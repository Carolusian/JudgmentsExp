The Defendant rented the rooftop of the Convention Plaza Apartment (âBuildingâ)in Wanchai for the purpose of shooting part of the film. The rooftop is a strictly restricted area to any visitors. There is no fenceand railing along the edge of the Building and there are a number of voids of different sizes on the rooftop: re the photos at pp.134to 135 and pp.194 to 199 of the bundle and the sketch plan at p.71 of the bundle [Exhibit P-1]. All the voids and the edge of theBuilding have curbs which are painted in bright yellow colour. At intervals, there are hazard notice painted in yellow on the ground.Some voids are big. Underneath some of these big voids, there are the rooftop gardens of the penthouse residents of the Building.Beneath those voids of smaller size, there are some concrete pipes and metal objects. Along the edge of the Building are the outerand inner metal rails which are about 16 inches from the ground of the rooftop and are 3 feet apart between these two rails. Thesemetal rails are installed for the use of window cleaner machines.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In the afternoon of 5 November 2003, the Plaintiff was asked to attend the scene to install a series of spotlights along a portionof the edge of the rooftop of the said Building. After obtaining confirmation from Wong Ching Ching, the Art Director of the film,the Plaintiff then instructed a Prop team to purchase the spotlights. It was the first time for the Plaintiff to visit the rooftopof the Building. The Plaintiff was the only representative of the Art Department and assumed a supervisory role. She had about 4to 5 persons under her supervision. At about 6:30 pm, after dinner, the Plaintiff supervised the setting up of 12 spotlights whichwere to be installed on the ground outside the outer metal rail. There are some 7 smaller voids located between the outer and innermetal rails. Whilst the Plaintiff was supervising the setting up of the spotlights, she stepped into one of the void openings, whichmeasures 1.5 meters x 1.2 meters in size, on the Southwest side of the Building. The Plaintiff fell 6 meters down from the top andlanded on top of the pergola of the penthouse garden of Unit 4608 on 46/F of the Building. The Plaintiff was unconscious and wasrushed to the hospital.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  At the time of the accident, the Plaintiff was in 8-week pregnancy and sustained injuries from the fall. She suffered fracture ofthe left mandible, facture of the left acetabulum and fractured dislocation of left wrist. The Plaintiff was hospitalized till 29November 2003 and had to receive therapeutic treatments. The Plaintiff was assessed to have suffered 2% of whole person impairmentfor the injury to her left hip and 1% of whole person impairment for the injury to her left wrist [pp.116 to 124 of the bundle].Fortunately the pregnancy of the Plaintiff was not affected adversely.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Plaintiff applied for leave to file the Amended Statement of Claim to cover the failureon the part of the Defendant to provide sufficient lighting. It was objected by Counsel of the Defendant as it was too late for themto prepare rebuttal evidence against the allegation. After taking instruction, Counsel for the Plaintiff decided to withdraw theapplication and rely on the original Statement of Claim. Counsel for the Defendant also asked for a joint site visit of the scenewhich was done in the afternoon of 26 April (Thursday).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Agreed Quantum</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Prior to the commencement of the proceedings, both parties agreed the quantum to be $530,000, inclusive of interest. A sum of $88,431.70had been given to the Plaintiff by the Defendant and the net sum outstanding is $441,568.30 if the issue of liability is found inthe Plaintiffâs favour.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The issues</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Plaintiffâs causes of action are:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Breach of employment contract; and/or</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Occupierâs liability; and/or</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Negligence</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Plaintiffâs case</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Plaintiff gave evidence in court. She adopted her witness statement dated 14 February 2007 [pp.51 to 60 of the bundle]. ThePlaintiff said that she started to do the art work in the film industry since 1999. In August 2003, the Plaintiff was asked by MadamWong Ching Ching to assist her in the art work for the production of a movie called âNew Police Storyâ. The Plaintiff was offereda monthly salary of HK$18,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiff started to work for the Defendant at the end of September 2003. She was required to sign a Contract in Chinese [pp.126130 of the bundle]. The contract bears the letterhead of Land Fortune Limited and it was described as âself-employee contractâ.The Plaintiff was engaged as an Assistant Art Director providing assistance to the Art Director of the Defendant. It was the understandingof the Plaintiff that some film production companies used this kind of self-employment contract to avoid paying the Mandatory ProvidentFund (âMPFâ) contribution. The job was expected to complete on or about 22 November 2003 and the Plaintiff was entitled to havea pro-rata payment of the monthly salary and $15 per hour for any overtime work. The Plaintiff was engaged on a full time basis andwas not allowed to work for other companies or engaged in other work during the contractual period. If the job could not be completedon 22 November 2003, the Plaintiff was required to continue to work for the Defendant. The Plaintiff was not required to provideher own tools and equipment for the purpose of the contracted job. The tools and equipment were provided by the Defendant. For anymaterials that were required for the art work, approval had to be sought from the Art Director and the expense would be reimbursed.The Plaintiff received instructions from the Art Director or other senior staff members of the Defendant as to the type of work tobe done and the place of work. The Plaintiff was not required to hire any workers as the workers would be provided by the Defendant.Her salary was fixed and could not earn profit or dividend. The Plaintiff was not required to bear any financial risk. Nor was sherequired to set up a company.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In this film project, there were 2 joint Art Directors (including Madam Wong), and under their supervision, there were 3 AssistantArt Directors, including the Plaintiff. They had different responsibilities in different parts of the Art works for the productionof the film. The Plaintiff was assigned mainly to do the setting-up job at the scene. From time to time during the contractual period,Madam Wong gave instructions to the Plaintiff as to how the shooting scene was to set up. The Plaintiff needed to seek Madam Wongâsapproval for those plans for the shooting scenes. Regular meetings were held with Madam Wong and other directors of different sectionsfor the film production. In the Art Section, there was a Prop Department which would assist the Plaintiff in setting up the sceneas planned. The staff of the Prop Department worked for the Defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 4 November 2003, the Plaintiff was asked by Madam Wong to go to the rooftop of the Building to supervise the Art work for filmshooting on the following day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Plaintiff went to the said rooftop at about 6:30 pm on 5 November 2003. She was told by the Photography Director to installa series of spotlights along a portion of the edge of the Building. She instructed the Prop team to buy the spotlights. At around7:00 pm, they started to set up the spotlights in accordance with the instructions of the Photography Director. It was getting dark.The Plaintiff needed to walk along the edge outside the gondola runway [see photos at p.134]. In court, the Plaintiff was asked andmade a red mark on the photo at p.134 which was exhibited as P-2. The Plaintiff was of the view that the two voids could have beencovered by wooden plank. There were no fencing, railing, barrier or safety net along the voids opening. Whilst the Plaintiff wassupervising the setting-up work, she stepped into one of the two smaller voids of about 1.5 meters x 1.2 meters. She landed on topof the pergola of the garden of a penthouse unit which was 6 meters down from the top of the void opening. She was unconscious andwas rushed to Ruttonjee and Tang Shiu Kin Hospital. Later she was transferred to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. She wasin 8-week pregnancy and was found to have multiple fractures. Several operations were performed. The Plaintiff was hospitalized fora total of 24 days and was discharged on 29 November 2003. On or about 29 March 2004, the Plaintiff received a total sum of $88,431.70from the Defendant, being her salary during the sick leave for the period from 6 November 2003 to 31 December 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Under cross-examination, the Plaintiff said that the fall from the void opening was an accident and she could not remember how ithappened. She lost memory about the process of her fall. She took a âmis-stepâ and fell down from the void opening. It was thefirst time the Plaintiff went to the rooftop of the Building. At the scene, the Photography Director asked her to set up 12 spotlights.The Plaintiff had to call Madam Wong to ascertain the position. Once the position was confirmed, the Plaintiff instructed the Propteam members to buy 12 spotlights. As it was time in November, the sky got dark quickly. The Plaintiff considered that it was notthe responsibility of the Prop team to take care of the safety issue, and safety measures, if any, should not be done on the spoton the day. She read the script of the film on the day before the shooting and hence knew in general terms the story of the film.The Plaintiff disagreed with Counsel for the Defendant that it was not possible to erect fence along the voids because it would hampershooting of the film. The Plaintiff mentioned that if the void openings were covered as depicted in the photo No.6 at p.197, it wouldnot affect the shooting. The Plaintiff was also of the view that if movable cones were to be set up, it could be done by âSet PAâand the Prop team was required to be involved.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Counsel for the Defendant asked for a site visit on the first day of the proceedings. Despite objection from Counsel for the Plaintiff,I have granted leave to have a site visit which was done in the afternoon of 26 April 2007 and it was in the process of the cross-examinationof the Plaintiff. Cross-examination of the Plaintiff resumed shortly after the site visit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Under cross-examination, the Plaintiff said that before the setting up of the spotlights, someone at the scene did remind thosepresent to âbe careful with yourself and be cautious that you may fallâ. The Plaintiff remembered that at that time, some peoplewere making use of the opportunity to take photos of the Victoria Harbour but the photo-taking activity was not work-related. RingoChan, Assistant Production Manager, did warn those crew members on the rooftop not to stand outside the rail when taking picturesof the harbour.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Plaintiff also showed 9 of her previous contracts which were labelled as working staff contract and/or employed staff contract.One of these contracts has a provision relating to the contribution to MPF.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Defenceâs case</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Defendant called 2 witnesses to testify: DW1 Tung Wun Sze Barbie (pp. 78 to 81 of the bundle) and DW2 Chan Chi Hin, Ringo (pp.62 to 77 of the bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  DW1 Tung worked as a film producer of the film and was responsible for managing the finances and logistics of making the film. ThePlaintiff was engaged as the Assistant Art Director pursuant to a written agreement with the Defendant dated 1 October 2003 (pp.83 to 87 of the bundle). It was said that the said agreement was a standard agreement commonly used by the film industry in HongKong. DW1 regarded the Plaintiff worked for the Defendant as an independent contractor with a salary of $18,000 per month. DW1 wasnot present when the accident occurred on the rooftop of the Building. Subsequent to the accident, she recommended the Defendantto continue paying salary to the Plaintiff and to shoulder the latterâs medical expenses. The Plaintiff was still considered aspart of the production team, even though she could not perform her duty after the accident. By a letter dated 25 March 2004 issuedby the Defendant (pp.89 and 90 of the bundle), a sum of $88,431.70 was given to the Plaintiff as a gesture of good will and was paidon a without prejudice basis. No admission of liability was made by the Defendant and, by the same token, the Plaintiff also acceptedthe said sum on a without prejudice basis. DW1 mentioned that in the film industry, the Production team was in charge of the overallsafety aspect. The Defendant did not ask for a substitute, even though the Plaintiff could not perform her duty after the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  DW2 was called. He adopted his witness statement and told the court that he worked for the Defendant as the Assistant ProductionManager in this film production. DW2 had not assessed the safety aspects of the rooftop of the Building before the film shooting.It was the responsibility of the Production Department of the Defendant to take care of the safety issues. DW2 said that at the timeof shooting, he did tell people on the rooftop not to go near the voids, but if they were required to work in that area then it waspermissible for them to go there. He knew that the Plaintiff was required to move around near the voids to perform her job. The areawas lit by the main lighting system which was not the responsibility of the Art Department. He considered that there was sufficientlighting at the time to enable people to avoid the voids. DW2 clarified what he had stated in para.8 of his statement (at p.64 ofthe bundle) when he said âafter the accident, I followed Cinnie [the Plaintiff] to the hospital. â¦ She said that she was puttingthe lights along the wall next to the voids when she accidentally stepped back into one of the voids.â DW2 said that the aboveconversation was made by the Plaintiff when the latter was discharged from the hospital, not when the latter was rushed to the hospital.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In the statement to the Labour Department dated 10 November 2003, DW2 confirmed that the Defendant did not make any safety or riskassessment of the rooftop before the shooting (p.67 of the bundle). Nor was there any warning notice posted up at the scene. Thevoids were not covered because the position of the camera might have to be changed from time to time (p.69 of the bundle). They didnot set up or impose any other safety measures to protect people working on the rooftop (p.70 of the bundle). He said that no oneon the day asked him to cover the voids or set up any fence along the edge of the Building. DW2 however was not responsible for thesafety of crew members on the spot. In his statement to the Labour Department, DW2 further stated that âthe film production company(Land Fortune) does not have a team which is particularly responsible for the safety matters of the staff working on the rooftop,it mainly relies on the staffâs own safety awareness.â: para.3 at p.66 of the bundle. He agreed, under cross-examination, thatfrom hindsight, had the voids in question been covered, the Plaintiff would not have fallen down from the void opening on that day.He agreed that in the course of setting up the spotlights, the voids could be covered by wooden planks. It would not require drillingof holes as a temporary measure to fix the planks.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Analysis</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>(I) Whether the Defendant is liable on the basis of a breach of employment contract</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Defendant denied that the Plaintiff was its employee at the material time. It relies on the written contract dated 1 November2003 signed by both parties (pp.126-130 of the bundle). It was labelled as âself-employee contractâ and the contract was forthe period between 1 October 2003 and 22 November 2003. The Plaintiff was required to work full time for the Defendant exclusively.The Defendant would assign works for her to do. The Plaintiff could not work for a third party, including charitable work, in whateverform and nature. It was specifically stated that the Plaintiff worked as a self-employed person providing services to the Defendant.The Plaintiff would not be regarded a partner or an agent for the Defendant nor were both parties in joint enterprise. The Plaintiffwas required to shoulder her own tax responsibility, labour insurance and MPF (clause 3 of the contract at p.127 of the bundle).A specified sum of $31,200 was mentioned. Upon expiry of the contractual period, if requested by the Defendant, the Plaintiff wouldbe required to continue working for the Defendant in this film production until it was completed, and the salary would then be calculatedon a pro rata basis. The Defendant could instruct the Plaintiff to work either in Hong Kong or overseas (clause 8 of the contractat p.128 of the bundle). If the Plaintiff was required to work overseas, the expenses would be borne by the Defendant (clause 9 ofthe contract).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It is well established that a contract, even though labelled as a self-employment contract, is not conclusive in determining thelegal relationship between the parties concerned.

The contract signed between the parties could not be taken as conclusive in determining the actuallegal relationship. The fact that the Plaintiff labelled herself as a self-employed person and had to bear the costs for insuranceand MPF could not exonerate the Defendantâs liability as the Plaintiffâs employer. I find that the actual relationship betweenthe Plaintiff and the Defendant was that of employer and employee and there existed a contract of service.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  As I accept that the Plaintiff was the employee of the Defendant at the material time, it follows that the Defendant owed the Plaintiffa personal and non-delegable duty to take reasonable care for the safety of the Plaintiff. As an employer, the Defendant was underobligations to its employees to provide for their safety. The employer may delegate the carrying out of such obligations, but itcannot delegate or avoid its own responsibility for their proper performance, and one of the obligations is to provide a safe systemof working.

The most that could be said about proper warning was when Ringo Chan said to those peoplewho were taking photos of the Victoria Harbour to be careful but that was unrelated to the shooting. The rooftop of the Buildingis a place of danger as there is no fence along the edge of the Building and, in this present case, there are a number of voids.One of the tasks of the Plaintiff was to supervise the setting-up of the spotlights and these crew members were required to set thespotlights along the metal rails as depicted in the sketch plan (Exhibit P-1).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It is my judgment that it should be the responsibility of the Defendant to install a proper safe system of working in the circumstances.Proper instructions should be given to those workers working on the rooftop when it was inherently dangerous to work there. It isalso reasonable, in my view, for the Defendant to cover the smaller voids with wooden planks or objects, or at least, part of thevoids, before making the shooting. Removable fences or plastic tapes could be installed or displayed so that it can be taken as awarning device to remind people of the hazard. I do not accept that these safety measures are not practical or costly as suggestedby Counsel for the Defendant. The Production Department of the Defendant which was responsible for the safety issue, could have madethe proposal and taken steps to install these safety measures or some of them when site visits for choosing shooting scenes weremade.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I find that when the system or mode of operation is highly dangerous, such as setting up spotlights on the rooftop along or nearthe edge of a tall building like the present case or shooting involving dangerous acts, the whole operation should require properorganization and supervision with a reasonable safe system. The higher the danger, the higher standard of organization and supervisionis expected.

It is not necessary, in order to discharge the burden of proof, thatthe defendant give evidence, because contributory negligence can be inferred from the evidence adduced on the claimantâs behalfor from the primary facts, as found by the court, on a balance of probabilities.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff, being an experienced Assistant Art Director, failed to take precautions to avoid goingnear to or falling from the void opening; that the Plaintiff failed to ensure that the spotlights were installed at a safe distancefrom the voids; and that the Plaintiff carried out her duties without taking reasonable care for her own safety while doing so (para.6of the Defence at p.33 to 34). It was argued that the Plaintiff should raise the safety issue with the Defendant or its agent andthere is a statutory duty on the Plaintiff to take care of herself under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3(3)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a>, knowing the existence of the voids on the rooftop.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  It is beyond dispute that the Plaintiff was instructed by the Defendant to go to the rooftop to work and the spotlights were installedas per instruction of the Photography Director or agents of the Defendant. The setting-up was to facilitate the shooting of certaindangerous acts done by the actors. It was accepted that the issue of safety was the responsibility of the Production team, and wasnot the responsibility of the Plaintiff. It was submitted by Counsel for the Defendant at her closing submission that there was noreason given by the Plaintiff as to her failure to inform other person to cover the two voids in question. It was submitted thatthe Plaintiff could have done so and could easily achieve that. I do not accept this kind of proposition. If such an argument canbe sustained, it should apply to the Production Department of the Defendant which has one of the important responsibilities of ensuringworking safety for its workers. The Defendant should be aware of the hazardous working environment when the rooftop of the Buildingwas chosen for shooting. The rooftop was chosen for particular purposes, inter alia, to have the Victoria Harbour as the backgroundof the shooting and certain dangerous act would be performed by the actors. The location per se for setting up the spotlights wasinherently dangerous. The Plaintiff had a âmis-stepâ, be it a step forward or backward, and that was an accident. There is noevidence to suggest that the Plaintiff, in the exercise of her calling, did not guard against special risks ordinarily incident toit. In fact, it would be inconceivable that the Plaintiff, being in 8-week pregnancy at that time, did not take extra precautionwhen working on the rooftop.

Nor were there specific oral warnings given to the workers. No attempts weremade by the Defendant to cover or fence off the voids in question. It is apparent that the Defendant took no elementary precautionswhen the shooting was made on the rooftop on that day.
