She filled out a printed Telegraphic Transfer ApplicationForm on BOC's standard form. On 7 July 2007 (Saturday), she learned that the Remittance had failed to reach the designated beneficiaryand account as stated in the Application Form. Chiu claims that as a result of the failure of the Remittance, her share trading accountmaintained with TD Ameritrade, Inc. ("TDA") in the United States was liquidated or closed out by reason of her failure to meet amargin call issued in respect of her account with TDA, and that she has sustained loss and damage as a result. These proceedingsare commenced by Chiu against BOC for recovery of the damages which Chiu said she sustained by reason of BOC 's breach of contract,and /or negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>   BOC denies that it is in breach of the terms of its contract with Chiu in relation to Chiu 's application for the Remittance tobe made. BOC accepts that it has a duty to take reasonable care and skill to effect the Remittance, but denies that the failure ofthe Remittance was due to any negligence on its part. BOC further denies that Chiu had sustained any loss or damage as a result ofany negligence or breach of contract on BOC 's part.</p>    <p class="heading">Issues</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The trial in July was for deciding the issue of BOC 's liability only. The issues on liability for determination at trial are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1) Was BOC in breach of the terms of its contract with Chiu in relation to the Remittance?</p>        <p class="quote">2) Did the Remittance fail as a result of any negligence on BOC 's part?</p>        <p class="quote">3) Was the failure of the Remittance caused or contributed to by Chiu 's negligence?</p>        <p class="quote">4) Did Chiu suffer any damage as a result of BOC's negligence, if any?</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Application for Remittance</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>   It is not in dispute that Chiu maintained a margin account with TDA for trading in securities. On Chiu 's evidence, she had beenbuying and selling US securities on her margin account with TDA since 2003 or 2005. Chiu holds an MBA degree from the CaliforniaState University, and had lived in the United States for some time. She also holds a degree in architecture from a University inChina. From her evidence, I am satisfied that Chiu has a good and sufficient understanding of English, having conducted her correspondenceand dealings with TDA in the English language. This Judgment is accordingly in English. If Chiu has any difficulty in understandingit, she can apply for the Judgment to be translated.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>   It is Chiu 's evidence that on 4 July 2007, she went to BOC to do a telegraphic transfer of US$25,000 from her account with BOCin Hong Kong, with the intention of transferring the said amount into her margin trading account number 870553955 maintained withTDA ("TDA Account"). On her own reckoning, she envisaged that the amount was required in order to keep up with the contractual maintenancerequirements for the TDA Account, as specified under the terms and conditions of Chiu 's agreement with TDA.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>   Chiu does not dispute that under the terms of the Client Agreement made between TDA and herself, which governs Chiu's trading onthe TDA Account, a 30% maintenance requirement is applicable for most stocks traded on the TDA Account. Under the terms of Chiu 'strading with TDA, the "equity" in Chiu's TDA Account is determined by the market value of her marginable stocks minus the amountlent to her by her brokerage firm for her margin trading. The equity is computed by adding the cash balance in the TDA Account tothe market value of her long security positions, and then subtracting the current market value of her short security positions andthe margin loan balance. Under Chiu 's Client Agreement with TDA, if the equity in Chiu's TDA Account falls below the maintenancemargin requirement, TDA is entitled to sell the securities or other assets in the TDA Account to cover the margin deficiency, andChiu may be responsible for any shortfall in the TDA Account after such a sale. Chiu does not dispute that TDA is entitled underthe Client Agreement to liquidate the securities and other assets in the TDA Account to meet a margin call without giving Chiu priornotice.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>   Under her dealings with TDA, when the market value of the margined securities plus any cash balance of Chiu 's account, less thedebit balance of her account, drops below TDA's specified maintenance requirements, a maintenance call will be made by TDA. If amargin call is issued by TDA, Chiu is required to bring her TDA Account to the required maintenance level by depositing cash or stock,closing long or short equity or option positions, or transferring funds or stock from another account.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>   Chiu does not dispute that on 4 July 2007, she had not yet received any margin call from TDA in relation to the TDA Account. Sheclaims that from her own trading, she was aware that an amount of US $25,000 was required in order to meet the maintenance requirementson her TDA Account, and due to the time difference between Hong Kong and USA, she normally would not wait for a margin call to beissued by TDA before making arrangements for transfer of the funds required to meet the maintenance requirements under her agreementwith TDA.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>   On 4 July 2007, Chiu obtained from BOC's counter its standard Telegraphic Transfer Application Form ("Application Form"). The ApplicationForm had more than 12 items and boxes for completion. 7 of such items were printed in red on the Application Form, with the remainderin green. At the top of the Application Form, a Note reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. Please complete in Block Letters and tick the applicable.</p>        <p class="quote">2. Fields printed in RED must be completed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>   Under the field or item "<i>Currency and Amount to be Remitted</i><i>å¯æ¬¾ä¹è²¨å¹£åéé¡</i>", which is printed in red, Chiu inserted: "USD 25,000". Under the field "<i>Name of Bene's Bank</i><i>ä»£æ¶éè¡åç¨±</i>" which is also in red, Chiu inserted: "First National Bank of Omaha". There is no dispute that references in the Application Formto "<i>Bene</i>" mean "beneficiary".</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>   Under the field "<i>Name of Bene</i><i>æ¶æ¬¾äººåç¨±</i>", which is in red, Chiu put her own name, "Cherry Chiu". Under the following item of "<i>A/C No. of Bene</i> <i>æ¶æ¬¾äººè³¬æ¶</i>", Chiu inserted : "870553955", which is the account number of the TDA Account.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>   There then appeared, in green, fields for insertion of the address and telephone number of the beneficiary, and a field entitled"<i>Message to Bene</i> <i>çµ¦æ¶æ¬¾äººéè¨</i>", which is also in green. These were left blank by Chiu.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>   The next fields, which all appear in red, were: first, one entitled "<i>Corr Bank Charges borne by</i> <i>ä»£çè¡è²»ç¨ç±</i> ", followed by boxes to be ticked, one indicating â<i>Bene</i><i>æ¶æ¬¾äººæ¿æ</i>â, and one indicating "<i>me/us</i><i>æ¬äººæå¾ç­æ¿æ</i>". This is for the customer to indicate whether the correspondent bank charges for the Remittance are to be paid by the beneficiary,or by the customer applying for the Remittance. Chiu ticked the box indicating "me/us".</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The second field, which appears in bold print and in red, is entitled "<i>Payment Method (Include amount remitted and incurred charges)</i> <i>ä»æ¬¾æ¹æ³ï¼åæ¬å¯æ¬¾æ¬éåè²»ç¨ï¼</i>", and is followed by boxes to be ticked, one indicating "<i>By debiting A/C No</i>.<i>_____ with _______</i><i>è«æ¼è³¬æ¶ï¼è³¬è</i> <i>ï¼æ£é¤</i>"; one indicating "<i>Your charges</i><i>è²´è¡è²»ç¨ : deduct from amount remitted</i><i>è«å¨å¯æ¬¾æ¬éå§æ£é¤</i>"; and one indicating "<i>debit from our A/C No</i>.______ <i>è«å¨æ¬äººæå¾ç­è³¬æ¶ä¸­æ£é¤</i>". Chiu ticked the box to indicate that the amount remitted and the charges incurred are to be debited to her specified account numberwith BOC.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>   A controversial green box with the word "<i>other</i><i>å¶ä»</i>" then appears for the client to tick, following the 3 boxes under the bold heading of "<i>Payment Method</i>". Against this box, Chiu inserted the following words:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Credit the Account of TD Ameritrade, Inc., Account# 16424641. Further Credit to My Account."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>   The dispute between the parties focuses on the meaning of these words under the "<i>other</i>" column, and whether BOC was in breach of contract or negligent in failing to give effect to these instructions from Chiu.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>   To put things into context, First National Bank of Omaha ("FNB"), which is the name inserted by Chiu as the âBeneficiary's Bankâin the Application Form, is the bank in the United States with which TDA maintained a bank account. TDA 's bank account with FNBis numbered 16424641, shown in the remarks made in the "other" column. Chiu accepts that she does not in fact have a direct bankaccount with FNB. Account No. 870553955, stated as the account number of the "Beneficiary" in the Application Form, is in fact Chiu'smargin trading account with TDA.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>   The following instructions were given by TDA on its webpage to TDA's clients with regard to wire transfers to be made by clientsto fund their accounts with TDA:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Wire transfers should be sent to TD Ameritrade as follows :</p>        <p class="quote">TD Ameritrade and former Ameritrade clients:</p>        <p class="quote">First National Bank of Omaha</p>        <p class="quote">1620 Dodge Street</p>        <p class="quote">Omaha, NE 68197</p>        <p class="quote">ABA # 104000016</p>        <p class="quote">Credit the account of TD Ameritrade, Inc.</p>        <p class="quote">1005 N.

Although Chiu had referred to âother instructionsâ given by TDA in relation to the manner ofsending funds to the TDA Account (i.e. apart from those contained on TDA 's webpage), I can safely infer that such instructions wouldnot differ from those contained on the webpage and those set out in TDA's standard margin call notification, such as the one sentby e-mail to Chiu on 5 July 2007.</p>    <p class="heading">Was BOC in breach of the terms of its contract with Chiu in relation to the Remittance?</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>   In summary, Chiu maintains that as the Remittance was intended to be transferred ultimately into her TDA Account, she was the "beneficiary"of the Remittance. Chiu therefore maintained that she had correctly named herself as the "beneficiary" in the Application Form. Thisis notwithstanding the fact that, as Chiu accepts, she does not have any direct bank account with FNB which is named as the beneficiary'sbank in the Application Form, and that the account number of the stated beneficiary was given as Chiu 's TDA Account, and not anybank account number of FNB.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>   Clearly, the word "beneficiary" must be read in its proper context. Like "recipient", the party it refers to can be different,depending on which transaction one refers to. In the context of Chiu's dealings on the TDA Account, the Remittance was intended tobe transferred into Chiu's account, with Chiu as the beneficiary. However, in the context of the telegraphic transfer effected throughthe services of BOC, the Remittance was stated by Chiu in the Application Form and intended by her to be directed into an accountat FNB. TDA had so instructed its clients like Chiu to send the necessary transfer of funds required for their trading accounts toFNB. TDA's instructions, such as those contained on its webpage and in its standard margin call notification, are that funds areto be sent to FNB, <i>to be credited to TDA</i> account number 16424641. The party to be credited with the funds is clearly the beneficiary of the transfer.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>   Having expressly stated FNB as the name of the "beneficiary's bank" in the Application Form, Chiu must be consistent in the termshe has chosen and cannot, in the same Application Form, allege that someone else is or intended to be the "beneficiary".</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>   Chiu 's own designation of "Cherry Chiu", i.e. herself, as the "beneficiary" under the field "Name of Beneficiary", and her designationof her own account number with TDA in the field "A/C No. of Beneficiary", are clearly wrong and inconsistent with her own, earlierdesignation of FNB as the "Beneficiary's Bank" in the first field. In short, the person stated as the Beneficiary in the ApplicationForm completed by Chiu does not have an account with the bank stated to be the Beneficiary's Bank, and to which the telegraphic transferis directed to be made. By her own default, Chiu had given wrong instructions with regard to the Remittance.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>   If, as Chiu maintained, she was the beneficiary of the Remittance because the sum of US $25,000 was intended to be transferredinto her account number 870553955 with TDA, then she should have inserted TDA as the beneficiary's bank. Chiu's evidence is thatshe did not do this, because TDA is not a bank. On such footing, with FNB being named as the beneficiary's bank, the "beneficiary"must necessarily be the recipient in the transaction or relationship involving FNB, namely, TDA which maintains a bank account withFNB, and not Chiu.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>   BOC would have no means of knowing, on the face of the particulars and instructions given by Chiu on the Application Form, thatthe beneficiary named in the Application Form does not in fact have an account with the bank named as the beneficiary's bank. Onthe face of the Application Form, Chiu's application to BOC, and her instructions to BOC, are to make a Remittance of US $25,000to a named bank, FNB, for a named beneficiary, Chiu, at a named account number (870553955). On the facts and evidence, that was preciselywhat BOC did. The Remittance failed only because there was no bank account number 870553955 at FNB in the name of Chiu.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>   Having effected the Remittance in accordance with Chiu's express instructions, I fail to see how BOC can be said to be in breachof the contract made between Chiu and BOC in respect of the Remittance.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>   Chiu argues that BOC should have given effect to the instructions she set out under the field "<i>other</i>". In answer to this, BOC claims that all the information required to effect the Remittance in accordance with the contract made betweenChiu and BOC can be found in the main parts of the Application Form, in particular those fields printed in red, and that it was notnecessary for BOC to refer to the obsoleteï¼"é¡å¤"ï¼information contained in the "other" field. According to the evidence ofMiss Tam and Mr. Man who gave evidence on behalf of BOC, the particulars given in the "other" field only relate to the method ofpayment of the charges for the Remittance. By practice, BOC does not refer to the "other" column for purposes of putting the telegraphictransfer into effect. On BOC's case, Chiu had already ticked the boxes to indicate that the charges for the Remittance are to bedebited from Chiu 's account number 01292392022747 with BOC.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>   As set out in paragraph 27 above, I accept that on a proper construction of the Application Form, the contract between BOC andChiu in respect of the Remittance is for BOC to make a telegraphic transfer of US $25,000 to FNB for Chiu at account number 870553955.Counsel for BOC points out that the words in the "other" field are totally inconsistent with, and destroy the effect of the instructionscontained in the earlier parts of the Application Form relating to the name of the beneficiary, the name of the beneficiary's bankand the account number of the stated beneficiary. Consequently, Counsel argues that those particulars in the "other" field shouldbe rejected as repugnant to the instructions given in the main parts of the Application Form which prevail, and that they do notform a term of the contract between BOC and Chiu for the Remittance (<i>The Interpretation of Contracts, Sir Jim Lewison,</i> (2007 ed.) paras. 9.08 and 9.09). I accept these submissions.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>   BOC relies on the terms and conditions set out on the reverse of the Application Form, which form part of the contract betweenChiu and BOC for the Remittance. BOC further relies on the terms and conditions in the Conditions for Services and the General Informationfor Retail Banking Services, which Chiu had agreed to be bound by when she opened her bank account with BOC. Of these provisions,clause 1.8 of Part 1 of the Conditions for Services provides that Chiu should ensure that her instructions to the bank are completeand correct, and that if an instruction cannot be carried out, Chiu will still be responsible for the charges and reasonable expensesthat may be incurred. Clause 1.10 of Part 1 of the Conditions for Services also provides that if Chiu 's instruction cannot be executedin whole or part, BOC is not required to notify Chiu immediately.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>   In my Judgment, the Remittance failed as a result of the incorrect information given by Chiu in the Application Form, and thereis no basis to find that BOC is in breach of any express term of the contract.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>   There is an implied term of the contract between a bank and its customer that the bank will observe reasonable skill and care inand about executing the customer's orders (see <i>Barclays Bank plc v. Quincecare Ltd. and another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%204%20All%20ER%20363" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 4 All ER 363).</a> Such an implied term is not pleaded in the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, although Chiu has pleaded that BOC was negligent, and BOChas throughout defended negligence as a cause of action. On the facts of this case, nothing on liability turns on the question whetherthe case is approached as one in contract, or in tort, and I will deal with BOC's negligence generally under the next issue.</p>    <p class="heading">Did the Remittance fail as a result of any negligence on BOC 's part?</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>   I am satisfied that BOC does not owe any general duty of care to explain the Application Form to Chiu, nor to instruct her generallyon the correct way to complete the Application Form. An analogy can be drawn from the decision in <i>Fred Lee v. Lam Kwok Keung</i> HCB 22795/2002 12 October 2007, unreported, at paras.31 &amp; 46.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>   Nevertheless, when a bank acts as agent for its customer, it owes to its customer the duty of care of an ordinary prudent bank(para.8-89, <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence</i>; <i>Barclays Bank plc v. Quincecare Ltd</i>, <i>supra,</i> at pages 375-376). When BOC acted on Chiu 's order to transfer money from her account to FNB, BOC was acting as Chiu 's agent. Asagent, BOC owes fiduciary duties to Chiu, and as an agent for reward, BOC is also bound to exercise reasonable care and skill incarrying out the instructions of its principal. Whether a bank, as agent in such circumstances, has taken reasonable care dependson the facts of the case, which facts obviously include the characteristics of the customer, the amount involved, the need for aprompt transfer, the presence of any unusual features, and the scope and means available for making reasonable inquiries.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>   I accept on the evidence that Chiu had not informed Miss Tam or anyone of BOC at the material time on 4 July 2007 that the Remittancewas required for the purpose of putting the TDA Account in funds to meet margin maintenance requirements, or to avoid or meet a margincall. It is unlikely that Chiu would have so informed Miss Tam. Chiu claims that she had informed Miss Tam that the funds were requiredin a hurry. Whether I accept Chiu 's evidence in this regard is, in my Judgment, immaterial as it cannot be disputed that BOC canreasonably foresee that if the Remittance fails, Chiu would suffer some damage as a result of the funds not reaching her designatedaccount for whatever reason.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>   It is not disputed that no one on BOC's part had either dealt with the information which Chiu had inserted in the "other" field,or ever questioned Chiu in relation to such information.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>   BOC's evidence is that, as a matter of practice and in accordance with BOC's internal training and instructions, the "other" fielddeals only with the customer's method of payment of the charges for the telegraphic transfer. Hence, BOC's staff responsible foreffecting the telegraphic transfer itself would not need to deal with the information under this field.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>   The evidence of Miss Tam, the employee at the counter who dealt with Chiu, is that to process the Remittance, she would input intothe computer (for further action by staff in the remittance department) the information given by the customer in the necessary fieldsprinted in red in the Application Form. She explained that the other information and particulars are only "additional é¡å¤ ", whichshe would ignore as they were not necessary for her work. She therefore did not notice the information set out in the "other" fieldof the Application Form completed by Chiu, as she could obtain and had obtained all the information which she required from the restof the Application Form.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>   Miss Tam 's evidence, that she only required information in the red fields and would only process such information set out in thered fields, cannot be entirely correct. The account number of the beneficiary must obviously be part of the necessary informationto be processed and dealt with, and this is set out in a green field in the Application Form.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>   Further, it is not entirely clear from the face of the Application Form that the "other" box and field relate only to "PaymentMethod". It can reasonably be understood by a reasonable customer to refer to any general or other information to be inserted bythe customer relating to the Remittance. BOC's evidence is that if the customer wished to include any general information or messagewith the Remittance, then such information should be inserted in the field marked "<i>Message to Bene</i>" (which is printed in green).</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>   Importantly, despite BOC maintaining that the "other" field only relates to the customer's method of payment of the bank charges,the information inserted by Chiu under this field is clearly <i>not</i> related to the method of payment. It reads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<i>Credit</i> the Account of TD Ameritrade, Inc., Account #16424641, Further Credit to My Account." (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>   The information inserted by Chiu therefore relates to an account being <i>credited</i>, instead of an account being <i>debited</i> with the remittance charges. Miss Tam, or her superior checking Miss Tam 's work on the day, should have been put on inquiry by virtueof the contradictory instructions contained in the 3 boxes under "<i>Payment Method</i>". A reasonable, prudent banker would have clarified with Chiu what she meant by the instructions in the "<i>other</i>" field: whether they actually relate to payment of the bank charges, whether they should be inserted in the Application Form underthe field entitled "<i>Message to Bene</i>", whether they should replace the instructions in the fields entitled "<i>Name of Bene</i>" and "<i>A/C No. of Bene</i>", or whether they should be deleted altogether as being irrelevant to the Remittance. No one of BOC made any attempt to do this.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>   In my Judgment, it is insufficient for BOC to say that Chiu had supplied all the necessary information which BOC required, underthe fields printed in red or otherwise, to effect the telegraphic transfer, and that the information contained in the "other" fieldis superfluous, or unnecessary, or irrelevant. The information was there, on its face inconsistent with the rest of the informationcontained in the Application Form, and without making inquiries with Chiu as to the precise meaning of the words she had inserted,a reasonable and prudent banker would not be able to conclude that the information was either superfluous, or irrelevant to the Remittance.I accept that BOC does not have the general duty to instruct its customers on how to complete the Application Form. However, havingbeen given unclear information, and having been alerted to the existence of contradictory and possibly incorrect information, BOCcame under a duty to make inquiries and to seek clarification from Chiu.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>   Importantly, it would have been easy for Miss Tam to ascertain from Chiu at the counter the meaning of the words in the "other"field, and to clarify what Chiu's intentions are in relation to the instructions contained in the "other" field. It is not a caseof a bank being presented with documents under a documentary credit, and having to reconcile the documents with the written instructionscontained in the letter of credit, or any unclear information contained therein, without the immediate assistance of the bank customer(thus distinguishing the facts of <i>Midland Bank Ltd. v. Seymour</i> [1955] 2 Lloydâs Rep. 147 cited by Counsel for BOC).</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>   The reply BOC received from New York on 6 July 2007, in response to BOC's telegraphic transfer made on 4 July 2007, was to thefollowing effect :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Unable to apply with info given, invalid FNBO account. Possible FFC account or correspondent account."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>   BOC explained that the reference to "possible FFC account" means "possible for further credit" account.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>   The reply BOC received from New York suggests by itself that a reasonable, prudent banker would have realized that the Remittancemight have been for an account which may be further credited by FNB with the Remittance. If BOC had made a similar inquiry with Chiuat the counter on 4 July 2007, the Application Form might have been corrected with the inclusion of the information set out in the"other" field in another, appropriate field (be it under â<i>Message to Bene</i>â, or elsewhere), to enable the Remittance to successfully reach or be credited to TDA's account with FNB.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>   I find therefore that BOC had fallen short of the standard of a reasonable prudent bank in relation to its handling of Chiu's Remittance.</p>    <p>Was the failure of the Remittance caused or contributed to by Chiu 's negligence?</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>   In my Judgment, the failure of the Remittance was substantially and materially caused by Chiu 's own error in naming herself asthe beneficiary of the Remittance, when she had designated FNB as the beneficiary's bank to which the Remittance was to be made.She had no bank account with FNB, and the account number 870553955 was not an account maintained with the stated bank to which theRemittance was to be made. That was the primary reason for the failure of the Remittance.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>   BOC 's failure to detect the inconsistencies in the instructions contained in the Application Form and to raise queries with Chiucontributed to the failure of the Remittance.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>   In all the circumstances, I consider that the apportionment of liability between Chiu and BOC in respect of the failure of theRemittance should be 70% and 30% respectively.</p>    <p class="heading">Did Chiu suffer any damage as a result of BOC's negligence, if any?</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>   It is Chiu 's case that because of the failure of the Remittance, the equity in her TDA Account dropped below the maintenance requirementspecified by TDA, such that her account was forcibly liquidated by TDA on 5 July 2007, at 15:46 US time, which is equivalent to 6July 2007 04:46 HK time. She claims that she sustained losses of US $26,129.54 on this closing out alone.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>   BOC claims that Chiu had never made known to BOC the fact that the Remittance was to avoid a margin call in respect of her marginshare dealings on the TDA Account.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>   The real issue is whether Chiu 's losses on the TDA Account, allegedly sustained as a result of the enforced liquidation of theTDA Account, are too remote to be recoverable as a result of BOC's negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>   For the purpose of showing that Chiu does not have a cause of action in negligence against BOC, Counsel for BOC argued that Chiuhad been trading on margin in relation to her short selling of the AAPL shares which were liquidated on 5 July 2007 (US time). BOCâsexpert, Mr. Wong, argues that Chiu did not sustain any damage as a result of the closing out of her short position on AAPL on 5 July2007, as her equity in the TDA Account remained the same before and after the liquidation. Mr. Wong 's evidence is that the equity(calculated in the manner summarised in paragraph 6 above) is the portion that truly reflects Chiu 's ownership and beneficial interestin the TDA Account.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>   Further, it is argued that since February 2007, Chiu had been making a loss in her investment represented by her short positionon the AAPL shares, such that her loss and damage was not caused by the failure of the Remittance, but by her own investment decisions.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>   However, Mr. Wong accepts that as a result of the forced liquidation which took place on 5 July 2007, the hitherto unrealized investmentloss on Chiu's account was converted into realized loss. On Chiu's case, she had lost the opportunity of recovering her hithertounrealized investment loss, or even of making a profit.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>   I accept that as a result of the failure of the Remittance on 4 July 2007, Chiu had sustained some damage over and above the transfercharges which BOC claims were waived and settled by virtue of the Oral Agreement pleaded in paragraphs 4A and 4B of the Re-re-re-AmendedDefence.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>   The true extent of the damage actually sustained by Chiu as a result of BOC's negligence and which is reasonably foreseeable, andnot too remote, to be recoverable will have to be separately assessed. Whether the reasonable damages include those allegedly sufferedby Chiu as a result of her sale of the 30,000 IPIN shares and purchase of 2,000 IGLD shares should be determined at the assessmentstage.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>   I find that BOC is 30% liable in negligence in respect of the failure of the Remittance which is the subject matter of these proceedings,and further make an order for Chiu's damages to be assessed.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>   I will further make an order nisi that 30% of the costs of the trial on liability will have to be borne by BOC, to be taxed ifnot agreed. Unless an application is made to vary this order nisi, the order shall become absolute 14 days after this judgment ishanded down.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Mimmie Chan)<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>The Plaintiff in person</p>        <p>Mr. Manuel Chong, instructed by Messrs.
