It also had nearby premises at 29 Praya Road where there was a pier and office. The deceaseddrowned when he tried to recover a gas cylinder which had fallen into the sea off the pier in about four metres of water.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="32"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p3" name="p3">3.</a> There is little dispute about the salient facts. The pier was used by customers of the company among others. It charged when boatswere moored there. The deceased was unskilled. His <brs_term brs_term_id="89" brs_term_type="9">duties</brs_term> were cleaning hulls and painting. He assisted Mr Chan, a director of the company, his employer who was apparently a qualified diver.The deceased did not do any underwater work but he would go into the water when required to assist.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="33"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> A witness, Wong Yan, was a skilled welder employed by the company. The accident happened on 3 January 1995. The deceased's workinghours were 8 am to 5 pm. In the afternoon of that day, he was working in the cabin of a yacht. He usually took his tea break from3 to 3.15 pm with the welder, Mr Wong. The yacht in which he was working was under maintenance at 45 Praya Road. Mr Wong was alsoat the yacht. He took his tea break as usual on that day but not with the deceased. When Mr Wong returned to work at the yacht atabout 3.30 pm, the deceased was not there but he came a few minutes later and asked Wong to get a rope to help him to retrieve thegas cylinder which had fallen into the sea off the pier at 29 Praya Road.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="34"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> It seems that the gas cylinder had been hired by Mr Yeung for work in a fishing boat which at one time had been moored at the company'spier. He had put the cylinder on the pier on 31 December. The company was closed for the next two days and Mr Yeung was going topick up the cylinder sometime after the holidays. He had no idea, when asked later, when it had fallen into the sea.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="35"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a> Upon the deceased's request, Wong went to him to the pier with the rope. The deceased took one end and Wong held the other. The deceaseddived in. He surfaced after a minute or so but then dived under again. He never re-surfaced. He had drowned. Before drowning howeverhe had succeeded in attaching the rope to the cylinder. The actual details are not very clear but the cylinder was lying somewherenear the pier from which it had fallen in about 4 meters of the water.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="36"><p class="heading">At trial</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="37"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p7" name="p7">7.</a> Mr Ho, a causal worker who had worked at the company in the 1980s, gave evidence. Also Mr Wong, the welder and Madam Sin, a co-directorof Mr Chan whom I have mentioned. She apparently had a part in running the business. Mr Chan did not give evidence as he was in MainlandChina at the time. Not surprisingly Mr Ho's evidence did not prove to be helpful to the judge. She did not rely upon any of it, describingit as speculative.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="38"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a> Mr Wong said that the deceased's duties did not require him to dive and indeed he had been told not to dive. There was other evidence,however, that part of the deceased's duties as a general worker was to recover tools and equipment which fell into relatively shallowwater. There was a suggestion that meant anything up to ten feet.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="39"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a> Mr Wong, being a skilled worker, was senior to the deceased. He said he helped the deceased and went along with the deceased's suggestionholding the rope without giving him any instructions not to do that which he was doing because the deceased had worked for 20 yearsfor the company whereas he only worked for six. He admitted that he could tell the deceased what to do.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="40"><p class="heading">The judge's decision</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="41"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a> The judge accepted that Mr Chan had told the deceased not to dive into the water but did not accept the reason given by Wong as towhy he had helped the deceased by holding one end of the rope in the enterprise of lifting the cylinder from the sea.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="42"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p11" name="p11">11.</a> The judge's <brs_term brs_term_id="17" brs_term_type="9">finding</brs_term> is clearly set out:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="43"><p class="quote">&quot;The Deceased was employed as an unskilled maintenance worker by the Respondent which is a company that repaired and maintainedboats. The Deceased's responsibility was to help clean the bottom of boats, clean the hull of the boat and help paint the boat. TheDeceased was told not to dive into the water by his employer Mr. Chan. The Deceased had been seen by Madam Sin to work in the watertogether with her husband Mr. Chan but his head was above the water. Mr. Chan was a skin diver and did all the work that entaileddiving.</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="44"><p class="quote">The accident occurred whilst the Deceased dived into the sea at the pier outside No. 29 Praya Road to retrieve an air cylinder whichhad dropped into the sea.

TheRespondent charged boats that moored there at a sum of between $200 to $300 per day. The Deceased returned from his tea break atsometime past 3:30 p.m. on the date of the accident. In the morning he had helped to paint a boat at No. 45 Praya Road. Upon returningto No. 45 Praya Road, he told Mr. Wong he would go to No. 29 Praya Road and dive into the sea to retrieve the air cylinder whichhad dropped into the sea. Neither Mr. Wong, nor any of the Deceased's employers asked him to do so. The Deceased did so of his owninitiative. He asked Mr. Wong to assist him. Mr. Wong did so by holding the rope. The Deceased drowned whilst doing so.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="45"><p>She then made her decision:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="46"><p class="quote">&quot;Having considered the above, I regrettably am not able to find that what the Deceased did <brs_term brs_term_expression="discont" brs_term_id="0" brs_term_type="3">arose out of </brs_term>and in the course of his <brs_term brs_term_expression="discont" brs_term_id="0" brs_term_type="3">work</brs_term> nor can I find that what he did was <brs_term brs_term_id="1" brs_term_type="2">reasonably incidental to</brs_term> his work.

The judge considered the provisionand a passage in <strong>R v Industrial Injuries Commissioner Ex Carte Richardson</strong> [1958]1 WLR at 851 to which her attention had been invited by counsel. The effect was simply this. If there is evidence to the contraryin relation to the presumption, then the applicant has to simply prove the point in the ordinary way. As Devlin J (as he then was)said the word &quot;evidence&quot; meant &quot;was there evidence fit to be <brs_term brs_term_id="5" brs_term_type="4">left to the jury</brs_term>&quot;.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="56"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p15" name="p15">15.</a> Applying that test, the judge decided that it was necessary for the applicant to prove the case in the ordinary way and the presumptiondid not apply.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="57"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> In due course I will examine some of the <brs_term brs_term_id="24" brs_term_type="9">findings</brs_term> of the judge on the <brs_term brs_term_id="54" brs_term_type="9">primary facts</brs_term>. It is clear to me that the presumption did not apply in this case. There was evidence for the judge's consideration. The only question,therefore, was had the applicant proved that this accident not only arose in the course of the deceased's employment but also outof that employment?</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="58"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p17" name="p17">17.</a> When considering that question, the judge recognised that it was not necessary for the applicant to prove that the accident arosedirectly out of the employment. As many of the cases under the old Workmen's Compensation Acts in England demonstrate, all that isnecessary is to show that the workman was doing something which was an incident of his employment or was incidental to it. The judgerightly cited a passage in <strong>Charles R. Davidson and Co v M'Robb or Officer</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1918%5d%20AC%20304" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1918] AC 304</a> which reads:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="59"><p class="quote">&quot; 'In the course of the employment' does not mean during the <brs_term brs_term_id="6" brs_term_type="3">currency of the engagement</brs_term>, but means in the course of the work which the workman is employed to do and what is incident to it; . . .&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="60"><p>The judge cited the above and other cases which demonstrate the same principle. Finally. she cited <strong>Reg v Insurance Come, Ex p. Michael (C.A.)</strong> [1977]1 WLR 109 where Lord Roskill said at p. 118:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="61"><p class="quote">&quot;If the injury is not suffered in the actual course of the work which the employee is engaged to do, it must have at least beensuffered by reason of some event incidental to that work.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="62"><p>That was the correct test which the judge sought to apply.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="63"><p class="heading">The appellant's case</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="64"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p18" name="p18">18.</a> The appellant <brs_term brs_term_id="59" brs_term_type="9">submits</brs_term> that the judge was wrong in her conclusion, which she inferred from the salient facts. Mr Wong, for the appellant, points out thatthe deceased was employed in general work. It was clear on the evidence that, although he was <brs_term brs_term_id="57" brs_term_type="9">instructed</brs_term> not to dive, part of his work was to recover tools and equipment which fell into water provided that it was not more than 10 feetdeep. He, therefore, <brs_term brs_term_id="60" brs_term_type="9">submits</brs_term> that the deceased was employed to do the general kind of work which was involved in recovering the cylinder from the seabed. Althoughhe concedes that the deceased was not <brs_term brs_term_id="58" brs_term_type="9">instructed</brs_term> to recover the cylinder, he <brs_term brs_term_id="61" brs_term_type="9">submits</brs_term> that the recovery of the cylinder from the seabed was at the very least incidental to his employment. He points out that the cylinderwas left on the employer's property. It does not matter whether it actually belonged to his employer or whether it had been lefton his employer's property. Either way, the employer was responsible for it. He <brs_term brs_term_id="62" brs_term_type="9">submits</brs_term> that Mr Yeung left the cylinder on the pier and the employer was therefore a <brs_term brs_term_id="7" brs_term_type="2">gratuitous bailee</brs_term>. Of course the deceased would not be aware of that. But he might well have been aware that the employer would be answerable for theequipment. He is likely to have thought that it was in his employer's interest to recover that property from the sea.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="65"><p class="heading">The respondent's case</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="66"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p19" name="p19">19.</a> The respondent, both at trial and on appeal through its counsel, Mr Sham, <brs_term brs_term_id="65" brs_term_type="9">submits</brs_term> that the evidence does not come near showing that this accident arose out of the deceased's employment. He points out that No. 29Praya Road was not a place where the deceased usually worked. He usually worked nearby at No. 45 where the maintenance was done.So far as the pier was concerned, normally there were no tools on the pier and no work was being carried out on that day. The evidencewas that he was not working at the pier on that day. He had not been <brs_term brs_term_id="63" brs_term_type="9">instructed</brs_term> to go to the pier and he had never been <brs_term brs_term_id="64" brs_term_type="9">instructed</brs_term> to recover the cylinder.

One is <strong>R v Industrial Injuries Commissioner, Ex Carte Amalgamated Engineering Union</strong> [1966]1 All ER 97. The facts are not helpful but Lord Denning <brs_term brs_term_id="96" brs_term_type="9">MR</brs_term> gave some examples which are useful. At p. 103D he said:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="71"><p class="quote">&quot;What is the position when a man overstays his tea-break or his meal-break? I do not think that the mere fact of overstayinghis time takes him out of the course of his employment: certainly not when it is done without thinking. Even if it is done negligentlyor disobediently, it does not automatically take him outside the course of his employment. It is only taken out of the course ofhis employment when the circumstances show that he is doing something of a kind different from anything he was employed to do.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="72"><p>Mr Sham points out Lord Denning gave some further illustrations. First, where a man goes from one end of a factory to the other tocompare notes on football pools, he is not acting in the course of his employment. Secondly, if a guard of a train takes it on himselfto drive the train and is injured whilst driving he is outside the course of his employment. Thirdly, if a man is employed to hookgoods on to a crane and instead took it on himself to drive a forklift truck, he is outside the course of his employment. But, ofcourse, even those cases are dependent upon the whole of the circumstances.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="73"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> But here, as Mr Wong has pointed out, there are wider considerations because of the circumstances and the property which concernedin this case. Mr Wong <brs_term brs_term_id="97" brs_term_type="9">submits</brs_term> that an employee who seeks to protect or preserve the employer's property, if it is at risk, may have implied authority of the employerto do things which normally would be outside the scope of his usual work. He cites in support the case of <strong>Poland v John Parr and Sons</strong> [1927]1 KB 237. He relies upon the headnote which reads:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="74"><p class="quote">&quot;A servant has implied authority to make reasonable efforts to protect and preserve his master's property in cases of emergencyendangering it. For acts done by the servant within the scope of that authority, the master is responsible. The servant's acts mayexceed the authority. Whether they do or not is a question of degree.</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="75"><p class="quote">A carter in the employment of the defendants on his way home in the middle of the day was following close behind a waggon laden withsugar in bags and being driven by one of his employers. He saw a boy walking beside the waggon with his hand upon one the bags. <brs_term brs_term_expression="discont" brs_term_id="11" brs_term_type="4">Honestly</brs_term> and reasonably <brs_term brs_term_expression="discont" brs_term_id="11" brs_term_type="4">thinking</brs_term> that the boy was stealing sugar from the bag, he gave him a blow with his hand on the back of the neck. The boy fell and the wheelof the waggon injured his foot:</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="76"><p class="quote"><em>Held</em>, that in the circumstances the carter had implied authority to make reasonable efforts to protect and preserve the defendant's property,that the violence exerted was not so excessive as to take his act outside the scope of the authority, and the defendants were liable.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="77"><p>Of course, the principles concerning <brs_term brs_term_id="73" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> for the acts of the servant do have a bearing on the scope of employment. Scrutton LJ at p. 243 said:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="78"><p class="quote">&quot;In cases of emergency any servant is bound to take reasonable steps to protect his employer's property. In <em>Rees v Thomas</em> [1985]1 QB 742 A.L. Smith LJ said: 'The deceased was acting in the interest of his master in an emergency which suddenly arose, andin which any one would, I should think, have tried to do the same thing. I think, therefore, that the accident arose out of his employment.'The Lord Justice lays stress upon the act being done 'in the interest of his mater.' That shows that an act is not placed beyondthe scope of the servant's duty by the mere fact that it is not one of the class of acts which he is specially employed to do orthat the time is not an hour at which he is ordinarily at work.... In the present case the man Hall, a carter in the employment ofthe respondents, saw his employer's waggon, with regard to which he had no special duty at the time, apparently being robbed by boys.He honestly and reasonably believed that his employer's property was being stolen. He took action either to prevent the theft ora repetition of it. Maybe his action was mistaken and maybe the force he used WAS excessive; he might have pushed the boy insteadof striving him. But that was merely acting in excess of what was necessary in doing an act which he was authorized to do. The excesswas not sufficient to take the act out of the class of authorized acts. and therefore the learned judge was wrong and the appealmust be allowed&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="79"><p>Atkin LJ (as he then was) gave a <brs_term brs_term_id="74" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> supporting the proposition.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="80"><p class="heading">Conclusion</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="81"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p24" name="p24">24.</a> In this case the fact that the property, the cylinder, was on the employer's premises and was known by the deceased to have falleninto the sea and therefore was at risk is a significant matter. It seems to me that it signifies nothing if he thought that the propertybelonged to someone else. The employer was in due course going to be answerable to Mr Yeung, a customer who would have paid for theuse of the jetty. The employer may well have been answerable to him. The above principle was, therefore, relevant to this appeal.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="82"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p25" name="p25">25.</a> This <brs_term brs_term_id="93" brs_term_type="9">approach</brs_term>, it seems to me, is also supported by the Ordinance itself.

Moreover, there was no evidencewhether ownership of the cylinder was known to the deceased, and it would seem to be quite immaterial, as it later transpired, thatthe cylinder was not the property of his company. This, the judge also seemed to have overlooked. These are the salient facts onwhich the judge made her erroneous <brs_term brs_term_id="79" brs_term_type="9">findings</brs_term> adverse to the appellant. The features of this case before the judge are now before us, and there would seem to be no obstacle tothis court's attempted re-visit of the situation on the same but largely undisputed material.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="90"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p29" name="p29">29.</a> A worker, just coming back from tea-break, taking a colleague to a place where his employer operated, with very little said betweenthem but tacit understanding, for the purpose of retrieving a cylinder - on these telling <brs_term brs_term_id="80" brs_term_type="9">primary facts</brs_term> given in the <brs_term brs_term_id="81" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> of my Lord, Mortimer V.P., the only realistic probability is that the deceased was seeking to serve his master within the scope ofhis employment. The predominantly logical conclusion from the scanty evidence is, clearly, that in attempting to retrieve the cylinderafter tea-break the deceased's action was taken in or incidental to his employment.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="91"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p30" name="p30">30.</a> I agree that the appeal should be allowed.

I have no doubt that it does. As to the instruction not to dive which emerge as the major factor against that view, it simply convertedthe deceased's action to recover equipment which was part of his <brs_term brs_term_id="94" brs_term_type="9">duties</brs_term> on the evidence and in the judge's <brs_term brs_term_id="84" brs_term_type="9">finding</brs_term>, from an authorised to an unauthorised way of performing that duty. Moreover, all employees are deemed to have a discretion to actfor the protection of their employer's property, see Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 17th Edn paragraph 531 and <strong>Poland v John Parr &amp; Sons</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1927%5d%201%20KB%20236" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1927] 1 KB 236.</a> That principle, it seems to me, must apply equally to the protection of property for which the employee thinks his employer is responsiblewhich seems to me on the facts found by the judge to be the position here. That would bring the deceased's action in diving to recoverthe cylinder and the resulting accident within the scope and course of his employment. If that were not so, then it could not beother than incidental to his <brs_term brs_term_id="83" brs_term_type="9">contract of service</brs_term>. It remains to say that if that action of the deceased was in the course of his employment and <brs_term brs_term_id="13" brs_term_type="2">contract of service</brs_term>, then upon the particular facts here, the accident must have <brs_term brs_term_id="12" brs_term_type="3">arisen out of the employment</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="96"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p33" name="p33">33.</a> The appeal is accordingly allowed, and the matter <brs_term brs_term_id="85" brs_term_type="9">remitted</brs_term> to the District Court for assessment of the compensation claimed.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="97"><p>[After hearing counsel]</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="98"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p34" name="p34">34.</a> The appellant is to have his costs of the appeal and below, and the appellant's own costs of the appeal and below to the extent thathe was legally aided are to be <brs_term brs_term_id="86" brs_term_type="9">taxed</brs_term> in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="99"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="100"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <brs_paragraph id="101"><td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(GP.
