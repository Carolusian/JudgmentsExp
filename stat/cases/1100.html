If that be so, then, by reasonof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/111/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/111" class="autolink_findacts">Estate Duty Ordinance</a>, the value of the Note will not be included in that of the estate of Lamson Kwok Lam Shan ("the deceased") for Estate Duty purposes.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The facts, as ascertained from the affidavit of Karl Kwok Chi-leung, (curiously named "Kwok Chi-leung, Karl" in the Originating Summons),and as agreed by Counsel, are that Tolu was incorporated under Part 1 of the Liberian Business Corporation Act on 25th February 1983.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> On 28th February 1983, the Plaintiff and two of his brothers, Lester Chi-hung and Bill Chi-biu, were appointed Directors of Tolu.Then, and the date, save to say that it was before the death of the deceased, is not relevant to these proceedings, the shares inTofu were duly and properly transferred to the lady who is now the widow of the deceased and their four sons. The deceased was nevera shareholder in or a Director of Tolu.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> At all material times the Directors of and the shareholders in Tolu were resident in Hong Kong. Two of the Directors then executedProxies in Hong Kong to a Mr. B.J. Yeung (previously the sole shareholder in Tolu) and a Mr. Wing Cheng.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Six Directors' Meetings of Tolu were held - all in that Province of Portugal known in English as "Macau". They took place on 21stand 22nd March, 18th April and 12th May 1983. Only the proxies attended.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> At the fourth such meeting, it was resolved that the company purchase certain shares from the deceased. Lester Kwok was authorizedto, and did, sign a Sale and Purchase Agreement on behalf of Tolu. The deceased signed, and that agreement was made on and dated26th April 1983: It is exhibited as K.C.L.K. 6.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Clause 1 of the Agreement provided that the purchase price, that is to say, US$1,807,839.24, should "..... be paid or satisfied inthe manner described in Paragraph 2 ..... ".</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I should add here, parenthetically, that the Agreement is written in a style more appropriate to the United States of America thanto Hong Kong.</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left">Clause 2 provided that: -</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">Seller agrees to accept from Buyer in consideration for the sale and transfer of the Said Shares a promissory note executed by Buyer..... due and payable on demand after 60 days from the date hereof at city of Monrovia, Republic of Liberia. ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Lester Kwok then executed a non-negotiable promissory note at 8.45 p. m. on the same day, 26th April. It reads:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">On demand after sixty (60) days from the date hereof TOLU LIMITED ..... promises to pay LAMSON KWOK the sum of .....

".</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left">That is also exhibited as K.C.L.K. 6.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The deceased died on the following day.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> If a minute book and the books of Tolu exist, they are probably not in Hong Kong, as Mr. Hamlin, for the commissioner of Estate Duty,surmises: I have no precise information as to that. Mr. Hamlin tells me that the Company's Seal is in Hong Kong, and that avermenthas not been challenged. There is no record of any other meeting of the company after that of the 12th of May: Indeed of any meetingother than the six which I have mentioned.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Mr. Dicks for the Plaintiff said to me in his reply, "I would not seek to persuade you that the central management and control ofthe company was not in Hong Kong at all material times. ".</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The company is not registered in Hong Kong under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> as a foreign corporation. The company has neither address for service nor place of business in Hong Kong.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Those, I believe, are the relevant facts, and it is upon those that I am asked to decide, as a matter of law, whether the situs ofthe promissory note is in Hong Kong or not.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The Commissioner takes a straightforward stance. 'This is a simple contract debt. The situs of such a debt is where the debtor is.A corporation resides where its central control and management is situate. This company is therefore resident in Hong Kong. Consequentlythe situs of the promissory note is in Hong Kong. '.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The case for the Plaintiff is put thus: 'This is not a simple contract debt. It is a special kind of obligation. It is a promissorynote (itself a special category). It is a non-negotiable promissory note (a special sub-category). It is not payable until after60 days. It carries interest at 10% per annum, and it is payable only in Monrovia - indeed presentment in Monrovia is a conditionprecedent to payment - that is at Common Law, as provided by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s93.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 93(1)</a> of the Bill of Exchange Ordinance and in the body of the instrument itself.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Being a chose in action it is situated in the country where it is recoverable.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The promissory note is governed by Liberian law as to which there is no evidence. Liberian law on this point, therefore, is deemedto be the same as that of Hong Kong. In Hong Kong there is no written law as to the situs of a promissory note. The Court, therefore,must fall back on the Common Law. No action on the instrument could be brought in Hong Kong unless leave to serve without the jurisdictionwere to be granted under Order 11, rule 1 - which is no test of residence. '.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> To find that the obligation contained in or evidenced by the promissory note is Liberian, is to fly in the teeth of common sense.Tax gatherers would never win a popularity poll, particularly those who prey on the dead, as does the Defendant in this case, but,if the law permits me to decide in the Defendant's favour, his unpopularity would in nowise deter me from so doing. If however, thisis yet another instance of conflict between common sense and the law, the latter must (as always) prevail, and I will be obligedto make a declaration in favour of the Plaintiff, and this ingenious tax avoidance scheme will have succeeded - but has it?</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Hamlin addressed me at some length on central management and control, but that point was conceded in reply, as I have mentioned.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Mr. Hamlin urges upon me that I must look, not at the promissory note, but at the underlying obligation, which is to pay the purchaseprice. "It is in all but name a negotiable instrument", he avers. When tendered in payment of the debt it amounts to but a discharge,and, if it be dishonoured, there is a right of action under the Sale and Purchase Agreement.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In my judgment that is not correct. The Sale and Purchase Agreement itself provides for the mode of payment by a promissory note- by this very promissory note, which is incorporated in the Sale and Purchase Agreement by clause 2 thereof. The promissory noteis distinctly and unequivocally endorsed as non-negotiable - not merely somewhere on its face, but in the body of it as a heading.Any attempt to sue for the purchase price under clause 1 of the Agreement would be met with a reference to clause 2 (to which clause1 itself refers). Any action in contract would have to be on the note itself.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Conceivably, if the Note were dishonoured, an action in damages for breach of an implied term in the agreement that the promissorynote would be honoured, would lie, but that would still not make this a simple contract debt under the Sale and Purchase Agreement,upon which an action would lie without further ado.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The rule as to choses in action, as propounded by Dicey as Rule 76(1), is as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="10%" valign="top" class="quote">"(1)</td>            <td width="77%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">Choses in action generally are situate in the country where they are properly recoverable or can be enforced. ", </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p align="left">and note (6) to that rule deals with actions in contract or tort.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Hamlin relies on the residence of Tolu in Hong Kong, and prays in aid the judgment of Upjohn, J., as he then was, in <u>In re a claim by Helbert Wagg &amp; Co. Ltd</u>.<sup>(1)</sup> and in particular the passage from the first break on p.342 to the second break on p.344. <sup>*</sup></p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> But this is not a case of a corporation with a sole residence. Tolu has an agent for service in Liberia. (That it is also domiciledthere does not affect the matter). It could be served only in Liberia, for it has no place of residence - no address, in Hong Kongwhere service could be effected as, for example, if International Trust Company Limited had not been appointed as such agent underchapter 3, paragraph 3:1, sub-paragraph 1 of the Business corporation Act.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> In <u>F. &amp; K. Jabbour v. Custodian of Israeli Absentee Property,</u><sup>(2)</sup> Pearson, J., as he then was, said at p.146:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">Where a corporation has residence in two or more countries, the debt or chose in action is properly recoverable, and therefore situated,in that one of those countries where the sum payable is primarily payable, and that is where it is required to be paid by an expressor implied provision of the contract or, if there is no such provision, where it would be paid according to the ordinary course ofbusiness. ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The commissioner relied on a number of authorities in support of his contention that the residence of the corporation governs thesitus of the obligation. But every one of those was a revenue matters, turning on the precise requirements of the United KingdomIncome Tax Acts, where "residence" of a company renders it liable to tax. I agree with the summary of the position set out in <u>Private International law</u> by Wolff, 2nd edition, at pages 295/6, particularly at p.296 where that very learned author said:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">It would be improper from the use of the term "residence" in tax law to infer that the term must be used in the same sense where itis a question of the situs debiti. ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left">Indeed, in <u>New York Life Insurance Company v. Public Trustee</u>,<sup>(3)</sup> Pollock, M.R. referred to this very point at p.112, where he said</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">I do not refer to the income tax cases, or other tax cases, which, I think, must be considered closely in relation to the terms ofthe statute upon which the circumstances arose for decision. ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left">The debts in that case were payable in London, and, as the company was resident in both New York and England, the Court of Appealapplied the test of the place of recoverability of the debt. The Master of the Rolls appears to have been much influenced in hisdecision by a dictum of Lord Esher, M. R. in <u>Attorney-General v. Lord Sudeley &amp; Ors.</u>,<sup>(4)</sup> where, at pages 360/1, he said:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">As to debts due to the testator at the time of his death, the rule to be deduced from the cases is that if the debtor is, at the dateof the death of the testator, abroad, and the debt is payable only abroad, and could only be got from him abroad, either by someact to be done there or some proceeding taken there, the debt is a foreign asset; but if, although the debtor is abroad, a legalproceeding could be taken here, which would, in law, directly order and enforce the payment here of the debt, then the debt is anasset here liable to the probate duty. ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Dicey's Rule 138 (supra) itself is qualified by its own notes referring to residence of corporation for the purposes of their liabilityto United Kingdom tax.</p>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> It appears that there is no authority directly in point, so I turn to an analogous situation. I shall take that of an irrevocableLetter of Credit. In <u>Power Curber International Limited v. National Bank of Kuwait</u>,<sup>(5)</sup> referred to at p.69 of the 4th cumulative supplement to Dicey, the court of Appeal held that the lex situs of such a Letter of Creditissued by the Defendant bank in favour of the Plaintiff through the latter's bank in North Carolina, to be paid there against presentationof documents, was that of North Carolina notwithstanding the Defendant's residence in Kuwait: Lord Denning, M. R., at p.1240 F -G, said:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">A debt under a letter of credit is different from ordinary debts. They may be situate where the debtor is resident. But a debt undera letter of credit is situate in the place where it is in fact payable against I documents. ",</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p align="left">and Griffiths, L.J., as he then was, at p.1242 E - F and G - H, said:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"</p>        <p align="left" class="quote">Under the letter of credit the bank accepted the obligation of paying or arranging the payment of the sums due in American dollarsagainst presentation of documents at the sellers' bank in North Carolina. The bank could not have discharged its obligation by offeringpayment in Kuwait.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p align="left" class="quote">Secondly, it was submitted that payment was unlawful according to the lex situs of the debt which it is said is Kuwait.

He also relies on a statement of the law by Eve J. in <u>In re Russo Asiatic Bank</u>,<sup>(8)</sup> where he said this: "although as a general rule the location of simple contract debts is the place in which the debtor is to be found,that rule, in my opinion, does not apply here, where the obligation is in terms to pay in sterling in London." It is to be notedthat in that case the debtor resided both in Russia and in England, and in those circumstances it was a perfectly accurate statementof the law, whatever interpretation is to be placed on the judgments in the Court of Appeal in <u>New York Life Insurance Co. v.

Banque des Marchands de Moscou</u>.<sup>(10)</sup> A transcript of the judgments has been made available to me. I have sent for the pleadings in that case, and it is clear that theplaintiffs were assignees of a bank (the Deutsche Bank), whose principal office was in Berlin, but who had a branch in England. Thedefendant, a Russian bank with no branch in England, was indebted to the London branch of the Deutsche Bank on current account and,therefore, in accordance with the general rule of banking law the debt was payable in London. It is clear that there was no expressterm of any contract making the debt payable in London. The point now under discussion was not dealt with by Scrutton L. J., butGreer L.J. formulated a number of propositions, among them these: "(4) On January 10, 1920, the Treaty of Peace Order in Councilcame into operation whereby enemy choses in action having a situs in this country become vested in the Custodian, afterwards calledthe Administrator, of German property. (5) At this time the bank had no residence in this country, but the debt was payable in thiscountry. (6) The debt in question, therefore, did not pass to the administrator, residence of the debtor being an essential elementin deciding the situs of the debt. "</p>            <p> </p>            <p>        Later on he said: "With regard to the propositions numbered (4)(5) and (6). At the date when the Treaty of Peace Order inCouncil came into operation, namely, January 10, 1920, the defendants had no place of business in, and were therefore not residentin, the United Kingdom, and I think it is established by the decision in this court in <u>New York Life Insurance Co. v. Public Trustee</u><sup>(11)</sup> that the debt had no situs in this country. I regard that case as establishing that it is an essential element in determining thesitus of a debt due to a foreign corporation that at the material date the corporation should have a residence within the jurisdictionin which the debt is payable. "</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="left">        Romer L. J., after discussing the New York Life Insurance Company's case, said this: "As the debt in question was, in termsof the contract creating it, payable in this country, and in addition was recoverable here, its locality was held to be English.In the present case the debt is payable in this country, but the defendant bank was not residing here on January 10, 1920. It wasin May of the same year, but that will not help the plaintiffs. The debt was also recoverable here on January 10, 1920, had the plaintiffsbeen successful in obtaining leave to serve the defendant bank out of the jurisdiction. But I know of no authority for the propositionthat a simple contract debt is situate in this country at a time when the debtor is not resident here; namely, because he can besued by putting into operation the provisions of Order XI. "</p>            <p> </p>            <p align="left">        It is true that in that case the decision of the court was ultimately of no effect upon this point for it was found upon furtherevidence that the defendant bank had no existence at the relevant time, but it is clear that the majority of the court intended tolay down finally their views upon the law "de bene esse" in the words of Greer L.J. in case upon further inquiry the bank was foundto be in existence. Therefore I do not think I can treat the observations of Greer L.J. and Romer L. J. as obiter dicta, and thecase is binding upon me if applicable to the present circumstances. It seems to me that the only distiniction that can be drawn betweenthat case and this is that in this case the debt is payable in London by the terms of the contract and not by virtue of the generallaw applicable thereto and that circumstance is indeed strongly relied upon by the claimants. In my judgment, however, that formsno proper ground of distinction, for the law must be the same whether the debt is payable in a particular place by virtue of theexpress terms of the contract or by general law applicable thereto. Nor can I accept the argument that, as on one construction ofsection 8 of the Act there is no appeal from my decision, I am at liberty to disregard a well-settled canon of procedural law, thatdecisions of the court of Appeal are binding on this court. Accordingly, in my opinion, the locality of the debt in this case isGermany, the only place where the debtor resides.
