The defendant was a transportation company and it undertook the overlandcarriage of the silk fabrics from Nam Hoi, across the border to Hong Kong. The third party was a driver of the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> On 11 November 1992, the third party drove the defendant's three-ton lorry, carrying the said quantity of silk fabrics from Nam Hoifor delivery to the plaintiff's premises at San Po Kong. He reached his home in Hong Kong at about 7 p.m. He parked the lorry inthe vicinity and found it missing the next morning. The lorry was recovered some days later but without its load of silk fabrics.The plaintiff sued the defendant for the sum of $475,863.45 and interests together with costs. In third party proceedings, the defendantclaimed an indemnity from the third party driver against whatever judgment debt it had to pay and its costs of defending the action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> On 19 April 1995, Mr Justice Findlay dismissed the plaintiff's action against the defendant. This is the plaintiff's appeal againstthat dismissal. In the respondent's notice, the defendant reiterates its claim for, inter alia, the same indemnity against the thirdparty driver.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> On the facts found proved by the judge, the relationship of a bailee for reward unquestionably arose. The judge accepted that thedefendant had instructed the third party driver to park the lorry "only in the defendant's carpark or any place designated by theowner of the goods", that "there was a risk that contents of a (lorry left) unattended" would be stolen and that the purpose of theseinstructions "was to minimize the risk of theft". It was also established that the defendant had caused the mobile telephone or pagernumber of its Miss Lau to be given to the third party driver for late arrival after 8 p.m. In the context, the evidence focused onunattended open-parking, and the judge described the order given in the instructions to the third party driver as "a mandatory requirement".In terms of unattended open-parking, the judge was satisfied that the whole exercise was to reduce the risk of theft. Except forthe padlocks provided by the third party driver for the goods compartment, there were no other security precautions taken.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The judge concluded that "by failing to carry out instructions, failing to park the loaded vehicle at the defendant's carpark, andby failing to contact Miss Lau to receive instructions, (the third party driver) was in breach of his <strong><i>obligations</i></strong> under the contract of employment". (Emphasis supplied). In this sense, the third party driver was said to have been "in breach ofhis contract with the defendant". The judge asked himself the correct question: "was the third party also negligent?" The judge continued:"negligence is the breach of duty of care, so one has to examine the nature of duty before deciding whether or not there has beena breach. Clearly, the third party had a duty towards the defendant to <strong><i>take care</i></strong> of the goods". (Emphasis added). It was on the basis of the driver's duty of care as the agent of a bailee for reward that the judgeshould have proceeded to resolve the simple question posed for his consideration at the trial.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> As a bailee for reward, the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff in the safe keeping of the goods. In discharging thatduty of care, "it (was) impossible (for the defendant) to say that no precautions needed to be taken", however slight the foreseeablerisk of loss, having regard to the value and ready disposability of the silk fabrics. <strong>Pitt Son &amp; Badgery Ltd v. Proulefco SA,</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2052%20ALR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 52 ALR 389</a> at p. 391. The risk of loss by theft in unattended open-parking in Hong Kong was foreseeable by the defendant. The defendant tookgreat pains in urging compliance with its said instructions for minimising that risk. Despite what the third party driver said aboutnever having "heard of any theft from this open space" with 40-70 vehicles left there over night, he did not exclude the risk oftheft nor condemn the "mandatory requirement" asked of him as being pointless. He merely asserted that he defied his company's instructionsfor personal convenience and that his company's car park in Sun Tin had never been used before (not, be it noted, after) 11 November1992. These mandatory instructions were given to the third party driver when he was employed. They were "standing instructions",and Miss Lau impressed upon the third party driver on the day in question to park his lorry in the defendant's car park which wasfenced with a locked gate. A contact number was left with him. In fact, the judge found it to be his mandatory employment obligation."The third party knew he was carrying a valuable cargo". It is incredible, in the circumstances, for the defendant to claim thatall reasonable care had been taken of the silk fabrics by leaving it unattended in a lorry parked in an open space near the driver'shome. The third party was negligent. If a bailee for reward should entrust the duty to the care of the goods to his servant or agent,he is equally answerable for the acts or omissions of his servant or agent. <strong>Port Swettenham Authority v. T W Wu &amp; Co. (M) Sdn Bhd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20AC%20580" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] AC 580</a> at p. 590B.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> A bailee for reward is obliged to return the bailed goods safely at the end of the bailment, and he could only escape liability bydischarging his burden of proving that he had taken appropriate care or that his failure to do so did not cause the loss. See <strong>British Road Services Ltd v. Arthur V. Crutchley &amp; Co Ltd,</strong> [1968] 1AER 811 at pp. 820a &amp; 824 C &amp; G. That is all of the applicable principles one needs to remind oneself of.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The judge did not focus on the liability of the defendant as a bailee for reward, nor on the negligence arising from his breach ofduty of care through its driver, the third party. The judge seems to have overlooked the bailee's burden of proof. The judge wasswayed by submissions made on the wholly irrelevant decision of <strong>Weld-blundell v. Stephens</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1920%5d%20AC%20965" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1920] AC 965.</a></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In <strong>Weld-Blundell v. Stephens</strong>, the plaintiff principal gave his defendant agent a libellous letter which was carelessly left by the agent's partner at the officeof one of the three persons defamed. Two of the persons defamed sued in libel and recovered damages from the principal who soughtin the action to recoup his loss from the agent. The issue was whether the principal could recover substantial damages against theagent for his negligence. The Law Lords were divided 3 to 2 : The majority held that the principal's liability for damages, whichthe principal had brought upon himself by his libel independently of the agency relationship, was not the direct consequence of hisagent's breach of duty. In terms of causation, clearly the principal's libellous letter was not a consequence of the agent's negligence.See p. 995, per Lord Dunedin who at pp. 981-2, laid stress on causa causans and causa sine qua non. See also p. 998, per Lord Wrenbury.Their ratio was unconcerned with a principal's vicarious liability for his agent. The minority view expressed in their Lordships'House was that the institution of the action for recovering those libel damages was the direct consequence of the agent's breachof duty, i.e. the agent made it possible for the claimants to go to court. See pp. 970 &amp; 986. Again, it was not based on vicariousliability.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In this case, loss was caused by the driver's own negligent act. The third party driver as agent was a "mere conduit pipe throughwhich consequences" flew from the principal (defendant) to the claimant (plaintiff). See <strong>Weld-Blundell v. Stephens</strong>, supra. p. 986. The principal (defendant) here was sued on its own negligence and on his vicarious liability for its driver's negligence.The negligent act of the driver as its agent, for which the defendant was vicariously liable, happened to be also a breach of hiscontractual duty with the defendant as principal. In <strong>Weld-Blundell v. Stephens</strong>, there was no question of vicarious liability but simply a breach of the agent's duty to his principal. But for that breach of duty,the principal's libel would not have been made known and the loss flowing from it would not have been sued for. What was under considerationin <strong>Weld-Blundell</strong> was the agent's liability to his principal, not to the claimant, as to whether or not he, the agent was liable to recoup his principalfor the libel damages which his principal had paid or "to give reparation for the damage done". <strong>Weld-Blundell v. Stephens</strong>, supra. at p. 986. Moreover, as Findlay, J. rightly pointed out, in that case the degree of foreseeability of loss on the part ofthe agent for attracting liability must be "fairly high", "at least.....something very likely to happen". In <strong>Weld-Blundell</strong>, a different concept in liability was examined and a different test of an agent's liability was canvassed, hence an entirely differentquestion was under review. It was also not a case of bailment where the bailee would be responsible for the safe return of bailedgoods.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Insofar as his conclusions on facts and in law were drawn upon the decision of <strong>Weld-blundell v Stephens</strong>, the judge cannot be supported. Insofar as his findings were made or purportedly made against the plaintiff independently of <strong>Weld-blundell v Stephens</strong> but apparently on a different burden of proof, such as "the loss was (in this case not) even reasonably foreseeable", "it is notalleged that the defendant suffered any loss as a result of any breach of this duty (duty of care)", "(the defendant) took all reasonablecare of the goods in its custody", they run counter to the weight of the evidence led on behalf of the defendant he had acceptedand are erroneous.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I ought to deal specifically with ground 4(f) of the Notice of Appeal. By ground 4(f), the plaintiff as appellant rests its challengeto the judge's dismissal on the contention that the judge should have held the defendant liable for the loss of silk fabrics becauseof its failure to fit the vehicle with any anti-theft devices or alarms. Suffice it to say that pleading difficulty aside, therewas no evidence to suggest that extra anti-theft installations were at all necessary in the light of the defendant's mandatory instructionsor that they would effectively increase security against theft or that their absence in fact caused or contributed to the actualloss in this case. This ground fails.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The defendant had given adequate instructions for meeting "the risk of theft" it had foreseen, but the defendant stood vicariouslyliable for its driver's breach of "a mandatory requirement" in his terms of employment by negligently parking the lorry in a place,particularly an open space other than that stipulated in the mandatory instructions so that risk of theft was not minimised or altogetheravoided. The defendant did not discharge its burden of proof that it had taken appropriate care for the bailed goods. It is thereforeliable to the plaintiff as claimed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Damages in the sum of $475,863.45 were implicitly found proved by the judge. Save for the "exemption clause" and "scope of employment"to which I will soon turn, this appeal should be allowed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Was the third party driver acting within the scope of his employment? Not every deviation from the manner in which a task is to beperformed would take it out of an employee's course of employment. It is largely a matter of degree. Whether disobedience to instructionsgiven would take the performance out of an employee's course of employment would generally depend upon whether it provides merelya different mode of carrying out the task or whether it in fact constitutes a different "class of act which the employee is employedto perform". See paras. 5-30 &amp; 5-23 at pp. 181 &amp; 177 respectively. Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts, 17th Ed. The third partydriver was instructed in his employment to deliver goods from Nam Hoi to San Po Kong. He interrupted the journey for the latenessof the day and it was to be resumed, delivery made the very next morning. It was an arbitrary selection for his own convenience ofa less safe place to park. The judge concluded that the instructions given "had an impact only in the way the third party was enquiredto carry out the work he was employed to perform". I am in entire agreement with that conclusion.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Finally, the exemption clause: there is no disagreement as to how clause 6 should in effect be read, that is to say, "During transport,all risk caused by wind or fire or water and other accident shall be the responsibility of the consignor." It is conceded that clause6 was part of the contract. In <strong>Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v. The King</strong> [1952] AC192 at p. 208 in delivering the judgment in their Lordships' House, Lord Morton of Henryton said this:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"Their Lordships think that the duty of a court in approaching the consideration of such (exemption) clauses may be summarized asfollows:-</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          (1) If the clause contains language which expressly exempts the person in whose favour it is made (hereafter called" theproferens") from the consequence of the negligence of his own servants, effect must be given to that provision.

I agree with the judge that the language of clause 6 was not wide enough, inits ordinary meaning, to cover negligence. In any case, wind, fire or water accidental risks are clearly referable to other exemptinggrounds than that of negligence. However, the third criteria in <strong>Canadian Steamship</strong> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/71/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/71" class="autolink_findacts">Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance</a> need not be considered.

I would give judgment accordingly against the third party.</p>    <p align="left">Bokhary JA:</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> There must be judgment for the plaintiff customer against the defendant transportation firm in respect of the loss of the goods.And, in turn, there must be judgment for the defendant transportation firm against the third party driver for an indemnity. I toowould allow this appeal accordingly.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The relevant law is clear. Both counsel are, as I am, content to take it from this summary in <i>2 Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed.) p. 856, para. 1839:</i></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Apart from special contract, the bailee is not an insurer and therefore, in the absence of negligence on his part, he is not liablefor the loss of or damage to the chattel due to some accident, fire, the acts of third parties, or the unauthorised acts of his servantsacting outside the scope of their employment. But if he entrusts the duty to take care of the chattel to a servant or agent, he isanswerable for the manner in which that servant or agent carries out his duty."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Here, the transportation firm rightly apprehended the reasonably foreseeable risk of leaving loaded vehicles unattended in the street.So it set up a system under which its loaded vehicles had to be parked in its own car park.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> If that system had been followed, the loss in question would not have occurred. That is plain since the customer's goods were lostwhen the vehicle on which they were loaded was stolen when left unattended in the street overnight. It was so left because the driver,being the transportation firm's servant to whom it had entrusted its customer's goods, flouted its instructions to him and departedfrom its system. That deprived the customer of the reasonable precaution for its goods to which it was entitled. And that deprivationresulted in the loss.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Sensibly, Mr Cheung for the transportation firm does not seek to defend Findlay J's view that the loss here would not be recoverableunless it was "at least ... something very likely to happen" or that there was "a fairly high degree of foreseeability" of such loss.That view is contrary to the law of bailment, and is based on a misapplication of the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Weld-Blundell</i> v. <i>Stephens</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1920%5d%20AC%20965" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1920] AC 965.</a></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr Cheung does, however, seek to support the judge's view that the loss here was not even reasonably foreseeable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> In taking that view, the judge said this: "To steal the goods would involve considerable effort by a knowledgeable and determinedcriminal, probably a gang of professional criminals, the crime would have to be committed in a place frequented by others, the padlockwould have to be overcome, and means provided to transport and 'fence' a large quantity of heavy silk."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> That line of reasoning is, I feel bound to say, faulty from start to finish. First of all, a gang of knowledgeable and determinedprofessional criminals is precisely what a transportation firm having custody of a large consignment of valuable goods would naturallyfear the most. Secondly, there is no evidence that the place at which the vehicle was parked was so frequented all night as to deteror pose insuperable difficulties for such criminals. Thirdly, the padlock was plainly something which such criminals could easilyovercome. Fourthly, transportation was no problem since the vehicle itself provided that. Finally, there is no reason to imaginethat professional thieves have difficulty in obtaining the services of professional handlers.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> In truth, the risk of leaving loaded vehicles unattended in the street overnight was an obvious one.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Four grounds are put forward in the Respondent's Notice.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The first reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Defendant was at all material times and is entitled to rely on Clause 7 under the heading "Notice to Consignor" of a deliveryorder, of which the Plaintiff had knowledge and had accepted, to exempt its liability, if any, to the Plaintiff in that the saidclause</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="3%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="3%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%" class="quote">formed a part of the contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant;</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="3%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="3%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%" class="quote">was and is capable of covering the incident in question; and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="3%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="3%" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%" class="quote">was one which, under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/71" class="autolink_findacts">Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance</a> Chapter 71 Laws of Hong Kong, the Defendant was and is reasonable, in all the circumstances, to rely on."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Now, the clause itself reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"During transport, all risk caused by wind or fire or water and other accident shall be the responsibility of the consignor."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Whatever that covers, it cannot on a fair reading cover exposing the goods to the foreseeable risk of theft while in an unattendedvehicle in the street overnight in violation of the transportation firm's policy never to leave loaded vehicles unattended in thestreet.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Turning to the second ground in the Respondent's Notice, it reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Further or alternatively, the Defendant was and is in any event not liable to the Plaintiff by reason of the fact that the ThirdParty, being its employee, had at all material times acted outside the scope of his employment, in that he parked goods vehicle EL5358 loaded with goods by the side of a public road and left the same unattended overnight despite clear instructions given to himby the Defendant (a) at his recruitment and (b) on 11th November 1992 to return the said goods vehicle and the goods therein to thepossession and control of the Defendant during night time."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In <i>Port Swettenham Authority</i> v.T.W.

The third one reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Further or in the further alternative, the Defendant was and is in any event not liable to the Plaintiff in that the Defendant hadestablished by sufficient and convincing evidence that it or its servant including the Third Party had taken reasonable steps orprecautions, or, further or alternatively, had acted reasonably to guard against the loss of the Plaintiff's goods."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">And the fourth one reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the further alternative to 3 above, if, which is denied, the Defendant had failed to establish by sufficient and/or convincingevidence that it or its servant including the Third Party had taken reasonable steps or precautions, or had acted reasonably, toguard against the loss of the Plaintiff's goods, such failure to take reasonable steps or precautions, or to act reasonably, didnot cause or contribute to the loss of the Plaintiff's goods."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> There is a short answer to both. The driver should have followed the obviously sensible system of parking loaded vehicles in thetransportation firm's car park. And if he had done so, this loss, which resulted from the theft of a loaded vehicle left unattendedin the street overnight, would not have occurred.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Before concluding this judgment, I wish to express my thanks to counsel on both sides for their able arguments, which they helpfullyforeshadowed in carefully prepared skeleton arguments.</p>    <p align="left">Nazareth V-P:</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> I agree for the reasons given by Liu and Bokhary JJA that the appeal must be allowed and judgment entered for both the plaintiffagainst the defendant and the defendant against the 3rd party. I would concur in the orders they propose.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> It is unfortunate that and not entirely clear why the matter came to be finally addressed primarily as one of a general claim incontract as opposed to one specifically in bailment.

The law in point is clearly stated in the following passages in Halsbury'sLaws of England, 4th Edn Vol. 2 para. 1839:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="3%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="97%" class="quote">"1839.

But if he entrusts the duty to take care of the chattel to a servantor agent, he is answerable for the manner in which that servant or agent carries out his duty."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In the context of the first question, the judge came first of all to focus upon the foreseeability of the loss. He found that a reasonableman would not have foreseen to the required degree in the circumstances of this case that the silk would have been stolen. I findit necessary only to say, and without recounting the relevant facts which have been adumbrated by my Lords, that I am wholly unableto accept that inferential finding which I think on the plainest considerations wrong. On any view of the facts, the theft was foreseeableand indeed must have been foreseen in the particular circumstances.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> I reject Mr Cheung's ingenious submission that although there may have been some foresight of the general risk initially, it wasdisplaced by the vehicle being parked in what the third party driver regarded as a safe place. Also, it was on the absence of foresightthat the judge can be seen to have concluded that there was no breach of duty to take care.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Returning the to the first question: was reasonable care exercised? Again, I do not find it necessary to canvass the facts and considerations,which have been dealt with by my Lords. I have no hesitation in concluding that reasonable care was plainly not exercised. On thedefendant's own assessment of the position, the vehicle should have been placed in its own secure car park. But this was not done.Moreover, on the law, there is an onus upon a bailee to prove that he took reasonable care to discharge his duty to secure the safetyof the goods entrusted to him. The defendant has not done so in this case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Proceeding to the second question, this is the liability of the defendant for the acts of its agent. The law is that I have alreadystated. Under that it can be seen that the act of the driver, even if it was unauthorised, this matters not if it was in the courseof employment. In stopping overnight in the process of transportation of the silk to the plaintiff, and I stress that was what thedriver was doing, transporting the silk to the plaintiff, the driver was, in my view, simply adopting a different mode of carryingout the defendant's orders so that on the authorities, this was within the course of employment.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> On both these central questions, therefore, the defendant fails.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> As to the other questions raised in this appeal, I do not think there is anything useful that I can add to what my Lords have said.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> The appeal is accordingly allowed and there will be judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant and in favour of thedefendant against the third party.
