He claims damages firstlythe differentials between the rents he had to pay for the period of alleged delay some 19 months on the pleadings and the rents heactually received from the then suit premises to the amount of $22,800 and secondly general damages for resulting distress and miseryallegedly suffered. (He originally claimed for "mentality suffered etc" but that was struck out by me in Chambers earlier on substitutingtherefor general damages. )</p>    <p>       </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> It is important from the legal point of view to be clear in my mind at the outset the foundation of the claim whether it is basedon breach of contract between solicitors and client or on tort as negligence simpliciter. I cannot expect any assistance as to thelaw from Mr. Yu who is a layman. Until recent years in modern times, it was thought that a solicitor could never be liable in tortand whenever he was liable his liability was ccntractual. However, I venture to the opinion that it is the current judicial tendencythat a solicitor can be liable either or both in tort as well as contractually. In <u>Ross v. Caunters</u> <em>[</em>1980<em>]</em> Chancery 297 at 322, Sir Robert Megarry V.-C., having referred at length to nearly all the previous relevant authorities and thebrief history of the matter, decided that</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"        (1) Despite the dicta in Robertson v.

If a case fell within these narrow limits, then the solicitor could be liable to his client in tort.

He then acted in person.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On the 2nd September 1981 Notice of Hearing was sent to the parties and the plaintiff received it. The date of hearing was set downfor 8th January 1982. In mid-November, the exact date of which has no great significance, the plaintiff instructed the defendantfirm to conduct the forthcoming hearing for him. Fees were agreed at ??4,000 as "agreed costs". The above are not in dispute at all.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Before the hearing the sole owner of the defendant firm DW1 was apprehensive of the imminent change of the law to result the uncertaintyas to whether or not Notice to Quit would be required as e pre-requisite for an order for possession. On l9th December 1981, the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7" class="autolink_findacts">Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap. 7</a> was amended in such a way, particularly with regard to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 52</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">53</a> that the legal-judicial-academic circles in Hong Kong were divided into two schools of thought: One, Notice was a pre-requisite;the other no notice was required at all. Mr. Ip, the solicitor, was left in a state of dilemma as to whether to abandon ship by discontinuingthe action and starting afresh or alternatively to take the chance in the hope of a successful result on 8th of January. He decidedin favour of taking a calculated risk. As a measure of precaution, he instructed PWl Counsel who, by the 8th of January, had theexperience of some 50/60 possession cases to appear for the plaintiff. He instructed his clerk Cano Ip to arrange a conference withCounsel for the plaintiff. He cannot say definitely whether Cano had carried out his instructions. PW1 Mr. Chow categorically testifiedthat one or two days before the hearing he held a conference in his Chambers with the plaintiff and Cano whereas the plaintiff definitelydenied it and challenged Mr. Chow to the effect that Mr. Chow lied about conference. Mr. Chow gave his reasons why he could categoricallyrecalled so well that the conference was held mainly that the plaintiff had conveyed to him in conference a number of matters, themost striking of which so retaining in his memory was that the plaintiff's one-room accommodation was so congested and appallingthat his young son had to be sometimes in physical contact with his young daughter on the lower bunk which the children shared. Iaccept the evidence of Mr. Chow. I see no reason at all why should he lie. In fact Mr. Chow convinced me as a witness not only oftruth but of great caution, telling only those matters which he could really remember that he was convinced himself that he remembered.He gave me the impression that he would rather leave it as matters not recalled than risking not telling the truth whenever he wasin some doubt. I found all that I mentioned in this paragraph are true.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Now on the date of hearing. Firstly, it was not in dispute that the defendant firm was careless in failing to obtain the OccupationPermit before 8th of January. Secondly, Mr. Chow applied for the adjournment which was granted without objection from the defendants.The important issue is the cause for the application for the adjournment. The plaintiff contended that the lack of Occupation Permitwas the sole cause in effect. I do not accept that as being contrary to the evidence as a whole. True Mr. Chow in chief had onlythe Occupation Permit in mind when dealing with the application and the lack of the Occupation Permit was stated and recorded asthe ground for the adjournment on the 8th before Judge Wane. However, under cross-examination when reminded of the necessity to eventuallydiscontinue the then action and the main reason behind it, PW1 came to recollect that in effect there was the other reason that therewas no valid notice served on all the defendants, the tenants and sub-tenants. It was abundantly clear also on his evidence thatJudge Wane then took up the case at as late as sometime after 12 p.m. (which the plaintiff said it was about 12.30 p.m.) when it'sturn of the floater was called upon. With 12 defendants around, surely the case even started would not have been concluded at theend of the day, say at 5 p.m. or even a bit beyond. Eventually it took 2 days as we shall see. It would have to be made part-heardin any event. On the evidence I find that there were 3 reasons as above stated which prompted Mr. Chow to advise and obtain consentfrom the plaintiff to seek the adjournment. I further find that even if the Occupation Permit was in hand, an application for adjournmentwould have been made on the ground of no notice to quit. In fairness to the plaintiff, the lack of Occupation Permit was just asimportant as the other two, if not more. It is certainly true that that was the deepest impression on the mind of PWl when he wasgiving evidence in chief this morning. Incidentally PW1, I think, did make a mistake when he said the case was first heard in theFire Brigade Building for it is apparent from Notice of Hearing Exh. P6 that the case was then heard exclusively in this buildingPokfulam. I find that mistake on the part of Mr. Chow was an honest mistake due to lack of memory with passage of time complicatedby the sizeable number of cases he had attended to in court all these years. There was, about this time, at least one judge sittingat Fire Brigade doing tenancy matters. That I can take judicial notice of it. I am sure that this mistake in no way put the truthfulnessand the accuracy of PW1's evidence in question.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> After the adjournment, Mr. Ip PW1 was even at greater pain as to what to do with the case. He consulted his solicitor brethren aswell as various Counsels who appeared to hold different views. He decided to wait until the outcome of the appeal in <u>NGAI Sau-ying</u>, the decision of which was not delivered by the Court of Appeal until May 1982 which judgment incidentally had become a milestonein the interpretation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 52</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">53</a> the final legal judicial opinions of that, as far as I am aware, are still not unanimous although it has been a uniform practicenow for solicitors to take it, and if I may say so, quite sensibly that notice to quit is a must. However, by March 11, 1982, Mr.Ip must have decided that it would be wiser to discontinue the old action and start afresh. That he did on that date by filing Noticeof Discontinuance. On 15th of March, four days later, he saw to it that the Notice to Quit on the tenant was served and on the sameday a letter to all sub-tenants informing them that the Notice to Quit had been served was sent by registered post to all sub-tenantswith another copy of the Notice posted up at a conspicuous place of the suit premises for three consecutive days. The Notice expiredon 30th April. 6 days later, on 6th May the defendant firm issued a writ for the 2nd action, Action No. VCJ 3418 of 1982. No Defencewas filed within 14 days as required by statute and application for default judgment was applied for, which judgment was obtainedon 27th of July, 1982. Suffice it to mention here that three or four weeks' time was needed to comply with the various proceduresof drawing up the default judgment, approval of it by the Court and further disposal of it. On llth of August, 1982, a Notice ofJudgment was sent to all the defendants. 6 days later, on the 17th, the defendant firm received from Arthur Au &amp; Co., Solicitors,notice to act for all the defendants and notice that application was being made to set aside the default judgment. The applicationwas heard on the 9th of September 1982 in which the default judgment was in fact set aside with leave to file defence. Defence ofall the defendants was filed on the 17th September. On the 25th September the defendant firm made an application to set the casedown for trial and it was set down for the 4th of November, 1982. On 4th November, the date of the hearing, Judge Tony Wane (thereference of Judge H, Wong in the Defence in this action was obviously a mistake) adjourned the hearing on the application of solicitorfor the defendants that the 11th Defendant had gone to Mainland China for further medical treatment after prior treatments at QueenMary Hospital. I was at one stage of the trial puzzled by the delay of some four months for it was not until 7th of March, 1983 thatthe defendant wrote to Arthur Au pressing for arrangement to refix the date of hearing. The cloud was cleared by Exh. D2, a letterfrom Arthur Au to defendant dated 13th of March 1983 in which the defendant was informed that the 11th Defendant had returned fromMainland China some days ago, obviously referring to several days from 13th of March. Mr. Ip, PW1, did not give detail evidence onit. That was understandable because he really did not personally handle the case in so far as most of the direct contact betweensolicitor and client was concerned. It was clear from D2 that the defendant could not have pressed Arthur Au for an early date ofhearing, much earlier than 7th of March if at all. On 16th of March 1983, the defendant wrote to Deputy Registrar, Victoria DistrictCourt for the restoration of the hearing and the action was reset down for the 6th and 7th of June 1983. Hearings were had beforeJudge Henry Wong on those two days with judgment reserved. On 17th of June, 1983, Judge Wong entered judgment for the plaintiff withpossession of the suit premises to him amongst other relief but staying execution for possession for 3 months until end of September.Eventually in September 1983, at long, last the plaintiff moved into the flat which he owns. I accept Mr. Ip, DW1's, evidence onthe history and the sequences leading not only to the adjournment and discontinuance but to the final conclusion of the case. Mr.Ip strikes me as a solicitor of great caution in the conduct of the proceedings for the defendant I agree with Miss Sze that hadMr. Ip personally chosen to be irresponsible, all he needed to do was to go ahead after the adjournment on the 8th of January by asking for a new hearing date on the 8th without giving a thoughtto whether to discontinue the action. Mr. Ip must, as I have said, bewildered, as many solicitors and barristers and others concernedor interested with the tenancy law must have been, with what was the law relating to requirement of notice to quit Afterall he hadagreed costs for only $4,000 without taking into consideration the necessity of engaging a Counsel at the time the fees were agreedCertainly when Counsel's service was included for the hearing of the 8th, the fees were very much on the low side even in 1982. AndI am also impressed by Mr. Ip's evidence that he never exaggerated a single bit in his evidence on details or matters of importance,for example he made no attempt to close the gap between November and March before he wrote to Arthur Au for restoration of the case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The picture would not be complete without reference to the fact that some of the defendants did ask for leave to appeal against JudgeWong's decision but was turned down by Judge Wong himself.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> I have verified from the two court files which have been exhibited for this action the various dates and legal steps taken and foundthem to be accurate as above stated.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> All the evidence contrary to my above findings had been given due consideration but rejected, i.e. on all my above findings. So muchso for the facts, what will be the legal consequences? I have at all the times very much in mind that impolite-as it may be, thedefendant firm was careless when neglected to obtain the Occupation Permit to be produced in court on the 8th of January, 1982. Foravoidance of any misunderstanding, that was the only piece of neglect I found on the conduct of the defendant firm, none others.I am sure, let alone on a balance of probabilities, that otherwise the defendant firm and Mr, Ip in particular had acted diligently,cautiously, knowledgeably, carefully and skilfully in the exercise of his judgment as to what course of action he ought to take beforeand after the adjournment. Be that as they may, neglect for no Occupation Permit remained. However, the adjournment, I am quite confident,was not caused just by the lack of Occupation Permit but was caused by the other two reasons stated as well. I am not diluting theimportance of the Occupation Permit. But the other two reasons were each as much the operative reasons as the Occupation Permit.Moreover, from the legal consequence point of view, even with a good and valid Occupation Permit produced, the trial on the 8th ofJanuary could not have been concluded. As I have said it would have been made part heard due to the large number of defendants. Theadjournment was a foregone conclusion at the time round about 12.30 p.m. when the Court took up the case from the floater for halfa day only. In other words, the neglect for no Occupation Permit did not cause the adjournment. In terms of consequences, it hadonly side-line significance. It really matters not whether or not there was an Occupation Permlt-result rise. As I understand thelaw, a plaintiff could only succeed on negligence if the damages suffered resulted from the negligence save and except in certainpeculiar actions such as that based on perhaps malice of which this is not one. The law on the matter is so clear that the establishedlaw has not been retested again in modern times. Suffice it to remind myself of the law by reading and perhaps for completion ofrecord quoting Chitty on Contracts - General Principles, 25th Edition, 1982, paragraph 726 at page 397:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">".... A solicitor may be liable to his client both in contract and in tort for negligence in failing to exercise a reasonable amountof skill, diligence and "knowledge, but not for the consequences of a mistake on a doubtful point of law or a nice point of practice."(The case of Godefroy <em>[</em>1830<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=6%20Bing%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">6 Bing. 460</a> and others were referred to in the foot note. )</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Even if I were wrong in finding that there was a complete lack of negligence (in fact much diligence was shown) in the judgment ofMr. Ip DW1 and in the conduct of the firm for the due prosecution of the defendant's action (save and except of course no notice)any mistake on the part of Mr. Ip or the firm or his assistant solicitors that might have been made must have been honest mistakeson a point of law very much in doubt at the time. As a matter of fact, I think Mr. Ip had made the correct decision. If he was tobe criticised at all, I would criticise him for not making the decision earlier on, i.e. before the case cane on the 8th of January.He was a cautious man. For a very bold man, one would have strongly advised to abandon ship before the end of 1981. Afterall lawyersare not expected to be brave men. Caution may be a better virtue than bravery in the battle of law.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Before I leave the matter, I should add that I suspect that there was certain amount of misunderstanding between the plaintiff andMr. Cano Ip, the defendant's clerk, due to a gap in communication. Perhaps the plaintiff was a person who needed to be explainedpainstakingly on matters of law especially law of sublety arising from a change and perhaps Mr. Cano Ip did not possess the qualityof such patience for that job.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> For the above reasons, I find that the defendant is not negligent in the sense that either the firm or any of the solicitors involvedwas so negligent as to be responsible for whatever damages that the plaintiff might claim to have suffered as a result of the delayfor obtaining physical possession of his flat, which delay was fully accounted for as above found and stated. In the result, it isunnecessary for me to go into damages as liability has not been established. Judgment is entered for the defendant (this action isdismissed). I shall hear Counsel and party on the matter of costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Having heard party and Counsel on the matter of costs, I order that nominal cost of $1 to solicitor for the defendants, namely Ford,Kwan who, if I may say so, true to its professional spirit, admirably acted on a complimentary basis. I said true to its professionalspirit not in the narrow brotherhood sense of the profession but in the broader sense of justice. And I also award a Certificatefor Counsel in this case and Counsel's costs to the defendant to be taxed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I have given serious thought to making no order as to costs but in all the circumstances of the case I don't think this is a casefit to be an exception to the rule that costs follow the event There was no good reasons to make it an exception particularly whenan offer of $10,000 which I believe is true had been made to the plaintiff for settlement out of court on a without prejudice basisand it was refused. The plaintiff might have a sense of grievance with regard to the occupation permit issue and started this actionbut surely he should have balanced this factor against all the other factors. A prudent man would have asked for some legal advicebefore the action was started and certainly before he would turn down the offer of $10,000. Just to avoid any further misunderstandingon the law by the plaintiff, when an offer was made without prejudice it means that the defendant was not admitting any liabilitybut was making the offer for reasons such as practicality, feasibility or "call it a day" or other reasons. I say this to dispelany illusion on the part of the plaintiff as to why should he lose the case when afterall an offer had been made to him I have alsotaken into due consideration the failure to obtain the Occupation Permit and my high suspicion that there was a communication gapbetween Cano Ip and the plaintiff for which Cano Ip as a staff of the firm for the plaintiff must be blamed and not the defendant.It was for these reasons that I have given serious consideration to make an order as to costs and it was for the same reasons thatI had boldly found out from Counsel that most probably Messrs. Ford, Kwan would be on a complimentary basis in the consequence thatI award only a nominal cost of $1 as solicitor's costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(Eric Li)</p>                <p style="text-align:center">District Judge</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Plaintiff in person</p>        <p>Miss Sze Kin instructed by M/S Ford, Kwan &amp; Co. for defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/1984/9.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
