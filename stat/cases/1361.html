The plaintiff who was employed asa moulding machine operator was engaged in the operation of one of these machines which was about 4'6" in height. The machine wasan automatic machine for the production of plastic flowers which when produced would be automatically ejected. The machine containeddangerous parts boing closing nips between platen motions. The dangerous parts were guarded by a sliding iron door referred to asâthe gateâ. The gate was obviously provided as a device to protect the operator against injury and against any inclination toput his hand between the fixed and the moving platen when they come togother. The gate shielded or covered an opening of approximately1 sq. ft. without which gate the dangorous parts may be reached by hand. If ono slides the gate to the left thereby exposing thedangerous parts the gate would hit a switch causing the platens to open and the machine would then automatically come to a stop andcease to function. This was evidently a built-in safety measure to insure against any mishap to an operator when the moulds are exposedor required to be attended to for any purpose. Although the machino wouli become non-operational when the gate is opened but whenthe gate is closed by sliding it over to the right thereby covering the dangerous parts, it would trigger another switch puttingthe machine into motion again. There is no evidence before me that the gate was detachable or has ever been detached.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The top of the machine was fitted with a detachable fence or grill. In this connection I accept the evidence of the defendant andthe plaintiff's co-worker that there was such a grill covering the top of the machine. If different types of flowers were to be produced,the moulds would have to be changed. It would appear that thc grill on the top of the machine was made detachable to enable thc mouldsin the machine to be removed or changed. Thero was a power switch in the machine which could be used to cut off the electricity.Shortly before the accident the plaintiff changed the moulds. He did this by first sliding open the gate causing the machine to stopand then switching off the power to isolate the supply of electricity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Although the plaintiff's case on the pleadings is that his finger got clipped as he was changing the moulds his evidence does notbear this out. He changed the moulds without any mishap. Having done that and having put the machine in operation and while the macllinewas in the course of producing flowers it was found that somo flowers became stuck to the mould. The plaintiff then opened the gatethat shielded the dangerous parts. This caused the machine to stop functioning. Instead of using the opening opposite the gate toget the flowers unstuck, he reached over and put his hand through the top of the machine to detach the flowers. It was while doingthis that the machine suddenly came to life with the result that the tip of his index finger was crushed by tho platons coming togother.He was unable to explain what activated the machine although he suspects that it was the sleeve of his shirt that got caught somewherewhich caused the machine to start. He did not elaborate upon this although it may be possible that his sleeve may have caught thehandle of the gate causing it to close. If so, this would activato the machine. There was suggestion that the machine ever had anyloose connections or that it was ever found that it could function while the safety gate was in the open position. There is everyreason to suppose that had the defendant reached for the flowers via the opening opposite the safety gate the injury would not haveoccurred as the machino was so constructed as to become non-operational while the gate was opened.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> At the tima the defendant sustained the injury when he reached for the flowers by getting to them through the top of the machine,the grilled fencing at the top of the machine was not there it having been removed by the dofendant when he changed the moulds. Hedid not thereafter replace the fencing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> It would be convenient at this juncture to deal with the question of whether there was a breach of statutory duty on that account.The grilled fencing, unlike thd iron gate, is not fixed but detachable. It does not cease to be an effective guard for that reason.Under Regulation 5 of the Factories Industrial Undertakings (Guarding and Operation of Machinery) Regulations affective guardingincludos an 'automatic guard' which is defined as 'a guard which automatically prevents an operator of any machinery or plant fromcoming into contact with a dangerous part when that part is in motion'. The detachable fancing, therefore, fails within the definitionof an automatic guard.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> But was there a breach of statutory duty as the fencing was not there when the accident occurred ?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On the facts of this case I would answer the question in the negative. The guard or fencing need only be kept in its proper positionwhile the machinery 'is in motion' : sub-reg. 2(c) of reg. 5 of the Factories Industrial Undertakings (Guarding and Operation ofMachinery) Regulations. Before tho defendant reached for the flowers frem the top of the machine he had opened the gate. This causedthe machine to stop functioning. The gate triggered a switch which stopped the machine. It is the same as if the def0ndant had himselfswitched off the machine. Effectively he did this by using the gate. As that stopped tho machine being in motion, it was not a breachof the relevant regulation if the fencing was not in it's proper place at that point of time. To support an action founded on broachof statutory duty it must be shown that at the time of the accident there was a breach and that the injury arose as a result of thatbreach. That is not the case here.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> I now turn to tho question of whether there was negligence on the part of the defendant giving rise to the accident. 'The plaintiffmust show, on the ba1ance of probabilities, that the damage was caused, both <u>in fact</u> and as a matter of law, by the defondant's breach of duty. To prove causation <u>in fact</u>, the plaintiff must in principle show that the damage would not have occurrod "but for" tho breach of duty : <u>Clerk</u> <u>and Lindsell on Torts</u> (15th Edn.) 653'.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> When the plaintiff was employed he was not warned or advised of the dangers necessarily inherent in the operation of the machine.In some cases it may be essential for the employer to givo adequate instructions concerning not only the proper and safe method ofdoing the job but also the likoly dangers to be wet should there be a departure from that prescribed method. Equally, there willbe cases where no instructions or warnings will be necessary at all, particularly to experienced workmen : <u>Wilson v. Tyneside Window Cleaning Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%202%20QB%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 2 Q.B. 110.</a> The plaintiff was an experienced plastic moulding machine operator. He had been oporating such machines since 1967. Before beingemployed by the defendant the plaintiff had been working on a similar type of machine and he stated that when he was employed thedefendant knew that he had previously been working on this and other type of moulding machines. Such a person does not need any warningsor advice about risks with vihich he is throughly familiar : <u>Qualcase (Wolverhampton) Ltd. v. Raynes</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20AC%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) A.C. 743.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It is not disputed that in the course of working the machine flowers tend to get stuck between the platens ten or twenty time duringthe day. There have been occasions when the defendant witnessed the plaintiff getting at the flowers from the top of the machine.I accept the evidence of the defendant that the plaintiff was warned against so doing. The plaintiff's co-worker, who was the supervisorof the factory, also stated that on several occasions he had to remind the plaintiff to replace tho grilled fencing after it hadbeen removed by the plaintiff. There were also occasions when the supervisor, noticing that the grill had been removed by the plair-tiffwould take it upon himsolf to replace it. Employers in such a case are not expected to keep a constant eye on mature and experiencedworkmen to make sure they do as they are told : <u>Woods v. Durable Suites Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%202%20All%20ER%20391" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953) 2 All ER 391.</a> âBut if he (the employer) does all that is reasonable to ensure that his safety system is operated he will have done all that heis bound to do' : per Lord Reid in General Cleaning Contractors Ltd. v. Christmas  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%202%20All%20ER%201110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953) 2 All ER 1110</a> at 1117. A master is under no legal obligation to dismiss his servant because the latter has shown a propcnsity to disregard hisinstructions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I am unable to infer from the evidence that the defendant failed to provide a safe system of working or that he was heedless of thesafety of his workmen or that there was any element of negligence on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff's claim founded onnegligence, therefore, fails. It follows that the plaintiff's claim founded on Occupiers Liability must also fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The decision I have arrived at would not have been any different had the plaintiff removed the protection grill from the top of themachine and later put his hand in to get at the flowers while the machine was in motion. There was some evidence suggesting thisto be the case. In such a situation there would be a breach of statutory duty since the machine was not effectively guarded whilein motion. In <u>Manwaring v. Billington</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281952%29%202%20All%20ER%20747" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1952) 2 All ER 747</a> the employer gave proper instructions to the plaintiff but the plaintiff disobeyed them and did the work in a way which created abreach of a statutory regulation. Morris, L.J., said at p. 750 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"I would deem it incongrous and irrational if, on the facts as found by the learned judge, the plaintiff could, in effect, successfullysay to his employer : âBecause of my disregard of your reasonable instructions I have brought about the position that you are inbreach of your statutory obligations, and so I claim damages from you because of such breachâ."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The question must be asked: Has the defendant at fault? It has never been necessary for a plaintiff to show that the defendant'sconduct was the whole cause or even the principal cause of the accident. It is enough to show that it made a material contribution.Unless that can be shown no liability arises. In the presont case, I find no fault on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff wasalone to blame for the accident. As he was the sola author of his own wrong, it would be unrcasonable to attribute any liabilityto the defendant even if there was a breach of statutory duty. The plaintiff's claim must be dismissed with costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">           </p>    <table border="0">        <tr>            <td width="274" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>            </td>            <td width="274" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span>(</span>L<span>.J.
