Mr Yim was employed as a construction site worker by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Chan Hong, at a building site at Siu Sai Wan of which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the main contractor.  He was struck on the head by oxy-acetylene cylinders, which fell from a chain sling while theywere being lifted by a crane.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the plaintiff pleads negligence and breach of statutory duty, in particular the common duty of care under the OccupiersâLiability Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap.314</a> and the duty to ensure, so far as reasonably practical, the health and safety of the deceased, under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509" class="autolink_findacts">Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509">Cap.509</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In particular it is pleaded that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant failed to provide a safe system of work for the transportation of the oxy-acetylene cylinders across the site.  It is saidthat the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant caused or permitted the deceased to attach the cylinders to the chain sling but failed to provide specific training orinstruction as to how this could be safely undertaken; failed to instruct, warn and supervise the deceased; failed to provide a cagefor safe transportation of the cylinders, and failed to inspect the cylinders to as to ensure they had been safely attached to thechain sling.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Against the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendant the plaintiff repeats the same allegations and in addition, failure to comply with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59J/s7j.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7J(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59J" class="autolink_findacts">Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Lifting Appliances and Lifting Gear) Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59J">Cap.59J</a>, as well as failure, so far as reasonably practicable, to ensure that premises, access and egress and plant were kept safeand without risks to health, contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509" class="autolink_findacts">Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The defendantsâ defence is that safety training had been provided by both defendants and cages were provided for the transportationof the cylinders.  The deceased himself, during a tea-break and alone, called the crane operator, by âwalkie-talkieâ radio, andinstructed him to transport the cylinders.  The crane operator could not see what was being transported and had to rely on the instructionsgiven by radio.  The deceased rigged the cylinders for lifting by himself, using chain slings instead of a cage, but told the craneoperator that they had been properly rigged in a cage.  He instructed the crane operator to lift the cylinders, but it was laterfound that they had slipped out of the slings.  Accordingly, the accident was caused or contributed to by the deceasedâs own negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Following the accident, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was convicted of an offence contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59/s6a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6A(1)</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59/s6a.html" class="autolink_findacts">6A</a>(2)(a), (b), and (c) and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59/s6a.html" class="autolink_findacts">6A</a>(3) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59" class="autolink_findacts">Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance</a> and the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendant was convicted of an offence contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59J/s7j.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 7J(1)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59J" class="autolink_findacts">Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Lifting Appliances and Lifting Gear) Regulations</a>.  The plaintiff relies on the convictions as evidence of negligence; the defendants say that they are irrelevant.</p>    <p class="heading">Issues on liability</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiffâs case is primarily that no safe system of work was provided by either defendant for the safe transport of the cylindersacross the site.  Ingredients of the safe system would include the provision of a cage and specific instruction on how to move useit to transport the cylinders.  It is the plaintiffâs case that no cage and no specific instruction, training, supervision andso on were provided.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> It is the defendantsâ case that a cage was provided and that the deceased had been given specific instruction on its use.  In otherwords, there was a safe system.  However the deceased, in spite of instructions, undertook the job on his own, used his own systemwith the chain slings and even deceived the crane operator by saying that he was using a cage.  He also got under the load.  Thedefendants say that the accident was caused entirely by the fault of the deceased.  In particular it is said that the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendant should not be liable because it did not know that the deceased was using an unsafe system.

This meansthat the facts on which the conviction is based are taken as proved, unless the contrary is proved.  The facts on which the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs conviction are based are set out in the amended summons and they are that he :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)  failed to provide and maintain a safe system of work in relation to the transportation of an oxy-acetylene gas cutting setthat was, so far as was reasonably practicable, safe and without risks to health,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)  failed to arrange for ensuring, so far as was reasonably practical, safety and absence of risks to health in connection withthe transport of an article, namely the oxy-acetylene gas cutting set, and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  failed to provide information, instruction, training and supervision as was necessary to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable,the health and safety at work of all persons employed by him at the industrial undertaking.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Those facts obviously also come within the cases set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(2)</a> (a), (b) and (c) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509" class="autolink_findacts">Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The facts proved against the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant in the criminal proceedings are the same facts which would give rise to civil liability, i.e. the failure to provide a safesystem of work, including the provision of a cage and specific instruction on its use.

This is relevant to the question of whether the deceased deceived the craneoperator.  The onus lies on the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to prove that.</p>    <p class="heading">Evidence on liability</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> There is, unfortunately, a dearth of direct evidence.  The only witness called by the plaintiff on liability is the OccupationalSafety Officer, Mr Kwok Tik Wai, who made a fatal accident report following the accident.  He relied on what various persons toldhim, but those persons have not been called, and what they told him is hearsay.  No witnesses were called for the defendants.  Transcriptsof the coronerâs inquest and the trial at Eastern Magistracy, which resulted in the convictions mentioned above, are before thecourts, but what the witnesses said there is also hearsay.  Such hearsay is, of course, admissible, but it has to be regarded inthe light of the considerations relevant to the weighing of hearsay evidence set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 49</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap.8</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The defendants have called no witnesses at all.  In effect what they have tried to do is to rely on those parts of the evidence givenbefore the Coroner and the Magistrate, and disbelieved by the latter, to prove those matters which, following the convictions, itis incumbent on them to prove, and to prove negligence on the part of the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> There is, I think, no dispute on the following matters which appear from the report of Mr Kwok.  The deceased had, on the morningof 19 February 2000, been instructed to cut reinforcing bars with an oxy-acetylene cutting set on the 3<sup>rd</sup><sup> </sup>floor podium level of the site.  Later, the site foreman told him to cut some other reinforcing bars about 120 metres away from thatpoint.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> During the afternoon tea break, the deceased set out to transport the oxy-acetylene cutting set from a location near Block 1 of thesite to a location near Block 3 on the same floor level.  The cutting set consisted of two cylinders, of different sizes, with flexibletubes running from the cylinders to the cutting torch.  The deceased himself used lifting gear, consisting of chains with self-lockingshackles, which were wrapped round the cylinders and attached to the hook of a tower crane, which was owned by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and operated by its employee, Mr Tang Chi Man.  The deceased used a radio to call Mr Tang and ask him to move the load. Mr Tang could not see the load from his crane cab.  The deceased directed him by radio to lift and move the load, which had to belifted over some buildings, and then to lower it.  As the load was being lowered, the cylinders became disengaged from the chainsand fell, hitting the deceased on the head and causing fatal injuries to him.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> It is also not in dispute that the correct way to move the cylinders with a tower crane was by putting them in a lifting cage, andattaching the four corners of the cage by chain slings to the crane hook.  A cage, or cages were available on site; they were keptat the machine room which was also the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs office, on the ground floor of the building.  A cage could have been transported from the machine room by using anexcavator and/or by lifting it through an open space in the flooring, using one of the tower cranes, so as to get it to the originalposition of the cylinders.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> It is not clear why the chains were being lowered at the place where the accident happened.  As appears from Mr Kwokâs plan, Appendix1, that place was quite close to the original position of the cylinders and quite far away from the place to which, according tohis information, the cylinders had to be moved.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> It is also not clear what caused the cylinders to come loose.  A photograph taken by Mr Kwok at the scene shows the chains hangingloose from the crane hook.  Mr Kwok says that the spring-operated self-locking shackles would have been forced open during transportation. There is no evidence as to how the chains were wrapped round the cylinders, but from his evidence, and from the photographs, itcan be seen that there is a release button on the shackle.  If the chains were wrapped round the cylinders in such a way that a loopof chain pressed on the release button or buttons, that could have caused the shackles to open.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> In fact, how the cylinders came loose does not matter.  Perhaps a spring shackle opened.  Perhaps the cylinders, if not slung atthe centre of gravity, dropped to one side and slipped out of the looped chains.  That they came loose at all indicates that theywere not adequately secured.</p>    <p class="heading">Was a safe system provided?</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Mr Kwok says in his report that there was no system of work in relation to transportation by tower crane.  No safe rigger procedurewas formulated; and no cage was provided.  There was no system for the crane operator to follow; he was not required to ensure thatthe load was securely fixed, and that there was a competent signaller before commencing the lift.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> He also says that in connection with the transportation by crane, Chan Hong and the foreman, Fung Wai Fung, who was the deceasedâsdirect supervisor, gave verbal instruction and training to the deceased.  However, there was no specific training on the safe liftingoperation, including the slinging method.  There were no written rules and procedures.  In the morning of the day of the accident,Fung had told the deceased to use a metal cage to transport the cutting set.  At the material time, the deceased worked alone.  Therewas no supervision provided to ensure that he did the transportation safely.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Mr Kwok also says that while cages were available at the engine room, when he asked for one to be brought up, it took the workersabout half an hour to bring it.  With regard to the instructions and training given, he says that Chan Hong told him about this;the instructions and training given had been general, non-specific and not directed particularly to lifting.  Mr Kwok, however, wastold that the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendantâs site foreman, Mr Leung, told the deceased in the morning to use a cage to transport the cylinders.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Kwokâs evidence relies on what various workers told him.  Evidence was also given by some workers in the inquest and the criminalproceedings, and the transcripts are before me.  I do not need to go into them in detail.  I am not re-trying the case on the transcripts. The point is that, so far as I can see, various different people could simply call up the crane operator by radio, tell him to movea load, and act as signaller, directing him where to move it.  Although Regulation 7J laid on the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendant a duty to ensure that any load was adequately secured, there was no specifically designated rigger required to do that. Although Regulation 15 requires the provision of a signaller when the crane operator does not have a clear view, there is nothingto indicate how signallers were selected or what training they had; there is only vagueness, such as, for instance, the evidenceof the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendantâs foreman, Mr Leung, at the inquest; he said that he thought the deceased had done a signallerâs course, but did notknow; he assumed that the deceased had been trained because he had a radio; and he did not ask, because the deceased belonged tothe 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The defendants rely on the fact that cages were available at the engine room where the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant had its office.  The deceased knew the cages were there, and he had been told to use one.  Also, it is said that he hadbeen given instructions about the use of cages, at a seminar run by a Ms Wong, and employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, on 26 December 1999.  He had signed an attendance paper, and written guidelines had been handed out.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> There was evidence before the Magistrate that a cage could have been lifted from the ground floor, through one of the voids in thebuilding.  It took, in Mr Kwokâs experience, half an hour to get one to the scene of the accident.  According to the site foreman,Mr Leung, it would have taken 15 minutes.  I do not think that matters.  The point is that a safe system requires more, particularlyin the context of the provision of a heavy piece of equipment, than putting it somewhere where a worker can get it, if he wants to,and telling him to use it.  In fact the learned Magistrate did not accept the evidence of Mr Leung, the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendantâs foreman, that he told the deceased in the morning to use a cage.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> As to the instructions given at the seminar, it is notable that the evidence of this, and the written guidelines on which the defendantsrely only surfaced at the trial.  Mr Kwok was told nothing about them, when he investigated.  The learned Magistrate in his verdictsaid that he rejected the evidence given with regard to the trainings sessions evidenced by the exhibits before him.  Of course itis true that I am not bound by the Magistrateâs findings; but he did convict on the basis, <i>inter alia</i>, of the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendantâs failure to provide information, instruction and training<i>. </i> I have dealt with the onus of proof above.  I have heard nothing from the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant in this trial to discharge that onus, and I do not accept that proper training and instruction was given.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Counsel for the defendants relies on the fact of the deceasedâs having worked for his father in the same trade for some years,before starting with the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant, to indicate that he must have got some training, somewhere along the line, on the moving of oxy-acetylene cutting gearwith a crane.  Also the brother-in-law, Mr Shek, was cross-examined at some length on the deceasedâs propensity to go off and workon his own.  Now maybe the deceased had had some training.  There is evidence that on the day of the accident he was told to usea cage.  But all this does not supply the deficiency in, or indeed the complete lack of any proper system, provided by the employeror the main contractor, for the moving of equipment.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> I accept the evidence of Mr Kwok that there was no system.  Overall, so far as I can see from the evidence before the Coroner andthe Magistrate, as well as Mr Kwokâs investigations, the system was simply to let the individual worker make his own arrangementsfor transporting the cylinders by crane on the site.  I have certainly heard nothing from either defendant, in this trial, to indicatethat there was any other system.  I do not see that letting the worker make his own arrangements can be dignified with the name ofa system; or if it can, it was certainly not a safe system.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> It is argued for the defendants that the deceased was an experienced worker and must have known how to transport the cylinders safely. He decided to transport the cylinders alone, during the tea break, without asking for assistance or informing his superior; he decidednot to use a cage, and in particular he misled the crane operator, telling him that a cage was being used.  Such deliberate actswere out of any reasonable expectation of either defendant, and therefore they should not be liable.  This argument, of course, alsorelies on the existence of a safe system and proper instruction and training, which I have found did not exist.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> As to the evidence of misleading Mr Tang, the crane operator, it seems to me that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, having been convicted under the Regulation, would have to prove this, so as to show that it thought that all necessarysteps had been taken to fulfil its duty.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Mr Tang gave evidence before the Coroner and the Magistrate.  Before the Coroner, he said that the deceased, known as Ho Chai, hadcalled him on the radio and asked him to move a load.  He knew Ho Chai, but not well, and recognised his voice.  He knew that HoChai was a signaller.  He told Ho Chai to direct him, which Ho Chai did; but then the directions stopped and only when he calledanother crane operator was he told that someone was lying on the surface where the load had been moved.  It does not appear fromthe evidence at the inquest that Mr Tang was ever told what load he had to move.  He only asked if it was secure, and Ho Chai toldhim it was.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Before the Magistrate, however, Mr Tang said that the load âseemed to be oxy-acetyleneâ because Ho Chai had told him so.  Hehad asked âShould I lift it with an oxy-acetylene cage?â and Ho Chai had said âyesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Mr Tang has not given evidence before me.  All I have from him is two pieces of inconsistent hearsay.  There is simply insufficientevidence from which I could be satisfied that the deceased misled him.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The defendants also argue that since there is no evidence of the length of the tubes from the cylinders to the cutting torch, thereis no evidence as to whether it was really necessary for the deceased to move the cylinders by using the crane.  I do not think thereis anything in this, because Mr Kwok dismissed the suggestion that the tubes could be as long as the 120 metres which separated thetwo places where the torch had to be used.  Granted that photographs are often not reliable, the tubes shown in the photographs donot appear to be so long.  120 metres is a very great length of tubing, and I would have thought it unlikely that tubes of such lengthwould be used anyway, because it would probably be much easier to move the cylinders than to try to manoeuvre 120 metres of tubingaround and over the obstacles to be found on a building site.  In fact in this instance the obstacle was part of the building, overwhich the cylinders had to be lifted.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> If there had been a safe system of work for transporting the cylinders across the site by means of a crane, the deceased would havebeen able to use it.  But for the lack of a system, there would have been no accident.  It cannot be said that the accident was causedentirely by the fault of the deceased himself.  The defendants cannot escape liability.</p>    <p class="heading">Contributory negligence</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> I accept that cages were available at the engine room, which is where the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs office was, so the deceased must have known that they were available.  I accept that he had been working for his father,in the same field, for some four years before he went to work for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  His brother-in-law, Mr Shek, with whom he previously worked, said that he had seen the deceased move cylinders around,using a handcart welded into a kind of cage.  He had not needed to use a crane when doing that work, but I think it is reasonableto infer that the deceased had some idea that safe transportation of the cylinders by crane would involve using a cage.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> I think that is about as far as the evidence goes, concerning what the deceased knew.  As I have indicated, the learned Magistratedid not accept that Mr Leung the foreman had told the deceased in the morning to use a cage.  Nor did he accept the evidence of instructionsgiven at a safety seminar.  It is true that Mr Tang said, in evidence before the Coroner, that the deceased had previously givensignals to him; but the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendantâs foreman, Mr Fung, said that the deceased had never worked as a signaller, so the evidence on this is contradictory hearsay. I have heard no evidence from either defendant on any of these matters.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> No safe system was provided for the deceased.  He could, perhaps, have set it up himself, by finding a cage, and getting someonewith more experience as a rigger and signaller to help, but he did not.  He was a diligent worker and he elected to do the job himself,in his tea break.  I do not see that the defendants can now hold that diligence against him.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> What the deceased did, however, was inherently somewhat risky.  It does not take much imagination to see that.  Unlike a rope, whichcan be made into a noose which will tighten on the cylinders, the chains will only tighten so far and there is always a risk of slippage;so if one end of a cylinder goes down, it might slip out of the chain.  The load can never be entirely secure.  An ordinary personwith no expertise should be able to foresee that.  Also, he stood underneath the load, which again is a risky thing to do, unlessone knows that the load is securely slung.  So clearly he failed to take the care which a reasonable man should take for his ownsafety and so contributed to the causation of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Where the defendant is charged with the breach of a statutory duty, the standard by which the plaintiffâs contributory negligenceis judged is sometimes less exacting than that used for ordinary negligence.  See <i>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</i>, 18<sup>th</sup> Edition, paragraphs 3-38 where the learned authors quote which passage by Lord Tucker in <i>Staveley Iron &amp; Chemical Co. v. Jones</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%20AC%20627" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] AC 627</a> at 648 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis is not so illogical as may appear at first sight when it is remembered that contributory negligence is not founded on breachof duty, although it generally involves a breach of duty, and that in Factory Act cases the purpose of imposing the absolute obligationis to protect the workmen against those very acts of inattention which are sometimes relied upon as contributory negligence so thattoo strict a standard would defeat the object of the statute.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> This was followed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Li</i><i> Man</i><i> Yuen v.

I also take into account that it washis diligence in carrying out his duties that led him to take the risk.  I assess his contributory negligence at 20%.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The deceased was born on 11 August 1978 and was 21 years old at the date of the accident.  He was employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and earning $600 per day.  It is claimed that he worked for 30 days and earned $18,000 per month.  It is further claimedthat he would have taken an electricianâs course and been promoted in about 2004 to earn $800 per day, or $24,000 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The major issues on quantum are whether the payments made by way of âdeath benefitsâ to the family fall to be deducted from thebereavement claim; what the deceased could have expected to earn in the future, with particular reference to whether or not he wouldhave taken an electricianâs course or been able to go into management; and whether, at the time of his death, he had an outstandingdebt of $180,000, which would have affected both his ability to support his parents and his prospects of accumulation of wealth. There are also issues on the degree of dependency of the parents.</p>    <p class="heading">The claim for bereavement</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> This is a claim under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>.  It is agreed that the plaintiff is entitled to $150,000 under this head.  She says in her witness statement that she has alreadyreceived $75,000 from each defendant as a âdeath benefitâ, so the defendants argue that she should give credit for the total.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Mr Shek gave evidence that there were two payments, one of $70,000 and one of $80,000.  He produces a document dated 23 February2000, signed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, a representative of the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>defendant, and the deceasedâs sister (Mr Shekâs wife) for the family.  It is also signed by representatives of a trade union andan employersâ organisation.  The agreement provides for $70,000 to be paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, which is non-deductible; and for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to pay $20,000 per month for 24 months as living expenses.  This is deductible, and repayable from the âfatal compensationâ;I am told it has been repaid from the employeeâs compensation payment.  There is no documentary evidence regarding the other $80,000. Mr Shek says that it was paid on the day of the agreement, and there was verbal agreement that it too would not be deductible. The $70,000 was included in the written agreement because it was to be paid later.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> I accept that Mr Shekâs explanation is not particularly good.  However, it is not entirely incredible, and there is simply no evidenceto contradict it, so I will accept it.  I find that the whole sum paid is non-deductible and award $150,000 for bereavement.</p>    <p class="heading">The deceasedâs earnings</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> The plaintiff claims that the deceased had enrolled in a course on electrical work, but met with his accident before he attendedany lesson.  If he had completed the course, it is said, he would have been promoted and earned $800 per day.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> According to the plaintiff, the deceased went to work for his father in the latterâs Ngai Yip Engineering Company.  He got to knowShek Yau Tong at work.  Previously he had been a poor student, even at a special school, but under Mr Shekâs influence he becamehard-working and responsible.  In about September 1999, a limited company, Ngai Yip Steel Work Engineering Ltd was set up for thefatherâs business, but no work came in, and that was why the deceased went to work for the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant, who was an old friend of his father.  The 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant, according to the plaintiff, thought that the deceased was a good worker and intended to train him and ultimately, if hegot a licence, put him in charge of a site.  So his future lay in management.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> As to the electricianâs course, this was at an establishment in Morrison Hill.  It does not appear that the deceased had commencedthe course.  After the accident a letter was sent to the deceased to register for the course, but the plaintiff had destroyed theletter because it was useless.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Mr Shekâs evidence was also that the deceased had, in effect, grown up and become responsible and had gained some ambition to betterhimself and get promoted.  According to Mr Shekâs witness statement, the deceased had enrolled in a programme offered by the VocationalTraining Council at Aberdeen.  However, in oral evidence Mr Shek said that he had meant to say that he had encouraged the deceasedto do this.  Perhaps he had made a mistake.  Later, the plaintiff had told him that the application was to the Morrison Hill establishment. He denied changing his evidence to suit.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Counsel for the defendants argues that Mr Shekâs evidence is incredible because he changed it.  It is also said that the defendantsâsolicitors had asked for documentary proof of the application, which was never forthcoming; and it should have been easy enough tofind out the establishment concerned, and obtain confirmation from it.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> It is also noted that, even if the deceased had completed the course, it is unlikely that the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant would have kept him on and promoted him.  In fact the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant suffered a stroke in 1999, and later closed his business and retired.  Although the plaintiff understood that the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant would have put the deceased in charge of a site, she agreed that she knew that the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant was to retire.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The evidence about the proposed course is rather sketchy.  The plaintiff herself seemed believable enough, and Mr Shek could havemade a mistake.  I accept that the deceased had put his name down for a course, but he had not yet started it.  If he had finishedthe course successfully, it is unlikely that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would have continued to employ him in any event.  However, he would probably have found work as an electrician elsewhere. The Government statistics in the trial bundle show a figure of around $750 per day for electricians by the middle of 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> If the deceased had not obtained an electricianâs licence, he could have carried on with the work he was doing, which, althoughhe is said to have been a mechanic, was metalwork.  By the middle of 2004 such workers earned about $850 per day.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> As to whether the deceased would have gone into management, this too seems to be conjectural.  If the new limited company which thefather had set up was not getting any business, there would be nothing there to manage, and even if the 1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant had been well-disposed to the deceased, once his business finished, the deceased would have had to seek employment elsewhere. He had no qualifications, so it is unlikely that he would have been able find a management post.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> It seems likely, therefore, that if the deceased had lived, he would have qualified and found work as an electrician, or gone onworking as a metalworker.  Either way, by the date of trial he would have been earning about $800 per day.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> A further problem is that, as Mr Wong points out, the construction industry was depressed after 1997 and only started to recoverin about 2004.  It is suggested that the estimate of 30 days worked each month is unrealistic, for this reason.  Counsel refers tothe case of <i>Lai Kwan</i><i> Ming v</i><i>. Lee</i><i> Ying</i><i> Hing t/a King Yip Co. &amp; Anor</i>, HCPI 765 of 2000, where the court accepted 22 days per month as a reasonable estimate for a carpenterâs work.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs own list of earnings shows that the deceased worked 30 days and earned $18,000 in January 2000, which was the onlyfull month he worked.  The Form 2 shows this as the monthly earnings.  This was in the middle of the economic downturn.  There isno evidence from the defendants that conditions got any worse.  In the circumstances I will take it that the deceased would havebeen able to continue to work for 30 days per month.  By the date of trial he would have been earning $24,000 per month.  The medianfigure between the date of death and the date of trial would therefore be $21,000 per month.</p>    <p class="heading">The loan of $180,000</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> This arises from the social investigation report of Ms Wong Yin Ha dated 28 September 2001 in which she says that the plaintiff received$270,000 from the deceasedâs insurance compensation, but it was mainly used to cover âthe debt of the deceased of $180,000â.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> This was not covered in any witness statement of the plaintiff.  Her oral evidence was that the debt was not owed by the deceasedbut by his father, Mr Yim, who had borrowed the money from her sister-in-law, Ms Ko Yuk Ha, to pay off creditors of his business. Ms Ko was called and she confirmed this.  But the social work assistant, Ms Wong, was also called, and she confirmed that she hadbeen told that it was the deceasedâs debt.  In cross-examination, she said that the plaintiff told her that, from the insurancepayment, $180,000 had been used to pay a debt owed by the deceased, and the rest had been used to pay Mr Yimâs business debts.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Mr Wong, counsel for the defendants, strongly attacks the truthfulness of both the plaintiff and Ms Ko.  In brief the argument isthat Mr Yim had plenty of money, and did not like to be in debt, so he would not have borrowed in any event.  Ms Ko, on the otherhand, admitted to losing money in her business.  She was heavily overdrawn.  She would not have lent from her overdraft account. If she did, there was no evidence that the overdraft was covered by her fixed deposit; and so on.  It is also said that Ms Ko wasinconsistent as between her statement and her oral evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> This is all very well, but it does not necessarily follow that a person who has money will not borrow from a relative to cover cashflow, which is how the plaintiff explained it; nor does it follow that someone who is overdrawn by $2 million will not overdraw another$180,000 to help a relative.  Overall I did not get the impression that the plaintiff or Madam Ko were evasive or otherwise suspect. They were giving evidence on matters which happened long ago, and in the plaintiffâs case, matters which did not affect her directly;a lot of them affected her husband rather than herself.  Some uncertainty and inconsistency is to be expected.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> At the same time, Ms Wong gave the impression of being an honest and independent witness.  It is difficult to see how she could havebeen mistaken as to whether the debt was owed by the deceased (Ngai Ho) or the company (Ngai Yip).  Further, she says that she explainedher report to the plaintiff, who did most of the talking at the interviews, and the plaintiff did not correct anything.  However,Ms Wong was also giving evidence of matters which happened long ago, and on a point she did not inquire into because she thoughtit was unimportant.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The problem with this allegation of a debt is that Ms Wongâs report of what the plaintiff told her is hearsay, relied on by thedefendants to prove the truth of what was said.  Of course hearsay is admissible in civil proceedings subject to considerations ofits weight.  The plaintiff denies either saying what is reported as hearsay, or the truth of what is reported.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> If the plaintiff is disbelieved, and I find that she did tell Ms Wong that her son owed $180,000, there will still be a questionmark over the truth of what was said.  But the matter does not end there; the plaintiff does not have to prove her case beyond reasonabledoubt, i.e. to negative the reasonable possibility that the deceased owed a lot of money.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> Of course if the plaintiff untruthfully denies saying the words, that suggests that the words must have been true, otherwise shewould not deny saying them.  At the same time, however, this is hearsay evidence and in estimating the weight to be given to it,I must have regard to circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the reliability or otherwise of the evidence. See <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 49</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap.8</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> There is no extrinsic evidence or admission that the deceased either owed money, or lived in such a way as to indicate that he mighthave borrowed or needed to borrow money.  Mr Shek said he did not know of any debts.  So did his wife, the deceasedâs sister, atthe inquest.  All the plaintiffâs evidence and that of Mr Shek went to show that the deceased was a young man who lived quietlywith his family and had no particular outside interests.  He used to go home and watch video recordings with his family.  The biggestexpense we know about is his gift of a watch worth $15,000 to his sister.  None of this evidence was challenged and there is no reasonto disbelieve it.  All this suggests that there was no reason for the plaintiff to tell Ms Wong that the deceased owed money, andthat Ms Wong could be mistaken on this point.  Alternatively, I note that, according to Ms Wong, both the plaintiff and her husbandwere âvery sadâ, as they would have been.  This also raises the possibility of confusion on the part of her informants, if theywere in a depressed emotional state.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Ultimately, the issue is whether the deceased was heavily in debt, so as to affect his ability to contribute to the family incomeand to save money for his own accumulation of wealth.  On the evidence as a whole, it seems most unlikely that he was.  The onlyindicator of debt is the denied hearsay that there was a debt, when there seems to have been no reason for the debt to exist.  Iaccept the evidence of the plaintiffâs witnesses that the deceased was not heavily in debt.</p>    <p class="heading">Pre-trial dependency</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> I have adopted, above, a median income figure of $21,000.  At the time of death the deceased was contributing two-third of his income. I will take the median contribution as being the same percentage, i.e. $14,000.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The deceased lived with his parents.  The total household expenditure was about $32,650; this is the figure appearing in the originalStatement of Damages, and confirmed by the plaintiff in cross-examination.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> The plaintiffâs dependency claim as set out by Ms Leong in her written opening was based on a net contribution which took intoaccount some of the household expenses as being referable to the deceasedâs own upkeep, but not al of them.  For instance, themortgage payments of $15,000 were not included.  Counsel relied on the judgment of Seagroatt J in <i>Tsang</i><i> Me</i><i> Ying v. Lam</i><i> Pak</i><i> Chiu</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%203%20HKC%2059" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 3 HKC 59</a> as authority for this approach.  I do not quite understand this, because in the course of his exposition of the âprinciples inrelation to assessment of dependencyâ Seagroatt J said that many items of dependency were common to the family, and that examplesof these were rent, utilities and other fixed payments.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> It seems that the mortgage payments must have been in part for the benefit of the deceased, for he lived with his parents, and theplaintiff said that they were a traditional family and would have gone on living together even if he had later married.  The samewould apply to the utility charges.  He ate at home so would have shared in the benefit of the food bills.  I have some difficultywith understanding why clothing should be a common item, because one would expect a young man to buy his own clothes, and the samegoes for medical expenses, family savings and âother expensesâ.  I will therefore take it that, of the items listed, the firstseven, which amount to $23,050 per month, should be regarded as common.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Taking a mean contribution of $12,000, minus one-third of $23,050, i.e. $7,683, this would mean that the parents were dependent onthe deceased at the time of his death for $4,317 which is 24% of his income.  Applying this to the mean income of $21,000 producesa figure of $5,760 which falls to be divided equally, so that the multiplicand for each parent is $2,880.  Mr Yip, the father, diedin February 2004, i.e. after 33 months.  The trial took place in January 2006, after 56 months.  The pre-trial dependency figuresare therefore :</p>    <blockquote>    <table border="0" width="60%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">The father: $2,880 x 33 =            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">$95,040            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">The plaintiff: $2,880 x 56 =            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><u>$161,280</u>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">Total :            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">$256,320            </td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Post-trial dependency</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> But for the accident, the deceased would now be 27 years old.  The plaintiff is now 56 years old.  The plaintiff pleads in the RevisedStatement of Damages that the deceased would probably have married by about 2010 and would then give her less support.  Calculationsare made up to 2020.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> Now the plaintiff is seeking a multiplier of 12, following on <i>Kong Yuk King v. Wong Yiu Wing</i>, HCPI 713 of 1998 where this was allowed for the father of the deceased, aged 50 at the time of the accident.  At the time of theaccident, the plaintiff herself was aged 50.  The defendant argues for a post-trial multiplier of 6, which amounts to the same thingand that is what I will apply.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> I will take the deceasedâs notional earnings at the date of trial as $24,000 per month.  The plaintiffâs dependency would probablyhave increased on the death of her husband.  She never worked and the deceased would have had to support her.  The rent and utilitybills would have remained the same; the food would be less.  I will apply a multiplicand of $5,000 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> The plaintiff pleads that the deceased would have married in about 2010, at which time her dependency would decrease to a figureof about $1,500 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> The figure for 2006-2010 will therefore be $5,000 x 4 x 12 = $240,000 and the figure for the remaining two years will be $1,500 x2 x 12 = $36,000.  The post-trial dependency figure is therefore $276,000.</p>    <p class="heading">LARCO â Loss of Accumulation of Wealth</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The plaintiff needs to show a pattern of savings from which may be inferred a likelihood of future savings, or, if there is no patternof savings, a probability of future accumulation of wealth.  See <i>Kwan Lai Kuen v. National Insurance Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20HKC%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 HKC 98.</a>  There is no evidence that the deceased had any pattern of savings.  Establishing such a pattern is not a pre-condition of makingan award.  See <i>Lam Pak</i><i> Chiu &amp; Anor v. Tsang</i><i> Mei</i><i> Ying &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKC 1 (CFA).</a>  However, I have not accepted that he was in debt.  The evidence is that he lived quietly.  It seems likely therefore that he couldhave saved some of what remained to him after contributing to the family.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> The plaintiff pleaded in the Statement of Damages that the deceased could have saved $4,000 per month from the $6,000 which remainedafter contributing.  That seems optimistic.  In the Revised Statement this goes down to a figure of $2,500 from $7,000 remaining. In fact, in the first year, he would have been earning $18,000 and keeping $6,000 and there would have been no MPF contribution;the scheme commenced in December 2000.  I will allow a figure for the first year of $2,500 x 12 = $30,000.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> From December 2000 to the date of trial i.e. 62 months, the calculations must be based on the mean figure of $21,000 arrived at above. I do not see why the deceased could not have saved $2,500 as well as paying his MPF contributions which would have been $1,000. So for this period I will allow for savings of $2,500 x 62 = $155,000.  In addition the deceased would have to be credited withhis own and his employerâs MPF contributions of $1,000 per month each, i.e. $62,000 x 2 = $124,000.  So the total accumulated wealthpre-trial would be $279,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Post-trial loss of accumulation of wealth</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> By this time the plaintiff would have been earning say $24,000 per month.  His savings should have increased in proportion to about$3,300 per month.  He was 21 at the date of the accident.  The plaintiffâs calculations are based on a post-accident multiplierof 20.  The defendants accept that a post-trial multiplier of 16, which is actually greater, would be reasonable, and I will adoptthat figure.  The savings figure would therefore be $3,300 x 16 x 12 = $663,600.  The MPF figure for the same period would be $1,000per month for the deceased and the employer, i.e. $384,000.  The total savings figure is therefore $1,047,000.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> The defendants refer to the courtâs duty under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20(2)(b)(iii)</a> of the LARCO to make such deduction as is considered just on account of accumulation of wealth and in order to avoid over-compensation. Reference is made to the cases of <i>Chow Ling Hung &amp; Anor v. Lui Suet</i><i> Hing &amp; Ors</i>, HCPI 332 of 1997, and <i>Yu Shuk Ying &amp; Anor v. Proficiency Industrial Products Ltd &amp; Ors</i>, HCPI 1019 of 1997.  In both cases a discount of 50% was applied.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> In calculating the award the court is concerned with what would have passed to the deceasedâs estate at the end of his notionalfull life.  The calculation has to take into account the possibility of diminution of savings by their being spent in retirementand so on.  See <i>Lam Pak Chiu</i>, above.  This deceased was only 21.  He probably had a life expectancy in excess of fifty more years, and a working life expectancyof 45 years if 65 continues to be regarded as the normal retirement age.  The multiplier already takes into account the normal risksand uncertainties of life, and acceleration of receipt.  I do not see that any further discount is appropriate here.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> I will therefore allow a total figure for loss of accumulation of wealth of $279,000 + $1,047,000 = $1,605,000.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of service</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> The plaintiffâs claim is for $2,000 per year for 20 years for do-it-yourself work which the deceased would have performed.  Itis suggested that this claim is not genuine because it was not included in the first witness statement.  Also, it is said, the plaintiffaccepted that she did not have such expenses any more because her daughter, with whom she now lives, pays for them.  Of course thatis irrelevant.  If she had been in her own house, with her son, he would naturally have fixed the leaking taps and the like.  I willallow the figure of $24,000 claimed.</p>    <p class="heading">Funeral expenses</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> The claim is for $165,281.  Ms Leong in opening adopted a figure of $150,000 which is what the defendants accept.  However thereis in the bundle a schedule of receipts for a total figure of $165,281 and that is what I will allow.</p>    <p class="heading">Summary of Awards</p>    <table border="0" width="70%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> Loss of dependency â father</p>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p style="text-transform: uppercase;text-align:right">$95,040</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Loss of dependency â plaintiff (pre-trial)</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>$161,280</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Loss of dependency â plaintiff (post-trial)</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>$276,000</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Loss of accumulation of wealth</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>$1,605,000</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Loss of Service</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>$24,000</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Funeral expenses</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>          $165,281</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Bereavement</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>$150,000</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Sub-total</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>$2,476,601</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Less 20% for contributory negligence</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>-$495,320</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p><sup><span>                              _________________</span></sup></p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Sub-total</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p style="text-transform: uppercase;text-align:right"><span>$1,981,281</span></p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Less EC payment</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>-$1,655,332</p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left"></td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p><sup><span>                              _________________</span></sup></p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="40%" valign="top" align="left">                <blockquote>                    <p>Grand total</p>                </blockquote>            </td>            <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right">                <p>$325,949</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>There will accordingly be judgment in favour of the plaintiff for $325,949.</p>    <p class="heading">Interest</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> This would normally be awarded at half the judgment rate on the awards for pre-trial loss of dependency and funeral expenses fromthe date of the Writ, but since the EC award was made on 30 April 2002, which is earlier, no award is appropriate.  As to the awardfor bereavement, Mr Wong says that interest should be 2%.  However in <i>Kwan</i><i> Lai</i><i> Kuen</i>, above, Keith J considered the law and awarded interest on the award for bereavement at the prevailing rate of interest payable onsuitorsâ funds from the date of the deceasedâs death.  I will make the same award of interest here.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> The costs of the action are awarded (<i>nisi</i>) to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed.
