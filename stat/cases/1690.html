In 1997 it bought the car from the 1st defendant ("Italian Motors")for $2,100,000.00 and took delivery of it in 1998. The car was used for personal transport by the plaintiff's director Mr Hui YuShing ("Mr Hui"), and from time to time it was returned to Italian Motors for maintenance and repairs.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The accident happened on one such occasion while the car was in Italian Motors' custody, and being driven on a road test by an employee,Mr Ho Kwok Wai ("Mr Ho"). He was driving back to Italian Motors' garage in Sun Wong Toi Road, when, just before he reached it, thecar came into collision with the truck, and was quite badly damaged on the front nearside.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff originally claimed against both defendants for repairs, loss of use, diminution in value and other losses. In factItalian Motors repaired the car, which was off the road until July 2000, and did not charge the plaintiff for it. Subsequently inApril 2001, the plaintiff traded in the car to Italian Motors for a new Ferrari, at an agreed trade-in price of $1,200,000.00 andthey also gave him a discount of $350,000.00 against the price of the new car. Now the plaintiff has amended his claim so as to claimonly for loss of use amounting to $648,000.00 and loss of no claims bonus amounting to $15,600.00. However Italian Motors is seekingto pass on to Mr Ma all the losses, including the repair costs and diminution in value and the sums claimed by the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The issues here are, in the first place, whether the accident came about through the negligence of Mr Ho or Mr Ma, or both of themand if so their percentage contribution. There is also an issue as to whether Italian Motors is not liable to the plaintiff, by reasonof a disclaimer clause in its repair and maintenance contract. So far as quantum is concerned, there is a dispute as to whether theplaintiff through Mr Hui hired another car at all, for the period of loss of use, and, if he did, whether the amount he says he paid,i.e. $3,000.00 per day is reasonable. There are also issues as to the cost of repairs and the loss of value and generally how muchof its losses Italian Motors can pass on to Mr Ma.</p>    <p class="heading">The accident</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Sun Wong Toi Road runs east and west along the southern perimeter fence of the old Kai Tak Airport. Italian Motors' premises areat building no.90 on the south side. For most of its length the road is a four-lane two-way road, but it divides somewhere near buildingnos.70-78 at which point the west-bound traffic goes straight ahead towards the junction with Kowloon City Road, while the east-boundtraffic comes in, around a series of bends culminating in a gentle left-hand bend, from Olympic Avenue. Just to the east of wherethe road division ends and two-way traffic begins, there is on the north side a gate through the old airport perimeter fence leadingto a scrap metal yard within the fence.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> At about 9.35 a.m. on 29 October 1999, Mr Ma was driving the truck westwards in the outer lane when at a position near building nos.70-78,the truck turned across the east-bound carriageway. Mr Ho was driving the car in the eastwards in the outer lane and had just comeout of the final bend. The front nearside of the car came into collision with the rear offside of the truck. The truck ended up onthe northern walkway with its front diagonally into the scrap yard gateway. The car ended up in the inner lane with its front diagonallytowards the northern walkway.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The only evidence comes from Mr Ho and Mr Ma. Mr Ho adopted a witness statement as his evidence-in-chief. He says that he was drivingthe car to check the performance of the clutch. At about 9:35 a.m., he was driving the vehicle from the old airport to the ItalianMotors' garage. He was driving eastwards in the outer lane at 45 kilometres per hour in second gear. The weather was good and theroad surface dry. The brakes were in good condition. The traffic was light. As he drove towards the building at nos.70-78 Sun WongToi Road, he saw the truck on the outer lane of the opposite carriageway about four car lengths away. When the truck was three carlengths away, it suddenly made a right-turn across the double white lines and across his path without making any signal. He turnedto the left, applied the brakes and sounded the horn but was unable to avoid a collision. In oral evidence, Mr Ho said that he thoughtthat the truck was travelling at 60 or 70 kilometres per hour. He was travelling at 45 kilometres per hour, partly because he hadto negotiate the series of bends from Olympic Avenue and partly because he was familiar with the road, and knew there was a junctionout of which lorries might drive, i.e. the scrapyard gate. He was also about 50 metres from his destination. Also he was not allowedby his employer to drive at excessive speed.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Mr. Ho said that when he was three car spaces away, he saw the truck make a right-turn without signalling and as far as he couldsee, the truck was trying to turn into the scrap yard gate. He could not stop in time and so collided with it. After collision, hiscar was pushed into a broadside position and it was pushed forward about five feet.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> It is the evidence of Mr Ma that he was avoiding a pedestrian. Mr Ho's evidence is that he did not see any pedestrian, and if hehad, he would also have had to take evasive action.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Mr Ho had given two statements to the police. In the first one what he said agreed more or less with his evidence. In his secondone, he volunteered to the police that he had seen a scrap metal on the back of the truck after the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Mr Ho was cross-examined at length, mainly about what he meant by car spaces or lengths and the perceived differences between whatappeared in his statement and what appeared in his evidence. I do not think that anything particularly significant came out in cross-examination.It must be remembered that any estimate of speed, distance and so on is bound to be only an estimate and if often inaccurate . Undercross-examination by the counsel for the plaintiff, it was suggested to him that he had been driving too fast, and had gone out ofcontrol; and further that because there were no skid marks he had failed to brake. He maintained that he had not been speeding andexplained the lack of skid marks by the car's advanced braking system which does not permit the brakes to lock up. He confirmed theexistence of a notice within the office of Italian Motors setting out the terms and conditions of repair, and I will come back tothis later on. Re-examined, he said that he did not expect lorries to turn right into the scrap yard from Sun Wong Toi Road becausehe had some time seen police officers stop lorry drivers at that position. There was in fact no road sign to prevent vehicles frommaking a right-turn into the scrap yard gate.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Ma also adopted a written statement as evidence-in-chief. According to the statement, when he was driving the truck westwardsnear building nos.70-78, there was a man rushing out from the right front of the vehicle to cross the road. In order to avoid knockingthe man down, and seeing that there was no vehicle on his right, he turned the vehicle to the right and braked immediately. The truckthen crossed the opposite lanes and stopped on the pavement. When he stopped he heard a bang from his left side and felt a collisionat the rear. He alighted and found the car had collided with the left rear wheel of the truck.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Ma's oral evidence-in-chief was that he was driving his truck to Tseung Kwan O with waste materials which consisted of refuseand plastic oil containers. He was not heading for the scrap yard. The pedestrian rushed out from his right side to the double whiteline and stood still there. When he saw that, he decelerated so that the pedestrian could cross the road, and swerved into the oppositelane. When the pedestrian saw that the truck had decelerated he then ran across the road. While the truck was swerving, there wasno car coming the other way.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> He said that when the collision took place, the truck had already crossed the outer east-bound lane. The front of his lorry had alreadyentered the gate and the rear was sticking out about three feet into the inner lane. When he saw the car, it was travelling in azigzag manner.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Cross-examined by counsel for the 1st defendant, Mr Ma estimated the distance from the pedestrian, when he first saw him, at about20 feet, or about the distance from where he sat in the witness box and the far wall of the court. In fact that distance would beabout 30 or 35 feet. The man ran to the double white line and he decelerated, and when he did the man ran across in front of him.He swerved to the right; he did not dare to swerve to the left. His speed before he started decelerating was between 40 and 50 onthe speedometer, which he thinks reads in kilometres rather than miles.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> As to the collision itself, Mr Ma said that when it happened, his truck was still moving. He then said that he was stationary, inthe scrap yard entrance and about three feet of the rear of the lorry was sticking out into the slow lane. The collision happenedafter the lorry had come to a stop. He confirmed that when he first saw the car, it was in the fast lane with its front-end zigzagging.He could see the car moving both ways. He thought it was caused by the driver braking. He had not told the police about this. Inany event, according to him, the collision happened when the rear of the truck and the front of the car were both in the inner laneeast-bound. He also said that when he first saw the car it was travelling at a very high speed "like a speed boat". He said thathis wheel was distorted by the impact.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Cross-examined by counsel for the plaintiff, he said that when he saw the pedestrian crossing in front of him, he saw no trafficcoming in the east-bound lane. He saw the car when he had crossed to the middle of the east-bound lanes. At this point, he estimatedthe distance between the car and the truck at a little more than the length of the court room which I estimate at about 60 feet.His foot was still on the accelerator at that point. He saw the car zigzagging when his truck had already almost reached the scrapyard gate. However by the time he heard the bang of the impact, the truck had stopped.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In a statement to the police, Mr Ma had said that when he saw the man ran out from his right-hand side, he was half a car lengthaway. Under cross-examination, he said that he could not remember if he had said that to the police. He could remember some things,but other things he could not.</p>    <p class="heading">Evaluation</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The obvious inference from the path taken by the truck is that it was making a right-turn from the west-bound carriageway into thescrap yard gate. In effect this is what Mr Ho says he saw; the truck made a sudden right turn across his path and towards the gate,without indicating. Mr Ho also says that he saw scrap metal on the back of the truck. He volunteered this information to the policein a second statement which may suggest that it is self-serving; but on the other hand it is something the police could easily havechecked and therefore it could be awkward for him to tell the police that, if it was not true.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Mr Ma says that he was not going to the scrap yard and there was no scrap metal on the truck; he was taking assorted scrap, includingplastic oil containers, to a landfill site at Tseung Kwan O. He says that the agreed photographs show this, but they are not of goodquality, and they do not help very much. However, even if Mr Ma was not delivering scrap metal to the scrap yard, it is not impossiblethat he was turning into the scrap yard in order to collect some other kind of refuse.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> What is important is his story of the pedestrian who suddenly rushed in front of the truck. Of course this is not an unusual situation,and it is true that Mr Ma told the story at an early stage. However, the evidence is full of inconsistencies and improbabilities.So far as inconsistencies go, in the first place, we have the discrepancy between the statement to the police that the pedestriancrossed half a car length away, and the evidence that he crossed something like 30 or 35 feet away. Then we have the evidence ofhaving seen the car "zig-zagging" which had never been mentioned before. And in the police statement, there is mention of the carbeing in the 2nd lane; but in evidence it moves into the 1st lane, and the impact takes place there, when the truck is stationary.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> There are also the improbable aspects. In the first place, if a pedestrian suddenly appears, rushing across the road, the driver'sinstinct is primarily to brake hard. There may or may not be a swerve either way, depending on where the pedestrian is, the spaceavailable and the other traffic; but the first priority is to brake. Yet according to Mr Ma, he did not brake; when body of yourlorry was on the eastbound his right foot was still on the accelerator though he was decelerating. Further, while according to himthe pedestrian was crossing from his right to his left, so that one would only expect a fairly slight swerve to be necessary, hemanaged to swerve right across the two lanes of the eastbound carriageway and into the scrap yard gateway.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is also difficult to accept Mr Ma's evidence that when he started the swerve, the oncoming lanes were clear. The road plan showsthat the curve of the eastbound carriageway is quite a gentle one and the photographs of the vehicles taken towards the bend fromthe northern kerbside show visibility for a good distance into the bend. The view would be even further, from the outer westboundcarriageway. Of course Mr Ma says that the car was going fast, but this is the sort of situation where, for it not to be within thevisible area when the manoeuvre is started, the oncoming vehicle would have to be travelling very fast indeed. The more likely scenariois that he did not see the car coming, because he was not keeping a proper lookout.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Finally, of course, there is the fact that Mr Ho says, and has said consistently throughout to the police and in evidence, that henever saw any pedestrian. He saw the truck turn right across his path. He could not have failed to see the pedestrian, if there wasone, because the pedestrian would have been well within his cone of vision. If he had seen a pedestrian there would be no reasonfor him to deny it, because the pedestrian's actions would tend to exonerate him, as they would tend to exonerate Mr Ma.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Having considered the evidence of the two drivers, I find that I do not believe Mr Ma's story of that he manoeuvred to avoid a pedestrian.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> It is more probable than not that he turned into the scrap yard gate without signalling and without keeping a proper lookout foroncoming traffic. I find that he drove negligently and so caused or contributed to the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> I turn to the question of Mr Ho's negligence. The argument is that he must have been speeding. Mr Ma describes the car as travelling"like a speedboat", but a vehicle always seems to be going fast when it suddenly comes into view especially if it is coming out ofa bend, and in any event I do not think that Mr Ma's evidence can be relied on, if, as it appears, he has made up the story of thepedestrian. The point of impact is relied on, as is the extensive damage to the car; but it is difficult to infer much from damagewithout expert evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Mr Ho says that he was travelling at 45 k.p.h. i.e. within the general speed limit of 50 k.p.h.; but then so does Mr Ma, and probablyso do most drivers involved in collisions, whether it is true or not. Much is made of the fact that he did not tell the police, butdid tell the court that his car was pushed by the impact; but I think one can tell, from the pictures of the damage to the car, thatthe impact must have been at an acute angle and if the truck was moving at the point of impact, as it must have been, the car wouldbe pushed sideways. Certainly it ended up at quite a sharp angle to the line of travel. There is no reason to believe that Mr Holost control; the car is a very sophisticated one and I accept his evidence that it had an advanced braking system, which would tendto prevent skidding. Also while the car is a very powerful one, and one of which a driver unused to driving it might easily losecontrol, Mr Ho has been working for Italian Motors and driving cars of this sort for many years.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> He says that the truck turned when he was three car spaces away. There seems to be some suggestion that he meant lorry spaces, orlorry parking spaces; he said that at one point in cross-examination, but I asked him what he meant and he said that he meant carparking meter spaces. This was quite consistent with what he had said earlier and in his statements. While such estimates are notoriouslyinexact this would give a distance of about 15 metres, or 50 feet. He agreed that he could brake to a standstill from 45 k.p.h. inless than 20 metres and I expect that the braking time (excluding the thinking time) would be rather less than that. So there isat least a suspicion that he was going somewhat faster than he says, but I do not see that there is more than that. There is I thinkinsufficient evidence to establish on the balance of probabilities that Mr Ho was driving too fast, and certainly none that he failedto keep a proper lookout, or was otherwise negligent as particularised in the pleadings. I conclude that Mr Ho was not negligent,and that the accident was caused entirely by the negligence of Mr Ma on whom 100% liability must rest.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Since I have found Mr Ma 100% liable in tort it will not be necessary to go into the question of Italian Motors' liability in contractor as bailee for reward. Either way, their duty would be to take reasonable care of the vehicle. It was reasonable enough for themto have it test driven by their employee. They would only be liable if he did not take reasonable care. On my findings, he did. SoI do not need to consider the question of the exemption clause relied on by Italian Motors; though I would think that in the normalway, since it purports to exempt Italian Motors from liability "unless some deliberate act of damage or negligence on the part ofone or more of the Company's employees is proved" it would not have exempted them from liability, if he had driven negligently.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The plaintiff originally claimed :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%">Cost of repairs</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">$573,125.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%">Motor Survey Fees</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">$920.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%">(3)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%">Diminution in Value</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">$500,000.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%">(4)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%">Loss of use</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">$648,000.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%">(5)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%">Loss of no claim bonus</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">$15,600.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%">(6)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%">Insurance for period 29/10/1999 to 26/4/2000</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">$10,730.15</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%">(7)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%">License fee for period from 29/10/2000</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"><u>$3,785.34</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="7%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%">Total</td>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="25%">$1,752,160.49</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Now the plaintiff has amended so as to delete all claims save for loss of use and loss of no claim bonus. However the 1st defendantby its Third Party Notice claims the full amount from the 2nd defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The plaintiff's claim for loss of use is for the hiring charges for the period from 1 December 1999 to 3 July 2000 of what is describedas a Mercedes-Benz SL 600 car. Mr Hui says that this car was hired from one Gorth Properties Ltd ("Gorth") at $2,500.00 per day plus$500.00 per day for insurance. In support of this the plaintiff relies on a hiring contract, a series of receipts which bear to beissued by Gorth, and a series of cheques drawn by the plaintiff in favour of that company.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The other parties question whether the plaintiff did in fact hire a replacement vehicle. It is the evidence of Mr Adamczyk, the managingdirector of Italian Motors, that Mr Hui was offered a replacement vehicle but said that he did not need it because he had many cars.In fact it appears that Mr Hui has at home three other cars, one for his son, one for his daughter and a larger one for the familyto use together. In cross-examination he said that he did not use the latter simply because he did not like using it; if he had,he would not have bought the Ferrari. Mr Ip, the service manager of Italian Motors says that Mr Hui asked what replacement cars thecompany had, and was told that there were no Ferrari cars, so the matter was left there. Mr Hui himself says that it was suggestedthat he take a much older car, but he did not want it, and then the offer was withdrawn. In fact the plaintiff through solicitorsdemanded a replacement vehicle on 24 November 1999 but it was never provided. Mr Adamczyk says that this was because the originaloffer was refused.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> There are some difficulties with the plaintiff's evidence of the hire. Gorth is not a car hire company; it is a business contactof the plaintiff. The hire is not at arm's length. On my suggestion, the registration document was obtained. It shows the vehicleto be a Mercedes Benz SL 500, manufactured in 1992 and not 1996 or 1997 as Mr Hui said. One may see from the newspaper advertisementsthat currently seven-year-old Mercedes Benz SL models are offered for sale at less than $200,000.00. Indeed as counsel has pointedout the price of a new Mercedes or BMW car would not be too different from the total claimed. Mr Adamczyk has found out that theAvis car hire company is currently offering its top model, a Mercedes E 240, for hire at about $22,000.00 per month. On any sensiblereckoning, the hire charge of $2,500.00 per day for an old car seems excessive. Further, the cost of insurance at $500.00 per dayalso appears very high. Some arrangement would have been necessary to extend Gorth's insurance policy to cover Mr Hui's use of thecar and some kind of document would have had to be issued by the insurer. None has been produced.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I would also add that while copies of cheques have been produced, although their dates are far apart their numbers are sequential.Mr Hui says that they came from a cheque book specially used for the purpose of providing this evidence. That may be so, but it isto be noted that the cheques bear no bank chops to suggest that they have been presented. Mr Hui says that they were photocopiedbefore being sent to Gorth but curiously enough the copies are not of each individual cheque; several appear together on the onesheet.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Miss Lo, counsel for Italian Motors, argues that Gorth documents are admissible under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap.8</a>, but that under subsection (5) I should direct that the provisions of that section do not apply. She gives various cogentreasons namely that the plaintiff has not called any of the persons in Gorth's or the plaintiff's staff responsible for enteringinto the hiring agreement; the discrepancy over the age of the car; the fact that the receipts show one cheque number, for two differentamounts received on two different dates; the final receipt, for three days hire, is for $93,000.00 when it should be for $9,000.00;and if the documents were admitted under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 54</a>, then they would prove themselves and the considerations relevant to the weighing of hearsay evidence in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 49</a> would not apply. I think this is right. I think these documents are highly questionable. The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 49</a> criteria need to be applied to them, and applying those criteria it seems to me that they are to be given little or no weight.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> A plaintiff must prove the fact and the amount of damage before he can recover substantial damages. If he proves liability but doesnot prove the fact and the amount of damage, at best he will recover nominal damages. See <em>McGregor on Damages</em>, 16th Ed., Â§2051. It is unlikely that anyone would have to pay so much to hire an old car, so either an old car was hired at aninflated price or the whole thing was a fiction. Either way, it seems to me that this whole story of the hire of a replacement vehicleis a dishonest attempt to exaggerate the plaintiff's claim. This, coupled with the flaws in the evidence and other matters alreadymentioned leads me to conclude that I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff hired the vehicle it claimsto have hired, or any other replacement vehicle. Further on the point of whether Italian Motors offered Mr Hui a replacement carfrom its fleet, I prefer the evidence of Mr Adamczyk that it did.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> I have found that liability is proved so the plaintiff should have some damages for loss of use. Even if the plaintiff had acceptedthe offer of a replacement car it would not have been a Ferrari. But it has to be remembered that while the Ferrari was bought forMr Hui's use, as a "fringe benefit", it is the plaintiff's car and the plaintiff's claim, and not his. There is no evidence thatMr Hui used the car for the plaintiff's business but only to travel between his home and his office, and there is no evidence thatthe plaintiff was obliged to provide him with home to office transport. He says that the Ferrari was useful to the company to showbusiness contacts such as bankers that it was financially sound, but ultimately he agreed that it would have had that effect if thecontacts knew that it had the car but it was off the road temporarily. In any event this kind of prestige is nebulous and difficultto quantify. It attaches to the person who drives the car, rather than his company; there are better ways of gauging a company'sworth and a banker will use them rather than relying on the managing director's possession of a fancy car. It seems to me thereforethat in any event the plaintiff would only be entitled to nominal damages for its loss of the use of the car. I will put the figureof such nominal damages at $100.00.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I turn to the no claim bonus. The only evidence on this is an invoice for insurance for the period from 27 April 1999. There is noevidence as to what the plaintiff was charged for insurance after the accident. In fact it appears from a letter from the plaintiff'sinsurer to the plaintiff's solicitor that the insurer intended to repudiate liability. If it did there should be no loss of bonus.The matter was not within Mr Hui's knowledge; it was his staff who dealt with it. So there is insufficient evidence to support thishead of the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> These were only two heads of claim still claimed by the plaintiff. There remain the repair costs and diminution in value, which ItalianMotors is claiming against Mr Ma. The other heads of claim, namely survey fees, insurance and licence were also abandoned by theplaintiff as against both defendants. They were not, so far as I can see, paid for by Italian Motors so there is no question of theirbeing claimed by Italian Motors against Mr Ma. What remains are the claims for repairs, which Italian Motors carried out, and diminutionin value for which the plaintiff has been compensated by the discount given on trade-in.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(4)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377">Cap.377</a> provides :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(4) A person who has made or agreed to make any payment in bona fide settlement or compromise of any claim made against him in respectof any damage (including a payment into court which has been accepted) shall be entitled to recover contribution in accordance withthis section without regard to whether or not he himself is or ever was liable in respect of the damage, provided, however, thathe would have been liable assuming that the factual basis of the claim against him could be established."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Italian Motors says it has made two payments in <em>bona fide</em> settlement of the plaintiff's claims, namely the cost of repairs and the trade-in discount. It is not liable for the damage but wouldhave been liable if the factual basis of the claim against it, i.e. the negligence of Mr Ho, had been established. Therefore it isentitled to recover from Mr Ma.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Mr Ma's argument is that there was never any compromise. The repairs were done because the plaintiff's solicitors demanded it. Thetrade-in took place against the background of denial of liability. Mr Hui never agreed to give up any claim in consideration of therepairs being done and Mr Adamczyk admitted that.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Counsel wrote lengthy and complicated submissions on the law but, with respect, now that liability has been established the positionis quite simple. The plaintiff sued both defendants. Italian Motors paid for the repairs and so, one way or another settled thathead of the claim. Later, it compensated the plaintiff for diminution in value, by giving a discount on trade-in and so settled thathead of claim. Now it has been found not to be liable, and Mr Ma has been found to be liable. There is no need for Italian Motorsto bear the cost of these settlements and it must be able to recover them from Mr Ma, except to the extent that they may be excessive.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The repair costs claim is for $573,125.00. This is the amount given in Italian Motors' estimate. Mr Adamczyk accepted that this figurewould be subject to revision. In fact the plaintiff's own loss adjuster revised the figure down to $466,078 and Mr Adamczyk agreedthat this was a proper revision. He also said that the plaintiff, or Mr Hui, was a member of the Ferrari Owners' Club and as suchentitled to a discount of 20% on spare parts; and this was not taken into account in the estimate.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> I think we have to take the figure which the plaintiff would have been able to claim, if the car had simply met with an accident,and had been repaired by Italian Motors; that is, leaving out any consideration of the fact that Italian Motors actually did thejob free of charge to him. On that basis the parts discount would have to be taken into consideration as mitigation of damage. Thefinal figure for repairs, taking into account the discount is $458,180.00.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> There is a claim for diminution in value of $500,000.00. This is based on the actual diminution in the second-hand value of the car,plus the discount given to the plaintiff when the car was traded in against a new model. This was done after the car had met witha second accident, also whilst under the control of Italian Motors. Mr Adamczyk's evidence is that the actual diminution in valueof the car, as a result of the accident with which this case is concerned, was between $100,000.00 and $150,000.00. The diminutionin value, as a result of the two accidents taken together, was between $150,000.00 and $200,000.00. The discount was, it appears,given in a large part because of the embarrassment factor of having crashed the plaintiff's car twice.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Again I think we have to look at the position as if the plaintiff's car had simply met with an accident and been repaired, and theonly involvement of Italian Motors was to do the repairs. What could the plaintiff have recovered from the other party involved inthe accident? Obviously it could legitimately claim the diminution in value as a result of the accident. I have no doubt of Mr Adamczyk'sexpertise in this field, for he has been dealing in Ferrari cars for Italian Motors, the sole agent in Hong Kong, for many years,and I accept his figures. I accept the diminution in value as a result of the accident as having been $150,000.00.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The plaintiff could not, in my view, have recovered any more than that. By the same token, Italian Motors cannot pass on liabilityfor any more than that difference to Mr Ma. There were various other reasons for the discount, a large one being the second accidentand the embarrassment factor arising from the fact of there having been two accidents. But the whole of the discount did not flowdirectly from the accident. If Italian Motors had been 100% liable for the accident, the plaintiff could have demanded the diminutionin value but it could not have demanded and Italian Motors would not have been obliged to give any extra discount.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> If statutory authority is needed for this it is to be found in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(5)</a> of the Ordinance which provides :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(5) On assessing any contribution under this section the court shall disregard any part of the payment in respect of which the contributionis sought which appears to the court to be excessive."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Any payment in excess of the actual diminution in value would obviously be excessive. The same of course applies to the repairs; anyfigure which Italian Motors paid (or charged its insurer) which was in excess of what it would have had to pay the plaintiff if ithad been liable, would be excessive.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> It follows that as against the 1st defendant the plaintiff's claims must be dismissed with costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The plaintiff is entitled to and will have judgment against the 2nd defendant for nominal damages of $100.00. As to costs I do notthink that the plaintiff can have them against the 2nd defendant, because what it has recovered is purely nominal. But a liabilityhowever small was established so I do not think the 2nd defendant can have costs against the plaintiff either. There will accordinglybe no order as to costs as between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> The 1st defendant is entitled to and will have judgment against the 2nd defendant in the third party proceedings in the sum of</p>    <p>$458,180.00 + $150,000.00 = $608,180.00 with interest at the commercial rate on $458,180.00 from the date of the Third Party Noticeand on $150,000.00 from the date of the trade-in, i.e. 3 April 2001 to the date of judgment and thereafter at the judgment rate untilpayment, and costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Since the judgment is to be handed down, and there have been no submissions on costs, the costs orders will be <em>nisi</em>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">( G.P.
