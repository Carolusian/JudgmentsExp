('Polaroid') during 1984, 1985 and 1986 toestablish a market in the People's Republic of China ('PRC') for photographic products comprising films and cameras. Until 1984 Polaroidhad been less successful that its competitors in selling its products to the PRC. Up to 1984 Polaroid sales to the PRC had only amountedto annual gross figures in the region of US$100,000.00.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> These sales were principally achieved by selling Polaroid products to China traders in Hong Kong who then resold the products toPRC buyers. Polaroid is one of a world wide group of companies who are subsidiaries of the Polaroid Corporation whose head officeis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The sale prices of the products sold by Polaroid in the Far East are fixed in accordancewith a strict world wide pricing control system imposed by the Polaroid Corporation. Prices for the same product may vary from countryto country, depending on the Polaroid Corporation's assessment of the marketing conditions in those countries in relation to itsoverall marketing strategy.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Examples of the price variation for different countries are reflected in Polaroid's Official Export Price List for 1985. The ex HongKong warehouse price for 600 High Speed Film (Single Pack) was US$5.95 for consumption in Hong Kong. The equivalent price for salesto the PRC was US$4.95. In the case of purchases by Bel Trade Co. Ltd. ('Bel Trade') for re-sale in the PRC the latter price wasreducible under an incentive scheme to US$3.92. Because of these substantial price differentials it was clearly in Polaroid's intereststo endeavour to ensure that products destined for particular countries at lower prices, were not resold by the purchaser in countrieswhere they could obtain much higher prices. Quite apart from the additional profit earned by the wholesales, Polaroid's attempt todevelop new markets in loss affluent and other countries by setting lower prices, would largely be frustrated.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In fact the wholesale price for sales to the PRC was a special low price set in an attempt to develop a market in that country. Theprice was so low that Polaroid claimed that it suffered a less on those sales but was reimbursed for that loss by a grant from theparent Polaroid Corporation in the United States. One step taken by Polaroid to ensure that products sold at the special PRC price,at least reached their PRC destination, was to assume responsibility for shipping the products from Hong Kong to the PRC. But theproducts were shipped in the name and at the cost of the Hong Kong China trader, who effected the wholesale purchase.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> By October 1984, Polaroid were selling relatively small quantities of film to several China traders in Hong Kong, for re-sale tothe PRC. Earlier annual sales were only in the region of US$100,000.00. One of Polaroid's China traders was Yuen Cheung Co., whoin October 1984 ordered 20,000 600 single pack films which at that time was a relatively large order. On further enquiry Polaroiddiscovered that Yuon Cheung Co. were making the order on behalf of another China trader, namely Bel Trade. Polaroid's General Manager,Mr. Joseph Ho, arranged for his Sales Manager Mr. Paul Ip and his China Manager Mr. David Chien to make further enquiries into BelTrade's business. These enquiries culminated in agreement being reached for Polaroid to sell films and supply cameras direct to BelTrade.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Ho was an honest and reliable witness and I find that from the beginning he wanted to be satisfied on two points. First, thatBel Trade was an established China trader with the ability to develop the PRC market for Polaroid products. Secondly, that Polaroidcould rely on Bel Trade's integrity to re-sell Polaroid's products in the PRC and not divert them elsewhere.   Mr. Ho had two earlymeetings with Mr. Stephen Sy, the Managing Director of Bel Trade, at which other officers of both companies were present. As a resultof those meetings Mr. Ho was satisfied that Bel Trade was a substantial China trader and could be relied upon to develop the PRCmarket and not sell elsewhere.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> There was a dispute between Mr. Ho and Mr. Sy as to when the first of these two meetings took place. The first meeting was held inBel Trade's office while the second meeting was held in the Unicorn Restaurant. I am satisfied that the first meeting was held inlate October or early November 1984 and not on 11th January 1985. Shortly after the first meeting Polaroid accepted Bel Trade's purchaseorder dated 30th November 1984 totalling US$90,000.00. for 20,000 single packs of 600 film at a unit price of US$4.50. Polaroid underthe same order provided 200 cameras free of charge. The goods were shipped to Xiamen by Polaroid in the name of and at the expenseof Bel Trade. This was the usual practice insisted upon by Polaroid to ensure that the goods did in fact enter the PRC. Later therewere also shipments to Hainan.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Sales to Bel Trade after that first order soared. The sale price of subsequent orders, expressed in United States dollars, included$90,000.00 on 5.11.84; $68,000.00 on 26.2.85; $42,500.00 on 23.2.85; $80,000.00 on 26.4.85; $127,500.00 on 4.3.85 and 26.3.85; $127,500.00on 10.4.85; $127,500.00 on 15.5.85; $53,300.00 on 2.8.85; $48,400.00 on 2.8.85; $149,150.00 on 2.8.85; $431,200.00 on 5.7.85; $152,096.00on 14.10.85; $347,410.00 on 3.10.85; $299,800.00 on 22.11.85 and 24.12.85; $172,480.00 on 16.11.85; $358,100.00 on 29.11.85; $126,000.00on 8.1.86; $254,297.50 on 9.1.86 and $522,400.00 on 8, 15, 22.1.86.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Following the negotiations late in 1984 and 1985 and as a consequence of the large orders being placed, the parties agreed to enterinto a long term contract in which their respective positions could be protected. Draft letters of agreement were prepared by Polaroidduring February 1985 covering price, incentive scheme reductions based on sales volume and other provisions to protect Polaroid'srequirement that the goods were only sold for export to the PRC. The original draft included the following provision which is setout in its final amended form with the deletions shown and the additions underlined :</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"For the avoidance of doubt, the above-mentioned reimbursement and incentive on both A. and B. will operate upon written purchaseorders being placed notwithstanding that the goods may not be available. On the other hand, relevant reimbursement or incentive willbe automatically default should any of the above goods purchase not be <u>shipped to</u> China and being <u>shipped to</u> other parts of the world."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>The original draft was forwarded by Polaroid to Bel Trade on 23rd February 1985. The final amended agreement was signed by Bel Tradeen 26th March 1985.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> According to Polaroid, from 1984 until 1986 it sold Bel Trade 712,785 packs of film for the PRC market but Bel Trade re-exported684,915 of those packs to North America and Europe. Mr. Sy, although at one stage contending that a slightly lesser amount of filmhad been re-exported by or behalf of Bel Trade from the PRC, agreed that 96% of the film exported from Hong Kong to the PRC had beenre-exported to North America and Europe. Polaroid's witnesses claimed that the first time they became aware of the re-exporting waswhen it received a series of telexes from its parent Company in the United States commencing on 6th March 1986 informing it thatfilm exported from Hong Kong to the PRC was on sale in Germany and later in Canada and the United States.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> At the hearing, Bel Trade did not dispute that film was re-exported. The mainly undisputed evidence established that large quantitiesof film, after arrival in Xiamen, was within days sent beck to Bel Trade or its associated companies in Hong Kong and then re-exportedto other countries. Following formal discovery in this action, a number of contract documents covering re-export transactions, indicatedthat on several occasions Bel Trade had resold the film to North American purchasers before the film had even been exported fromHong Kong to Xiamen so well before it had commenced its circuitous journey back to Hong Kong and thence to North America. Bel Tradepaid its Xiamen customer 2Â½% of Polaroid's sale price for its assistance in shipping the film, in most cases within days, back toBel Trade in Hong Kong. Mr. Sy estimated that from its re-exports to other countries, Bel Trade made a profit of about US$500,000.00.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Bel Trade's explanation was that its PRC customers were unable to sell the film in the PRC and that Bel Trade was forced to acceptthe film back and for economic reasons was then obliged to find customers elsewhere in the world. Mr. Sy further assorted that astime progressed, Polaroid's officers well know that the PRC could net absorb the huge orders Bel Trade was placing and were contentto continue to accept purchase orders, without enquiring into their ultimate destination. Mr. Sy further alleged that it was onlywhen Polaroid's parent company became aware of the position, that Polaroid's employees in Hong Kong tool action and refused to acceptany further purchase orders.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The final 3 purchase orders placed by Bel Trade, which Polaroid refused to accept, were for huge quantities. Earlier accepted purchaseorders placed in 1984 and down to mid-1985 typically ranged in value from about US$40,000.00 to US$150,000.00. In the latter halfof 1985 they increased and included orders for US$431,200.00. In January 1986 orders were received for even larger sums includingone for US$522,400.00. These were followed by the 3 final rejected orders :</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="43%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right">7.2.86</p>            </td>            <td width="57%" valign="top">                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="left">US$538,400.00</p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="43%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right">14.3.86</p>            </td>            <td width="57%" valign="top">                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="left">US$1,139,875.00</p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="43%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right">14.3.86</p>            </td>            <td width="57%" valign="top">                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p align="left">US$977,050.00</p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>Throughout the period these orders were placed, Mr. Sy consistently affirmed that the products would be sold in the PRC. As late as1st November 1985 he was writing to Polaroid pressing for exclusive selling rights in the Fukien Province and seeking a higher commissionfor sales within the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> For completeness I would record, that on 22nd May 1986, Polaroid wrote to Bel Trade referring to its requirement that products soldshould be consumed in the PRC. The parties had discussed a proposal that Bel Trade should execute a performance bond, which wouldbe forfeited in the event of any or all of Polaroid's products sold to Bel Trade, being found to be available for sale outside thePRC. No agreement was reached on the amount of the bond. None was over executed. One consequence of the non-execution of a performancebond was that the final 3 orders were never accepted by Polaroid. On 3rd June 1986 Bel Trade's solicitors wrote to Polaroid statingthat Bel Trade accepted that the films were intended to be sold in the PRC but, despite its best endeavours, Bel Trade had littlecontrol over the film once it was sold to purchasers in the PRC. The solicitors letter concluded that Counsel had advised that BelTrade's obligation was limited to shipping the products to the PRC and that obligation had been discharged.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Bel Trade's response at the hearing, to the clear evidence that at least 96% of the products exported to the PRC had boon re-exportedby Bel Trade elsewhere, was that the solo contractual obligation was to ship the products to the PRC. There could be no dispute thatall the Polaroid products sold to Bel Trade had been shipped to the PRC, for Polaroid itself had shipped them to the PRC on behalfof Bel Trade. Bel Trade submitted that after shipping it had not contracted that Polaroid's product would be sold within the PRC.Mr. Sy pointed to the alteration of the Letter of Agreement which reduced Bel Trade's contractual liability to shipping to the PRC,unlike the draft proposal that the products were to be used in the PRC. Polaroid's witnesses maintained that the alteration was madeto meet Mr. Sy's objection, that while Bel Trade would sell within the PRC to customers in that country, it was unable to guaranteethat those customers might not resell elsewhere. Polaroid disputed that Bel Trade's legal obligation was merely to have its productsshipped to the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Polaroid founded its claim against the defendants on alternative grounds. First Polaroid pleaded that it entered into the contractin reliance on Bel Trade's representation that Bel Trade would sell the products to the PRC for use in the PRC; would not re-exportelsewhere; and would establish a market for Polaroid products in the PRC. Secondly, that it was an express or implied term of thecontract that Polaroid products sold to Bel Trade would be resold and used only in the PRC; would not be re-exported to any areasoutside the PRC; would not be re-bought and re-exported by Bel Trade.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> During the hearing lengthy and at times involved evidence, was adduced by both parties on the various discussions and meetings heldbetween their respective employees. I also had the advantage of listening to and observing Mr. Ho, Mr. Chien, Mr. Ip, Mr. GordonFok and Mr. Stephen Lam for the plaintiff and Mr. Stephen Sy for the defendants. Where the evidence of the plaintiff's witnessesconflicted with that of Mr. Sy, I prefer the evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses. I find that Polaroid entered into the contractwith Bel Trade upon the basis of the representation that Bel Trade would sell Polaroid's products within the PRC and use its bestendeavours to ensure that such products were not resold outside the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The factual position is that Polaroid, on the basis of those representations, was induced to enter into the contract and accepteda series of purchase orders which, in terms of that contract, were tendered by Bel Trade to Polaroid. Each of those purchase ordersresulted in new individual contracts for the goods described in those orders. I have considered whether the initial representationscontinued. According to Bel Trade, it was only some time after the contract was entered into that its PRC customers were unable tocomplete the sales it anticipated making to them. As a matter of law, Bel Trade was always at liberty to withdrew or modify its originalrepresentation to Polaroid. However, if it failed to do so, the representation is deemed to be repeated at each successive momentthereafter and amounts at law to a continuing representation.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Before deciding whether Bel Trade's representation continued and affected the subsequent purchase orders, it is necessary to considertwo incidents which, according to Mr. Sy, supported his allegation that Polaroid knew that Bel Trade was re-exporting and with suchknowledge indicated its approval by continuing to accept further substantial purchase orders. The first relates to what occurredat a meeting between Mr. Ho and Mr. Sy, when Mr. Ho raised with Mr. Sy the possibility that film sold to Bel Trade, was being re-exportedfrom the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Sy informed Mr. Ho that he was aware that Bel Trade's Xiamen customer had outlets in Northern China and it was possible thatsome film was crossing the PRC border and being sold in Russia and Eastern Europe. Mr. Sy stated that when he had discussions withPolaroid's employees, the word "Russia" was used as a codeword to cover re-export of film from the PRC to any other country in theworld. He agreed that this meaning of Russia was never expressly mentioned by him or by any of Polaroid's employees but he statedits wide meaning was clearly understood. Polaroid's witnesses denied that they ever understood Russia to have this wider or codewordmeaning. I accept their denials. I also record that when Mr. Sy spoke to Mr. Ho he cleanly conveyed that it was possible that theXiamen customer had resell film which may have crossed into Russia. Mr. Sy never told or indirectly suggested to Mr. Ho, that BelTrade was re-exporting to Russia or to any other country. I equally reject Mr. Sy's explanation that the reason he did not expresslytell Mr. Ho and his colleagues that Bel Trade was re-exporting was to make them "free more comfortable" as untrue.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The second incident concerns the return of container of Polaroid film shipped on the "Hua Sheng" from Xiamen which arrived in HongKong an 11th October 1985 and was devanned at Bel Trade's premises on 15th October 1985. Quite fortuitously, Mr. Gordon Fok, Polaroid'spresent China Manager, but then employed in a more junior position, passed Bel Trade's premises on board a tram on the evening of15th October 1985. He saw a container being unloaded and its contents appeared to be Polaroid products. Mr Fok, who was carryinga Polaroid camera, alighted and took a photograph of the unloading operations which was produced as Exhibit P.5. When the followingmorning this incident was brought to Mr. Ho's attention, he directed Mr. Ip and Mr. Chien to attend on Mr. Sy at Bel Trade's premisesto obtain an explanation.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I accept Mr. Ip's evidence that at first Mr. Sy denied that a container with Polaroid film had been unloaded the previous eveningbut later admitted that was the portion when confronted with Mr. Ip's evidence. I further find that Mr. Sy then took Mr. Ip and Mr.Chien to the godown where they inspected water damaged cartons of film and also observed substantial quantities of undamaged cartonsof film. Mr. Sy claimed that Mr. Ip and Mr. Chien knew that the bulk of the container's contents were undamaged and had been returnedto Hong Kong for re-export to other countries. Mr. Sy asserted they only made a perfunctory visit to dispose of Mr. Fok's report.Mr. Sy also pointed out that thereafter from 22.11.85 down to 22.1.86 several large purchase orders were accepted by Polaroid notwithstandingits actual knowledge of the return of the container with a substantial quantity of undamaged film.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Mr. Ho's evidence was that Mr. Fok's report raised the possibility that it was Bel Trade and not suspected other China traders, whowere re-exporting and Polaroid took immediate action to check the position. After Mr. Ip and Mr. Chien's visit they reported thatwater damaged cartons had been inspected. Further, Bel Trade made an insurance claim for the damaged goods and a survey report fromGellatly Hankoy Marine Services was obtained. In addition, Bel Trade at the same time, made a claim against Polaroid for compensation.Polaroid's witnesses when cross-examined on the fact that there were more undamaged cartons that damaged cartons, replied that theyaccepted it was normal trade practice for a consignee to reject the whole consignment even when only part of the contents are damaged.They considered that the return of the full contents of the container was not suspicious and had not suggested to them that in factthe undamaged contents were on route to another country.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> After reviewing the whole of the evidence on the container incident, including the credibility of the various witnesses who gaveevidence, I reject Mr. Sy's allogations. I am satisfied that after Mr. Fok's report aroused Polaroid's suspicions, Mr, Ip and Mr.Chien's investigations satisfied Polaroid that the sole reason for the return of the container to Hong Kong was that it had beenrejected in Xiamen because part of its contents were water damaged. I also record that each of the purchase orders after this incidentcontinued to be prepared by Bel Trade. Each provided for products purchased thereunder to be shipped to the PRC. As a matter of facteach shipment contined to be arranged by Polaroid who had the actual knowledge that their products were shipped from Hong Kong tothe PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> On the evidence I an satisfied that Polaroid entered into the contract to sell products to Bel Trade at reduced prices because ofBel Trade's representation that the products would be sold to and used only in the PRC. I am also satisfied Bel Trade made the otherrepresentations pleaded in paragraph 4A of the Re-Amended Consolidated Statement of Claim. The remaining issue is whether the misrepresentationswere fraudulent, negligent or innocent. There is no direct evidence as to Mr. Sy's state of mind when the first purchase order wasaccepted. But the contract was only executed after the first four purchase orders were accepted. The series of purchase orders resultedin the representations being continuing representations. Accordingly the crucial time to determine whether they were fraudulent isnot when they were made but later when Polaroid acted upon them.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> There is a substantial body of evidence relevant to the issue whether the representations were fraudulent. I have already found thatI prefer the evidence of the Polaroid witnesses to Mr. Sy, where there is any conflict. Mr. Sy was an unimpressive witness. He variedhis evidence as the hearing progressed and on several material matters his evidence was not consistent either with the pleadings,the documents adduced nor with other parts of his own evidence. I am satisfied that he lied in respect of the "Russia" codeword allegation.I also reject his evidence that Polaroid's officers in Hong Kong in officers conspired to prevent its United States parent from knowingproducts exported to the PRC, were nearly all being re-exported elsewhere.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> My adverse finding against Mr. Sy is reinforced by the documents, only disclosed at a late stage in discovery, by Bel Trade in relationto some the re-exports. From these and earlier documents discovered or otherwise available to Polaroid, three schedules were preparedfor the hearing, the contents of which were not really disputed. I generally accept their accuracy. Schedule A showed details ofthe shipment from Hong Kong to the PRC of film sold by Polaroid to Bel Trade. Schedule B showed similar details of shipments of 96%of the same film from the PRC back to Hong Kong. Schedule C showed details of the later shipment of some of the film returned toHong Kong, on to North America.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Film under the first Purchase Order dated 30.11.84 was shipped to Xiamen on 24.1.85. The film under the final accepted Purchase Orderdated 21.3.86 was shipped on 4.4.86. The shipments by Bel Trade back to Hong Kong were invoiced as early as 18.3.85 and shipped on28.3.85. The return shipments under Schedule B continued down to 6.4.86. The re-exports to other countries listed in Schedule C coverthe period from 4.4.85 to 9.5.86. The short intervals before the film was sent back to Hong Kong, is strong evidence that Bel Tradenever made any real or genuine attempt to sell the reshipped film in the PRC. There are several instances where Bel Trade had evenarranged for the resale of film from Hong Kong to North America, before it had been shipped from Hong Kong to the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Bel Trade had clearly devised an elaborate and deliberate scheme to buy film in Hong Kong at low PRC export prices and then re-exportit via the PRC and Hong Kong, to higher priced North American and European markets. The evidence of such a scheme being instigatedfrom the very beginning, does not rest on the documents alone. After Polaroid refused to accept any more purchase orders from BelTrade, Polaroid's Mr. Gordon Fok was in 1986 approached by Mr. Chen Yen Quian. Mr. Chen was the Assistant Manager of the Xiamen SpecialEconomic Zone International Information Development Co. Ltd. ('XIID') which had been one of Bel Trade's main customers in the PRC.Mr. Chen visited Hong Kong and asked Mr. Fok to meet him in a North Point Restaurant on 6th May 1986. Mr. Chen enquired why exportsof film to Xiamen had stopped. Mr. Chen disclosed that from the very beginning of Bel Trade's exports to the PRC, XIID and otherPRC companies had assisted Bel Trade to ship the film back to Hong Kong. Mr. Chen wanted the same practice to continue and as BelTrade was no longer involved, naively offered to deal direct with Polaroid. Mr. Chen stated that XIID would arrange for the filmto be shipped back to Hong Kong at a cost of 7% of the invoiced cost of the film.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr. Chen's assertion that Bel Trade from the beginning re-exported film back to Hong Kong, also does not stand alone. Under cross-examination,Mr. Sy while at first maintaing that less than 90% of the film shipped to the PRC was returned to Hong Kong, later agreed that thetotal returned to Hong Kong would have been in the region of 96%. This extremely high percentage covers nearly all the film shippedto the PRC. The very short period between the arrival of the film in the PRC and its return to Hong Kong negates any real effortby Bel Trade to try and sell the returned film in the PRC. From that evidence, I am prepared to infer that it is more probable thannot, that Bel Trade at least from the time when Polaroid first acted upon the misrepresentations, did not honestly believe the representationswere true. On the facts any other inference would be fanciful and unreasonable. The lies told by Mr. Sy also tend to reinforce theprimary evidence I have found of a clear intention from the beginning to defraud.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I turn now to consider whether it was an express or implied term of the contract that Polaroid products sold to Bel Trade would besold and used in the PRC and not re-exported by Bel Trade to other countries. This was a commercial contract drafted and settledby the parties themselves as businessmen without recourse to lawyers. The contract requires to be construed in the light of its commercialpurpose in relation to the factual circumstances in which it was negotiated. For Polaroid it was submitted that the word "shipped"in the extract from the contract already quoted in full, should not be given a narrow literal meaning.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Polaroid submitted that the scheme of the contract was that special low prices were payable by Bel Trade for products which it woulduse its best endeavours to sell within the PRC. The importance that the products should be sold in the PRC was evidenced by the unusualprocedure, that while the film would be at Bel Trade's risk from the time of its sale in Hong Kong, it would be shipped by Polaroidin Bel Trade's name and at Bel Trade's expense. At the risks of over summarising Polaroid's submissions, it was contended that theproper meaning of the provision was that it after using its best endeavours Bel Trade could not sell any of the film in the PRC andwas obliged to sell the film elsewhere, then the price incentives special to the PRC would not apply.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Counsel for Polaroid also referred to Clause 2 of the contract which provided for Polaroid to have the right to ship the film tothe PRC. It was submitted that the price and other contractual advantages granted to Bel Trade on the film being shipped to the PRC,only made sense if the implied intention of the parties was that the film was to be sold in the PRC. Bel Trade's contrary submissionthat the contract only required the mere shipping of the film to the PRC to entitle it to the lower price and other advantages, wasalso attacked on the basis that if that were the proper construction, the unusual requirement for Polaroid to attend to the actualshipping, would have been both unnecessary and meaningless.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Counsel for Bel Trade submitted that the express terms of the contract clearly show that the lower rice and other incentives apply,if the film is first shipped to the PRC whatever thereafter happens. It was submitted that the default provision in the contractonly applied if the film were exported direct to a third country and not through the PRC. It was common ground that no such defaultingdirect shipment to a third country had occurred. In the instant case, it was submitted, the contract contained no ambiguity and therewas therefore no need to look outside the contract. The purported contractual scheme advanced by Polaroid, it was submitted, wasat best an attempt to conjure non-existent terms out of thin air. In any event as a matter of law, it was not open to the Court,in construing a contract to look at previous negotiations. But even if these negotiations were looked at it was undisputed that theparties had deleted the more onerous provision requiring the goods to be used in the PRC and substituted the lesser requirement thatthey merely be shipped to the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In summary, Counsel for Bel Trade submitted that the contractual terms were clear; there was no ambiguity to resolve. Polaroid, contraryto authority, was trying to refer to extrinsic evidence in order to add provisions to the contract which simply never existed. Finally,it was submitted that the strict requirements that required to be satisfied, before the Courts will imply an additional term in acommercial contract, had not been established.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> On the construction of the contract and on all the other legal issues which arose at the hearing, including those on misrepresentation,fraud, burden of proof, personal liability of directors, remedies, damages, recission, and taking accounts, I was referred by bothparties to a long list of authorities. I have read and considered each of them, which is one reason for the delay in delivering thisjudgment. I am also obliged to the clear and helpful submissions of Mr. Ma and Mr. Bell in developing their respective opposing legalsubmissions on those authorities and from the several textbooks to which I was also referred. However, the factual evidence was soclear and the relevant legal principles arising on those facts so well settled, that I do not propose expressly to refer to any ofthose authorities or textbooks, except to record that I have taken them fully into consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The contract extends over two pages and was drafted and amended by laymen. The contract is in English but I infer from its contentsthat it was drafted by a person for whom English is a second language. However, its contents are tolerably clear. I recognise thelimitations the law imposes on referring to extrinsic evidence as an aid to construction and similarly strict limitations on implyingadditional terms. There is much force in Counsel for Polaroid's submission, that at least some of the contract's provisions seemto be unnecessary, unless the intention of the parties was that Bel Trade contracted that the price and other advantages it enjoyed,were conditional upon the products being sold and used in the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> I may well have boon prepared, because of the commercial nature and surrounding circumstances of this contract, to accede to thosesubmissions. However, it seems to me that those submissions face the insuperable obstacle that the parties had altered the contractby deleting the original express requirement that the products be used in the PRC to the lesser obligation that they be shipped tothe PRC. If with reluctance, I have reached the conclusion that the contract cannot be given the wider construction urged by Counselfor Polaroid, nor may the suggested additional term be implied.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Accordingly, Polaroid has succeeded in its first cause of action based on fraudulent misrepresentation. One of the consequences ofthat finding is that the contract between the parties is rescinded. However, I reject in relation to the second cause of action incontract, Polaroid's submissions on the proper construction of the terms of the contract.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The next question relates to the defendants separate liability. Clearly Polaroid is entitled to judgment against Bel Trade. Counselfor the defendants submitted that if I reached that conclusion, liability had still not been established against the 2nd and 3rddefendants personally. The separate legal personality enjoyed by a limited liability company, means that where it is liable, itsdirectors are not necessarily liable. It is necessary to consider the separate role of eath director. Mr. Sy, the 2nd defendant,carried out on behalf of Bel Trade nearly all the material negotiations between the parties. The fraudulent misrepresentations weremade by him on behalf of Bel Trade. Depending on the circumstances wrongful acts of a person when acting as a director may not beprotected by the concept of limited liability or the separate legal personality of the limited liability company. A director may,in accordance with the normal principles of vicarious liability, be personally liable for any wrongful acts he commits, even thoughacting as agent. Mr. Sy's knowing, deliberate and wilful participation in the fraudulent misrepresentation of his Company, is sufficientin the present case to make him also personally liable. I hold Mr. Sy to be personally liable.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Mrs. Anita Hung, the 2nd defendant, is the wife of Mr. Sy. Although present for periods during some of the early meetings betweenthe parties, any participation by her in the negotiations was limited and falls short of establishing personal liability. In theresult Polaroid is entitled to judgment against Bel Trade as 1st defendant and Mr. Sy as 2nd defendant but the action against Mrs.Hung, as 3rd defendant, is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Finally, I turn to the remedies Polaroid seeks. Where a plaintiff succeeds in establishing fraudulent misrepresentation, it is entitledto have the contract rescinded and to recover damages for deceit. I record that before arriving at that conclusion I have recognisedthat in many cases a successful party will not be entitled to both recission and damages. However, in the case of fraudulent misrepresentationthe defrauded party is entitled to damages in tort quite independently of the operation of the doctrine of recission in contract.I hold that Polaroid is entitled in the instant circumstances to both recission and damages. Polaroid also asks for an account tobe taken of the profits Bel Trade made under the contract.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Dealing first with the issue of damages Polaroid claims US$2,118,426.81. This sum is particularised in Schedule I to the Re-AmendedConsolidated Statement of Claim. In that Schedule the PRC price, invoiced to Bel Trade for products supplied, is deducted from theHong Kong dealer price and to that difference the value of free products supplied is added. Polaroid claims that the loss it sufferedon each sale is represented by that final sum. The total losses so calculated on all sales to Bel Trade at the PRC rate, plus thevalue of the PRC rebates granted to Bel Trade, produces the damages claimed of US$2,118,426.81.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Bel Trade attacked the claim for damages on a number of grounds. It was submitted that due to the unclear evidence of the cost ofproduction and the pricing adjustments between Polaroid and its parent United States corporation, it was not clear whether any profitwould have been made if all the products had been purchased and used in the PRC. On this promise, Bel Trade built an intricate argumentthat in the event Polaroid had suffered no loss. There was also criticism that the in later sales, the rebate had already boon includedin Polaroid's bills. After considering these submissions I am satisfied that the loss suffered by Polaroid was in the region of US$2,118,426.81and it is entitled to judgment for that sum.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Polaroid founded its right to an account, on the equitable principle that an innocent party is entitled to recover benefits conferredon the other party, where a contract is subsequently rescinded. I am satisfied that where, as here, the Court has rescinded the contracton the ground of fraudulent misrepresentation, it may also order the restoration to the innocent party, of benefits received by thefraudulent party under the contract. This equitable principle is available to an innocent party where a contract is so rescindedand arises independently of common law remedies.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Where a contract is rescinded on the different ground of innocent misrepresentation or in other cases where damages are not awarded,a Court may particularly consider it just that, in addition to rescinding the contract, any financial benefits received by the representorunder the contract, should be restored to the misrepresented party. In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation, the defrauded representeeis, of course, entitled both to rescind the contract and recover damages in tort. In accordance with the latter principles the presentcontract has been rescinded and Polaroid awarded damages. I accept that, as a matter of law, this Court also has a discretion, inthe exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, to order accounts and inquiries into profits made by Bel Trade.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Before ordering accounts, care must be taken to ensure that the outcome would not necessarily result in the award of double compensation.The damages awarded in tort, were to put Polaroid in the position it would have been, if the fraudulent misrepresentations had notbeen made. If Polaroid had known that Bel Trade were not going to sell the products in the PRC, it would not have charged the speciallow PRC wholesale prices. In its damages claim, Polaroid elected to calculate its loss principally on the difference between thehigher Hong Kong and the lower PRC wholesale prices. Mr. Sy's estimate that Bel Trade made a profit of US$500,000.00 on its salesto other countries, even if accurate, does not assist in determining whether the same products would have been resold within HongKong at a Greater or lesser profit. The damages awarded have been calculated on the basis of Hong Kong prices.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> At this stage it is entirely speculative to conjecture whether, if an account were taken, Bel Trade would be shown to have earneda greater profit that if, having paid Hong Kong wholesale prices, it had resold the products in Hong Kong. In view of the damagesalready awarded, that would be the lessor basis on which any account of profits would require to be taken. I have paused to considerwhether, on the probabilities, the taking of an account would in the circumstances be a useless exercise. On balance I consider thatthis is proper case in which to order that an account be taken.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Finally, in view of the findings made in favour of Polaroid in the action the Re-Re-Amended Counterclaim of Bel made fails. The counterclaimis therefore dismissed. As to costs, there will be an order nisi pursuant to Order 42 Rule 5B (6) RSC that the 1st and 2nd defendantswill pay the plaintiff's costs on the claim and that the 1st defendant will pay the plaintiff's cost on the counterclaim.
