The secondground alleges that there is no evidence that the plaintiff offered to enter into the settlement agreement with the defendant oncondition that the defendant made payment of the sum of $179,169.90 within ten working days, or that the payment of the said sumby the defendant to the plaintiff was a condition precedent to the settlement agreement, or that the settlement agreement containedany term or condition that upon failure on the part of the defendant to pay the said sum to the plaintiff within ten working days,the settlement agreement would come to an end and the plaintiff would cease to be bound thereby, or that the plaintiff had acceptedthe defendantâs repudiation of the settlement agreement, or that the settlement agreement had been terminated for any other reason. Thus the judgeâs conclusion that the settlement agreement was not binding on the plaintiff was not supported by evidence.  Thethird ground of appeal contends that the judgeâs conclusion of the plaintiff not being bound by the settlement agreement is inconsistentwith his finding of fact that the plaintiff and the defendant had entered into the settlement agreement on 5<sup> </sup>September 2001.</p>    <p class="heading">The law</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Counsel drew our attention to certain passages in <i>Chitty on Contracts,</i> 29<sup>th</sup> Edition, Vol 1 on the law of accord and satisfaction, and the authorities of <i>Morris v Baron &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1918%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1918] AC 1</a>, at 35 and <i>British Russian Gazette &amp; Trade Outlook Ltd v Associated Newspapers Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1933%5d%202%20KB%20616" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1933] 2 KB 616</a>, at 643-645, 652, 654-655, in support of his contentions.  I consider that the following passages in <i>Chitty</i> correctly summarise the law as borne out by those authorities:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Para 22-012</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>Definition</b>.  âAccord and satisfaction is the purchase of a release from an obligation whether arising under contract or tort by means of anyvaluable consideration, not being the actual performance of the obligation itself.  The accord is the agreement by which the obligationis discharged.  The satisfaction is the consideration which makes the agreement operative.ââ¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Para 22-015</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>Executory satisfaction</b>.  At one time, a number of cases appeared to establish the rule that satisfaction was of no effect unless it was executed.  Whilethe satisfaction remained executory, that is to say, so long as the agreement to give satisfaction remained unperformed, the originalclaim was not discharged, nor would any action lie for breach of the accord.  Even a tender of performance of the satisfaction agreedupon was adjudged insufficient.  Only executed satisfaction would suffice.  This rule, however, was never completely accepted andit is now established that satisfaction may be executory.  The question is one of the construction of the accord: whether it wasintended that the promise itself or the performance of the promise should discharge the original claim.  âThe rational distinctionseems to be, that if the promise be received in satisfaction, it is a good satisfaction; but if the performance, not the promise,is intended to operate in satisfaction, there will be no satisfaction without performance.â  In the modern law, therefore, a claimantmay still insist upon the performance of some act by the other party in satisfaction of his claim.  In that case, there is no satisfactionuntil performance, and the other party remains liable on the original claim until the satisfaction is executed.  More often, however,the claimant will agree to accept the other partyâs promise of performance in satisfaction of his claim.  The original claim isthen discharged from the date of the agreement and cannot be revived.  The claimantâs sole remedy, in the event that the otherparty fails to perform, is by action for breach of the substituted agreement, and he has no right of resort to the original claim. If he wishes to preserve his right to proceed with the original claim should the other party fail to perform, an express term shouldbe incorporated in the agreement to that effect.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Para 22-023</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>Pleading</b>.

In the circumstances, the settlement agreement came to an end and the plaintiff is not bound by the same.  The settlement agreementdoes not prevent the plaintiff from claiming the amounts that I have found that the plaintiff is entitled to.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Analysis</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> He who asserts must prove.  It was the defendant who pleaded the settlement agreement in its defence and the onus is squarely onit to prove the existence of the settlement agreement and that it was binding on the plaintiff.  It is to be noted that no satisfactionwas pleaded.  This could mean that the defendant intended to plead the accord as the satisfaction, but on the other hand, it couldmean that no satisfaction was expressly pleaded or relied upon by the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The judge found that the settlement agreement had been reached on 5 September 2001 between Mr Yeo of the defendant and Mr Tin ofthe plaintiff.  He also found that there was an express condition of the agreement that payment would be made within ten workingdays, which had not been performed by the defendant; thus the plaintiff was no longer bound by the agreement.  There is nothing inconsistentbetween these two findings, as contended by the third ground of appeal. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Whether the settlement agreement was executory in nature or provided for executed performance as satisfaction is entirely a matterof construction.  For a proper construction of the agreement, all the surrounding circumstances, which sometimes are called the matrixof facts, must be considered.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Latest by 9 June 2000, the plaintiff had completed the first four items of works set out in paragraph 5 above and submitted two billsto the defendant the later of which was dated 24 May 2000, which made, according to the judgeâs finding that the defendant wasobliged to pay within 15 days of submission of the bills, 8 June 2000 the deadline for payment.  Those four items of works claimedby the plaintiff totalled $694,428.20, the major parts of which were allowed by the judge, amounting to $625,146.20.  When Mr Yeomet with Mr Tin on 5 September 2001, those sums had been long overdue for 15 months.  If the two other items for idling period andloss of profit for the omission of the jacking shaft were to be taken into account, an additional sum of $201,701 would also havebeen due.  It is, to say the least, surprising for the plaintiff to have accepted the sum of $179,169.90 in substitution for itsjust claim as found by the judge of $826,847.20, or at least $625,146.20 if the $201,701 is not taken into account.  Be that as itmay, there is no appeal against the judgeâs finding that the parties had reached the settlement agreement on 5 September 2001. The monies at least totalling $625,146.20 commenced to be due and owing on 8 June 2000, but the plaintiff had still not been paidby the defendant as late as 5 September 2001.  </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> According to Mr Yeoâs testimony in cross-examination, he agreed that there was a condition for payment within ten working days. He explained that payment of the agreed amount of $179,169.90 was to be made within ten working days because the representativesof the plaintiff were saying that they were short of cash.  The irresistible inference to be drawn is that the time of payment wasmade of essence by the parties and so understood by the parties.  It is also to be noted that in Mr Yeoâs own witness statement,the words â<i>shall be paid</i> to the Plaintiff within 10 working daysâ were used.  Counsel contended that âshall be paidâ is ungrammatical.  However, I considerthat those words were used to accentuate the importance of the time of payment. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In the email of 11 September 2001, Mr Yeo asked Mr Tai to arrange payment for the plaintiff, and had specifically informed Mr Taithat he had âagreed with them to pay within 10 working days.â</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> By 5 October 2001, the date of the letter sent by the defendant to the plaintiff, the ten working days time limit for the paymenthad already expired.  However, the letter still asked the plaintiff to âconfirm acceptance of this amount and the foregoing disclaimerby signing this letterâ, ignoring the time limit for payment altogether.  Even in this letter, it is stressed that âacceptanceof the amounts indicated in the above statement and receipt of the Outstanding Balance shall represent full and final settlementof all claims dueâ.  The full and final settlement was treated as a âdisclaimerâ.  Moreover, it could not be over-emphasisedthat the letter took âreceipt of the Outstanding Balanceâ as representing full and final settlement of all claims due, but didnot even intimate that the promise to pay the outstanding balance by itself amounted to a full and final settlement. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> It is crystal clear that all the surrounding circumstances material to the construction of the settlement agreement point to theinevitable conclusion that the time limit for the payment was of essence and that the agreement was firmly based on executed performanceof payment within the agreed time for it to be binding on the plaintiff.  There was an abundance of evidence supporting the judgeâsfinding that the settlement agreement was no longer binding on the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The grounds of appeal have no substance and were rejected.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> For the above reasons, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Hon Le Pichon JA:</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Anthony Rogers)<br />            Vice-President</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(K H Woo)<br />            Vice-President</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Doreen Le Pichon)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Johnny Mok, instructed by Messrs C L Chow &amp; Macksion Chan, for the Plaintiff (Respondent)</p>        <p>Mr Denis Gordon Yu, instructed by Messrs Leung, Chan &amp; Pang, for the Defendant (Appellant)</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2005/312.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
