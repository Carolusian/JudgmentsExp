By reason of the recent indication from Samosand Caledonian, there is a possibility that no interest in the 1,777,700 TSE shares was acquired by the defendant.

Samos and Caledonian were not prepared to proceed with the transaction. No beneficial ownership of the 1,777,700 TSE shares were acquired for Mr. Woods.

Courts of Equity did not award damages but,acting in personam, ordered the defaulting trustee to restore the trust estate: see <i>Nocton v.

Although Axdalehad the right to demand the use of the funds, Axdale held no chose in action.  Hence, the proper defendant should have been BLP.</p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Mr. Wright also pointed out that the plaintiffâs pleaded case was based upon the defendant being a trustee of a declared trustand not on fiduciary relationship. </p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  A constructive trust is a remedy against an agent who has been given the control of property to use it for specific purpose undercircumstances of a duty to account for it and has misapplied it for unauthorized purpose.   The defendant had control of the BLPfunds, and he had made reports to Mr. Woods  for the use of the funds which turned out to be far from accurate.   As I see it, thecase of fiduciary relationship is open on the facts pleaded.  The plaintiff has shown a good arguable case on breach of fiduciaryduty on the part of the defendant in relation to the funds in the BLP account.  Hence, the defendant is liable to account for theuse thereof.</p>    <p style="text-align: left" class="heading"><i>(3)     All the funds in BLF account fully were accounted for except for Â£5.48 million used for the purchase of 1,777,700 TSE shares.</i></p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Mr. Barlow accepted that the 5.5 million TSE shares acquired by Momentum were paid for through the BLP trust account, and due creditmust be so given.  However, by reason of the fact that the price for those shares was Â£2.71 instead of Â£3.11 per share, only Â£15,173,067instead of Â£17,356,646 were used.  There is no indication that the defendant was allowed to make a secret profit.  Hence, thereis <i>prima facie</i> a duty to account for the shortfall of Â£2.18 million instead of Â£7.51 million.</p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  As to the Â£0.66 million, the defendant earlier said in his affidavit that this sum was unrelated to any matter involving the plaintiff. <i>Prima facie</i>, there is a duty to account for it.</p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I find there is a good arguable case that the defendant has to account for the Â£2.18 million and Â£0.66 million.</p>    <p style="text-align: left" class="heading"><i>(4)     Â£5.46 million were paid over to Samos and Caledonian and the defendant was not liable for failure by Samos and Caledonianto complete.</i></p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Mr. Wright submitted that although the e-mails from the defendant might have suggested that the defendant had acquired 1,777,700TSE shares, the defendant is not a lawyer and a laymanâs understanding of the e-mails is not inconsistent with the defendantâscase that there was only an agreement with Samos and Caledonian without completion.

The description of such a person as trustee is inaccurate. He may not necessarily have vested in him any relevant property belongs to the beneficiary in equity.  The description of the defendantas its trustee is merely a formula to describe his equitable liability to account for the losses caused by his wrongful conduct.

Correctly construed, the2002 Articles were only addressed to the sales, transfers or other dispositions of the legal title, the only title TSE recognized.

No prejudice has been suggested to or deposed in the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  By reason of the conduct of the defendant in the transaction and the representations in contemporaneous correspondence which henow seeks to argue out of, I am satisfied that there is a real risk of dissipation of assets.  The plaintiffâs explanation as towhy it has not come to the court earlier is reasonable.  Hence, I do see that the plaintiff is guilty of such delay to disentitleit from seeking the interlocutory injunction.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  By reason of the above considerations, I ordered that the interlocutory injunction be continued until trial save that the amountof the sum of Â£13,646,708.18 in the tracing injunction be reduced to Â£8,314,680.64.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">Costs</p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of the application (including the hearing) be costs in the cause.</p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  The plaintiff has taken out an half hour appointment on 8 May 2007 to vacate the hearing of the present application.  Mr. Barlowsubmitted that by reason of the voluminous affidavits filed in the present case, the time to be taken for the hearing of continuationof the injunction would probably be as much as the trial itself.  The court could order that the affidavits be deemed the witnessstatements and the parties would be ready for trial.  By reason of the admissions made by the defendant, the court could adopt theapproach by Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson (as he then was) in <i>Dormruil Feres SA &amp; anor v. Nicolian International (Textiles) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20WLR%201362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 WLR 1362</a>, i.e. to continue the injunction, order an early trial and stand over the argument for discharge to the trial.  Mr. Wright brieflyoutlined the arguments he wished to be heard on.  I consider that the matter could not have been dealt with within half an hour. Hence, I refused the application to vacate the hearing date and reserved the costs thereon.</p>    <p style="text-align: left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Mr. Barlow did not rely <i>Dormeuil Feres</i> at the substantive hearing of continuation.  Be that as it may, he has achieved more in the end and that is not to be held againsthim.  However, to take out only an half hour appointment effectively for the continuation of the injunction is not appropriate inthe circumstances of this case.  Hence, I order costs <i>nisi</i> against the plaintiff in respect of the 8 May 2007 application.</p>    <p style="text-align: left"> </p>    <p style="text-align: left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(B Fung)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr. Barrie Barlow, SC, instructed by Messrs Haldanes, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr. Colin Wright, instructed by Messrs Kennedys, for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/595.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
