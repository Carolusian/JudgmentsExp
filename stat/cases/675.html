He injured his elbow and was assessed to have suffereda 3% permanent loss of earning capacity.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Respondent denied that the Applicant was his employee.  His case was that the Applicant was an independent contractor.  As afallback, the Respondentâs case was that even if the Applicant was his employee, the injury sustained did not arise out of andin the course of his employment.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The trial took 3 days.  Both parties were represented by counsel.  The judge reserved her decision and handed down an 18- page judgmentin which she discussed the issues and evidence in detail.  The judge found that the Applicant was an employee of the Respondent andthat the accident did arise out of and in the course of his employment.  The judge awarded the Applicant compensation in the sumof $63,107 with interest and costs.</p>    <p class="heading">Ground of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Respondent appealed on two grounds:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)     that in finding that the Applicant was employed by the Respondent, the judge failed to take any or any sufficient accountof evidence that the Applicant had delegated (or had been permitted to delegate) some of his driving duties on the Mainland to aperson called Ah Kwai;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) that in finding that the Applicantâs injury arose out of and in the course of employment, the judge was wrong to accept as crediblethe Applicantâs evidence as to when and how he was injured, in the light of evidence from Li Fu Pen that when the lorry was beingloaded earlier he (Mr Li) had seen someone else whom he took to be the driver.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">First ground of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The first ground of the Respondentâs appeal involves the issue of delegation (actual or permitted) of some part of the Applicantâsdriving duties to a driver in the Mainland.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The judge accepted the Respondentâs evidence that the Applicant had introduced him at a restaurant to a person called Ah Kwaiand had told him that Ah Kwai âwas the employee Mr Pun [the Applicant] had hired to assist him in delivering goods in Chinaâ(para. 21).  The judge must have accepted that âdelivering goodsâ  entailed some driving by Ah Kwai as she said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIt is not for this court to speculate what commercial or other practical benefit [the Applicant] could obtain by an assistant todrive the lorry after it crossed the border into China.  Suffice it to say that from the evidence, it does not appear to be an impossibletask for an assistant driver to be involved at some stage of the transportationâ (para.25); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â ... I consider that there may be some ring of truth to [the Respondentâs] account of his meeting with [the Applicant] and AhKwai, and the fact that [the Applicant] had a driver to assist him in Chinaâ (para.27).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The judge did take this factor into account when she was considering the many features of the relationship between the Applicantand the Respondent (para. 29) before deciding that the Applicant was an employee.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In this respect the judge held (para. 33):</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âThe fact that [the Applicant] can hire a driver to do his work creates more difficulties.  If [the Applicant] can delegate hiswork to Ah Kwai, instead of providing his own skill and service in the performance of his work under his agreement with [the Respondent],it may be inconsistent with their relationship being a contract of service.  <i>However, the evidence presented in this case is not clear as to how Ah Kwai was involved in [the Applicantâs] work or the extentto which Ah Kwai was involved</i>.  According to [the Respondent], when he was introduced to Ah Kwai, [the Applicant] had simply said that Ah Kwai was employed by[the Applicant] âto assist him to deliver goodsâ in China. [The Respondent] did not elaborate further what this meant.  Mr Liâsevidence does not shed further light on this.  He only said that on one occasion, he had seen someone other than [the Applicant]in the lorry whilst it was in the loading area.  He did not say that someone other than [the Applicant] was driving the lorry onthe day in question.  I do not consider that there is sufficient evidence for me to find that [the Applicant] had delegated his drivingservices to someone else, <i>to the extent</i> that it can support the existence of a contract for servicesâ.  (Emphasis added).  </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In my view the judge was entitled to take this approach.  The Respondentâs counsel has not cited any authorities to the effectthat <i>any</i> assistance, however minimal, received by an employee from a person he hired would be conclusive evidence against a finding of employment. In <i>Express &amp; Echo Publications Ltd v Tanton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20ICR%20693" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] ICR 693</a> the driver had the absolute right at his discretion to arrange for a substitute driver at any time.  The Court of Appeal held thatit was a contract for services.  In the judgment the court referred to McKenna Jâs judgment in <i>Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%202%20QB%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 2 QB 497</a>, 515 where he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âFreedom to do a job either by oneâs own hands or by anotherâs is inconsistent with a contract of service, though a limitedor occasional power of delegation may not be: see <i>Atiyahâs Vicarious Liability in the Law of Torts</i> (1967), pp. 59-61 and the cases cited by himâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">The court in <i>Express &amp; Echo v Tanton</i> noted that the passage âwithout the qualification in the last sentenceâ was quoted with approval by the court of appeal in anothercase, but it did not suggest that the qualification in the last sentence was wrong.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In the absence of authority that <i>any</i> assistance or delegation would be conclusive against a contract of service, the judge had to look at the evidence on this issue (andin this case there was no evidence as to how Ah Kwai was involved in the Applicantâs work or the extent to which Ah Kwai was involved)together with all the other evidence in the case before the court. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In this respect it is important to bear in mind what the Applicantâs work entailed.  He was the sole registered driver of thecross-border lorry in question.  At the control points both in Hong Kong and the Mainland, a driverâs documents are checked toensure that the lorry is driven by the registered driver.  Therefore for a Hong Kong - Mainland - Hong Kong round trip, the Applicantwould at least have to drive the lorry from Hong Kong to the control points in Hong Kong and the Mainland on the outward leg, andagain from the control points in the Mainland and Hong Kong and back in Hong Kong on the return leg.  As for the part of the journeyon the Mainland, the Respondentâs own evidence was only that Ah Kwai was introduced to him as someone who would âassistâ theApplicant in delivering goods, and even if that were to be regarded as including driving, that would still mean that the main bulkof the driving work would still be done by the Applicant.  This distinguishes this case from <i>Express &amp; Echo v Tanton</i>.  In light of the factual matrix in the case before us, I do not think this court can say that the judge was wrong in her decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Second ground of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The second ground of the Respondentâs appeal challenges the judgeâs acceptance of the Applicantâs evidence as to how he wasinjured.  He said that he parked the lorry at Man Kam To Customs and slipped when climbing down from the lorry to collect customsdeclaration documents. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Respondent sought to challenge this evidence by calling Mr Li, a staff member of a mainland company.   He was responsible forpreparing customs declaration documents for his companyâs goods to be transported to Hong Kong.  He had asked the Respondent tosend a lorry to collect some goods for transportation to Hong Kong.  In due course he supervised the loading of the goods onto thelorry with a person whom he took to be the âdriverâ.  Afterwards he was telephoned by someone claiming to be the driver of thelorry asking him to bring the custom declaration documents.  When he did so he saw that this man was not the âdriverâ he hadseen earlier when the goods were loaded.  The man who had telephoned him was standing beside the lorry and asked him to hand overthe documents to the customs officer immediately as his arm was painful and he did not want to wait anymore.   </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The person who was complaining about the painful arm was the Applicant, and the Respondent argued that since Mr Li said he had seena different âdriverâ when the goods were loaded, that proved that the Applicant had not been driving the lorry earlier and thereforethe judge should not have accepted his evidence as to when and how he was injured.  </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  It is true that the judge did not refer to Mr Liâs evidence in connection with the second ground of appeal but only in connectionwith the first ground.  However there is nothing in the second ground.  The judge accepted the Applicantâs evidence as to how hewas injured.  It is well-established that an appellate court should be very slow to interfere with findings of primary fact.  AsLord Hoffmann said in <i>Biogen Inc v Medeva plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20RPC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] RPC 1</a> and repeated in <i>Piglowska v Piglowski</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20WLR%201360" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 WLR 1360:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âThe need for appellate caution in reversing the trial judgeâs evaluation of the facts is based upon much more solid grounds thanprofessional courtesy.  It is because specific findings of fact, even by the most meticulous judge, are inherently an incompletestatement of the impressions which was made upon him by the primary evidence.  <i>His expressed findings are always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, relative weight, minor qualification andnuance .... of which time and language do not permit exact expression, but which may play an important part in the judgeâs overallevaluation</i>â.  (Emphasis added).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">To this, Bokhary PJ added in <i>Ting Kwok Keung v Tam Dick Yuen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20HKC%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 HKC 601:</a>  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âWhere the judgment turns on an issue of fact, the Court of Appeal must have regard to the nature of that issue of fact.  And itmust have regard to the advantages enjoyed by a trial judge who received the evidence on such an issue at first-hand, in other words,in whose presence the whole of the evidence unfolded in its living state.  Such advantages can be, as Lord Shaw of Dunfermline putit in <i>Clarke v Edinburgh Tramways</i> at p.36, âsometimes broad and sometimes subtleâ.  <i>The question for the Court of Appeal is whether, even though it does not enjoy the advantages enjoyed by the trial judge who receivedthe evidence at first-hand, it is nevertheless satisfied that his conclusion on the facts is plainly wrong.  The Court of Appealshould intervene if so satisfied.  But if not so satisfied, the Court of Appeal should defer to the trial judgeâs conclusion evenif in some doubt as to its correctness</i>â.  (Emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Mr Liâs evidence in fact supported the Applicantâs case that he had injured his arm before getting the customs declaration documents. It might have been different if the Applicantâs case was that he had injured his arm at the time when the goods were being <i>loaded</i> as Mr Li said he saw a different âdriverâ then, but that was not the Applicantâs case.  In any event Mr Li did not explainwhy he considered that the person he had seen earlier during loading was the âdriverâ of the lorry.  He (Mr Li) only handed himsome documents for the goods.  There was no evidence as to what that person said or did which led Mr Li to make that assumption. Accordingly there is nothing in this ground either. </p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I would dismiss the appeal and order the Respondent to pay the Applicantâs costs of the appeal.  The Applicantâs own costs areto be taxed in accordance with legal aid regulations. </p>    <p>Hon. Lam J:</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Subject to what I have to say below regarding the first ground of appeal, I agree with the judgment of Yuen JA.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Counsel for the appellant did not seek to argue against the principle of law in McKenna Jâs judgment in <i>Ready Mixed Concrete</i> as regards the possibility of having a contract of service where the employee can delegate occasionally or in a limited extent someof his duties to others. The relevant part of the judgment was cited at paragraph 11 of the judgment of Yuen JA. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  A similar statement of law can also be found at para.39-022 of <i>Chitty on Contracts Vol.II, 30<sup>th</sup> edn.</i> At that paragraph, the learned editors cited <i>Robinson v Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1910%5d%201%20KB%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1910] 1 KB 94</a> where the following proposition was assumed to be correct,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âa person may possibly be an employee, although he himself (with the permission of the employer) employs assistant to help him.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">  The facts of that case bear some resemblance to our case. The employer baker engaged a vanman to deliver bread to his customers.The vanman, for his own convenience and benefit employed a child to assist him. The vanman paid the wages of the child. The engagementformed no part of the arrangement between the employer and the vanman though the employer was aware of that but only during permittedhours. The case concerns the prosecution of the employer in respect of the employment of the child outside permitted hours. The focusof the court in that case was whether the employer was employing the child outside permitted hours. He was acquitted and the acquittalwas upheld on appeal. In the short judgment of Lord Alverstone CJ, His Lordship proceeded on the basis that the employment of thechild could be brought about by the vanman as the agent of the employer. However, since there was no knowledge on the part of theemployer regarding the child being employed during the prohibited hours, it was held that there was no evidence of a contract ofemployment of the child on behalf of the employer during those hours. Hence, there was no discussion on whether in such circumstancesthe vanman should be regarded as employee or independent contractor.  </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  That case was also cited by <i>Atiyahâs Vicarious Liability in the Law of Torts</i> (1967) pp.59-61, an authority in turn cited by McKenna J in <i>Ready Mixed Concrete</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On the other hand, the editors of <i>Chitty on Contracts, Hong Kong Specific Contracts,</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn. summarized the position as follows at para.7-010,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">  âEmployees are exceptionally unlikely to be able to delegate their responsibilities under the contract to a third party.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I have looked at some authorities cited in these textbooks and most of them appear to be cases where the employer could be regardedas delegating to the employee to engage assistants on his behalf. In that scenario, the employer would also be the employer of theassistant engaged by the employee.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I do not wish to express a final view of my own in this judgment whether the same principle applies when the employee cannot beregarded as engaging the assistant for the employer. Counsel for the appellant did not draw such a distinction in accepting the principleof law mentioned above and no reference was made to the relevant cases in the course of submissions. Given the relatively modestamount involved in this appeal, I do not deem it appropriate to re-open the appeal for further submissions. </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I agreed with my lady that the Court of Appeal in <i>Express &amp; Echo v Tanton</i> dealt with a situation where the employee was contractually entitled to delegate completely the performance of the duty to anotherperson and this is not the situation we are dealing with. I have also read the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20ICR%20612" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] ICR 612</a> at p.623, referred to by Peter Gibson LJ in <i>Express &amp; Echo v Tanton</i>. That earlier judgment also did not shed any light on the situation here.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  For my part, if it was established that Mr Pun was contractually entitled to delegate substantially the driving duty in mainlandChina to another driver engaged by Mr Pun as his own employee, that would go a long way in establishing that the contract betweenMr Pun and Mr Tsang was a contract for service.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  But the finding of the learned judge at paragraph 33 of her judgment was that it is not clear as to how Ah Kwai was involved inMr Punâs work, or the extent to which Ah Kwai was involved. We were taken to the witness statements and the transcript. Havingread those again, I agree with my lady that the learned judge was entitled to come to such conclusion. There is no evidence as tothe terms of engagement of Ah Kwai as between him and Mr Pun. The evidence as regards Ah Kwaiâs duty in respect of driving is minimal.Though it might be open to the learned judge to draw inference from Mr Tsangâs evidence as to the conversation he had with Mr Punwhen Ah Kwai was introduced, she was equally entitled to decline to draw an inference that Mr Pun had delegated his substantial drivingduties to Ah Kwai in the light of the wordings in Mr Tsangâs witness statement. At the end of paragraph 33, the learned judge said,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">  âI do not consider that there is sufficient evidence for me to find that   Mr Pun had delegated his driving services to someoneelse, to the   extent that it can support the existence of a contract for services.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Like my lady, I see no justification for this court to interfere with that conclusion.   </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  For these reasons, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.  </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(W.
