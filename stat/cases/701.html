The Defendant counter-claimsfor damages for breach of contract.</p>	<p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> It is necessary to go back in time in order to understand how the Plaintiff claims to have been entitled to possession of the motor-vanin question. He has for some time been operating and driving taxis in the New Territories and in December, 1968 he approached theDefendantâs wife with a view, as he says, to purchasing an old taxi from the Defendant, the Defendant himself being at that timeout of the Colony and his wife having a power of attorney to act for him in relation to his taxi business. It may not be withoutsignificance that the Defendantâs wife herself says that during her husbandâs absence âbusiness almost came to a stopâ. TheDefendant does not dispute that an agreement was reached concerning this old taxi but he contends that the transaction was one ofbailment and he says that the new taxi which the Plaintiff subsequently contracted to buy on hire purchase was bought on his behalfand remains subject to the agreement of bailment to which the old taxi had been subject.</p>	<p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> According to the Plaintiff it was never intended that the old taxi should be put into operation by him and that what he was in factacquiring from the Defendant was, substantially, the licence. That such a transaction could even be contemplated arises from thepolicy of the licensing authority to limit the number of licences to be issued for taxis in the New Territories and, at the sametime, to allow the owner of any licensed New Territories taxi to transfer a licence from an old vehicle to a new one without havingto take his place among the applicants for new licences. Before any licence could be renewed the vehicle had to be submitted forinspection and the inference appearsto bethat ifa vehicle failed to pass the inspection its licence wouldnot be renewed. The significanceof that is that the agreement relating tothe Defendantâs old taxi was reached shortly before the vehicleâs licence expired andif the vehicle failedto pass theinspection the Plaintiff might have found himself, whetherasowneror as bailee, with a van which couldnot belicensedasaNew Territories taxi.Thereis no doubt that itwas a condition of the agreement that the vehicle must pass the inspection.TheDefendant, of course, says that this was because this old vehicie was itself to be put into service. The Plaintiff says the intentionwas that the old vehicleshould be scrapped as soon as the new taxi which he had in mind to purchase was ready for delivery and thatthe sole object of the inspection was the preservation of the licence so that it could be transferred to the new vehicle. The vehicledid pass the inspection. Whether the old taxi was then used by the Plaintiff or not (and I am inclined to believe that it was), Iam satisfied that on 30th December 1968 the Plaintiff placed an order with the Hong Kong Garage Ltd. for a new vehicle. I do notbelieve the Defendantâs wife when she says that some ten days after delivery of the old vehicle to the Plaintiff he asked her toreplace it with a new one at the Defendantâs expense. On lst February, 1969 a hire purchase agreement was signed between the HongKongGarage Ltd. and the Defendant. Although this agreement was completed in the name of the Defendant both the Plaintiff and theManaging Director of the garage say that in truth the hire purchaser was the Plaintiff and that the only reason for putting the Agreementin the name of the Defendant was that the Defendant had not yet arranged for the transferof the old taxi to the Plaintiff to be notedin the register of motor vehicles: until the transfer was registered the licensing authority would not recognise the Plaintiff asowner of the new vehicle to which the licence was being transferred. The Plaintiff says that he was entitled to a transfer of thelicence of the old taxi, that he asked the wife of the Defendant to arrange a transfer and that she refused except on condition thathe pay a sum of money over and above that which had been agreed for the transfer of the vehicle, while the Defendant denies thatthe Plaintiff was entitled to a transfer of the licence or that he ever asked for such a transfer. It has never been suggested byeither side that the true agreement between the parties was that a sum of $2,400 should be paid for the vehicle and that a furthersum should be paid in respect of the licence, although if the Plaintiffâs assessment of the value of the new van with the licencein December, 1969 is anywhere nearcorrect a price of $2,400 for the old van and the licence was undoubtedly very low.</p>	<p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It was admitted by the Defendantâs wife in evidence that she wrote the incomplete and unsigned document which has been marked Exh.L. It reads:</p>	<p class="auto-style1">â (I) hereby received from Mr. Ho Po How the sum of Hong Kong Currency Dollars Seven Hundred Only for the purchase of vehicle bodyof AB4597 belonging to Asia Taxi Company, the whole purchase price being $2,500.00. The balance of the purchase price to be paidin full within two days after the said vehicle shall have passed inspection. In the event of failure in making payment the depositshall be forfeited. Mr. Ho Po How shall be solely responsible for all costs relating to the repairs and insurance premium and registrationfee in respect of the said vehicle. The passing of inspection of the vehicle shall be undertaken by me in the course of the next14 days. The said AB 4597 at presentâ.</p>	<p>Her explanation is that it was originally contemplated that the old taxi should be bailed to the Plaintiff in return for a lump sumpayment of $2,500 and that they would go to a solicitor to have an agreement drawn up, but that the Plaintiff failed to pay in onelump sum and therefore they never went to see a solicitor. One would have thought that if she knew the Plaintiff was from the startdefaulting in this way she would have been the more anxious to ensure that an agreement was drawn up in proper legal form. Be thatas it may, this document written by her shows that at one stage she was clearly contemplating a sale and purchase of the old vehicle.She does not remember why the document was never completed</p>	<p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> After the old van had been inspected and handed over to the Plaintiff the Defendantâs wife and the Plaintiff executed the Agreementwhich was marked Exh. J. This is a most unsatisfactory document. The opening recital does not even make it clear whether what ithad been agreed to transfer was the taxi or the licence. Clause (1), however, would seem to indicate that the Plaintiff is appointedthe Defendantâs attorney to operate the taxi, since one does not normally âoperateâ a licence. Clause (4) refers tothe taxiâsbeing âin the name of Asia Taxi ,Companyâ and I interpret that as meaning registered in the name of that company. The clausetherefore provides that the Plaintiff shall not change the name in which the vehicle is registered but then goes on to prescribea âfeeâ to be paid in the event of âany transfer of the ... taxi by [the Plaintiff]â. If the document was intended merelytoconfer a licence on the Plaintiff to operate the vehicle there could be no quest      of a transfer, for the licence would be personalto the Plaintiff and not transferable. Clause (8) provides that if the Defendant has any dispute âsuch will be no concern of [thePlaintiff] andthe vehicleâ. This is some indication that the Defendant had disposed of his proprietary rights in the vehicle. Clause(9) provides that at the expiration of the Agreement the Defendant is to âtake over the licenceâ while the Plaintiff is to takeover the vehicle. How the parties thought that result could be achieved is not indicated, but this clause does point to at leastan eventual transfer of the vehicle. At the same time it shows that the licence was an important factor in the transaction and itis inconsistent with an intention to transfer the licence. The Defendant relies upon this Agreement as representing the true natureof the transaction, while the Plaintiff says it is a document he was forced to sign by reason of the refusal of the Defendantâswife to notify a change of ownership to the Registrar. In general it purports to allow the Plaintiff to use the old taxi for a periodof ten years in return for a monthly âsupervising feeâ of $50 and an annual fee of $100 âfor filing the returns to the InlandRevenue Departmentâ. If the Plaintiffâs version of the agreement is true he was clearly entitled not only to the vehicle butalso to have the licence transferred into his name in the register. Equally clearly the proper course if his vendor refused to takethe necessary steps was to sue the vendor in respect of his breach of the implied term in the contract of sale and purchase or insome other way to establish to the satisfaction of the Registrar his title to the vehicle.However, obviously that would result inthe Plaintiffâs being unable to use the vehicle until the proceedings were brought to a successful conclusion - and it is notoriousthat businessmen, particularly in Hong Kong, are prone to regard practical convenience as a weightier factor than morality. Thatbeing so the Plaintiffâs professed willingness to execute a wholly misleading document which would give him immediate possessionof the vehicle, at the risk of jeopardizing his proprietary rights, becomes understandable even if not commendable. If the Plaintiffhad to rely on this document to establish his case he might be in considerable difficulty, because the Defendant has pleaded thatthe agreement contained therein was illegal. However, as counsel for the Plaintiff has emphasised, he does not have to rely uponthat document: he relies upon the true agreement for sale and purchase which thisdocument was designed tohide. That there was intruth an agreement for sale and purchase is supported by two receipts issued by the Defendantâs wife for payments made by the Plaintiff:Exh. M<sup>1</sup> and Exh. P.The first of these was not signed by the Defendantâs wife but she admitted that she issued it as a receipt. Both receiptsare clearly referableto a sale and purchase.</p>	<p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I certainly do not overlook the fact that on the face of it the Agreement which was signed contains little which is consistent withthe Plaintiffâs allegation and much which is inconsistent with it. It is, however, also inherently suspect. However poor the NewTerritories taxi business may have been in December 1968 it is difficult to believe that use of a vehicle which was capable of passinga licensing examination would be given in return for a lump sum payment of â$2,000 oddâ and a monthly payment of $50 for tenyears. The $100 fee payable annually for filing the tax return would be reasonable enough if the Plaintiff were intended to operatethe vehicle on behalf of the Defendant and toaccount to the Defendant for the profits. It is common ground that no such intentionexisted. Indeed it was admitted by the Defendantâs wife that in return for the annual fee of $100 the Defendant would include inhis tax return a false return of the profits made with this taxi, such return being based on a wholly fictitious estimate made bythe Defendant and not upon any figures provided by the Plaintiff. The sum of $2,400 paid in the instalments acknowledged by Exh.M<sup>1</sup> and M<sup>2</sup> and Exh. P is not mentioned inthe Agreement, although the Defendantâs wife says that this is âthe remuneration for giving himthe right to manage or use the carâ.</p>	<p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It is not without significance that the old taxi had already been in service for eight years at the date of the Agreement Exh. Jand that according to the Defendant,a man experienced in the trade, it had a further life expectancy of two to three years. Subsequentlyhe said that, if properly maintained, the vehicle âcould be run for ten yearsâ. If by that he meant for ten years from the dateof the Agreement, I just do not believe him. Even allowing for a one hundred per cent error in his estimate oftwo to three yearsit is difficult to believe that if the transactionwas genuine the parties would have contracted for a period of a further ten years.</p>	<p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I believe that the Plaintiff has told me the truth about this contract and that there was an agreement for the sale and purchaseof the old taxi. He gave his evidence, for the most part, ina far more convincing manner than the Defendant and his wife. It maybe that the Plaintiff took advantage of the Defendantâs wife in obtainingthe original agreement for sale and purchase at a priceof $2,400 and that she attempted to redress the balance by asking for an additional payment before she would agree to the transferof the licence. However, by seizing the vehicle and claiming to be the owner of it I am satisfied that the Defendant was guilty ofconversion and became liable to pay damages to the Plaintiff.</p>	<p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The question then arises, whatdamages must he pay? and it must be borne in wind that the action lies in tort and not in contract.The Plaintiff claims to be entitled to $30,000 for a vehicle which, a year before, he had contracted to purchase for less than $20,000and which, as a chattel, had no scarcity value. The enormous value put upon it depends solely upon (1) the existence of the licenceand (2) the policy of restricting the number of such licences: although the Plaintiff could readily replace the vehicle with another,he could not use that other vehicle as a New Territories taxi. The added value attaches by virtue of the licensing policy, whichis extraneous to the chattel itself. Nevertheless it is clear that if the Plaintiff were awarded the cost of replacing the vehiclewithout this added value he would not be restored to the position in which he was at the time of the conversion, while, on the otherhand, the Defendant would be unjustly enriched by reason of his having the Plaintiffâs vehicle, which could still be used as aNew Territories taxi. If, of course, the Commissioner of Transport were to cancel the licence of the vehicle which was wrongly takenand to issue a licence for any substitute vehicle acquired by the Plaintiff, no difficulty would arise, and the assessment of damageswould be straight forward. Unfortunately this Court has no power to compel him to do this. No case has been cited to me where a scarcityvalue arising from a limited licensing scheme has been taken into account , but it seems to me that the licence here was of sucha nature that unless it is taken into account the Plaintiff will suffer an injustice. It was clearly damage which it could reasonablybe foreseen would result from the Defendantâs tort.</p>	<p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The evidence as to the market value, including âthe added valueâ, is very sparse but I see no reason to reject the evidence ofthe Plaintiff that â$30,000 oddâ could have been obtained at the time of the conversion, which is the material time. I think,however, that it would be wrong not to take into account the fact that the Defendant paid $9,994 in respect of instalments due onthe van (see Exh. R): these were instalments due under the hire purchase agreement and should have been paid by the Plaintiff regardlessof the fact that the Defendant had wrongfully deprived him of the use of the vehicle.</p>	<p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The counter-claim is based upon the Plaintiffâs failure to pay moneys due to the Hong Kong Garage Ltd. under the hire purchaseagreement, it being a term of the alleged agreement for the replacement of the old taxi that the Plaintiff would make such paymentsand that if he did not the Defendant should be entitled to pay them and to repossess the van. It follows from what I have alreadysaid that I do not accept that there was such an agreement for the replacement of the old taxi as that alleged by the Defendant:I find that the old taxi was sold to the Plaintiff, as evidenced by the documents to which I have previously referred (Exh. M<sup>1</sup> and Exh. P).</p>	<p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In the result there will be judgment for the Plaintiff on the claim in the sum of $20,006, with interest thereon at the rate of 8%per aunum from 24th December, 1969 and the Defendantâs counter-claim will be dismissed. The Plaintiff must have his costs on claimand counter-claim.</p>	<p> </p>    <p>Dennis Chang (Russ &amp; Co.) assigned for Plaintiff.</p>    <p>H. Y.
