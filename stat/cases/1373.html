The Writ was issued out ofthe Kowloon District Court on the 25<sup>th</sup> of March, 1972 as action No. 2527 of 1972. The defendant filed a defence to the action that bears no date except that there appearsat the top of the document the imprint of a rubber stamp showing the date to be the 30<sup>th</sup> of March, 1972. In his defence he claimed that although there was a fight at the time and place in question it was caused by theplaintiff who hit him first and that he merely acted in self defence. He admits in his defence that he was convicted on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of November in respect of a charge of assault under S.40 of the Offence against the Person Ordinance and was fined $750, but he maintainedthat he was hit first and that he acted only in self defence. He gave his address at two places firstly No. 93 Tung Choi Street,11<sup>th</sup> floor, Kowloon, and secondly Room 777, Block 12, Li Chang Uk Resettlement Estate, Kowloon.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The next step in the action was taken by the plaintiff when his solicitors Messrs. DâAlmada Remedios applied for a date of trialand on the 28<sup>th</sup> of April 1972 the hearing date was set for the 1<sup>st</sup> of June at 10 a.m. at the Victoria District Court an order being made for the transfer of this case to the Vicoria District Court.A formal notice of trial dated the 1<sup>st</sup> of May, 1972, was sent to the defendant by registered post to his address at Room 777, Block 12, Li Chang Uk R/E, Kowloon, one ofthe two addresses given by him on his statement of defence. The letter was returned with an endorsement in the form of an imprintof a rubber chop bearing the words âreturn to senderâ and a tick against the word âunclaimedâ. Evidence has been given bya clerk at the Victoria District Court Registry confirming the return of this letter unopened and varifying that when he opened theenvelope it contained the notice of trial giving full particulars. It appears from the Courtâs record that a further letter wassent to the respective parties in this case informing them of the new action No. V.C.J. Action No. and of the time and date for hearing.This second letter was addressed to the defendant at the first of the 2 addresses given by him in his statement of defence, namelyNo. 93 Tung Choi Street, 11<sup>th</sup> floor Kowloon. Again the envelope was returned bearing the same imprint from a rubber stamp with the words âreturned to senderâand a tick opposite the word âunknownâ. On the day of the trial, not surprisingly the defendant failed to appear. On hearingthe evidence of the Registry Clerk of the Victoria District Court, I was satisfied that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/336A/s38e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 38E(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/336A" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Civil Procedure (General) Rules</a> regarding service of the notice had been complied with. The hearing therefore carried on.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff went into the witness box and described the circumstances which led up to the assault, and also gave details of theassault. It would appear from his evidence that the defendant was at one time a very good friend of the plaintiff, but that theirrelationship changed when the defendant made off with the plaintiffâs wife. Eventually the plaintiff entered into a separationagreement with his wife under which he agreed to allow the wife to retain custody of the three children of their marriage. This agreementwas made in August, 1971.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Shortly after this in August 1971 the eldest daughter of the marriage came back to the plaintiff and begged him to let her stay withhim, because the defendant had been ill-treating her. He therefore telephoned his wife and asked her to come and take away the child,and also to tell the defendant not to ill-treat her.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> However early in November 1971 the same thing happened again, but on this occasion the eldest daughter came to the plaintiff withthe other 2 children, claiming that the defendant ill-treated them. Once again the plaintiff made arrangements for his wife to takethem back. This incident was followed then days later by the plaintiffâs eldest daughter ringing him up on the telephone and begginghim to let her stay with him as she was ill-treated. The plaintiff arranged to meet her at her school but also rang up his wife makingarrangements for her to also meet them at school. When they had all met at the school, they went of the police station in order toresolve their problems, but were unable to get any assistance from the police as it was a domestic matter, though they were advisedthat a reasonable solution would be to allow the children to select the parent with whom they wanted to stay. The children then allsaid that they wanted to stay with the plaintiff so he took them home.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The following day the plaintiff received a telephone call from the defendant saying unless the children were returned he would bebeaten up and that he would also have to apologise. The defendant further accused the plaintiff of telling people that he had snatchedthe plaintiffâs wife away from him saying that this had impaired his reputation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The assault upon which this action is based, took place on the 17<sup>th</sup> of November, 1971 at about 2.15 p.m. on the ground floor of the building at No. 733 Nathan Road, Kowloon, at a spot just outsidethe lift. When the plaintiff arrived to take the lift up to his office on the 13<sup>th</sup> floor, there were 6 people waiting for him outside the lift on the ground floor. Of the 6 people, one was the defendant, anotherwas the plaintiffâs wife, and a third was a man called Chan Keung. The identity of the other 3 has not been disclosed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> As soon as the plaintiff saw the 6 persons, the defendant said âThis is the bugger. Hit him.â He then gave the plaintiff a blowwith his fist and said to the other men âDonât be afraid. Beat him up. Chung Ming Kwong is my friend.â (The plaintiff did notknow this man Chung Ming Kwong at the time but subsequently learned that it was the name of a detective station sergeant at the MongkokPolice Station). The defendant and the other three men then beat up the plaintiff with fist blows and also they kicked him at thesame time. The plaintiff described this assault in some detail, and there can be no doubt that it was a deliberate and most viciousassault upon the plaintiff, as a result of which the plaintiff suffered multiple bruises over his limbs, neck, ribs, back and sides.Fortunately for him a detective who happened to be passing saw what was happening and took the plaintiff to the police station wherethe plaintiff became unconscious as a result of the assault. The plaintiff was eventually sent to hospital where he regained consciousness,and was a patient for three days.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Subsequently the defendant and one of the other assailants Chan Keung were prosecuted in the Magistrateâs Court, and were bothconvicted and fined. The defendant was fined $750, and Chan Keung was fined $1000. The Plaintiff was present throughout the trialat the Magistrateâs Court and heard the man Chan Keung admit 10 previous convictions, one of which was of a similar character.Chan Keung declined to give evidence in the Magistrateâs Court, and the plaintiff formed the opinion that he was a professionalfighter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> There can be no doubt that because of the strained relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, and because the plaintiffat the request of the children took the children back to his home, this assault was deliberate and planned attack by these four menupon the plaintiff to compel the plaintiff to return the children to his wife. I think anyone hearing the story of the plaintiff,would feel that the defendantâs conduct in the circumstances was outrageous. The defendantâs attitude arranging for the beatingup of the plaintiff, was wilful and unlawful conduct of a high order.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Mr. Remedios who appeared for the plaintiff informed the Court that no special damages were claimed, only general damages. He thenaddressed the Court on the subject of the law relating to exemplary damages. He referred first to the case of <u>London v. Ryder</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1953 2 Q.B.D. p.202.</a> In that case there was a dispute between the plaintiff and her mother over the devolution of certain property which had been leftto the plaintiff by her father. At the instigation of the plaintiffâs mother the plaintiff was assaulted by a man who was the friendof the plaintiffâs mother. There was very little physical injury from the assault, but the plaintiff suffered shock. The jury awardedthe plaintiff Â£5500 made up in the following way. Â£1500 for trespass and Â£4000 for combined assault, in the proportion of assaultÂ£1000 and exemplary damages Â£3000. In both the reported case and the present case the plaintiff was assaulted by a third partyin respect of a personal dispute between the plaintiff and a close member of the plaintiffâs family. The facts of the present case,however, would appear to justify even more an award of exemplary damages against the defendant because the act of the defendant wasdeliberate and premeditated act, and because the assault was committed by four people upon the plaintiff who was alone.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The reported case was decision of the Court of Appeal. Its effect as a precedent however was severely limited when in 1964 the Houseof Lords restricted the sort of cases in which exemplary damages could be awarded to 3 defined categories. (<u>Rookes v. Barnard</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1964 1 A.E.R. p.367).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Lord Devlinsâs judgment in the Rookes case has however come under attack in most of the Commonwealth countries. The Privy councilhas supported the High Court of Australia in a judgment which marshalls the arguments against the new doctrine (see <u>Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v. Uren</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1967 3 A.E.R. p.523</a> and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1969 1 A.C. p.590)</a> The new doctrine in Rookes case was recently condemned by the Court of Appeal in England in the case of <u>Broome v. Cassell &amp; Co. Ltd. and another</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1971 2 A.E.R. p.187.</a> It was held by the Court of Appeal that the decision of the House of Lords in Rookes case on the question of exemplary damages wasmade per incuriam because it was in conflict with earlier decisions of the House of Lords and, when the case was decided, the Housewas bound to follow its own previous decision; furthermore the decision was made without any argument on the point, and the decisionwas not therefore binding on the Court of Appeal. It further held that there was therefore no rule restricting the award of exemplarydamages in tort actions to the narrowly defined categories of cases described in <u>Rookes v. Barnard</u> which were in any case illogical and unworkable; the power of common law to award exemplary damages in appropriate cases was wellsettled. It further suggested per curiam that the difficulties presented by <u>Rookes v. Barnard</u> were so great that until the House of Lords has considered the problem again judges should direct juries in accordance with the lawas it was understood before <u>Rookes v. Barnard</u>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The Court of Appeal did not have to wait long for the House of Lords to consider the problem again because the first appellant appealedfrom the Court of Appealâs decision. The hearing lasted 13 working days before the appellate committee of the House comprisingLord Hailsham of St. Marylebone L.C., Lord Reid, Lord Morris of borth-y-gest, Viscount Dilhorne, Lord Wilberforce, Lord Diplock andLord Kilbrandon.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> It was held (Viscount Dilhorne Dissenting) that <u>Rookes v. Barnard</u> was not arrived at per incuriam and further that in the hierarchial system of the English courts it was not, in any event, open tothe Court of Appeal to direct Judges of the first instance to ignore a decision of the House. (Cassell &amp; Co. Ltd. and Broome <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%202%20WLR%20645" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 2 W.L.R. 645).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> <u>Rookes v. Barnard</u> must therefore still be regarded as defining the common law of England with regard to the categories for which exemplary damagescan properly be awarded. (The Privy Council in <u>Australian Consolidated Press Ltd. v. Uren</u> upheld the decision of the High Court of Australia only on the basis of the law of Australia).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> However as has now been made clear, there is a distinction between exemplary damages and aggravated damages. It is only with regardto the former that the categories are restricted by the decision in <u>Rookes v. Barnard.</u></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Lord Hailsham makes this abundantly clear in the following passage from his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIn awarding âaggravatedâ damages, as distinct from âexemplaryâ damages, the natural indignation of the court is a legitimatemotive in making a generous, rather than moderate, solatium. Since the injury was greater because of the defendantsâ conduct excitingthe indignation. The three categories enumerated in <u>Rookes v. Barnard</u> were concerned with cases where, beyond what was awarded for loss of reputation, injured feelings, outraged morality, protectionagainst further calumny or outage, an additional sum was needed to vindicate the strength of the law and supplement its strictlypenal provisions.â (at p.674 D-F)â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I am satisfied that in the present case I have power to award aggravated damages though not exemplary damages. Taking into accountin the present case the obvious feelings of hurt pride which the plaintiff felt, the pain and suffering he felt, the high handedaction and out-rageous conduct of the defendant showing a complete contempt for the plaintiffâs rights as a member of the public,I could award damages to the plaintiff in a sum of $2,000.00 with costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">           </p>    <p style="text-align:justify">           </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center"><span>(sd.)
