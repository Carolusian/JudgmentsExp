As part of the admission procedure, he visited the University in October1993 and met the 2nd and 3rd defendants, both of whom assured him that he could pursue his research interests in the Ph.D. programmewith all their help. The 2nd defendant further told him that there would be no problem for him to work in Hong Kong to earn an incometo supplement his expenses for his studies, which, the plaintiff says, was an important factor for him to decide to come to HongKong as he was not a rich person. The 3rd defendant also had lunch with him and his wife and took them for a tour of the old chemistrydepartment and its facilities. He discussed with the 3rd defendant the specific and general areas of chemical physics that he wasinterested in and the 3rd defendant again assured him that he would do his best to help him. He was admitted to the Ph.D. programmein Chemical Physics on 28th January 1994.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="37"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p3" name="p3">3.</a> Things, however, did not turn out in the way that he had wanted. Instead of helping him and giving him advice, the 3rd defendanthad created all sorts of difficulties for him. The matter got worse and worse. In June 1994, the 3rd defendant told him that he hadto publish works on a yearly basis in an international journal, which, the plaintiff says, was not a requirement in the graduateprospectus of the University. As a result, he wrote to the 1st defendant asking for a payment of $150,000 as <brs_term brs_term_id="51" brs_term_type="9">damages</brs_term> for the period from 31st January 1994 to 31st January 1995. This was rejected and it was also denied that the 3rd defendant had madethe remarks regarding publication. On 5th February 1995, the plaintiff made a request that he be allowed to change the title of hisPh.D. thesis from &quot;The Chemical Physics of Ultrasonic Cavitation&quot; to &quot;The Biological Effects of UV Enhanced Ultrasoundon the Cleaning of Cholera from Fish Tank Water in Hong Kong.&quot; He also suggested that he should complete his research work forhis Ph.D. degree in the Faculty of Medicine instead of the Faculty of Science. These requests were also rejected and he was toldthat he &quot;should complete his research in the field of study for which he was formally registered.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="38"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> He appealed against the decisions to the Vice Chancellor who appointed Professor Weatherhead to look into the matter. On 25th February1995, the University extended his <brs_term brs_term_id="2" brs_term_type="4">probationary period</brs_term> for an additional 6 months to 31st July 1995 to &quot;focus in research in the approved field for which he was registered.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="39"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> After discussions with Professor Weatherhead, the plaintiff indicated that he would accept a M.Phil degree in two years i.e. up to31st January 1996. The 2nd and 3rd defendants continued blocking or obstructing his research. On 11th October 1995, he was &quot;kickedout&quot; of the University. He paid the tuition fees for the Ph.D. programme on 7th October 1995 which was accepted by the University.He had never wanted or accepted to take a M.Phil degree. On 23rd November 1995 the University &quot;illegally deposited&quot; $12,000into his bank account which, he alleges, was an admission of guilt on their part. He had altogether spent a total of $200,000 onhis tuition fees, living and other expenses during the two years of his stay in Hong Kong. After deducting $12,000 repaid to himby the University, he is still owed $188,000 and he claims this sum against the defendants.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="40"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a> A <brs_term brs_term_id="54" brs_term_type="9">defence</brs_term> was <brs_term brs_term_id="56" brs_term_type="9">filed</brs_term> on behalf of the defendants on 2nd February 1996 which alleges that the plaintiff's claim discloses no reasonable course of actionagainst the defendants; it is <brs_term brs_term_id="52" brs_term_type="9">frivolous</brs_term> and <brs_term brs_term_id="53" brs_term_type="9">vexatious</brs_term> and is otherwise an <brs_term brs_term_id="55" brs_term_type="9">abuse</brs_term> of process.

On the plaintiff's own case, he pursued the interests in the Ph.D. programme before he was &quot;kicked out&quot;. He did whateverresearch he had wanted. If he was denied a Ph.D. degree, the remedies are either to appeal within the Hong Kong University and toseek a <brs_term brs_term_id="74" brs_term_type="9">judicial review</brs_term> of its decision, which are of course too late to pursue now. The denial of an opportunity to obtain a Ph.D. degree was never raised.At best, the <brs_term brs_term_id="20" brs_term_type="9">alleged</brs_term> <brs_term brs_term_id="106" brs_term_type="9">misrepresentation</brs_term> was that he was allowed to work but denied a Ph.D. degree. But where does that get us to? The second <brs_term brs_term_id="107" brs_term_type="9">representation</brs_term> was that the plaintiff was told by the 2nd defendant that he could work in Hong Kong while taking part in the Ph.D. programme. Thiswas a <brs_term brs_term_id="108" brs_term_type="9">representation</brs_term> of law and not fact. The 2nd defendant was not a lawyer. There was nothing to stop the plaintiff from applying subsequently for aworking visa. This <brs_term brs_term_id="114" brs_term_type="9">representation</brs_term> was not relied on by the plaintiff because he must have found out after he came to Hong Kong and he nevertheless stayed on until1995. He never complained to the defendants that he could not work or could not find employment in Hong Kong. On this, Mr. Reyessubmits that there was no <brs_term brs_term_id="4" brs_term_type="2">causative damage</brs_term> and it could hardly be said that there was any special relationship between the 2nd and 3rd defendants and the plaintiff, particularlyon the question of the work visa. In any event, the <brs_term brs_term_id="115" brs_term_type="9">representations</brs_term> were made before the plaintiff was admitted to the University.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="48"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p14" name="p14">14.</a> Mr. Reyes says that the new allegations of fraud and theft are different from the <brs_term brs_term_id="43" brs_term_type="9">pleaded case</brs_term> and it puts the defendants in an even more embarrassing position. Fraud has not been <brs_term brs_term_id="5" brs_term_type="2">pleaded with particularity</brs_term> and there is not a <brs_term brs_term_id="6" brs_term_type="4">shred of evidence</brs_term> to justify it.

If there is any <brs_term brs_term_id="83" brs_term_type="9">sustainable claim</brs_term> against him, it has not been <brs_term brs_term_id="86" brs_term_type="9">pleaded</brs_term> in the <brs_term brs_term_id="84" brs_term_type="9">statement of claim</brs_term> clearly or at all.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="51"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> I agree with the judge in so far as the 1st defendant is concerned.

The plaintiff is obviously deeply aggrieved about what he regards as the blockageof his efforts to get a Ph.D. from the Hong Kong University. He clearly got a very full and careful hearing from Woo J., who canbe seen from his <brs_term brs_term_id="29" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> to have gone to a great deal of trouble to ascertain what his complaints were and whether they could found any legal claims. As hesaid:</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="58"><p class="quote">&quot;The plaintiff's <brs_term brs_term_id="46" brs_term_type="9">Statement of Claim</brs_term> is obviously not drawn by a person trained in Hong Kong or English law. It contains a lengthy account of events leading up to hisclaim, without distinguishing between facts and evidence. What is most unacceptable is the arguments and comments, vituperative attimes, which apparently were used to air his grievance rather than presenting the matter to the court with clarity or precision.However, I do not take any of these against the plaintiff as he has been <brs_term brs_term_id="90" brs_term_type="9">acting in person</brs_term>. As far as I can make out, it appears to me that the plaintiff's claim against the 2nd and 3rd defendants is based on various representationsor <brs_term brs_term_id="93" brs_term_type="9">statements</brs_term> made by them to him. The crux of the plaintiff's complaint is that he had been told by the two defendants that he could pursue hisspecified research interests as a Ph.D. student at HKU and he was debarred from doing so eventually. ... The remainder of the <brs_term brs_term_id="91" brs_term_type="9">Statement of Claim</brs_term> deals with how the plaintiff was blocked from obtaining a Ph.D. or a lesser M. Phil. degree by the acts of the 2nd defendant andperhaps, the 1st defendant.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="59"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p19" name="p19">19.</a> Before us he relied on those same facts and allegations.

The latter matter was mentioned below with other irrelevant complaints and allegations, but not put forward asthe basis of a claim. Moreover what that claim may be in law is not apparent. The first, he says, arises out of the research he wouldhave done had he been permitted but which has now been &quot;stolen&quot; by other researchers across the world producing what hewould have produced. It is not easy to see how this can be the basis of a legal claim nor how it could be sustained by the facts.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="61"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p21" name="p21">21.</a> There is clearly no <brs_term brs_term_id="96" brs_term_type="9">merit</brs_term> in his appeal, nor so far as I can see in his complaints and allegations.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="62"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a> I also would <brs_term brs_term_id="33" brs_term_type="9">dismiss</brs_term> the appeal and allow the <brs_term brs_term_id="8" brs_term_type="2">cross appeals</brs_term> of the 2nd and 3rd defendants and make an order <brs_term brs_term_id="97" brs_term_type="9">nisi</brs_term> that the defendants are to have their costs of the appeals.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="63"><p><a class="pseudopara" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> The appeal is accordingly <brs_term brs_term_id="34" brs_term_type="9">dismissed</brs_term> and the <brs_term brs_term_id="98" brs_term_type="9">cross appeals</brs_term> allowed with <brs_term brs_term_id="9" brs_term_type="2">costs orders nisi</brs_term> that the defendants are to have their respective costs of the appeal and <brs_term brs_term_id="99" brs_term_type="9">cross appeals</brs_term>; the order will become absolute upon the expiration of 14 days from the date of the handing down of this <brs_term brs_term_id="103" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term>, if no application is received before then for the appeal to be listed for the hearing of <brs_term brs_term_id="47" brs_term_type="9">submissions on costs</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="64"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="65"><p> </p></brs_paragraph>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <brs_paragraph id="66"><td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(G.
