The proceedings concernedthe right of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to occupy the property known as No. 4A South Bay Road (âthe propertyâ) after the expiration of a notice to quit servedon her by the plaintiffs on 24 December 1999.  The judge found that the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants were guilty of trespass in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs occupation of the property for nine days between 2 and 11 October 2000 and awarded the plaintiffs damages which heassessed at $36,812.90 together with interest.  It was also ordered that the property be sold by public tender with a reserve pricebut that part of the order was made with the consent of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants and does not form the subject matter of the appeal and cross-appeal.  At the conclusion of the hearing, judgment was reservedwhich we now give.</p>    <p class="heading">The facts</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Cheung Kung Hai (âthe fatherâ) was a wealthy Singaporean businessman.  He came to Hong Kong in 1961 and built an eight-bedroomedhouse on the property in 1967 as a home for his wife Lim Bee and the eight children of that marriage consisting of a son Cheung ChinChye (âCCCâ) and seven daughters including the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The father had a concubine namely, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff with whom he had three sons, Cheung Kee Wee (âCKWâ), Cheung Lin Wee (âCLWâ) and Cheung Ying Wee (âCYWâ) andthree daughters.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and her children lived in a flat at No.4 South Bay Road and at a later date in a house in Blackâs Link.  The judge foundthat the relationship between the half siblings was less than harmonious.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The father also had two adopted sons, Cheung Theam Siew (âCTSâ) and the late Cheung Kwong Wai.  Three of the daughters includingthe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant are unmarried.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Starting from 1967, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant assisted in the family business together with CTS.  In 1975, when she was sent to take charge of the family business inSingapore, she maintained a room in the property which she used whenever she returned to Hong Kong.  In 1976, CKW joined the familybusiness in Hong Kong.  Lim Bee died in 1977.  At about that time the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant returned to work in Hong Kong and lived in the property.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The family business which was property orientated experienced financial difficulties in the early 1980s when uncertainty over thefuture of Hong Kong led to a drop in the property market.  On 30 October 1982, the father assigned his interest in the property tothe 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, CCC, CKW, CLW and CTS in equal shares as tenants in common (âthe 1982 assignmentâ).  The judge found that the assignmentwas made to protect the property from possible enforcement action by creditors of the family business as the father was the guarantorof the business debts.  Given that finding, he had little difficulty in holding that the presumption of a gift to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and 4 sons had been rebutted.  The father was to live for another 18 years after the 1982 assignment.  As will become apparent,he remained in possession either actually or through Lim Beeâs children right up to his death in October 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In 1984, the father and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff relocated to Taiwan and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was again sent to work in Singapore.  She nevertheless maintained a room in the property for her use whenever she was inHong Kong.  The father maintained control of the Hong Kong business from Taiwan, with CTS and CKW being responsible for the day-to-daymanagement in Hong Kong.  At about this time, CLW also joined the family business in Hong Kong.  In the following year, CTS emigratedto Canada and re-assigned his 1/5 share in the property to the 4<sup>th</sup> plaintiff in exchange for some assets from the father.  The judge, apparently erroneously (although nothing turns on this) thoughtthat the 4<sup>th</sup> plaintiff was owned and controlled by CKW, CLW and CYW when it was in fact owned by Doran Ltd which the father and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff controlled at the time and only later came to be controlled by CKW, CLW and CYW.  The judge summed up the situation in1985 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Lim Beeâs children were ousted from the family business in Hong Kong and were replaced by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs sons; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs sons together with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff became the legal owners of 4/5ths of the family home for Lim Beeâs children but the <i>de facto</i> possession remained unchanged.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In the late 1980s, CLW and CKW assigned their respective interests in the property to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiffs, companies which they respectively controlled. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  When the father and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff returned to live in Hong Kong in 1987, they did not move to live in the property; rather, they resided in a house in Shatin. The property remained as a home exclusively for Lim Beeâs children.  By 1989, CPK, a sister of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was the only person living in the property although the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was still working in Singapore maintained a room which she used whenever she returned to Hong Kong.  CPK accepted thefatherâs offer to buy her a flat in Repulse Bay and moved out of the property in 1990.  Although a similar offer had been madeto the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, she declined.  When the father and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff moved into the property in 1990, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was still working in Singapore, continued to maintain a room there and used it whenever she was in Hong Kong.  Thefather renewed his offer to purchase a flat for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in 1995 but the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not take it up.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  CCC died in Singapore in 1995.  On 27 November 1996, letters of administration were granted in Singapore to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants who are his sons and the sole beneficiaries of his estate.  They obtained a re-sealed grant of administration to CCCâsestate in Hong Kong on 11 October 2000. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant returned from Singapore in 1996 and lived in the property with the father and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  In May 1996, the father was diagnosed as suffering from a brain tumour.  That affected his walking ability, obliginghim to use a wheelchair whenever he went out.  He and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff moved to a flat in Grenville House in late 1996.  The judge found that he did so for health reasons and rejected the plaintiffâscase of constructive exclusion by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant particularly as the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff who was in a position to give first hand evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs alleged intolerable behaviour was never called to give evidence in support of the plaintiffsâ case.  The fatherâshealth continued to deteriorate.  He had operations in January 1997, August 1998 and September 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  After her return to Hong Kong, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant began to suspect that she was being systematically excluded from the family business.  When she complained to her fatherthat her half siblings CKW and CLW were receiving higher salaries than herself, she was told that her salary included an elementof rent-free accommodation in the property.  Whilst there had been unhappy quarrels between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the family companies particularly in the second half of the 1990s, the judge found that there was no evidence to suggestthat any of the plaintiffs or the father objected to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs occupation of the property.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In about 1999, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had further complaints about various matters relating to the family business including a complaint concerning the receiptof salary by one of her half sisters from the family business without working for any of the family companies.  Those disputes ledto the issue of a notice to quit on 24 December 1999 by the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff on behalf of the plaintiffs (who were 4 out of 5 tenants in common) requiring her to vacate the property within 30 daysâassuming that [the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant] had been occupying the property as a licenseeâ. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and one of her sisters had a meeting with the father on 17 February 2000 in the presence of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant produced a tape recording and a transcript of the conversation that took place during the meeting.  The judge summarisedthe gist of that conversation at paragraph 45 of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhen the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant asked if the Father knew about the action taken by the half-siblings to evict her from the Property, the Father said unequivocallythat he did not know.  He did not categorically tell the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that he had revoked her licence or that what the half-siblings did was with his consent or words to that effect. â¦  Thisevidence was not challenged by the Plaintiffs.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Several events occurred on 31 May 2000.  On that day, the father signed an affirmation to the effect that he had never granted anypermission to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to remain on the property for so long as she wished, that he moved out to avoid quarrels, that he did not recall the conversationwith him on 17 February 2000, and that the writ seeking vacant possession from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was issued on 1 February 2000 with his knowledge and consent.  The affirmation which was written in English was signedin the presence of Mr Sit, a solicitor.  Mr Sit who had interpreted the contents to the father was satisfied that the father understoodthe contents before signing the affirmation.  However, the judge gave no weight to it because the judge concluded that what the fatherhad said in that affirmation was unreliable given the fact that although he had been given details of the February 2000 conversationwith the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the father said in his affirmation that could not recall the conversation at all having regard to the fact that the evidenceof that conversation and its contents were unchallenged.  Also on 31 May 2000, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs employment by the family companies was terminated.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The father died on 2 October 2000. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The judge accepted the evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had their consent to live at the property and that she also had the consent of CCC to do so before his death in 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Based on those facts, the judge reached the following conclusions:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had implied authority from the plaintiffs to reside in the property at least until the expiration of the notice to quitby 23 January 2000;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs entitlement to reside in the property as part of her remuneration package for working in the family business terminatedon 31 May 2000 when her employment by the family companies came to an end;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the fact that Lim Beeâs children remained in undisturbed possession of the property for about 20 years after the 1982 assignmentcoupled with the fact that the assignment was not a gift nor made for valuable consideration gave rise to an irresistible inferencethat the assignees of the 1982 assignment took the legal title subject to certain obligations;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">those obligations were described by the judge (at paragraph 27 of his judgment) in the following terms:</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">â27.   â¦ it was understood by members of the family, including the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and her half-siblings to whom the Property was assigned, that despite the assignment, the Property would remain as thefamily home for the Lim Beeâs line of children and that the Father, as head of the family, would continue to make decisions asregards the Property, though he no longer held its legal title.  What in fact she was saying in laymenâs term is that the Propertywas held on trust by the assignees for the Father, even though it was not so pleaded.  Accordingly, I find that despite the assignment,the Father remained as the beneficial owner of the Property, at least to the extent of a life interest in the Property.  He may remainin possession in the Property for as long as he wished and may grant licence to anyone to use and enjoy the Property. â¦â</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(5)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">given the fatherâs interest in the property, he had the power to and did grant the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant a licence to stay in the property which was never revoked during his lifetime; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(6)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs occupation of the property was non-exclusive.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Although the judge rejected the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs defences based on family tradition, arrangement or understanding in favour of an unmarried daughter and estoppel, hisfindings summarised above meant that the plaintiffsâ claim in trespass prior to 2 October 2000 fell to be dismissed.  As to the1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs occupation after the death of the father on 2 October 2000, it was contended on her behalf that she was entitled todo so with the permission and as the ârepresentative or agentâ of the estate of CCC.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The judge held that (1) until the re-sealing of the grant in Hong Kong on 11 October 2000, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants had no interest in the property; (2) beneficiaries under an intestacy have no beneficial interest in the assets of theestate and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants as CCCâs beneficiaries were not in a position to grant the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant a licence to occupy the property applying <i>Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Livingstone</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20AC%20694" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] AC 694</a>; (3) the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants from the date of re-sealing of the grant as administrators of CCCâs estate were entitled to authorise the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to occupy, use and enjoy the property on a non-exclusive basis on their behalf whether as agent or licensee; and (4) thatsuch licence could not be terminated by the plaintiffs without the consent of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.  Those findings meant that between 2 and 11 October 2000, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in occupation as a trespasser and he so held.  The damages awarded in favour of the plaintiffs for that period werebased on 4/5ths of the rental value of the property, which the judge assessed at $36,812.90.</p>    <p class="heading">The appeal</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The appeal focused on two matters: (1) the fatherâs life interest in the property; and (2) the ability of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants as representatives of the estate of one of the tenants in common to grant a licence to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. </p>    <p class="heading">Life interest</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The thrust of the argument was that it was not open to the judge on the pleadings to find that the father had a life interest inthe property.  It was said that even if there had been the understanding that notwithstanding the 1982 assignment, the father coulddeal with the property as he liked, that would not have created any proprietary interest in the property.  Any obligation in thatcontext could only have been binding either in personam or as a matter of honour.  It was also said that a person who only had alife interest was not in the position to dictate how the property was to be dealt with.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In paragraph 8 of the re-amended defence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, particulars were given of the assertion that she had been occupying the property pursuant to a family arrangement.  Paragraph(11) read as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="8%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">â(11)</td>                <td width="87%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">In the early 1980s the Cheung family group of companies controlled by the said Cheung Kung Hai experienced financial difficulties;the said Cheung Kung Hai had personally guaranteed repayment of loans made to those companies; in order to avoid the Property beingthe subject of enforcement proceedings, the said Cheung Kung Hai caused ownership of the Property to be transferred to his secondwife Chin Lan Hong (the 1st Plaintiff) and to his sons, namely, Cheung Chin Chye, Cheung Theam Siew, Cheung Kee Wee and Cheung LinWee; the said transfers were made on the understanding between Cheung Kung Hai, the said transferees and all members of the familythat the Property was, and would continue to be, the family home and that the said Cheung Kung Hai, as head of the family, wouldcontinue to make decisions as regards the Property despite its no longer being registered in his name and that the Property wouldcontinue to be available for members of the family to live in.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>There was a request for further and better particulars directed at the alleged understanding of the property remaining the familyhome as to whether it constituted a binding contract or is otherwise enforceable at all and, if so, the legal basis thereof.  Thefollowing particulars were given:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="7%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">â(5)</td>                <td width="88%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">A licence revocable in limited circumstances (namely the provision of equivalent alternative accommodation by the paterfamilias) only,binding upon the Plaintiffs in equity.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>There was never any request made of the understanding regarding the fatherâs right to âcontinue to make decisionsâ.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr Shieh SC who appeared for the plaintiffs submitted that that answer given to the request was inconsistent with any suggestionof the carving out of a life interest for the father and the father then granting a licence.  But when fairly read, the answer statedquite clearly that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was asserting a licence granted by the father and which was binding on the plaintiffs in equity.  It was further submittedthat the plaintiffsâ understanding of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs case that her right to live at the property was linked to the unmarried daughterâs equity which did not find favourwith the judge.  But the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs pleadings amounted to this: notwithstanding the 1982 assignment, there was a family understanding to the effect thatnot only could the father continue to use the property as a family home, but also that as regards any matter that had to do withthe property, in colloquial language, the father would still be âcalling the shotsâ.  Those matters must, it seems, include anydecision to renovate, redevelop, lease or sell the property.  That right or interest must necessarily encompass a right to grantthe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant a licence to occupy the property on a non-exclusive basis.  Once granted, that licence would be binding on the plaintiffsin equity and whilst it was revocable by the father, he could only do so in limited circumstances, namely, by providing the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant with the equivalent alternative accommodation.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In paragraph 27 of his judgment (cited above), the judge accepted the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs evidence as regards the family understanding concerning the 1982 assignment outlined above.  As I understand it, thisappeal has not been put on the basis that the judgeâs finding of the existence of the family understanding that the father wouldcontinue to make decisions regarding the property should be reversed.  In other words, no challenge is being made in the appeal againstthis finding of fact.  That being so, it must follow from that finding that despite the 1982 assignment, the father did retain abeneficial interest in the property.  Whether or not the judge was correct to describe that interest as a âlife interestâ inthe property matters not. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It was urged before this court that a finding of âa full beneficial ownershipâ would have serious estate duty implications. But the possibility of such implications arising ought not deter the court from reaching such a conclusion if warranted by the evidenceand if necessary for the resolution of the issue between the parties.  In my view, it is unnecessary to explore the precise parametersof that interest or to give it a label because during the lifetime of the father, at a minimum, it was an interest that enabled himto grant the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant a licence to occupy the property non-exclusively during his lifetime which was binding in equity on the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I should briefly mention the plaintiffsâ fallback position.  It was said that the father had, at the latest by 31 May 2000, withdrawnany permission for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to remain in occupation.  This submission was grounded upon the affirmation signed by the father in the presence of MrSit, a solicitor whose unchallenged evidence the judge had found to be of âundoubted credibilityâ.  As noted above (see paragraph17), the judge attached no weight to Mr Sitâs evidence.  Suffice it to say that on no view could it be said that the judge wasplainly wrong in so doing.  To the contrary, there was ample material before the judge to warrant the finding made.  The followingextract is from Mr Sitâs evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">Q.</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">I see.

It shows that the father, then 85 and ailing, was not a person in controlof his faculties.  It gave the impression of a sick and elderly man mechanically repeating what the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had reminded him of without any real recollection or understanding, susceptible to manipulation and a person with an apparentlack of memory.  The latter alone would negate âinformedâ consent.  There is simply no basis for interfering with the judgeâstreatment of the evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether one of several tenants in common may grant a non-exclusive licence</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In practical terms, the question is whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants could validly grant the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant a licence to occupy the property on a non-exclusive basis as from 11 October 2000 notwithstanding objections from the othertenants in common.  Mr Shieh SC relied on <i>Annen v Rattee</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%201%20EGLR%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 1 EGLR 136</a> and <i>Robson-Paul v Farrugia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%2020%20P%20%26%20CR%20820" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 20 P&amp;CR 820</a> for the proposition that one of several tenants in common may not unilaterally and against the wishes of the other tenants in commongrant a licence to a third-party that was effective against the other tenants in common, the corollary of which may be put on thebasis that a co-owner may terminate a licence granted by another co-owner to occupy the property jointly owned by them.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I propose, first of all, to consider the rights of legal tenants in common.  Their rights were stated by Denning LJ in <i>Bull v Bull</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%201%20QB%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 1 QB 234</a> at 237 in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âEach of them is entitled to the possession of the land and to the use and enjoyment of it in a proper manner.  Neither can turnout the other; but if one of them should take more than his proper share the injured party can bring an action for an account.  Ifone of them should go so far as to oust the other he is guilty of a trespass: see <i>Jacobs v. Seward</i>.  Such being the rights of legal tenants in common, I think that the rights of equitable owners in common are the same, <i>save only for such differences as are necessarily consequent on the interest being equitable and not legal</i>.  It is well known that equity follows the law; and it does so in these cases about tenants in common as in othersâ.  (<i>emphasis added</i>)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>These rights were more recently considered in the decision of Paterson J in <i>U-Needa Laundry Ltd v Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20NZLR%20308" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 NZLR 308:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[24]    â¦ Because a tenant in common has an undivided share, that tenant is free to deal with his or her share as he or she seesfit.  On the other hand, joint tenants do not have undivided shares.  In the case of joint tenants, as the property or rights areheld jointly, a transfer or lease must be by or under the authority of all interested.  Because of the unity of title, it is notpossible for one co-owner to deal with the property without the authority of others.  That is not the position with tenancy in commonas the co-owner is only dealing with his or her particular interest in the title.  It is the interest of the co-owner which is beingleased and which entitles the lessee to possession to be shared with the other co-owners.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[25]      For the above reasons I am of the view that the statements in the English authority are not relevant to the legal rightsof tenants in common in New Zealand.  The position in New Zealand is as it was in the United Kingdom before the passing of the Lawof Property Act 1925 (UK).  That position was stated in <i>Woodfall: Landlord and Tenant</i> in para 2.102 as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âTenants in common needed to have only unity of possession; they might have unequal shares, and there was no right of survivorship. Each tenant in common could at common law make a lease in respect of his own share alone, the interest of each being separate anddistinct, and if tenants in common all joined in one lease it operated as a lease by each of his respective share, and a confirmationby each as to the shares of the others.ââ</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The position in Hong Kong is similar to that in Australia and New Zealand and in the United Kingdom prior to the 1925 legislation. A tenant in common is entitled to deal, in whatever way he desires, with his own undivided share: he may lease it or dispose ofhis right to possession to a stranger as he likes without the concurrence of the other tenants in common.  See <i>Incorporated Owners of Chungking Mansions v Shamdasani</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%202%20HKC%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 2 HKC 342</a> at 352 G-H.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  What then of the authorities relied on by Mr Shieh?  The first matter to note is that both authorities are based on the decisionof Lord Tenterden CJ in <i>Doe d Aslin v Summersett</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281830%29%201%20B%20%26%20Ad%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1830) 1 B &amp; Ad 135</a>, a case concerning the rights of joint tenants in law and in equity.  In that case, the land in question had been devised to thetwo lessors of the plaintiff as joint tenants.  The question before the court was whether a notice to quit, signed by one of twojoint tenants, was sufficient to put an end to the tenancy.  In holding that the notice was sufficient, Lord Tenterden CJ gave thefollowing explanation (at page 739):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBut, though upon a joint lease by joint-tenants each demises his own share, this is not the only operation of such a lease.  Joint-tenantsare seised not only of their respective shares, per my, but also of the entirety, per tout; Litt. s. 288.  The rent reserved willenure jointly to all the lessors; Co. Litt. 47 a. 192 a. 214 a.; and if any of them die, the lessee shall hold the whole as tenantto the survivors.  Upon a joint demise by joint-tenants upon a tenancy from year to year, the true character of the tenancy is this,not that the tenant holds of each the share of each so long as he and each shall please, but that he holds the whole of all so longas he and all shall please; and as soon as any one of the joint-tenants gives a notice to quit, he effectually puts an end to thattenancy; â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  As succinctly explained in the <i>U-Needa</i> case, a lease by a tenant in common of his interest in the land operates differently: the lessee of that interest has to share possessionwith the other co-owners which could lead to practical inconveniences.  In the <i>U-Needa</i> case at paragraph 26, Paterson J cited the following passage from <i>Re Marcellos</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2041%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 41 SR (NSW) 154</a>, 155:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe rarity of a lease by one of two tenants in common is explained by the inconvenience to which it may lead, as illustrated inWoodfall on Landlord &amp; Tenant, 17th edn 15.  But if one tenant in common is willing to submit to or to create this inconvenienceand can find a lessee, there appears to me to be no objection in law to his granting a lease.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In my view, the judgeâs statement of the law, in particular at paragraphs 77 to 79 which Mr Shieh sought to impugn is correct. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants as representatives of the estate of CCC had the power to grant the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant a licence to occupy the property on a non-exclusive basis.  That licence could not be determined by the other tenants incommon without the consent of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot maintain a claim in trespass in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs occupation of the property as from 11 October 2000.</p>    <p class="heading">The cross appeals</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The cross appeals relate to two issues: (1) whether the doctrine of relation back applies to the facts of the present case suchthat as from the resealing of the grant in Hong Kong on 11 October 2000, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants could grant the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant a licence to occupy the property on a non-exclusive basis as from the death of CCC on 8 August 1995; (2) whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant being the sole beneficiaries of CCCâs estate had the power to licence the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to occupy the property on a non-exclusive basis before the resealing of the grant.  There had been a third issue relatingto ratification which was not pursued at the hearing.</p>    <p class="heading">Relation back</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  As a general rule, an intended administrator has no power to do anything as administrator before the grant of letters of administration. The doctrine of relation back is an exception to that general rule.  For the doctrine to apply, it must be shown (1) that the personwhose conduct is relied upon as binding the estate should have been acting in the assumed character of an administrator, and he doesthat if the act is done by him when professedly intending to take out letters of administration so that he is an <i>executor de son tort</i>; and (2) that the act done should be for the benefit of the estate: see per Sir Alan Huggins VP in <i>Chan Pak-man v Chan Pang-fee</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20HKLR%20483" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] HKLR 483</a> at 506I.  Where the doctrine applies, it results in the administrator being deemed to have been in existence at the relevant timei.e. during the interval between the death and the grant of administration: see <i>Chan Pak-man</i> at 494H.  As Parke B observed in <i>Foster v Bates</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%2012%20M%20%26%20W%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 12 M&amp;W 226</a>,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ when one means to act as agent for another, a subsequent ratification by the other is always equivalent to a prior commandnor is it any objection that the intended principle was unknown, at the time, to the person intended to be the agent, the case of<i>Hull v Pickersgill 1 Bro. &amp; B.</i> being authority for that position.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In the present case, the evidence was that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had the consent and permission of the late CCC to occupy the property.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants obtained a grant in Singapore on 27 December 1996.  In late 1996/early 1997, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants orally requested the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to look after the property as their agent and/or representatives.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Given those facts, I have no doubt that when the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants requested the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to look after the property as their agent and/or representative, they were acting in the assumed character of administratorsof CCCâs estate.  At that time they had just been, or were about to be, granted letters of administration in Singapore.  Whilstthe grant was not to be resealed in Hong Kong until 11 October 2000, there is no question but that they were the intending administratorsof CCCâs Hong Kong estate. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  That leaves the question whether the act done was for the benefit of the estate.  The test is objective.  It was submitted by MrShieh that a gratuitous licence could not possibly have been of benefit to CCCâs estate.  Moreover, it prevented a sale or otherprofitable use of the property.  But the benefit has to be assessed from the point of view of CCCâs estate and not that of theother co-owners of the property.  The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants was to the effect that they made their request because the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was their aunt; she was already living at the property; they enjoyed a close relationship with her as did their father;they therefore trusted her to look after the interests of CCCâs estate; and they themselves were living in Singapore and not HongKong.  At that time, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was the only person residing at the property although, as the judge found, her occupation of the property was on a non-exclusivebasis.  CCCâs estate was but one of five tenants in common and the only one not based in Hong Kong.  In those circumstances, itwas unarguably in the interests of the estate to have an agent or representative here to look after its interests in the property. Whilst one may admittedly âlook afterâ a property without residing in it, equally I can discern no disadvantage in having theagent/representative residing there where the relationship with the other co-owners have not been harmonious and it is certainlytrue that given Hong Kongâs climate, a property is better lived in than left empty.  That is nothing more than plain commonsense. Therefore I have no difficulty in accepting that the act done was for the benefit of the estate.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The plaintiffs placed reliance on <i>Fred Long &amp; Sons Ltd v Burgess</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%202%20All%20ER%20484" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] 2 All ER 484</a> at 489H where it was held, <i>inter alia</i>, that the principle of relation back cannot be applied so as to invalidate interests lawfully acquired in the interval.  The plaintiffsâcontention was premised on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant being a trespasser.  But, as explained above, CCCâs estate had the power to grant a licence to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant over the objections of the other co-owners.  That being so, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs occupation of the property did not and could not give rise to any accrued cause of action in trespass which the applicationof the doctrine would extinguish.  The <i>Fred Long</i> case is therefore not of assistance.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  For my part, I am of the view that both conditions for the doctrine of relation back to operate were fulfilled with the consequencethat the doctrine applied to render legal the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs occupation of the property during the 9 days between the date of the fatherâs death on 2 October 2000 and the resealingof the grant.</p>    <p class="heading">Reasonable notice</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Even if I were wrong on the issue of relation back and the fatherâs licence to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to occupy the property terminated with his death, she would nonetheless be entitled to reasonable notice to vacate theproperty.  When the plaintiffs served the notice to quit on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on 24 December 1999, she was given 30 daysâ notice on the assumption that she was occupying the property as a licensee. I do not see that it is open to the plaintiffs to contend that a shorter period would be appropriate.  In any event, it could certainlynot be less than nine days.  This conclusion renders it unnecessary to deal with the other point left in the cross appeals, namely,a beneficiaryâs right to grant a licence and I do not propose to do so.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross appeals of the defendants.  I would also make an order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of the appeal be to the defendants and the costs of the cross appeals here and below be to the defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="38">(Anthony Rogers)<br />            Vice-President</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="38">(K.
