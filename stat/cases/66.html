The two lots of land and the two LUCs are conveniently referred to as âold securitiesâ and the five LUCs as the ânewsecuritiesâ. For twenty-six months, the Defendant held on to the two LUCs as well as the five LUCs without effecting the exchange. As a result, the Plaintiffs were unable to dispose of the land represented by those seven land use certificates and the buildingsbuilt thereon and suffered loss.  The Plaintiffs also claim against the Defendant for misrepresentation, breach of warranty and conversionof the five LUCs. </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Defendant counterclaims against the Plaintiffs for repayment of loans advanced to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff under various loan facilities.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  This action took twelve years to come to trial. A fore-warning is that this case is one of abundance: abundance of inaction anddelay, abundance of evidence, documents and expert opinion and abundance of legal argument.  Most of these were unnecessary and evenfutile.  These abundance contributed to an over-burdened judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">Dramatis personae</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Hung Fung Holdings Limited (âHF Holdingsâ) was a company incorporated on 4 April 1991 in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap 23</a>.

He entered into an agreement with two PRC parties,namely Jiuzhou Property and Zhenye Holdings on 1 July 1993 to construct a development known as New City Garden (âNCGâ) over thoselots of land (âJiuzhou Agreementâ).  On 2 July 1994, Lung Shing Property substituted Jiuzhou Property as one of the contractingparties.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On 8 July 1994, HF Holdings entered into a formal co-operation agreement with Lung Shing Property to develop NCG.  Later, HF Shenzhenentered into an identical agreement with Lung Shing Property to develop NCG and backdated it to 8 July 1994 (â1994 Co-operationAgreementâ). Under that agreement, Lung Shing Property would pay the land premium and obtain the land use certificates in respectof the land under its name.  The land premium of the various lots of land was paid by HF Shenzhen but the lots of land were heldin the name of Lung Shing Property under an arrangement known in the PRC as âgua kao(æé )â,which is a common way of enablingforeign entities to participate in business activities restricted to Chinese entities.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Then the Bank came into the scene.  On 19 October 1994, HF Holdings became a customer of the Bank through its Offshore Department. As at 1996, the Bank had granted four facilities to HF Enterprises, totalling $35 million.  Those facilities were:</p>    <blockquote>        <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="80%" border="1">            <tr>                <td width="121" align="center"><u>Date</u></td>                <td width="224" align="center" valign="top"><u>Facility</u></td>                <td width="140" align="center" valign="top"><u>Security</u></td>                <td width="131" align="center" valign="top"><u>Owner</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="121" valign="top">29/11/1994</td>                <td width="224" valign="top">$14 million, repayable by 9/12/1995     (âFacility 1â)</td>                <td width="140" valign="top">Lot number G09205-1(3)</td>                <td width="131" valign="top">Lung Shing Property</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="121" valign="top">23/01/1995</td>                <td width="224" valign="top">$12 million, repayable by 27/01/1996     (âFacility 2â)</td>                <td width="140" valign="top">Lot number G09205-1(2)</td>                <td width="131" valign="top">Lung Shing Property</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="121" valign="top">22/08/1995</td>                <td width="224" valign="top">$2 million, repayable on demand  (âFacility 3â)</td>                <td width="140" valign="top">Sheung Shui Property</td>                <td width="131" valign="top">HF Enterprises</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="121" valign="top">23/10/1995</td>                <td width="224" valign="top">$7 million, repayable on demand (âFacility 4â)</td>                <td width="140" valign="top">PRC Factory</td>                <td width="131" valign="top">HF Shenzhen</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Facility 1 and Facility 2 were secured against the two lots of land of which Lung Shing Property was the registered owner and mortgagor.

Pre-sale permits were obtained for blocks B1 to B4.  HF Holdings apportioned a little over two of those blocks of flats toLung Shing Property in repayment of about RMB20 million land premium paid by Lung Shing Property for HF Shenzhen.  All four blocksof flats were sold or assigned in 1995.  The remaining eight blocks were built over the two lots of land mortgaged to the Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In 1993, the township of Longgang was upgraded from rural area to urban area and became a district under Shenzhen City.  As a result,in 1996 Shenzhen Land Bureau required HF Holdings to pay additional land premium of over RMB70 million for the various lots of landin Longgang it had purchased before Shenzhen Land Bureau as a condition for issue of the respective land use certificates.  The tradereceivables due to HF Holdings or HF Enterprises in respect of construction works they executed for the Shenzhen government wereapplied by the Shenzhen government to off set the additional land premium.  As a result, HF Enterprises fell into arrears in repayingthe Bank under the various facilities. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Since 1996, HF Holdings or HF Group as a whole was in financial difficulties.  On 27 June 1996, Chan wrote to GJH explaining thecash flow problem which HF Enterprises was facing.  He enclosed copies of nineteen land use certificates held by HF Group.  He assuredthe Bank that it would have trade receivables of RMB60 million in July and August 1996 to repay the loans.  He said that he had securedsome interested buyers for the flats in NCG Phase 1.  He proposed mortgaging another lot of land use certificates of equivalent valueto the Bank as security so that the two LUCs held by the Bank could be released to HF Enterprises to facilitate sale of the flatsin NCG Phase 1 to alleviate HF Enterprisesâ cash flow problem.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Following that letter, a meeting between Chan and Wong representing HF Enterprises and GJH and LYT representing the Bank was heldin the conference room of the Bank in Shenzhen on 9 July 1996.  It was a very brief meeting.  At the meeting, Chan selected fivecopy land use certificates from among a batch of nineteen copy certificates which he had sent to the Bank together with his letterof 27 June 1996 to be used in exchange for the two LUCs.  LYT requested for the original certificates.  According to Chan, whichwas hotly disputed by the Bank, an agreement was reached at the meeting to swap the two LUCs for the five LUCs, i.e. to swap theold securities for the five LUCs which would be used as new securities and that the Bank would also consider whether to release thesecurities over the PRC Factory and Sheung Shui Property as well.  This meeting formed the principal basis of the Plaintiffs' claimunder the Swap Agreement. </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  On the following day, Wong faxed a minute of the meeting held on 9 July 1996 to the Shenzhen branch and the Offshore Departmentconfirming the agreement to swap land use certificates reached at the meeting. On 16 July 1996, Wong delivered the originals of thefive LUCs to the Offshore Department.  Those certificates were then sent by courier to Shenzhen branch and kept in the vault of theBank.  Since then, Wong issued numerous faxes pressing for the swap.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  On 28 July 1996, HF Shenzhen entered into an agreement with Lung Shing Property and Yue Hua Trading for the sale and purchase of168 flats in blocks B-5 to B-8 of NCG Phase 1 at a consideration of RMB39.95 million.  HF Shenzhen was to deliver possession of theblocks of flats on or before 30 December 1996.  A deposit of RMB1 million was paid to HF Shenzhen.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Wong kept chasing the Bank for the swap.  He alleged that he had a telephone conversation with LYT on 8 October 1996 during whichLYT informed him that the Bank had agreed to the swap.  LYT denied.  That conversation formed the alternative basis of the Plaintiffsâclaim under the Swap Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  On 23 April 1997, CYP replied by fax that the Bank agreed to process the request for swap but refused to release the securitiesover the PRC Factory and Sheung Shui Property.  He wrote: âè²´å¬å¸â¦è¦æ±æ´æåå°è­1001335å1001336èï¼æè¡åæäºä»¥è¾¦çâ. However, the swap was never effected.  As a result, HF Shenzhen was unable to complete the sale and purchase of blocks B-5 to B-8of NCG Phase 1 and refunded the deposit to the intended purchasers on 24 January 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Eventually, in March 1998, the Bank asked HF Enterprises to apply for an extension of the facilities using the five LUCs held bythe Bank as security after which the two LUCs would be released.  HF Enterprises complied with the request and other subsequent requestsfor amendment of the application and submission of valuation reports on the new securities. However, on 14 September 1998, the Bankinformed HF Enterprises that the application was refused.  Yet it did not return the five LUCs until 24 September 1998 and only uponthe demand of HF Enterprisesâ then solicitors.  On the following day, the Plaintiffs commenced the present action.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On 29 September 1998 the Bank demanded repayment of the outstanding loans under the facilities.  HF Enterprises failed to pay. TheBank commenced action in Shenzhen City Intermediate Peopleâs Court and obtained judgment against HF Enterprises in the amount of$7 million in respect of Facility 4 under action number (1998) æ·±ä¸­æ³ç¶èª¿åå­ç¬¬654è(âShen 654/1998â) on 24 April 2000and in the amount of $21,190,543.97 in respect of the Consolidated Facility under action number (1998) æ·±ä¸­æ³ç¶èª¿åå­ç¬¬655è(âShen 655/1998â) on 18 April 2000.  HF Enterprises appealed against the judgment in Shen 654/1998, but the appeal was dismissed. The Bank successfully sold the security, i.e. the PRC Factory, and recovered $6,066,883.39.  HF Enterprises did not appeal againstthe judgment in Shen 655/1998.  However, the Bank was unable to execute on the securities because the court of execution in Shanweidistrict took the view that while the two lots of land were held under the name of Lung Shing Property, the flats built thereon belongedto a third party (âShan 219-2/2005â).  The Bank had not taken any action in respect of Facility 3 in the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  On 27 November 2000, a winding up order was made against HF Holdings in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In January 2003, the then solicitors of the Bank, Messrs Koo and Partners (âK&amp;Pâ) discovered HF Enterprises had allotted4 million of its shares to Chan.  As the allotment was made after the winding up order of HF Holdings, K&amp;P believed that it wasan invalid disposition contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s182.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 182</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.  At the instigation of K&amp;P, the liquidators of HF Holdings commenced action in the High Court against HF Holdings, Chan andothers for relief (âHCA 2957/2003â). Upon the application of the Bank, an order staying the present action pending the outcomeof HCA 2957/2003 was granted on 12 August  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2003/2957/2003.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">2003.

It disputes the factual basis of the Plaintiffsâ claim and argues that even on the factsof the Plaintiffsâ case the Bank is not liable as a matter of law.  It denies the existence of the Swap Agreement whether reachedon 9 July 1996 or 8 October 1996.  Its case is that the parties were only negotiating and never reached any binding or concludedagreement.  It disputes HF Shenzhen was the beneficial owner of the two lots of land or suffered any loss.  It also counterclaimsfor repayment of the outstanding loans under the various facilities and relied on the two PRC judgments, namely Shen 654/1998 andShen 655/1998.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The parties have agreed that the issues to be determined are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)   On the claim for breach of contract:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)        whether the Swap Agreement was reached between the Plaintiffs and the Bank in the meeting on 9 July 1996, whereby the Bankagreed to release the two LUCs to the Plaintiffs in exchange for the five LUCs to be provided by HF Shenzhen;</p>            <p>(b)        if no, whether the Swap Agreement was reached between the Plaintiffs and the Bank on 8 October 1996, whereby the Bank agreedto release the two LUCs to the Plaintiffs in exchange for the five LUCs to be provided by HF Shenzhen;</p>            <p>(c)         if the Swap Agreement was in fact made between the parties, what were the terms of that agreement;</p>            <p>(d)        the governing law of the Swap Agreement;</p>            <p>(e)         whether the Bank has breached the Swap Agreement;</p>            <p>(f)          the relief to the Plaintiffs as a result of the said breach;</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(2)   As alternative to (1), on the misrepresentation claim:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(g)        whether the Plaintiffs can establish a claim against the Bank in misrepresentation;</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(3)   Further to (1), on the breach of warranty claim:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(h)        whether the Plaintiffs can establish a claim against the Bank for breach of warranty;</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(4)   On the conversion claim:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(i)          whether the Plaintiffs can establish a claim in conversion for the retention of the five LUCs between 1996 and 1998;</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(5)       the governing law in respect of the above claims;</p>        <p>(6)       the quantum of the Plaintiffsâ claim, if the Plaintiffs succeed against the Bank; and</p>        <p>(7)       whether the Bank is entitled to the counterclaim and the quantum.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">CREDIBILITY OF FACTUAL WITNESSES</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  This is a case which is particularly fact sensitive.  Finding of fact and assessment of credibility of witnesses are extremely important. In this section, I shall give an overall view of my assessment of the credibility of the factual witnesses.

As for the expert witnesses, I shall deal with my assessmentof their evidence in the respective sections where it will be more convenient and appropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The events in this case took place in 1996, some fourteen years ago.  Witnessesâ memory may have faded and their demeanour adverselyaffected.  However, there is a host of contemporaneous documentation in the form of faxes and other correspondence, mostly from thePlaintiffs.  The authenticity of those documents has never been disputed.  In approaching the evidence of such a case, I bear inmind the guidance of the Court of Appeal in <i>Esquire (Electronics) Ltd v Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%203%20HKLRD%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 3 HKLRD 439.</a>  I shall approach the evidence with caution and place special weight on documentation.  I shall test the credibility of the assertionof any witness by reference to contemporaneous documentation where it exits, or to its absence and lack of explanation where onewould expect it to have been created and to inherent probabilities having regard to all the known facts and incontrovertible evidence. I shall consider the totality of the evidence and the context in which each piece of assertion arose.  I also bear in mind the tenorof the partiesâ case.</p>    <p class="heading">Birdâs eye view of the Plaintiffsâ case</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The Plaintiffsâ principal claim is for breach of the Swap Agreement to swap securities.  The parties conducted their affairs peculiarlyover a period of twenty-six months on the basis of an oral discussion to use a neutral term on 9 July 1996 or 8 October 1996.  Asa result of the discussion on 9 July 1996, the Plaintiffs delivered very valuable title documents, namely the five LUCs with a valueof RMB52 million at the time, which the Bank retained for twenty-six months.  During those twenty-six months, the Plaintiffs issuednumerous faxes to the Bank referring to the Swap Agreement and pressing for completion of the formalities necessary for the exchange. The Bank did not respond to that allegation except on one occasion on 23 April 1997.  On that occasion, it confirmed its agreementto the swap except in respect of the PRC Factory and Sheung Shui Property.  But the swap never took place.  Eventually, when theBank rejected HF Enterprisesâ application for extending the facilities, the Plaintiffs demanded return of the five LUCs and promptlyinstituted the present action on 25 September 1998.  The action was stayed until 8 October 2007.  By now, the events had taken placefourteen years ago.  This is the framework within which I shall analyse the credibility of the witnesses.</p>    <p class="heading">Chan Siu Ping (âChanâ)</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Chan is the Plaintiffsâ principal witness.  His credibility was severely attacked by Mr Chan SC, counsel for the Bank.  He wassearchingly cross-examined.  The cross-examination was extended to matters which occurred some years after the events relating tothe present dispute for the purpose of destroying his credibility.  Specifically, Chanâs conduct in the proceeding of (2003)ç²µé«æ³æ°âçµå­ç¬¬311è(âYue 311/2003 proceedingâ) before the Guangdong Province Higher Peopleâs Court(å»£æ±çé«ç´äººæ°æ³é¢)was usedas a weapon to impeach his credibility.  I shall deal with those matters in the latter part of this judgment.  In this section, Ishall only give my general view on Chanâs credibility.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Chan was the managing director and majority shareholder of HF Holdings, HF Enterprises and HF Shenzhen and a number of subsidiariesof the HF Holdings.  He was the person in control of the Plaintiffs.  He came from a humble background and was not highly educated. He started off with an engineering company and built up a substantial business empire in early 1990. He was the âbossâ of thegroup who was concerned with major management decisions but was seldom involved at the operational level which he delegated to hisstaff and accountants.  My overall impression is that Chan is not a sophisticated person.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Chanâs business empire grew and prospered until 2000 when it collapsed with the winding up of HF Holdings on 27 November 2000and his own bankruptcy.  What led to the collapse of HF Holdings is irrelevant.  Apparently, HF Holdings experienced cash flow problemsin 1996 caused by the Shenzhen government applying contract fees payable to HF Group to pay or set off against additional land premiumassociated with upgrading of Longgang township to the status of a district.  HF Enterprises fell into arrears in repayment of theloans to the Bank. </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  That was the context in which negotiation for the Swap Agreement commenced.  I accept, as submitted by Mr Tong SC, counsel for thePlaintiffs that as HF Enterprises had been suffering from cash flow problems and had been in default of repayment to the Bank, itneeded forbearance and help from the Bank to arrange for a swap of securities so that HF Shenzhen could sell some of the blocks inNCG Phase 1 to repay the facilities. The parties were not in equal bargaining position.  Chan was not in any position to be overbearingor pushy.  As the financial position of HF Holdings deteriorated further since 1997, the imbalance between their respective bargainingpower became even more stark.  However, Mr Chan SC argues that despite the disparity in bargaining power, Chan would not be sayingthings he did not mean to say.  I think Chan was being diplomatic in his dealings with the Bank.  He acknowledged his handicappedposition and refrained from being too pushy.  But as soon as the Bank confirmed its refusal to effect the swap despite all effortsto comply with the Bankâs requirements, he immediately demanded return of the five LUCs and promptly instituted action againstthe Bank.  His failure to take more active steps in obtaining alternative financing from other banking institutions by using thefive LUCs during the twenty-six months is difficult to understand.  It may well be due to a combination of factors, including theimbalance in bargaining power, fear of retaliation by the Bank, undue reliance on LYTâs assurance, his inadequacy in financialmanagement and lack of legal advice.  On the totality of the evidence, I do not think Chanâs evidence is in any way inconsistentwith his dealing with the Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Between 1997 and 2000 came the Asian financial crisis and its aftermath.  HF Holdings was wound up in November 2000 and Chan wasdeclared bankrupt.  Chan described HF Holdings at the time as a ship full of holes.  The entire group employing over 1,000 employeescollapsed.  HF Enterprises was at its worst.  HF Holdings and Chan were being chased by creditors.  Chan had no money or assistancefrom his staff.  His hard-built business empire was vanishing fast right in front of his eyes.  According to Chan, that was the worsttime in his life.  I have no doubt that such circumstances adversely affected the way Chan conducted his affairs in relation to theHF Group around that time.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Yue 311/2003 proceeding was conducted in mid 2003.  By then, the winding up and bankruptcy proceeding had been concluded two andhalf years ago.  HF Holdings was in the hands of the liquidators, though Chan was still in control of HF Enterprises and HF Shenzhen. He had lost everything and was worrying that he might face criminal prosecution in the PRC.  Though the worst of his time was behindhim, Chan could not have been in the best of his condition to handle the proceeding.  Mr Chan SC suggested that Chan misled the PRCcourt as to HF Holdingsâ right over the blocks of flats in NCG Phase 1 and misled this Court about his role in that proceeding. Hence, he argues that Chan was an incredible witness.  It would be to Chanâs and the Plaintiffsâ disadvantage for him to claimthat the blocks in NCG Phase 1 belonged to HF Holdings.  I accept that at the time Chan was in a state of confusion. He must havebeen worrying about the prospect of his being prosecuted in the PRC and was only too happy to go along with the judge to have thematter swept under the carpet.  More importantly, as submitted by Mr Tong SC, the Yue 311/2003 proceeding is a red-herring.  Whathappened in that proceeding took place in mid 2003, seven years after the material events in this proceeding. Whatever dishonestydisplayed by Chan in that proceeding could have little impact on his credibility in this proceeding.  More importantly, the evidenceChan gave in relation to the issues in dispute in this proceeding is amply supported and borne out by the documentary evidence. I shall deal with the Yue 311/2003 proceeding separately.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  On the whole, I find Chan a credible witness.  His evidence is largely supported by contemporaneous documents, the authenticityof which is not in dispute.  I accept his evidence, save as otherwise pointed out in this judgment.  Where his evidence conflictswith those of the Defendantâs witnesses, I prefer Chanâs.</p>    <p class="heading">Wong Kwok Sing (âWongâ)</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Wong was the general manager of HF Enterprises from 2 May 1994 to 31 January 2001.  He was also a director of HF Enterprises from1 October 1994 to December 1999.  He had a master degree in business administration.  He acquired the qualification of CharteredSecretary during his employment with HF Enterprises.  He was responsible for most of the documentations of the Plaintiffs connectedwith this action.  He is no longer in the employ of Group.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr Chan SC criticised Wong as an incredible witness.  I respectfully disagree.  I think Mr Chan SCâs criticisms are trivial andfault finding.  Most of Wongâs evidence is incontrovertible and supported by contemporaneous documentation, the authenticity ofwhich is not challenged. Part of his evidence is favourable to the Bank.  He frankly admitted that there were inaccuracies in someof the faxes he issued to the Bank which he introduced in the hope of getting more favourable terms under the Swap Agreement forHF Enterprises.  There were some discrepancies between his and Chanâs evidence.  He was not involved in the actual decision-makingprocess concerning HF Enterprises or in the affairs of HF Shenzhen across the border.  As he acted on the basis of Chanâs instructions,he might not be fully appraised of Chanâs acts and would have to rely to some extent on his own understanding and interpretationof the situation when he handled matters initiated by Chan but left to him to follow up.  I do not consider those discrepancies couldin any way influence my assessment of their credibility.  After fourteen years, I would be very surprised if their evidence wouldmatch each otherâs seamlessly. Wong has ceased working for Chan or HF Group for almost ten years.  He has no personal interestin this litigation.  He impressed me as a responsible witness.  I find him credible and accept his evidence except otherwise mentionedin other parts of this judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">Li Yutian (âLYTâ)</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  LYT was a manager of the Offshore Department of the Bank back in 1996.  He was the second in command.  His senior officer was GJHwho was not called to give evidence.  He was the most senior officer available to give evidence on behalf of the Bank.  He was theone who had the most knowledge of what happened between 1996 and 1998.  He attended the important meeting with Chan on 9 July 1996. He said that the purpose of that meeting was to discuss with Chan about HF Enterprisesâ defaults in repayment of the outstandingloans.  He denied having agreed to swap securities. </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Many of the faxes quoting the Swap Agreement from Wong were sent or copied to LYT.  LYT did not respond to any of them. When pressedduring cross-examination, he replied that he responded orally. LYT also said that had pressed HF Enterprises for repayment orally. But in none of his or his colleaguesâ witness statements was it ever mentioned that any of them had responded to any of the faxesorally on the phone.  Had he done so, I would be surprised if Wong would not have responded in any of his faxes. This is preciselythe type of case where in the light of the numerous faxes alleging an oral agreement and the fact that pursuant to that oral agreementthe five LUCs which are title documents of five very valuable properties were handed over to the Bank that one expects a writtendenial would have been made if the allegation was untrue.  But such a document is missing. </p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The Bank was unable to produce even a single file note recording any such oral denial.  LYTâs and his colleaguesâ evidence isthat the Bank was very casual in filing correspondence.  It only filed formal documents.  The Bank had no system for filing correspondenceexchanged with its customers.  Such letters and other communication from clients would simply be left lying around or filed or disposedof at the discretion of the officer concerned.  Their evidence is that the Bankâs practice was to communicate with its customersorally.  They would not correct their clientsâ misapprehension or misunderstanding or state the Bankâs position even if its customersâassertion is patently incorrect.  The officers were free to file or to discard any correspondence or faxes received at will.  Hence,there was no note of any oral response made to Wongâs faxes.  This is hardly credible for such a large and well-organised bankinginstitution.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  More fatally is the fax reply from CYP on 23 April 1997.  That reply, as I have noted, was the only contemporaneous response fromthe Bank to Wongâs faxes.  CYP wrote that the Bank agreed to process the request for swap but refused to release the securitiesover the PRC Factory and Sheung Shui Property.  CYPâs fax is not conclusive evidence that an agreement was reached on 9 July 1996,but is more consistent with the Plaintiffsâ evidence than with LYTâs.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Further, when he was stuck, LYT was prepared to volunteer any irresponsible answer to explain himself.  For instance, in order tojustify his assertion that the Bank could not do anything for HF Enterprises in 1996, he said that was because HF Enterprises nevermade a formal application for new loan in connection with the swap.  When confronted with absence of any formal application relatingto the extension of the Consolidated Facility in March 1996, he said that a board minute from HF Enterprises would qualify as a formalapplication.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Applying the Court of Appealâs test in <i>Esquire (Electronics) Ltd</i>, it is only too obvious that LYT is not a credible witness.  I do not accept his evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Chen Yaoping (âCYPâ)</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  CYP was a marketing officer of the Offshore Department.  He succeeded HXM as the officer responsible for HF Enterprisesâ accountbetween the end of 1996 and the beginning of 1998.  He was actively involved in the account of HF Enterprises and was the officerwho wrote the fax dated 23 April 1997 on behalf of the Bank confirming the swap.  He avoided answering questions relating to thatfax by saying that he could not remember. That was the feature of his evidence under cross-examination.  He gave three witness statements,none of which disclosed anything of substance relating to this dispute.  He asked the Court to rely on LYTâs evidence and not hisin case of conflict.  His attitude demonstrated a total disregard of his responsibility as a witness to tell the truth and his fearfor saying anything contrary to his seniorâs evidence or adverse to the Bankâs interest.  If he did not have clearance or confirmationabout the Swap Agreement from LYT or GJH, he would not have replied along the lines of his fax dated 23 April 1997.  He is not acredible witness.</p>    <p class="heading">Chen Wu (âCWâ)</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  CW is a deputy manager of the Offshore Department.  At the material time, he was posted to work in Silux Investment Limited whichwas a private corporation set up by the Bank in Hong Kong.  He had previously handled the facilities of HF Enterprises.  He describedhimself as a ârunnerâ or courier bringing documents to and from Shenzhen.  He arranged the Bankâs visit to HF Shenzhen.  MrTong SC criticised CW as being less than honest when he suggested he had little involvement in this dispute.  That criticism maynot be fair.  There was nothing material in his evidence, anyway. </p>    <p class="heading">YUE 311/2003 PROCEEDING</p>    <p class="heading">Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Yue 311/2003 proceeding had not been raised by the Plaintiffs or the Bank in their pleadings.  It was first put in issue by theBank in its counselâs opening submission.  The Bankâs purpose was two fold: to discredit Chan and to show that HF Shenzhen wasnot the beneficial owner of the two lots of land.  The issue was vigorously argued and perhaps out of all proportion.  I shall firstset out the background to that litigation and then deal with the attack on Chanâs credibility.  I shall leave the question of HFShenzhenâs beneficial ownership of the two lots of land to be dealt with separately.  </p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  It should be recalled that after HF Group acquired the land in Longgang district, it together with Jiuzhou Property on the one partentered into the Jiuzhou Agreement dated 1 July 1993 with Zhenye Holdings on the other part to develop the land into a residentialdevelopment. The agreement was for a term of two years.  Under the agreement, HF Group and Jiuzhou Property would provide the landand obtain land use right from the government, while Zhenye Holdings would build and finance the building of the development andto lend RMB20 million to HF Group and Jiuzhou Property.  Upon completion of the project, Zhenye Holdings would be entitled to 55%of the flats built and be repaid the loan of RMB20 million by being allotted flats in the development calculated at a 10% discountof the current market price. </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Upon signing the agreement, Zhenye Holdings advanced RMB 13 million to HF Group and Jiuzhou Property instead of RMB20 million. It arranged for one of its subsidiaries, Shenzhen No.1 Construction Company (âNo.1 Constructionâ) to execute the constructionwork.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In late 1993, the State Council of the PRC implemented the macroeconomic control policy which had an adverse effect on the propertymarket.  Jiuzhou Property wanted to pull out from the Jiuzhou Agreement.  The parties reached agreement to terminate the JiuzhouAgreement. HF Group would repay the loan of RMB13 million from proceeds of sale of the flats in NCG Phase 1 and No.1 Constructionwould complete the development at a budgeted cost of RMB37 million to be settled after completion and sale of the development.  LungShing Property would substitute Jiuzhou Property as the contracting party.  The arrangement was approved by the Longgang governmentwhich is evidenced by a notice of the alteration dated 2 July 1994 published by the Longgang government (â1994 Arrangementâ). The above background facts are fully documented and not disputed by the Bank. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  On 8 July 1994, HF Holdings and Lung Shing Property entered into a formal co-operation agreement.  Some time later, HF Shenzhenalso entered into an identical co-operation agreement with Lung Shing Property backdated to 8 July 1994 (âLung Shing Agreementâ). Chan explained that HF Shenzhen was newly incorporated and was not ready to enter into the co-operation agreement with Lung ShingProperty.  Hence, HF Holdings entered into that agreement first which was then replaced by the Lung Shing Agreement and backdatedto 8 July 1994.  As HF Shenzhen had been incorporated on 1 July 1994, that explanation is not convincing at all.  There was probablymore that was left untold whether inadvertently or deliberately.  Mr Chan SC suggests that there was some impropriety or dishonestyon the part of Chan in entering into two identical contracts so that he could attribute the agreement to whichever of the two partiesas it suited him.  But on the facts, it appeared that the Lung Shing Agreement had all along been performed by HF Shenzhen. Accordingto the Capital Verification Report No. 113 of 1996 issued by Shenzhen Da Cheng Certified Public Accountants, HF Holdings injected$19,346,925 cash into HF Shenzhen by four instalments as at 28 November 1994 and land use right worth $80,653,075 on 28 June 1996. The four cash injections totalling $19,346,925 were used to pay for the purchase price of various lots of land including the twolots of land.  Even the Bankâs accountancy expert confirmed that the evidence supported a link between HF Shenzhen and NCG andthe two lots of land.  Thus, despite the somewhat unsatisfactory explanation given by Chan, I have no doubt about the propriety ofthe two co-operation agreements.  I accept that HF Shenzhen had substituted HF Holdings as the contracting party to the Lung ShingAgreement.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  As HF Shenzhen was unable to sell the flats in NCG Phase 1, Zhenye Holdings was not repaid the RMB13 million lent under the 1994Arrangement with Lung Shing Property and HF Shenzhen.  In 2001, instead of suing HF Shenzhen and Lung Shing Property under the LungShing Agreement or the 1994 Arrangement.  Zhenye Holdings instituted action in the Shenzhen City Intermediate Peopleâs Court under(2001) æ·±ä¸­æ³æ¿åå­ç¬¬7è against HF Holdings and Jiuzhou Property under the Jiuzhou Agreement (âShen 7/2001â) and againstLung Shing Property as third party.  It sought a declaration that the Jiuzhou Agreement was null and void and sought repayment ofmonies paid under that agreement.  On 20 February 2003, the Shenzhen City Intermediate Peopleâs Court granted judgment in favourof Zhenye Holdings.  It declared the Jiuzhou Agreement void; ordered HF Holdings, Jiuzhou Property and Lung Shing Property to repayZhenye Holdings investment funds of RMB29,882,520 and the loan of RMB13 million with interest but dismissed all other claims of ZhenyeHoldings.  Jiuzhou Property appealed to the Guangdong Province Higher Peopleâs Court in Yue 311/2003.  The court allowed the appealand set aside the award of Shenzhen City Intermediate Peopleâs Court.  It ordered Zhenye Holdings to complete the constructionof the eight blocks of flat in NCG Phase 1 and ordered six of the blocks to be transferred to Zhenye Holdings and two to be keptby HF Holdings.  Those facts are incontrovertible.</p>    <p class="heading">Chanâs involvement in Yue 311/2003 proceeding</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  According to Chan, he learned about Shen 7/2001 proceeding taken out by Zhenye Holdings in early 2001.  As HF Holdings was in liquidation,he could not represent the company.  He gave notice of the action to the Official Receiver who was then the provisional liquidatorof HF Holdings.  He was not involved in that action until 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  In September 2003, Yang Guang, the general manager of the parent company of Lung Shing Property informed him about the outcome ofShen 7/2001 proceeding taken by Zhenye Holdings and of Jiuzhou Propertyâs appeal.  Yang enlisted his help as a witness in the appeal. The purpose for which Chan was called was to produce a letter dated 20 October 1997 from Zhenye Holdings (âZhenye Letterâ) showingthat Jiuzhou Property had withdrawn from the Jiuzhou Agreement.  Chan agreed.  Chanâs participation in Yue 311/2003 proceedingwas under severe attack by Mr Chan SC.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Mr Chan SC argues that Chanâs evidence that he participated as a witness on behalf of Lung Shing Property to produce the ZhenyeLetter was a concoction and an excuse to explain his participation in that proceeding.  Mr Chan SCâs theme is that in that proceeding,Chan took a stand which was contrary to his stand in the present case and that in that proceeding HF Shenzhen had claimed no interestin the two lots of land.  Mr Chan SC argues that the Zhenye Letter did not show whether Zhenye Holdings had withdrawn from the JiuzhouAgreement and Chan was unable to show the relevance of the letter.  As it was Chanâs evidence that he first saw the letter in aroundOctober 2003, Mr Chan SC queried how Chan could have testified on the letter.  The letter was issued by Zhenye Holdings and addressedto Lung Shing Property and HF Shenzen.  It referred to the Lung Shing Agreement to develop NCG and urged Lung Shing Property andHF Shenzhen to pay the land premium so as to facilitate sale of the units to repay Zhenye Holdings.  The purpose for which Chan wascalled was a matter for counsel of Lung Shing Property which Chan might not appreciate.  Having had some familiarity with the backgroundof the case, I could well see the purpose of calling Chan, though the weight to be given to his evidence was a matter for the PRCcourt.  The Zhenye Letter was addressed to Lung Shing Property and HF Shenzhen, which were not parties to the Jiuzhou Agreement. Thus, the contents of the letter were clearly referable to the 1994 Arrangement and the Lung Shing Agreement rather than the JiuzhouAgreement.  Chan was the person in control of HF Shenzhen and HF Holdings and the person who negotiated the Jiuzhou Agreement, 1994Arrangement and Lung Shing Agreement.  Though he might not have seen the letter in 1997, he was able to speak to the matters referredto in the letter and inform the PRC court of the historical background leading to the transactions.  Depending on the law of evidencein the PRC, Chanâs evidence might have some probative value.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Mr Chan SC criticised Chanâs incomplete disclosure of the documents relating to Yue 311/2003 proceeding to this Court as a basisof attack on his credibility.  He argues that Chanâs disclosure was selective and it was only upon the Bankâs production of copiesof certain pages of the notes of proceeding that the Plaintiffs produced the full set of documents.  He suggests that in view ofthe direction given by the Supreme Peopleâs Court in (2009) æ°ç£å­ç¬¬545è (âSPC 545/2009â) in relation to HF Shenzhenâsappeal against the judgment in Yue 311/2003, the Plaintiffs could have access to the notes of proceeding in that case.  However,having seen the course which Yue 311/2003 proceeding took, I give little weight to that criticism.  In my view Yue 311/2003 proceedingis irrelevant to the dispute in the present case.  It was not pleaded by the parties, but raised in the Bankâs opening submission. Chan had to urgently obtain the documents which were in the possession of PRC lawyers instructed by the liquidators of HF Holdingsduring the course of this trial.  The Plaintiffsâ un-preparedness in disclosing the documents could be understood.  So was Chanâsconfusion in his witness statement which he prepared without the benefit of the full set of notes of proceeding to refresh his memory. I draw no adverse inference against Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr Chan SC criticised Chan for telling lies before the PRC court claiming to have a copy of the Zhenye Letter when he even neverhad personal knowledge of that letter.  Chan had never seen that letter. His evidence at the highest was that he genuinely believedthere was such a letter which was lost in the flood.  He asked his staff in HF Shenzhen to contact Jiuzhou Property and Lung ShingProperty for a copy and obtained a copy of the Zhenye Letter and a reply from HF Shenzhen.  Even though what he believed was in facttrue, his evidence was not.  He tried to economise on the evidence.  In so doing, he misled the PRC court.  To some extent, thisreflected adversely on his credibility.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  According to the notes of proceeding, Chan appeared as the legal representative of HF Holdings and Zhou Tao appeared as its attorney. Both of them signed the notes of proceeding.  Chan was adamant that he attended as a witness only and did not realise that he wasacknowledged by the PRC court as representing HF Holdings or was he aware of the capacity with which Zhou Tao appeared.  Indeed,the notes of proceeding on 20 November 2003 showed that he gave some evidence, but it equally showed that he also participated aslegal representative of HF Holdings when making suggestion to the judge as to how the flats in NCG Phase 1 should be divided andparticipated in mediation.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Chanâs explanation was that he was confused at the time.  His concern was that the action should be settled as soon as practicable. He said he was told by Yang that if he did not testify in the PRC court there would be very serious consequences, for if the courtfound out that the Jiuzhou Agreement was still subsisting and he had procured the change in one of the contracting parties from JiuzhouProperty to Lung Shing Property without Zhenye Holdingsâ consent, he might attract criminal sanction.  Though Chan was preparedto testify that Jiuzhou Property had been substituted by Lung Shing Property, he found himself in a delicate situation as regardswhether Zhenye Holdings had consented to the substitution.  He was in deep trouble at the time with the winding up of HF Holdingsand his own bankruptcy.  Chan also explained that he had no opportunity to read the notes of proceeding as he signed them and wasnot given a copy afterwards.  Though his conduct was not what I would condone, I accept he was in genuine fear and was only too eagerto have the matter swept under the carpet in whatever way he could.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Mr Chan SC tried to contradict Chanâs evidence that Zhenye Holdings had withdrawn from the Jiuzhou Agreement because under cross-examinationChan admitted that Zhenye Holdings was still executing works in NCG Phase 2.  I think this criticism is unfair because the un-contradictedevidence of Chan was that Zhenye Holdings assigned one of its subsidiaries, No.1 Construction, to execute the works under the JiuzhouAgreement and that No.1 Construction continued to execute the works under the 1994 Arrangement.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  There are many other allegations made against Chan suggesting he was not an honest witness.  In particular, Mr Chan SC suggeststhat in Yue 311/2003 proceeding, Chan claimed that the flats in NCG Phase 1 belonged to HF Holdings when it was convenient to himand now Chan claimed that they belonged to HF Shenzhen when it would be to his benefit.  I think those criticisms were trivial, faultfinding and of no substance.  As Chan rightly pointed out, at the time HF Holdings was in liquidation while he still had a good stakein HF Shenzhen.  It would have been to his advantage if HF Shenzhen rather than HF Holdings was to claim ownership of the flats. Chan was obviously in a state of confusion and was attending the proceeding as a witness for Lung Shing Property.  He was in fearand at a loss not knowing how to explain the ownership of the flats.  He was trying to have the proceeding settled to avoid the riskof his criminal prosecution in the PRC.  In any event, even when claiming the flats for HF Holdings, he told the PRC court that thoseflats were to be given to the Bank which must be in satisfaction of the loans owed by HF Enterprises to the Bank under the ConsolidatedFacility.  However, it is clear from the documentary evidence from the PRC that HF Shenzhen paid for the land premium.  This is notdisputed by the Bankâs accounting expert. It is also clear that HF Shenzhen had taken over the responsibility of developing theland from HF Holdings. </p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  At last, HF Shenzhen saw fit to correct the error in Yue 311/2003 judgment.  It failed to come to settlement with the liquidatorsof Lung Shing Property in 2007 and commenced action in the Shenzhen City Intermediate Peopleâs Court on 20 April 2008.  It thenwithdrew the action in order to commence action in the Guangdong Higher Peopleâs Court on 24 February 2009.  The Higher PeopleâsCourt refused to entertain the application.  On 8 June 2009, HF Shenzhen commenced action in SPC 545/2009 in the Supreme PeopleâsCourt to review the judgment in Yue 311/2003.  Eventually, the Supreme Peopleâs Court dismissed HF Shenzhenâs application onthe ground that it was made out of time.</p>    <p class="heading">Effect of the judgment in Yue 311/2003</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  In the end, after the lengthy cross-examination, I agree with Mr Tong SC, that the Yue 311/2003 proceeding is but a red herring. The fact that HF Shenzhen paid for the blocks of flats is clearly borne out by the documents.  Chanâs representation before thePRC court that they belonged to HF Holdings was misfortunate and, even if deliberate, was a fortuitous event blown all out of proportionby Mr Chan SC. Basically, I accept Chanâs explanation for the way he conducted himself in Yue 311/2003 proceeding.  But whatevermight have been his conduct in that proceeding, it was seven years after the material events in this case and has no impact on hiscredibility.</p>    <p class="heading">OTHER PRC JUDGMENTS</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Hereunder is a summary of a number of PRC judgments involving the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p class="heading">Shen 654/1998</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  By this action, the Bank sued HF Enterprises as borrower and HF Shenzhen as mortgagor for repayment of the loans under Facility4.

Its defence was that the Bankâs claim was time-barred and that interest should be calculated in accordancewith regulations of the Peopleâs Bank of China.

HF Enterprises defaulted appearance. Lung Shing Property was legally represented by the samefirm of lawyers who represented HF Shenzhen in Shen 654/1998.  No defence was pleaded by Lung Shing Property. The case of the Bankwas admitted.  The PRC court entered judgment against HF Enterprises in the amount of $21,190,543.97 plus interest and costs andordered that in default of payment the Bank may enforce the securities, which were the two lots of land represented by the two LUCs,against Lung Shing Property.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  HF Enterprises did not appeal against the judgment.  However, the Bank was unable to execute on the securities.</p>    <p class="heading">Shen 9964/2005</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In this action, HF Shenzhen sought a declaration from the Shenzhen Longgang District Peopleâs Court that it is the beneficialowner of lot number G09205-1(9) and G09205-1(10) held by Lung Shing Property under a reliance relationship with HF Shenzhen.  Thoselots were within lot number G09205-1 which included the two lots of land.  Thus, the decision in this case is equally applicableto the two lots of land.  Lung Shing Property did not dispute the reliance relationship, that HF Shenzhen had paid the land premiumand that the land belonged to HF Shenzhen.  It refused to transfer the land use certificates to HF Shenzhen because of the latterâsfailure to undertake to pay the substantial tax involved.  At the hearing, the court reviewed the evidence and was satisfied withthe reliance relationship.  On 20 September 2005, upon HF Shenzhen agreeing to pay all the necessary expenses associated with thetransfer of the land in question, the court declared that HF Shenzhen was the beneficial owner of the land which was held in thename of Lung Shing Property under a reliance relationship with HF Shenzhen.  It also ordered Lung Shing Property to arrange the transferwith the land bureau within ten days after its judgment had entered into effect and ordered HF Shenzhen to pay all necessary expensesof the transfer and the costs of the proceeding in the amount of RMB100.</p>    <p class="heading">Shan 219-2/2005</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The Bank applied to the Shanwei Peopleâs Court to enforce the security over the two lots of land.  In view of the judgment inYue 311/2003, the court held that the Bank could not enforce the securities as the land use right belonged to Lung Shing Propertybut the flats on the land were owned by Zhenye Holdings.  As HF Enterprises had no other assets available for execution, the courtterminated the execution process on 30 October 2007 and left it to the parties to resolve the matter among themselves.</p>    <p class="heading">SPC 545/2009</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  On 8 June 2009, HF Shenzhen applied to the Supreme Peopleâs Court to review the judgment of Guangdong Province Higher PeopleâsCourt in Yue 311/2003.

The remaining eight blocks offlat were built on the two lots of land mortgaged to the Bank.  In 1996, HF Enterprises fell into arrears in repayment of its loansin the total amount of $26.8 million.  The Bank pressed for repayment.  In early June 1996, Lung Shing Property together with YueHua Trading expressed interest to purchase four more blocks of flats in NCG Phase 1 from HF Shenzhen.  To complete the sale of theblocks, HF Shenzhen had to apply to the authorities for pre-sale permits which would require production of the relevant land usecertificates.  Hence, Chan wished to negotiate with the Bank to exchange the two LUCs for the five LUCs.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  On 27 June 1996, Chan wrote a letter to GJH explaining the cash flow problem of HF Group.  He enclosed copies of the land use certificatesas evidence of the asset worthiness of HF Enterprises.  He said that HF Enterprises would be receiving over RMB60 million betweenJuly and August 1996 and assured the Bank that HF Enterprises would repay the outstanding loans due under the trust receipts before15 August 1996.  In the last paragraph of the letter, he indicated that the company had found buyers for some of the flats in NCGPhase 1, the land use certificates of which land were held by the Bank as security.  He proposed to mortgage to the Bank anotherbatch of land use certificates of equivalent value as security in exchange for the two LUCS so as to facilitate the sale of the flatsto relieve the HF Enterprisesâ cash flow problem.  He wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãç¾è©²æ¹æ¿ç¢é¨ä»½æè²·å®¶ï¼æ¬å¬å¸æ³ç¨å¦ä¸æ¹ç¸ç­å¹å¼çæ¿å°ç¢è­æµæ¼çµ¦ è²´è¡ï¼ç­æ¬å¬å¸å¯ä»¥å°åä¾çæ¿ç¢é·å®ï¼æ¸è¼æ¬å¬å¸è³éå£åï¼â¦ã</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Following that letter, the meeting on 9 July 1996 was arranged.</p>    <p class="heading">The meeting on 9 July 1996</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  On 9 July 1996, Chan and Wong went to the Shenzhen branch of the Bank.  They had a meeting with GJH and LYT in the conference room. It was a brief meeting.  The discussion was mainly conducted between Chan and LYT, while GJH went in and out of the conference roomduring the course of the meeting.  This much is not in dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  The bone of contention between the parties is whether an oral agreement for the exchange of the two LUCs held by the Bank for thefive LUCs was reached at the meeting.  According to Chan, the focal point of the meeting was the content of his letter of 27 June1996, whereas LYT said that the focus was on pressing HF Enterprises for repayment.  Chanâs and Wongâs evidence are as follows. During the discussion, the copies of land use certificates attached to Chanâs letter of 27 June 1996 were placed on the table. Chan selected five copies of land use certificates from the batch with a total value of RMB52 million which was about twice theConsolidated Facility and offered the originals of those certificates in exchange for the two LUCs held by the Bank.  According toChan, LYT said that the Bank was agreeable to the proposal and would like to have the originals of the five LUCs, whereupon the Bankwould release the two LUCs.  He said that LYT indicated that the Bank would consider whether to release the security over the SheungShui Property and PRC Factory as well.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Interestingly, LYT gave two slightly different accounts of what happened at the meeting.  In his witness statement dated 30 October2001, he said that at the meeting, he pressed Chan for repayment.  Chan and Wong replied that HF Shenzhen had cash flow problem becauseits clients did not pay and that they had to pay land premium.  They suggested the Bank to allow HF Shenzhen to sell some of itsmortgaged properties to repay the Bank. That was not a swap of securities.  Then he emphasised on Chanâs failure to identify thesecurities offered for the exchange, failure to provide a resolution authorising the exchange of securities, financial reports ofHF Enterprises and HF Shenzhen and valuation report of the new securities proposed for the exchange.  He said that he and GJH indicatedthat unless HF Shenzhen paid all the arrears, the Bank would not consider any proposal by HF Shenzhen. He also explained to Chanand Wong the mechanisms involved in exchanging securities which basically involved granting a new loan on the strength of new securitiesto discharge the old loan with release of the old securities.  The salient feature of his evidence is that no exchange of securitieswas proposed by Chan but simply release of the two LUCs to enable sale of the flats in NCG Phase 1 to repay the loan, copies of nineteenland use certificates were not presented at the meeting and copies of the five LUCs to be used to exchange for the two LUCs werenot even identified.  Then gradually, LYT mentioned about explaining the mechanisms involved in exchanging securities which impliedlysuggested that the exchange was discussed.  One wonders why he should be so guarded in his witness statement.  His evidence in thatwitness statement is inconsistent with the totality of the evidence and in particular Chanâs letter of 27 June 1996.  In that letter,Chan had offered to exchange the two LUCs for some other land use certificates.  There was no reason why Chan would retreat his offerand ask for release of the two LUCs and not exchange.  With the release of the two LUCs and repayment of the loan after sale of theflats, HF Enterprises would have no more facilities from the Bank to finance its business activities.  Clearly LYT concealed thetruth on the very first occasion he was to give a witness statement.  He is not credible.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Then, in his fourth supplemental witness statement dated 27 October 2009, filed shortly before trial and in connection with an applicationto amend the defence and counterclaim, LYT put in a different account which he maintained at trial.  He tried to blend in his accountwith Chanâs, but maintained the crucial difference that no agreement for exchange was reached.  He said Chan proposed to use somenew securities to replace the old securities held by the Bank, an allegation which he had tried hard to avoid agreeing in his witnessstatement given in 2001.  He went on and said that the Bank did not agree and did not give Chan any proposal or guarantee. He pointedout to Chan that his exchange proposal would have to be submitted to the credit approval committee for consideration after HF Enterpriseshad repaid the outstanding interest and principal.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  The new account LYT gave bore no relationship with the amendment to the defence and counterclaim.  It is curious why back in 2001when memories were still fresh in his mind, LYT did not openly disclose the discussion about the exchange, but maintained a verydistanced and detached stand talking about the standard procedure for applying for a mortgage, avoided admitting any discussion forexchange had ever taken place at all and said that nothing but the Bankâs pressure for repayment and HF Enterprises financial difficultieshad been discussed.  One wonders why it took him nine years to come up with an account which is so different from his original accountand which ties in with Chanâs.  In his witness statement dated 30 October 2001, he was clearly trying to hide his involvement andwhat he had said at the meeting.   In his fourth supplemental witness statement, he was trying to fabricate a more reasonable andcredible account of what took place at the meeting while denying the agreement to swap securities.  He has demonstrated no sincerityin his evidence.  I do not believe in his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Mr Chan SC raised three points about the letter dated 27 June 1996.  Firstly, he doubted if copies of nineteen land use certificateshad been enclosed in that letter.  Secondly, he argues that there was nothing in the letter to suggest that the proposed offer ofanother batch of land use certificates were those to be selected from the enclosed copy certificates.  He said that if indeed theintention was to ask the Bank to select the land use certificates to be used as replacement securities, there was no reason not tomake this clear in the letter.  He submits that even if there were copies of land use certificates enclosed, it was plain from theletter that the documents were enclosed to support the contention in the letter that HF Enterprises had made payment of land premiumand was in cash flow difficulty for good reason.  These are very trivial points.  There was no suggestion that the letter was a fabrication. Chan was seeking a favour from the Bank, if not for exchanging the securities at least for forbearance of some sort.  Chan couldnot have written that he had enclosed copies of land use certificates without actually enclosing them.  Mr Chan SCâs argument ofanother batch of certificate to be used in exchange is just misplaced.  He was over-emphasising on the wordsãæ³ç¨å¦ä¸æ¹ç¸ç­å¹å¼çæ¿å°ç¢è­æµæ¼çµ¦è²´è¡ãusedin the penultimate paragraph of the letter.  Chanâs evidence is that he was not referring to another batch of land use certificates. The words âanotherâ referred to other than the two LUCs then held by the Bank.  Whether Chan was offering another batch of landuse certificates for the exchange does not affect the Plaintiffsâ case a bit.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  The third point raised by Mr Chan SC is more substantial.  He referred to what the Plaintiffsâ accounting expert, Poole, saidin paragraph 3.32 of his 1<sup>st</sup> Report dated 26<sup>th</sup> August 2002:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn addition, I have been instructed that all land owned by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, other than the plots which constitute the New Securities, had already been pledged to lenders to the company prior to9 July 1996.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Under cross-examination, Poole said that he was told the above by Chan.  Hence, Mr Chan SC submits that if HF Shenzhen had mortgagedall its land other than the lots represented by the five LUCs before 9 July 1996, it was impossible for Chan to have sent nineteencopies of the land use certificates to the Bank for the Bankâs selection on or around 27 June 1996 and for there being nineteencopies on the table during the meeting on 9 July 1996 for selection.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Mr Chan SCâs argument is valid, only if viewed in isolation.   Chanâs evidence is supported by his letter dated 27 June 1996in which it was written that copies of land use certificates were enclosed.  On the other hand, Pooleâs report was prepared in2002, six years after the event.  Poole was asked to recall what had happened while he was preparing the report eight years ago. He said that the above information was provided either by Chan or by another staff whom he could not now recall.  If the informationwas provided by that other staff, it may be that staff was just speaking off his head without full knowledge or without referringhimself to documents.  If the information was provided by Chan, it may well be that Chan was careless or too casual or understandablytoo confused at the time in view of the collapse of his business empire and his own bankruptcy.  Likewise, he might not have addressedhis mind to the letter and the meeting.  I would place no weigh on Pooleâs evidence.  Looking at the totality of the evidence,especially the contemporaneous letter of 27 June 1996, and applying common sense, there is no reason why Chanâs evidence in Courtis not to be believed.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Mr Chan SC submits that as Chan only requested for the release of the two LUCs, it was highly improbable that LYT would all outof the blue offer to exchange for all the securities held by the Bank, including the Sheung Shui Property and PRC Factory.  Accordingto Chan, LYT only said that the Bank was considering whether to release the securities over the Sheung Shui Property and PRC Factory,but no decision was in fact made.  That, too, was the understanding of Wong.  As the five LUCs offered in exchange were worth morethan twice the value of the Consolidated Facility, LYTâs proposal could not be said to be devoid of commercial sense or at allimprobable.  LYT may have his own reasons for proposing to release all the securities.  The securities offered for exchange werenot only comparable but of double value. They were physically located in the PRC and were more accessible to the Bank, in case enforcementaction is necessary.  For those advantages, he might well be anxious to proceed with the proposal in the Bankâs interest.  LYTâsproposal as alleged by Chan is not improbable or is Chanâs evidence incredible.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  There is a slight discrepancy between Chanâs and Wongâs evidence as to whether the need for valuation of the properties offered      in exchange was discussed at the meeting.  Chan said it was. Wong said    it was not, but he was told by Chan that the issuehad been discussed      and agreed before the meeting.  LYT denied that the properties were ever identified at all.  I prefer Wongâsevidence.  He understood his position   was to keep record of what happened at the meeting and to take follow     up action.  Hefollowed up with the fax of 10 July 1996.  He took follow up action with respect to the exchange.  His recollection was quite precise. On the other hand, Chan, being   the chief executive officer of the HF Group had too much on his agenda    to be able to recallprecise details. It is more likely than not that he had discussed the issue of valuation with GJH and LYT before but not at the meetingand he had informed Wong of the discussion.  I accept Wongâs evidence as more credible.  But nothing turns on this minor discrepancyin the evidence.  Subject to the above, I accept Chanâs and Wongâs evidence as to what happened at the meeting.  The totalityof the evidence does not support LYTâs allegation that he had informed Chan about the mechanics for the exchange, the need to applyfor new facility to repay the outstanding loans etc.  Probably during the meeting, LYT acted on some misapprehension of the procedurehimself.  What he said about the mechanics etc. was just afterthoughts.  I certainly do not believe in LYTâs evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">The events between 10 July 1996 and 16 July 1996</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  On the day immediately following the meeting on 9 July 1996, i.e. 10 July 1996, Wong faxed a minute of the agreement reached atthe meeting to YLT.

This suggests that Chan and Wong considered that they were dealing with the Bankthrough LYT rather than GJH who only happened to have an intermittent presence during the meeting.  Mr Tong SCâs criticism of theBankâs failure to call GJH to give evidence is misplaced.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Wong said that the fax was a minute of the meeting on 9 July 1996 recording the agreement reached to effect the exchange of securitiesimmediately.  He set out the facilities granted to HF Shenzhen. He gave particulars of the five LUCs to be used in the exchange. He explained why no valuation of the new securities was necessary as the certificates were just issued towards the end of June 1996any valuation would only give a higher value.  He sought confirmation of the above and advice on the procedures. </p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Mr Chan SC takes a contrary view.  He emphasises on the phrases âç¾æåºä¸ååå°è¨¼ä½æ´æ (now we offer the followingland use certificates as exchange)â and âåæå¾è«ç¢ºèª (please confirm upon your agreement)â used by Wong in the fax. He submits that not only that the fax did not witness a concluded agreement, on the contrary the above phrases are clear evidenceof a still on-going negotiation.  He argues that there was not even any agreement on waiving the requirement for valuation of thenew securities. </p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Since 10 July 1996, Wong issued a string of faxes quoting the oral agreement and enquiring about the progress of the swap.  Thosefaxes are also relied on by the Plaintiffs as supporting the evidence of Chan and Wong about the oral agreement. </p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Wong explained that an agreement had already been reached on 9 July 1996 and that by those phrases, he meant what remained was forthe Bank to verify the information provided by HF Enterprises and to confirm the information was correct.  Those clauses are notto be quoted out of their context and the faxes are not to be read in isolation.  In the fax of 10 July 1996, Wong recorded thatat the meeting on 9 July 1996, the parties agreed to effect the exchange immediately(åæé¦¬ä¸é²è¡äº¤æ).  His purpose of specifyingthe land use certificates offered for the exchange was to give precision to the oral agreement.  Wong admitted that it was his wrongchoice of words.  The use of the word âç¾ (now)â was redundant and misfortunate.  Then he addressed the issue of valuation andsuggested that there was no need to value the properties represented by the five LUCs because they were newly issued with a currentvalue which was already twice the value of the Consolidated Facility. It was in that context that he sought LYTâs agreement notto call for valuation and not that he was seeking agreement to the exchange.  Once Wongâs explanation is accepted, there is nosignificance to be attached to the word âç¾ (now)â, the fact that he sought LYTâs confirmation to waiving valuation couldnot prevent an agreement from having been reached at the meeting on 9 July 1996. </p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Mr Chan SC argues that Wongâs reference to the existing facilities of $35 million was more consistent with exchange for all existingsecurities held by the Bank, but strangely no particulars of the existing securities to be released was given.  I think that is neitherhere nor there.  After all, Wong was a layman.  The evidence was clear.  At the meeting, Chan asked for release of the two LUCs only.</p>    <p class="heading">Delivery of the five LUCs on 16 July 1996</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  On 16 July 1996, Wong arranged for the five original LUCs referred to in the fax dated 10 July 1996 to be delivered to the OffshoreDepartment of the Bank.  The certificates were then delivered to the Shenzhen branch of the Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  According to Chan and Wong, the five LUCs were delivered to LYT pursuant to the Swap Agreement reached at the meeting on 9 July1996.  By way of contrast, LYTâs evidence was that the five LUCs were delivered to him voluntarily and he did not even know whythey were delivered to him.  So he sent them to Shenzhen branch for safe custody and to await further instructions from HF Groupas to their disposal.  If that was any truth in his evidence, he should have picked up the telephone and asked Wong.  It would havebeen open to him to say that the originals were delivered to him for the purpose of investigating title or valuation in respect ofan intended mortgage.  But that was not his evidence.  He wanted to steer clear of anything that might even remotely touch on theexchange.  He did so even to the extent of ridiculing himself.  His evidence was just laughable, especially as it came out of themouth of a senior bank officer.  He noted that the five LUCs belonged to HF Shenzhen whereas he only had discussions with Chan andWong on behalf of HF Enterprises.  His answer was artificial as he knew that Chan was the corporate mind of HF Group and Chan andWong were the natural persons who carried out the corporate will of the different members of the HF Group and that on his own evidencea week ago they were discussing about the exchange.  He must have read Wongâs fax of 8 October 1996 and knew that the five landuse certificates delivered to him were the five LUCs mentioned in that fax.  No one would have delivered such expensive title documentsto another without reason.  In the absence of an agreement to exchange, it is difficult to understand why Chan would have causedthe five LUCs to be delivered to the Bank and why the Bank would have held them for twenty-six months.  Clearly, LYT had a lot tohide about what he had said at the meeting on 9 July 1996.  He was not telling the truth in his evidence in Court.  I prefer Chanâsand Wongâs evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">The events between 17 July 1996 and 8 October 1996</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  After the meeting on 9 July 1996, a string of faxes dated 20 and 29 July, 22 and 29 August, and 27 September 1996 were sent by Wongto LYT referring to the agreement reached on 9 July 1996 and enquiring as to the progress and the procedures.  There was no writtenresponse from LYT or the Bank to the faxes.  On 19 August 1996, HF Enterprises repaid $7 million. On 29 August 1996, HXM, on behalfof the Bank, replied to Wongâs fax dated 22 August 1996 relating to Wongâs inquiry as to how that repayment was apportioned asbetween capital and interest.  But he gave no response to the enquiry about the swap which Wong also raised in that fax.  Then, on28 July 1996 HF Shenzhen entered into a sale and purchase agreement in respect of four blocks of flat in NCG Phase 1 for a considerationof RMB39,950,400.  If there was no agreement to release the two LUCs, Chan would not have entered into that agreement on behalf ofHF Shenzhen as he well knew that the sale of the flats could not be completed unless the two LUCs were released to HF Shenzhen toenable it to obtain the necessary pre-sale permits.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  On 27 September 1996, Wong wrote to LYT again. He referred to his telephone conversation with LYT on 25 September 1996 and the twoLUCs held by the Bank as security.  He said that HF Shenzhen had almost reached consensus for the sale of the blocks of flats.  Hesought the return of the two LUCs for the purpose of processing pre-sale permits so as to sell the flats and repay the Bank.

He could recall having spoken with Wong on one occasion in which Wong requested to exchangethe securities and he reiterated that HF Enterprises must repay the outstanding loan capital and interest and formally apply withfull set of documentation otherwise the Bank would not consider the request to exchange.  He said that the process would take aboutten days but HF Enterprises never applied or submitted any documentation, financial report, valuation report etc.  He admitted thathe could not recall if he had other telephone conversations with Wong.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Towards the end of September 1996, GJH, LYT, CW and a Miss Huang of the Bank had a very brief visit to HF Group office in EnergyPlaza.   LYT said that the visit was made at the invitation of Chan.  He said that during the visit Chan repeated the request toexchange the securities but he repeated that HF Enterprises must repay the outstanding loan and interest before the Bank would considerthe exchange.   According to Wong, no demand for repayment was made.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  Mr Chan SC referred to Wongâs fax dated 27 September 1996 in which Wong wrote âæ¬å¸èæ®åç­è¦âseeking the Bankâsconsideration and reply to the request for exchange.  He submits that was evidence that the parties were still in the course of negotiation. According to Chanâs and Wongâs evidence, an agreement was reached on 9 July 1996 for the immediately exchange of the two LUCsfor the five LUCs, though LYT was considering releasing all securities held by the Bank.  Thus, it is obvious that what Wong wasasking LYT to consider was the due or prompt performance of the Bankâs obligation under the Swap Agreement because HF Shenzhenhad performed its part of the agreement by delivering the original five LUCs and the matter was becoming urgent as HF Shenzhen hadreached consensus with a potential purchaser to purchase the blocks of flats in NCG Phase 1.  I think it would be wrong to arguethat the parties were still negotiating.</p>    <p class="heading">The telephone conversation on 8 October 1996</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  According to Wong, he telephoned LYT on 8 October 1996.  LYT told him that the Bank had agreed to exchange the two LUCs, that theBank was processing the application and that the proceeding would take about ten days.  After that conversation, he immediately senta fax to LYT to put on record what was discussed.  He wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ã8/10/96èä½ éé»è©±ï¼ç¥æè²´è¡å·²åæä»¥5æ¬éè±éå(æ·±å³)æéå¬å¸ä¹é¾å´åå°è¨¼ãç´æ¬ãï¼å¹å¼RMB52,060,635.00ä½çºæ´æä»¥å¾æææµæ¼å¨è¾²è¡çæ¿å°ç¢è¨¼(å¯åé±æå¸27/9/96å³çGW9159/96)ï¼æçºä½ æ¹å¨è¾¦çä¸­ï¼ä¼°è¨éæ10å¤©å·¦å³ï¼å¦æé£æ¹é¢æçºéè¦æå¸éåï¼è«åç¥ãã</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  LYT denied having had such a conversation with Wong.  He could not recall clearly if he had ever received the above fax but assertedthat no copy of the fax could be found in HF Enterprisesâ file kept by the Bank.  Given the adverse view I formed of LYTâs credibilityand in the light of the totality of the evidence, in particular the contemporaneous documents, I find that LYT had spoken with Wongon the telephone on 8 October 1996 and promised that the exchange could be arranged in ten days.  That is a clear acknowledgementof the agreement to swap securities.</p>    <p class="heading">The events between 14 October 1996 and 23 April 1997</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  In the ensuing six months, Wong kept on sending reminders by fax to LYT pressing for the exchange quoting the telephone conversationwith LYT on 8 October 1996.  He sent four such reminders on 14, 18 and 28 October, 12 November 1996.  There was not a single writtenresponse from LYT or the Bank.  However, there is no dispute that the Bank had kept on pressing for repayment.  On 31 December 1996,HF Enterprises repaid interest in the amount of $1.09 million.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  During the first quarter of 1997, Wong sent five more reminders dated 22 and 24 February; 3, 17 and 19 March 1997 to LYT by fax. In his fax dated 19 March 1997, he mentioned about having been informed by LYT at a meeting that the exchange would be effectedon or before 31 March 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  No exchange was effected.  Wong sent three more reminders on 1, 7 and 19 April 1997 to the Bank.  For the first time, the Bank responded. CYP replied on 23 April 1997 by fax as follows: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãæ¶å°è²´å¬å¸å³çè©¢åæ´ææµæ¼æ¿ç¢è¨¼äºå®ï¼ç¾åå°±å¹´åæè¡èé³å°å¹³ç¸½ç¶çåè«çæéç²¾ç¥é³è¿°å¦ä¸ï¼</p>        <p class="quote">1. æè¡åæè²´å¬å¸ç¹¼çºä½¿ç¨æ¹åä¹é¡åº¦ã</p>        <p class="quote">2. è²´å¬å¸æç¡å¿«æ¢å¾©é¡åº¦ä¹æ­£å¸¸ä½¿ç¨ï¼ä¸¦åå¿«æ¸éé¾æé¡åº¦ã</p>        <p class="quote">3.   è²´å¬å¸å å®æ¨éè¦è¦æ±æ´æåå°è¨¼1001335å1001336èï¼æè¡åæäºä»¥è¾¦çï¼ä½é¦æ¸¯æ¿ç¢è¨¼ï¼å» æ¿åä½å®çæµæ¼ï¼ä¸åææ´æãã</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  LYT argued that that fax was evidence that no concluded agreement had been reached at the meeting on 9 July 1996.  However, in thelight of my analysis of what happened at the meeting and the events which took place thereafter, I find that this fax precisely acknowledgedthe agreement reached at that meeting.  At the meeting, LYT had mentioned but without committed the Bank to release the securityover the PRC Factory and Sheung Shui Property.  This fax was just repeating what had been agreed and retreating what LYT had saidhe would consider.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  The faxes must be read and understood as a whole and against the background in which they were written.  I agree with Mr Tong SCthat it is inappropriate to subject the faxes to Mr Chan SCâs nit-picking exercise of dissecting each and every word used as ifthey were statutes.   One must also bear in mind that they were written by a layman.  Looking at the series of faxes issued by Wongin which the Swap Agreement and immediate exchange were referred to.  I think, with respect, Mr Chan SC was quoting Wongâs faxesout of the context.  LYTâs promise to effect the exchange within ten days, CWâs promise to effect the swap by 31 March 1997 andCYPâs reply on 23 April 1997 clearly acknowledged the Bankâs agreement to the exchange.  The total lack of response from theBank in the face of those allegations reinforces that conclusion.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether any agreement was reached at the meeting on 9 July 1996</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  Chan, Wong and LYT were the only three witnesses who testified about the events on 9 July 1996.  Looking at the totality of theevidence and the contemporaneous documents, Chanâs and Wongâs evidence are clearly to be preferred.  They gave evidence in alogical manner.  Their evidence makes sense and, most importantly, is supported by contemporaneous documents issued by Wong, in particularthe faxes of 10 July, 27 September and 8 October 1996 and by CYPâs fax of 23 April 1997.  The Plaintiffsâ and the Bankâs conductin respectively delivering and safe keeping the five LUCs could only be explained on the basis of the Swap Agreement. </p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  On the other hand, LYTâs evidence is hopelessly unconvincing.  He bore the hallmark of a defensive witness trying to avoid tellingthe truth for fear that he might have said anything wrong.  He regurgitated time and again what he thought was safe for him to tell. For example, he said he insisted HF Enterprises to repay the outstanding loans and interest before the Bank would consider exchangingthe securities and that HF Enterprises had to apply with full documentation, including board resolution, financial statements andvaluation reports of the property to be used as new security. As Chan rightly pointed out in cross-examination, if HF Group couldrepay the outstanding loans and interest there was no need for the swap.  HF Enterprises would have the right to demand return ofthe securities.  LYTâs evidence is not supported by any contemporaneous documents and is wholly unrealistic. Surprisingly, he couldnot recall if he had seen the crucial faxes dated 27 September 1996 and 8 October 1996.  He asserted that he could not find thosedocuments in HF Enterprisesâ file in the Bank.  He could not recall if he had the conversation with Wong on 8 October 1996.  Evenif he had missed those faxes or forgotten about that conversation, he could not have missed a whole string of faxes thereafter addressedto him and quoting those two faxes or conversation.  More importantly, while not denying the authenticity of those faxes, neitherhe nor the Bank responded.  LYT demonstrated a total lack of good faith as a witness.  He was obviously not telling the truth. </p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  Chanâs evidence about HF Group having to pay huge sums of land premium and about having reached agreement with Lung Shing Propertyand Yue Hua Trading to purchase four blocks of flats in NCG Phase 1 is supported by contemporaneous documents.  To enable the saleto complete, Chan had to seek the Bankâs release of the two LUCs.  All these are set out in his letter dated 27 June 1996.  Hence,he went with Wong to Shenzhen branch of the Bank on 9 July 1996 specifically to discuss with GJH and LYT about the exchange of securities. In contrast, LYTâs evidence is that Chan and Wong simply went all the way from Hong Kong to the Bankâs conference room in Shenzhento retract his request for a swap and simply to ask for release of the two LUCs or just to be reminded to repay the outstanding loansand interest.  That is incredible.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  As the evidence unfolded LYT changed the tenor of his evidence and admitted that the question of exchange was discussed at the meetingon 9 July 1996.  He only denied having agreed to the proposal or made any proposal or given guarantee on behalf of the Bank.  Theonly blemish in Chanâs evidence is as to what LYT had offered in exchange for the five LUCs. According to Chan, his letter dated27 June 1996 and the nineteen copies of land use certificates were placed on the table at the time of the discussion. His concernwas to seek the release of the two LUCs.  He asked how many land use certificates would be required to exchange for the two LUCs. LYT told him that the Bank preferred exchanging all the securities held by the Bank as one lot, i.e. including the securities overthe PRC Factory and Sheung Shui Property.  Chan said that he and LYT then picked five copies of land use certificates from the batchof nineteen copy certificates and agreed to use the originals of the five LUCs to exchange for all the securities then held by theBank.  However, in his first witness statement, Chan said that LYTâs response was that the Bank was considering whether it wouldalso release the securities over the PRC Factory and/or the Sheung Shui Property but as his concern was for the release of the twoLUCs, he did not discuss the topic further.  Mr Chan SC criticised Chan for departing from his witness statement.  Chan denied andattempted to draw support from Wongâs fax dated 10 July 1996.  However, Wongâs evidence was also that the Bank agreed to releasethe two LUCs only.  Wong also admitted that when he wrote in his faxes that the Bank had agreed to exchange for all the securities,he was only stating his subjective wish in an attempt to bargain for more benefits for the Plaintiffs as the five LUCs had a valuefar in excess of the Consolidated Facility or outstanding loan and interest. This, I think, is the only blemish in Chanâs evidence. This finding only cut down the extent of the Swap Agreement, but has little impact on Chanâs credibility.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Mr Chan SC carried out a fine forensic analysis of Chanâs and Wongâs evidence in his seven hundred page long closing submission(which included recital of the evidence for the convenience of the Court) to show that their evidence is not to be believed.  Hecriticised them for failing to explain many of the questions he put to them.  I have considered his arguments fully but I do notthink they dented the credibility of Chan and Wong in any way.  One cannot overlook the totality of the evidence and that human natureis but common sense.  The events occurred fourteen years ago.  No witness could be expected to remember why he did or did not doany particular act in respect of all minutiae details.  This consideration applied to Chan and Wong just as it applied to LYT.  ButLYTâs failure is glaring.  I do not intend to over-burden this already long judgment by dealing with all the criticisms raisedby Mr Chan SC.  I shall deal with the more significant ones. </p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Mr Chan SC queried the credibility of Chanâs case by comparing the date of the Swap Agreement pleaded at the commencement of theaction with that as pleaded in the latest Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim.  Initially, the Plaintiffs pleaded an oral agreementon 16 July 1996. No explanation for the amendment was given by Chan.  I think Mr Chan SC has given this query the significance whichit does not deserve.  There was nothing to suggest there was any change in Chanâs witness statement.  It is obvious that the changewas probably a draftsmanâs point.  On Chanâs evidence the Swap Agreement was reached on 9 July 1996 and not 16 July 1996 whenthe originals of the five LUCs were delivered to the Bank.  Mr Chan SC also found it notable that the agreement as pleaded was toexchange for âother propertiesâ and not the five lots of land held under the five LUCs delivered to the Bank on 16 July 1996. With respect, I think Mr Chan SC was being fault-finding.  The amendment in the pleading does not have any adverse impact on thecredibility of Chan or Wong.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Mr Chan SC criticized Chan for not being able to explain why he did not mention the Swap Agreement reached on 9 July 1996 or thetelephone conversation on 8 October 1996 in his letter dated 23 May 1998 to the Bank.  Again, that letter was quoted out of its factualcontext.  That letter was issued almost two years after the meeting on 9 July 1996 and shortly before the total break down of relationshipbetween the parties.  At the time, the Bank asked HF Enterprises to make a fresh application for facility instead of proceeding withthe exchange, which Chan did still in the hope of effecting the swap.  In that connection, the Bank wrote to HF Enterprises on 11May 1998 asking for repayment of outstanding interest of $1.33 million as part of their agreement to regularize(ç¤æ´»)the account. It was in that context, Chan wrote the letter of 23 May 1998.  He was pleading for indulgence to repay.  As Chan said under cross-examination,HF Group was in financial difficulties and his concern was to deal with the fresh application so as to obtain the release of thetwo LUCs so that the blocks of flats in NCG Phase 1 could be sold to solve his cash flow problem.  It was not in his interest toprovoke the Bank by accusing it of failure to honour the oral agreement as suggested by counsel.  Again, this criticism was unfair.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Perhaps, the most powerful criticism of Chanâs credibility arose out of the Plaintiffsâ conduct in Shen 654/1998 and Shen 655/1998. In Shen 654/1998, the Bank sued HF Enterprises and HF Shenzhen as borrower and mortgagor of the PRC Factory under Facility 4.  HFEnterprises defaulted appearance.  HF Shenzhen was legally represented.  Its defence was that the action was time-barred and theinterest on the loan should be calculated in accordance with the regulations of the Peopleâs Bank of China. In Shen 655/1998, HFEnterprises and Lung Shing Property were respectively sued as borrower and mortgagor of the two lots of land.  As in Shen 654/1998,HF Enterprises also did not appear.  Lung Shing Property was represented by the same firm of lawyers who represented HF Shenzhenin Shen 654/1998.  No defence was pleaded by Lung Shing Property.  The case of the Bank was admitted.  In both cases, judgment wasentered against HF Enterprises and HF Shenzhen. During cross-examination, Chan was asked if he had informed his PRC lawyers aboutthe existence of the Swap Agreement.  Chan repeatedly said he could not remember.  Mr Chan SC submits that if indeed there was sucha Swap Agreement and in view of the catastrophe the Bankâs breach of agreement had caused HF Group, there was no reason why Chan,HF Enterprises or HF Shenzhen did not inform their PRC lawyers to contest the action and to make a counterclaim rather than for HFEnterprises to default appearance in both actions and for HF Shenzhen to raise such spurious defence as limitation. </p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  The judgments of those two actions were delivered in April 2000.  Chanâs evidence must be viewed against the backdrop of a manwhose hard built business empire was fast falling apart, HF Holdings was facing winding up and he was facing his own bankruptcy. As soon as he was informed by the Bank on 14 September 1998 that the exchange or the application for new facility was refused, heinstructed his then solicitors, Messrs Robert W. H. Wang &amp; Co., to demand the Bank to return of the five LUCs.  One day aftertheir return, he commenced the present action on 25 September 1998.  But by 2000 when the two actions came up for trial in the PRCcourt, Chan was in deep financial trouble in Hong Kong, ending up the year with the winding up of HF Holdings and his own bankruptcy. He said that he was too burdened to be able to recall what instructions he had given to his lawyers in the PRC in relation to thetwo actions.  He agreed that it would have been normal to inform his PRC lawyers about the Swap Agreement and he believed that theactions should have been tried in Hong Kong as he had commenced proceedings in Hong Kong before the Bank commenced the two actionsin the PRC.  The way the two actions were conducted was peculiar.  HF Enterprises defaulted in both actions, but HF Shenzhen waslegally represented.  HF Shenzhen was represented by the same firm of lawyers representing Lung Shing Property.  Effectively LungShing Property admitted the Bankâs claim and HF Shenzhen put up a spurious defence.  Lung Shing Property was sued as mortgagor. It had no beneficial interest over the mortgaged properties because it was only their owner in a reliance relationship.  HF Enterprisesand HF Shenzhen were both under the control of Chan.  One wonders why HF Enterprises defaulted in both actions when HF Shenzhen wasrepresented in one.  Or put it the other way round, why HF Shenzhen was represented when HF Enterprises was not.  I do not wish tosurmise what happened in the two actions, but it appears that Lung Shing Property had the conduct of the defence in both actionsinstead of HF Enterprises and HF Shenzhen.  I have no doubt that in view of the circumstances Chan was facing, he could not recallwhat he had instructed his lawyers, if he had.  The Swap Agreement had been quoted in the string of faxes and in the letter of MessrsRobert W.H. Wang &amp; Co.  These are contemporaneous documents.  The allegation could not have been created with the foresight ofthe present litigation in mind.  I am left in no doubt that Chan and Wong were telling the truth.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  In conclusion, except for the little blemish I mentioned above, I accept Chanâs and Wongâs evidence as to what happened at themeeting on 9 July 1996.  In brief, Chan sent the Bank his letter dated 27 June 1996, enclosing copies of nineteen newly issued landuse certificates and proposed using some of those certificates to exchange for the two LUCs held by the Bank as security.  Then Chanand Wong attended a meeting with the Bank in its Shenzhen branch to discuss the exchange.  Chan selected five copies of land usecertificates with a value of RMB52 million and offered to use the originals of the five LUCs to exchange for the two LUCs held bythe Bank.  LYT agreed on behalf of the Bank and asked for the originals.  An agreement was reached between Chan representing HF Enterprisesand HF Shenzhen on the one part and LYT representing the Bank on the other part to exchange the securities.  The essence of the agreementwas recorded in the fax dated 10 July 1996 issued by Wong to LYT, except that the exchange was limited to the two LUCs only. </p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  Pursuant to that agreement, the Plaintiffs delivered the five original LUCs to the Offshore Department of the Bank, which were receivedby LYT who forwarded them to the Shenzhen branch of the Bank for custody.  In a string of faxes that followed, Wong quoted the SwapAgreement reached at the meeting on 9 July 1996 and pressed for the exchange.  Those faxes were received by the Bank without demur. The authenticity of those documents were not in dispute.  The Bank had never retorted or denied the existence of the Swap Agreement. Indeed, during a telephone conversation on 8 October 1996, LYT confirmed the agreement with Wong.  In a fax dated 23 April 1997,CYP also quoted the agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  Having made the above finding, it is not necessary to consider the Plaintiffsâ alternative case based on the telephone conversationbetween Wong and LYT on 8 October 1996.  I accept Wongâs evidence about the telephone conversation.  It flowed from the Swap Agreementmade on 9 July 1996 and did not constitute a separate agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  I must emphasise that for the present purpose the word âagreementâ is used in the laymenâs or non-technical sense as opposedto a binding legal agreement.  âConsensusâ would have been a more proper word. What was the content of that Swap Agreement andits legal effect will be dealt with in the following sections.</p>    <p class="heading">The terms of the Swap Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  In essence, the crux of the Swap Agreement was to exchange the two LUCs then held by the Bank for the five LUCs.  It is the Plaintiffsâcase that the express term of the Swap Agreement was evidenced by the fax dated 10 July 1996.  In addition, the Plaintiffs pleadedin paragraph 5A of the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim that there was an implied term that the Bank was to use its best endeavourto facilitate or carry into effect the swap and not to impede any further procedures required to effect the swap or towithhold itsapproval for such procedure unreasonably.  Mr Chan SC argues that the implied terms pleaded are contradictory to the existence ofa binding agreement.  I think, if the express term of a valid and concluded agreement is proved, it goes without saying that theparties shall carry out the terms of the agreement with reasonable despatch, unless the time for performance is expressly providedfor or is expressed to be not of the essence of the agreement.  What is reasonable despatch depends on the factual circumstancesof the case.  It may not necessarily be synonymous with best endeavour.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  The crux of the Swap Agreement reached on 9 July 1996 was to exchange the two LUCs held by the Bank for the five LUCs agreed betweenChan and LYT.  The five LUCs were particularised in Wongâs fax to LYT dated 10 July 1996 and subsequently delivered to the Bankon 16 July 1996.  The agreement was to effect the exchange forthwith.  Given the nature of the securities and the statutory requirementunder Hong Kong law or PRC law, the word âforthwithâ could not mean anything other than as soon as practicable and subject tothe time required for completion of the necessary formalities.  To give business efficacy or as a matter of necessity, it must beimplied into the agreement a term that the Bank should use its best endeavours to facilitate or carry into effect the swap becausewithout the co-operation of the Bank, the agreement simply could not be performed.  However, the Plaintiffsâ claim is not for damagesfor delayed performance, but for total non-performance.  Those implied terms pleaded are redundant and only provoked unnecessaryarguments.  Indeed they were used to fuel the Bankâs argument that the implied terms pleaded are contradictory to the existenceof a binding agreement, which I dismiss.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  Another implied term pleaded by the Plaintiffs in paragraph 7 of the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim is that the Bank would haveto return (presumably without demand) the five LUCs if the swap was not to be effected within a reasonable time. Mr Tong SC arguesthat the five LUCs were delivered to the Bank against the background of there being intended purchasers for some of the flats builton the land represented by the two LUCs and the Plaintiffs wanting to use the five LUCs to exchange for those two LUCs so as to sellthe blocks of flats to repay the Bank.  He then argues that the swap had to be carried out expeditiously to meet those ends and inthe premises it must be an implied term or condition in the delivery of the five LUCs that they should be returned within a reasonabletime if the swap was not to take place.  He submits that such an implied term was plainly within the partiesâ contemplation andwas necessary, for it must have been clear to all that, given the financial pressure HF Enterprises was facing at the time and thefact that the Plaintiffs were entrusting two sets of valuable securities to the Bank with value far exceeding the debt owed by HFEnterprises; if there was to be no swap, the Plaintiffs would apply the new securities towards relieving HF Enterprisesâ financialpressure.  Hence, Mr Tong SC argues that if the Bank never agreed to or intended to perform the swap, its prolonged retention ofthe five LUCs amounted to a breach of implied term.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  The court may imply a term into a contract in order to give effect the presumed intention of the parties or to give business efficacyto the contract: see <i>The Moorcock</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20PD%2064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 14 PD 64.</a>  A term could only be implied into a contract if it is necessary.  The court will not imply a term which the parties were too lazyto make for themselves, no matter how reasonable the term is.  Though it was apparent to the Bank that HF Enterprises was in financialdifficulties and was in arrears of repayment, it was also apparent to the Bank that HF Enterprises had other resources, includingaccess to another fourteen very valuable land use certificates.  The implied term suggested was certainly reasonable.  But I am unableto see how such an implied term would be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract.  If the Plaintiffs considered thatreasonable time had lapsed and they wanted the five LUCs back, they could simply ask the Bank.  Why should the Plaintiffs choosenot to ask and now raise the implied term argument?  There is no necessity to impose an implied obligation on the Bank to returnthe certificates.  Accordingly, I decline to imply such a term into the oral agreement.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether the Swap Agreement was a concluded agreement</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  Mr Chan SC argues that the Swap Agreement was, at the highest, a consensus reached in the course of a negotiation which was shortof a binding agreement.  He used the term âbinding agreementâ.  But I prefer the term âconcluded agreementâ and reserve histerm to those concluded agreements which are legally binding as having fulfilled any formal requirements as required by law or asnot having been otherwise vitiated.  Mr Tong SC takes the view that the point argued is an unpleaded point based on uncertainty. He objects to the point taken by Mr Chan SC as the Plaintiffs would then be required to engage in âshadow-boxingâ with the Bank. A party suing on a contract has the burden of proving the contract.  It is open to the defendant to test the plaintiffâs caseby adducing some evidence or argument that no contract has yet been concluded as the parties were still in the course of negotiation. It is one thing to argue that a contract has not yet been formed and another to avoid the liability under a contract founded onterms which are void for uncertainty.  The party seeking to avoid a contract for uncertainty bears the burden of proving the uncertainty. The distinction between the two is a very fine one.  But, in my view, Mr Chan SC has not crossed over the line.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  Negotiation of a contract may take place by stages.  The parties would first seek agreement or to avoid ambiguity, consensus ormeeting of the minds, on the essential term or terms.  When that stage has been achieved, they may say that they have reached agreementin principle.  That is still short of an agreement.  It is just an agreement to agree.  They will then negotiate on all the termsthat the parties intend to include in the contract beyond those essential terms.  In the course of their negotiation, they may finetune what they have achieved.  But, it is only when they have reached consensus on all the essential terms to make a contract andall the terms they desire to put in the contract that one can say that the parties have reached a âconcluded agreementâ.  Evenwhere the parties have reached consensus on all the terms essential for an agreement, if they still intend to have more terms, nomatter how trivial they are on an objective view, to be agreed before they are bound, the parties are still in the process of negotiationand there is no concluded agreement.  In <i>Rossiter v Miller</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%203%20AC%201124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 3 App. Cas 1124</a>, Lord Blackburn said at 1151:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSo long as they are only in negotiation either party may retract; and though the parties may have agreed on all the cardinal pointsof the intended contract, yet, if some particulars essential to the agreement still remain to be settled afterwards, there is nocontract. The parties, in such a case, are still only in negotiation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  The requirement that there must be complete agreement not only on all essential terms but also on terms desired by the parties cannotbe overlooked.  A good example is the House of Lords decision in <i>Hussey v Horne-Payne</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281879%29%204%20AC%20311" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1879) 4 App. Cas 311.</a>  In that case, the parties agreed to the price and the property to be sold, i.e. meeting of minds on the three-Ps.  The purchaserhowever requested the vendor to agree to payment of the purchase price subject to the title being approved by his solicitors.  Subsequentto that, he further suggested to pay by instalments.  The vendor insisted on immediate payment of 10% and the balance in a few months. The House of Lords held that there was no concluded agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  An example in Hong Kong is the Court of Final Appealâs decision in<i>Kwan Siu Man</i> <i>and</i> <i>Yaacov Ozer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d98%29%201%20HKCFAR%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-98) 1 HKCFAR 343.</a>  In that case, the parties were former landlord and tenant of a property.  Their relationship was not an entirely happy one.  Thelandlord obtained judgment against the tenant for rent in the High Court with costs.  The tenant was applying for a new tenancy whilethe landlord was seeking an order for possession in the Lands Tribunal.  One day, the parties somehow met in the lift lobby wherethe tenant agreed to purchase and the landlord agreed to sell the property for $4.25 million. Subsequently, the landlord called offthe deal.  The Court of Final Appeal held that in the context of Hong Kong conveyancing, the mere fact that the parties have agreedon the property and the price, being the three-Ps required for an open contract, did not immediately bring about the existence ofa concluded contract between the parties for the sale of the property, it still required the court to scrutinize the surroundingcircumstances carefully, and not be too impressed by the partiesâ own protestations as regards their intent.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  This case is heavily relied on by Mr Chan SC. He referred to the following dicta of Litton PJ at 355:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBy parity of reasoning, there is nothing to prevent an owner selling a property on a âhandshakeâ, but when such an unusualcase is put forward, and is accepted by the trial Judge, the function of the Court of Appeal is to <u>examine critically the factual foundation</u> upon which the judgeâs finding is based.It cannot just accept blandly the label âopen contractâ as if that were some kind ofmagic shibboleth, sufficient by itself to confer on the purchaser the rights of a beneficial owner.â</p>        <p class="quote">(Emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Chan SC drew my attention to Litton PJâs emphasis on the need of the court to carefully scrutinize the evidence and the partiesâintention to have an immediately binding agreement in the light of the unusual nature of the alleged agreement, i.e. an agreementfor the sale of a flat allegedly reached at a lift lobby over a short conversation.  Likewise, Mr Chan SC argues that in the presentcase it was unlikely that the Bank would have during a brief conversation at its office entered into a concluded agreement for theexchange of some securities it was holding by other securities which it had done no valuation of. </p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  Mr Chan SC also referred to the following dicta of Bokhary PJ at 363:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSo even assuming that an open contract can be made under our law, still our courts should always be slow to find that such a contracthas indeed been made in any given case. The making of such a contract is not to be found just because there has been a meeting ofminds as to parties, property and price. For the strong probability would be that such meeting of minds was no more than one stagein the course of on-going negotiations. This is because in Hong Kong nowadays the inherent probability is that negotiations for thesale of land would, if successfully concluded, result in a contract which includes express terms as to other important matters inaddition to parties, property and price: not least of all the date for completion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then, his Lordship continued at 364:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOnce that question receives consideration, it can be seen that the inherent and strong probability is that their meeting of mindswas indeed merely one stage in such negotiations: in other words that no oral contract had been made. Indeed the Judge seems, withoutrealising it, in effect so to have found. For she spoke of the parties having âagreed on all important mattersâ and leaving âallother details ... for their solicitors to sort out.â But in the circumstances of this case, <u>the matters left to the solicitors were much more than mere details. They included the very important matter of the date for completion.</u> <u>Accordingly all that the parties achieved was an agreement to agree: and that is not a contract. The law preserves bargains; but itdoes not create them: that must be done by the parties themselves, if it is to be done at all</u>.â (Emphasis added).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  Based on these dicta, Mr Chan SC argues that the discussion on 9 July 1996 was only a stage in a negotiation process without anylegally binding contract for the exchange of securities having been formed.  He argues that from any point of view, a contract betweena banker and a customer over the question of provision of security is a serious matter.  Even assuming that the parties did havea meeting of the minds over what security the customer would like to be released and what security was offered in substitution, itis against common sense that one would expect that the customer, not to mention the banker, would expect that they would have a bindingand enforceable contract over a preliminary conversation without any valuation of the security offered, without going through thenormal vetting procedure of the bank and without any stipulation on the reward or charges of the bank.  He characterised the oralSwap Agreement put forward by the Plaintiffs as a âcontract by a handshakeâ and urges the Court to examine critically the factualfoundation upon which the allegation is based.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  Mr Tong SC seeks to distinguish <i>Kwan Siu Man</i> from the present case by arguing that in <i>Kwan Siu Man</i> the Court of Final Appeal was concerned about an agreement allegedly reached on a casual, chanced meeting in the lift lobby.  Itwas also a composite agreement involving besides the sale of property, settlement of Lands Tribunal proceedings and costs in certainHigh Court proceedings.  He pointed out that the finding of the Court of First Instance which was overturned by the Court of FinalAppeal was solely based on the sale and purchase of property.  He argues that the present case is wholly distinguishable.  Chan andWong went all the way from Hong Kong with the sole purpose of discussing the Swap Agreement.  The meeting was held in the conferenceroom of the Bank in the normal course of its business.  Chanâs proposal contained in his letter dated 27 June 1996 with copiesof the nineteen land use certificates were placed on table for discussion.  Short, though the meeting was and with GJH leaving theconference room every now and then, the discussion took place under a business-like atmosphere.  I agree with Mr Tong SC.  The presentcase is distinguishable from <i>Kwan Siu Man</i> and the oral agreement was not a contract by handshake.  However, given the exchange of securities is a serious matter, whether theparties have reached a concluded agreement does deserve critical examination. </p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  In answer to Mr Chan SCâs arguments that the Swap Agreement was but one stage of the negotiation and there were still other outstandingmatters to be agreed, Mr Tong SCâs reply is that the Swap Agreement was an open contract. The only outstanding items which he couldidentify from Mr Chan SCâs cross-examination are: the procedures to be executed to effect the swap; the fees payable to the Bankfor the swap and the valuation of the new securities. He submits that it is plain from the very nature of those items that they wereat best peripheral to the Swap Agreement and could not in any way be said to be fundamental terms that failing to agree on them wouldmean no agreement at all.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  I agree with Mr Tong SCâs submission.  The Court of Final Appeal in <i>Kwan Siu Man</i> did not find that there could be no valid open contract as a matter of law.  It only cautioned against the finding of an open contractin the context of sale and purchase of properties in Hong Kong, since the date of completion is invariably regarded as an importantterm ranking probably on a par with parties, property and price.  In the end, the Court of Final Appeal rejected the argument basedon open contract because of the casual, chanced nature of the meeting and the trial judgeâs inconsistent finding of fact.  However,in the present case, the parties were not strangers.  At the time, they had a continuous business relationship for two years prior. It is open to the Plaintiffs to argue on open contract.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  Insofar as procedures are concerned, it is clear that they were just standard procedures of the Bank and the terms were standardterms.  It had always been the Bank who dictated the formalities.  In other words, it was for Bank to specify the procedures andformalities to be undertaken, and that was precisely what HF Enterprises had been chasing the Bank to do through the series of faxes. When the Bank suggested in 1998 to HF Enterprises that it should effect the swap through a new loan application, HF Enterprisesimmediately complied and submitted the application.  Plainly the proper procedure to be adopted was a matter entirely for the Bankwhich HF Enterprises would unconditionally accept.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  As for the fees payable to the Bank, as Chan explained, payment of the fees had always been in his contemplation but that was nota matter which concerned him, since the amounts would be insignificant compared to the amount of the outstanding loan and, I shouldadd, his dire need for the swap.  They had a past and a then on-going business relationship.  All throughout this relationship, thequestion of fees was never discussed.  HF Enterprises would just accept whatever amount the Bank proposed.  Neither had Chan everdisputed the interest rates charged.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  As for the requirement of valuation, the question is what had the parties agreed.  According to Chan, it was agreed at the meetingon 9 July 1996 that no valuation was necessary.  According to Wong, the requirement for valuation was not discussed, but he was toldby Chan that GJH and LYT had agreed with him prior to the meeting that no valuation was necessary as the five LUCs had just beenissued by the Shenzhen Land Bureau in June 1996 with an up-to-date valuation of RMB52 million, which was about twice the ConsolidatedFacility.  LYT denied that there was such an agreement reached during the meeting or at all.  Though the Plaintiffsâ evidence isconflicting, given the unfavourable view I formed of LYTâs credibility, I accept Wongâs evidence.  From the fact that it wasonly until very late during the twenty-six month period that the Bank asked for valuation, I draw the inference that Wongâs evidencewas true.  Chan and LYT or GJH had agreed to dispense with the requirement of valuation.  Furthermore, the evidence is also clearthat if the Bank had insisted on valuation of the new securities, the Plaintiffs would have complied.  As a matter of fact, whenthe Bank subsequently demanded valuation two years later in 1998, the Plaintiffs complied without demur.  A valuation of RMB47.327million was obtained which exceeded the facilities by a wide margin. The absence of a valuation report or agreement to obtain a valuationas such is not anything which could prevent a contract from being concluded.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  That said, valuation may be very relevant in another context.  Facility would only be granted upon the borrower providing such securityas the lending bank considers adequate.  Hence, a valuation report of the security is almost a must.  A lending bank would lend upto a certain percentage of the value of the security offered.  However, the prime consideration of a lending bank is the borrowerâsability to repay rather than the value of the security.  Having to enforce a security is what a lending bank wishes to avoid.  Thus,apart from the value of the security, the lending bank will consider other factors such as the liquidity of the security, creditworthiness of the borrower and his ability to repay, his asset worth, the purpose of the loan, the business risk, etc.  Some of thesefactors could not be assessed until a valuation report of the security is available and the bank had an opportunity to review allthose considerations.  Usually, these are considered by a credit approval committee rather than the front line staff, no matter howsenior he is.</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  In the present case, the oral agreement was not an agreement for exchange of personal chattels but an exchange of securities. Theagreement could not be performed by LYT opening his drawer or the safe of the Bank, retrieving the two LUCs and giving them to Chanin exchange for the five LUCs and putting them into the safe as if they were chattels which exchange could be effected upon delivery. The exchange is not as simple as Mr Tong SC suggested as merely comparing the value of the securities offered for the exchange againstthat held by the Bank and involved no input or control by the credit approval committee of the Bank.  As a matter of legal procedure,the two LUCs could only be returned to HF Shenzhen upon HF Enterprises repaying the outstanding loan and the Bank discharging themortgage under the Consolidated Facility.  HF Enterprises did not have the necessary funds to repay the loan.  It is therefore commonground that the exchange could only be effected, as explained by LYT and agreed by Wong, by HF Enterprises using new securities toobtain a new loan to repay the outstanding loan under the Consolidated Facility.  The application for the new loan required approvalfrom the credit approval committee and the mortgage of the new securities would have to be registered with Shenzhen Land Bureau. It was not merely a matter of comparing the value of the securities.  Submission of valuation report certifying that the propertieswere of a certain value is not the last formality which seals a contract.  A decision had yet to be made by the Bank whether to agreeto the exchange.  That decision had to be made not by LYT but by an independent credit approval committee.  Valuation is but oneof the considerations.  The credit approval committee may rightly or wrongly for any of the considerations I have mentioned aboveor for other commercial reasons unforeseen by the processing front line staff of the Bank reject a loan application despite the adequacyof the security.  Indeed, the Offshore Department and GJH sitting on the credit approval committee supported HF Enterprises applicationfor new facility.  However, the credit approval committee rejected the application because of an unfavourable comment by the Longgangbranch of the Bank that the security was not marketable and land premium had not been fully paid.  This precisely demonstrates thecaution which one has to exercise in determining whether a concluded agreement was reached during the meeting on 9 July 1996 in relationto an agreement of this nature.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  What the parties agreed at the meeting on 9 July 1996 must be understood in the light of the nature of the underlying transaction.The agreement would involve HF Enterprises applying for a new loan which would be subject to scrutiny by the credit approval committeeof, among other things, HF Enterprisesâ credit-worthiness, ability to repay the adequacy of the securities offered, its liquidityand other commercial considerations.  It could not have been intended to be an outright swap such as an exchange of personal chattels.Given his experience and position in the Bank, LYT would not have misunderstood the agreement to be such.  By reason of their previousdealings, HF Enterprises must know the procedures involved.  Even if Chan thought that it was just an outright swap, at least, accordingto Wong, he knew the exchange would involve approval by the Bank.  The agreement has to be viewed objectively.  The so called agreementmust be conditional upon the Bank or its credit approval committee approving an application for a new loan using the five LUCs. It was subject to so many uncertainties which the parties were aware of.  Those were not matters which could be left to be agreedbetween lawyers.  It was also unwittingly admitted by the Plaintiffsâ expert, Zhang, that the exchange must be predicated on theBank being satisfied as to the value of the new securities and that the whole of the arrangement was finally worked out, includingHF Enterprisesâ being willing to pay the handling fees required by the Bank.  It is impossible that in a brief meeting of thatnature, LYT could have committed the Bank to advance money on the strength of the securities represented by the five LUCs withoutundergoing the process of approval by the credit approval committee.  Though the word âagreeâ or some other strong language mighthave been used, at the highest, the agreement was an agreement subject to approval or an agreement to process the application forexchange which in turn involved an application for a new loan.  LYT agreed to support HF Enterprisesâ application for a new loanfor the purpose of discharging the loan under the Consolidated Facility and for the release of the two LUCs.  The Swap Agreementwas just an agreement to agree or an agreement subject to approval which is short of a concluded agreement.  The parties could notbe said to have reached a concluded agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  The alternative basis of the Plaintiffsâ claim under the oral agreement is Wongâs telephone conversation with LYT on 8 October1996.  As the underlying basis of that agreement was the discussion or agreement reached at the meeting on 9 July 1996, the alternativeclaim also fails for the same reason.  Any agreement which LYT was said to have made with Wong was no more than an agreement subjectto approval by the credit approval committee or an agreement to agree.  There was no concluded agreement.  </p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Counsel argued on LYTâs ostensible authority to bind the Bank.  As there was no concluded agreement, whether LYT had actual orostensible authority is just besides the point.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  For the above reasons, the Plaintiffsâ claim for breach of contract under Hong Kong law or PRC law must fail as there was no concludedagreement.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  In the last part of this judgment, I shall, for the sake of completeness, deal with the alternative scenario by assuming that therewere a concluded agreement reached on 9 July 1996.  I now turn to the Plaintiffsâ claim for misrepresentation.</p>    <p class="heading">MISREPRESENTATION</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  The Plaintiffsâ case on misrepresentation as pleaded in the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim is based on a representation madeat the meeting on 9 July 1996 (âFirst Representationâ) and another representation made in early March 1998 (âSecond Representationâ).</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  Both representations were made in the Shenzhen branch of the Bank.  Thus, the Plaintiffs would only be entitled to pursue this causeof action if its claim satisfies the requirement of double-actionability, i.e. the wrong is of a character that if committed wouldhave been actionable in Hong Kong, and the civil liability in respect of the claim exists as between the actual parties under thelaw of the foreign country where the act was committed: see <i>Boys v Chaplin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 356.</a>  Mr Chan SC accepts that in the present case, if the Plaintiffs were able to prove misrepresentation under Hong Kong law, both limbsof the requirement would be satisfied.  This is because the alleged wrong complained of is misrepresentation, which is plainly actionableunder Hong Kong law and the wrong complained of would also give rise to civil liability under article 42 of Contract Law of the PeopleâsRepublic of China(ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååååæ³ã)(âContract Lawâ) which provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãç¶äºäººå¨è¨ç«ååéç¨ä¸­æä¸åæå½¢ä¹ä¸ï¼çµ¦å°æ¹é ææå¤±çï¼æç¶æ¿ææå®³è³ åè²¬ä»»ï¼</p>        <p class="quote">(ä¸) ååè¨ç«ååï¼æ¡æé²è¡ç£åï¼</p>        <p class="quote">(äº) ææé±çèè¨ç«ååæéçéè¦äºå¯¦æèæä¾èåææ³ï¼</p>        <p class="quote">(ä¸) æå¶ä»éèèª å¯¦ä¿¡ç¨ååçè¡çºãã</p>        <p>Translation:</p>        <p class="quote">âWhere in the course of concluding a contract, a party engaged in any of the following conducts, thereby causing loss to the otherparty, it shall be liable for damages:</p>        <p class="quote">(i) negotiating in bad faith under the pretext of concluding a contract;</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) intentionally concealing a material fact relating to the conclusion of the contract or supplying false information;</p>        <p class="quote">(iii)  any other conduct which violates the principle of good faithâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  In order to succeed in an action founded on deceit under Hong Kong law, the Plaintiffs have to prove: that the Bank made a statement,i.e. a representation of present fact; that the representation was false; that the representation was intended to be acted upon bythe Plaintiffs; that the Plaintiffs did act on the representation and that they suffered damage as a result: see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts (19<sup>th</sup> ed),</i> paragraphs 18-04, 18-28 and 18-32.  I was also referred to <i>Cartwrightâs Misrepresentation, Mistake and Non-Disclosure</i>, paragraphs 3.03-3.05, in which the learned author suggested that the false statement must be made with a particular state of mind:fraud for the tort of deceit or breach of duty of care for the tort of negligence.  The learned author further submitted in paragraph3.41 that for an action founded on breach of duty the better test is whether the statement, in the circumstances in which it wasmade and the position of the parties, was one which the representee was entitled to take seriously and rely on without making hisown inquiries.  I have no quarrel with the above tests.</p>    <p class="heading">The First Representation</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  The First Representation as pleaded in paragraph 5D of the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ in order to induce the Plaintiffs to deliver to the custody of the Defendant the New Securities and to enter into the Agreement,the Defendant by Mr. Geng [GJH] and Mr Li [LYT] orally and wrongfully falsely represented to the Plaintiffs, or alternatively, warranted(âthe Warrantyâ) that it was the intention of the Defendant to agree to the Swap (collectively âthe 1<sup>st</sup> Representationâ) and in particular, to release the Old Securities in exchange for the New Securities.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  Mr Chan SC attacks the Plaintiffsâ case as incredible because there was no reason why LYT would offer to release the securitiesover the PRC Factory and Sheung Shui Property.  He also submits that the Plaintiffsâ case is unsubstantiated because at the timeof the alleged representation, the Bank was not yet aware of what exactly were the properties to be offered as security.  That argumentis premised on LYTâs evidence which I rejected.  In considering the Plaintiffsâ claim for misrepresentation, I consider I ambound by my finding of fact made in relation to the Plaintiffsâ claim in contract.  I have found that at the meeting on 9 July1996 LYT agreed to the exchange of securities on behalf of the Bank.  Apart from that, there was no evidence of the Bankâs intention. Based on such scanty evidence and the nature of the transaction, I can only reach the conclusion that LYT agreed on behalf of theBank to process the application for exchange including the application for new loan.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  Interpretation of a document or a contract is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable personhaving all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they wereat the time of the contract: see <i>Investorâs Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20897" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 897</a> at 912 to 913.  By analogy, the test to be applied in the construction of an oral communications between the parties in the courseof negotiating a contract is the meaning which the communication would convey to a reasonable person in the position of the recipienthaving all the background knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the negotiation.</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  Applying that test to the evidence which I accept, I find that the intention of the Bank as represented by LYT could be no morethan an intention to process the application for exchange and the application for new loan.  There were so many uncertainties inconnection with the application, including among other considerations, the view taken by the credit approval committee of HF Enterprisesâcredit worthiness, its ability to repay, the commercial profitability of the transaction, adequacy and liquidity of the new securitiesoffered and business risk.  Ultimately, whether the exchange would be effected would have to be left to the total discretion of thecredit approval committee.  In just the same way as I could not find a concluded agreement to exchange securities, I am equally unableto find that the representation evinced a committed intention on the part of the Bank to exchange the securities.  While it is possibleto plead an alternative case, the Plaintiffs have insurmountable difficulties with the evidence in support of their alternative case.</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  If the Plaintiffs were able to prove the representation, I would have no difficulties to find that it was false as it was LYTâsevidence that the Bank never intended to exchange the securities at that stage but until the credit approval committee would haveapproved the loan application.  At one stage, LYT went as far as saying that the Bank would only process the application if HF Enterpriseshad repaid the outstanding loan and interest in full.  Thus, it is clear that the Bank did not then have the intention at that stageto effect the exchange.  I would also have no difficulties to find that the Bank intended the Plaintiffs to act on the representationwhich was why LYT asked for and kept the original copies of the five LUCs. </p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  Even assuming that LYT did not have actual authority to make the representation on behalf of the Bank or that while doing so heacted outside the scope of his employment, I would have held that he had ostensible authority to do so.  LYT was the deputy managerof the Offshore Department responsible for the account of HF Enterprises.  He was the banking officer with whom Chan and Wong liaisedin connection with the account of HF Enterprises.  He had authority to sign the facilities letters dated 28 February 1996 and 14March 1996.  The Bank had clothed him with authority to make the representation on its behalf in relation to the matter in hand. In <i>Armagas Ltd and Mundogas SA</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20AC%20717" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 AC 717</a>, Lord Keith held at 781:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe essential feature for creating liability in the employer is that the party contracting with the fraudulent servant should havealtered his position to his detriment in reliance on the belief that the servantâs activities were within his authority, or, toput it another way, were part of his job, this belief having been induced by the masterâs representations by way of words or conduct.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At 782-783, his Lordship continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt the end of the day the question is whether the circumstances under which a servant has made the fraudulent misrepresentationwhich has caused loss to an innocent party contracting with him are such as to make it just for the employer to bear the loss. Suchcircumstances exist where the employer by words or conduct has induced the injured party to believe that the servant was acting inthe lawful course of the employerâs business. They do not exist where such belief, although it is present, has been brought aboutthrough misguided reliance on the servant himself, when the servant is not authorised to do what he is purporting to do, when whathe is purporting to do is not within the class of acts that an employee in his position is usually authorised to do, and when theemployer has done nothing to represent that he is authorised to do it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  The point was also raised that HF Enterprises was the borrower but not the owner of the two lots of land represented by the twoLUCs or the five LUCs.  The distinction relied on by the Bank is more apparent than real.  HF Enterprises and HF Shenzhen were underthe same management, which the Bank was well aware of.  Chan and Wong spoke on behalf of both companies.  Insofar as HF Shenzhenwas treated as the beneficial owner of the two lots of land under the reliance relationship, there must be a special relationshipin this tripartite relationship of lender, borrower and mortgagor, albeit short of a fiduciary relationship.  As for reliance onthe representation, clearly HF Enterprises as borrower relied on the representation because the discussion at the meeting was aboutrelease of the two LUCs to facilitate sale by HF Shenzhen of the blocks of flats in NCG Phase 1 so as to repay the debt of HF Enterprises. On the other hand, though Lung Shing Property was the legal owner and mortgagor of the two lots of land, HF Shenzhen as the partywho was ultimately entitled to have the land transferred to its name under the reliance relationship was clearly concerned as itwas its property which was at risk of enforcement by the Bank if HF Enterprises was unable to pay the debt.  As submitted by Mr TongSC, there was clearly a special relationship in the circumstances of this case between HF Shenzhen and the Bank to give rise to aduty of care on the part of the Bank.  It was reasonably foreseeable that the Bankâs failure to effect the swap would entitle itto enforce the securities and cause loss to HF Shenzhen.  There was a sufficiently proximate relationship between the Bank and HFShenzhen in that HF Shenzhen was to the Bankâs knowledge closely associated with HF Enterprises and was under the same managementand control by Chan.  HF Shenzhen was the party whose interest in the two lots of land represented by the two LUCs charged to theBank would be adversely affected if the swap was not effected and HF Shenzhen would also charge the five LUCs to the Bank in exchange. Applying Lord Keithâs dictum in <i>Armagas Ltd and Mundogas SA</i>, there is no policy reason why it would not be fair, just and equitable to affix the Bank with a duty in the present case. </p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  It was reasonable for the Plaintiffs to deliver the five LUCs to the Bank in reliance on the belief that LYTâs representationwas within the scope his authority.  Applying the test suggested by <i>Cartwrightâs Misrepresentation, Mistake and Non-Disclosure</i>, the essential condition for creating liability is satisfied.  In view of the circumstances in which the representation was madeand the relationship between the parties, the Plaintiffs were entitled to take LYTâs representation seriously and rely on it withoutmaking any inquiries.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  In reliance on the First Representation, the Plaintiffs delivered the five LUCs to the Bank, continued to deal with the Bank forthe ensuing two years, did not demand their return and did not make alternative arrangement to obtain finance by using the propertiesrepresented by the five LUCs.  As a result, the Plaintiffs suffered detriment.  Had the First Representation been proved, I wouldhave awarded damages to the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p class="heading">The Second Representation</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  The Second Representation as pleaded in paragraph 22 of the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn about early March 1998, the Defendant invited the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to apply for an âextensionâ of the Loan of $35 million (even though the Loan had not expired as notice of terminationunder the various facility letters has never been given by the Defendant).  The Defendant represented to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff that:</p>        <p class="quote">(1)  it would exchange or substitute the Old Securities with the New Securities (as previously agreed) under the âextensionâ ofthe Loan;</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  the application for the âextensionâ of the Loan was a mere formality as it was very likely or almost a certainty that theDefendant would approve the âextensionâ of the Loan.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  On the facts, HF Enterprises knew that the application for a new facility of $35 million was part of the exercise of borrowing anew loan to repay the outstanding loan.  HF Enterprises knew that the application was subject to the approval of the credit approvalcommittee.  Indeed, the Plaintiffs pleaded that âthe application for âextensionâ of the loan was a mere formality as it wasvery likely or almost a certainty that the Bank would approve the âextensionâ of the loan.  Thus, on the Plaintiffsâ pleadedcase, the application was subject to approval.  There is no representation that as a matter of certainty the Bank will definitelygrant the application. </p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  It is also the Bankâs case that the application was subject to approval by the credit approval committee and there was no representationthat the application would be approved in any event.  The evidence was that XF, LYT and GJH all recommended approving the loan. It was only due to a last minute twist that the Bank decided to act on the contrary view of its Lunggong branch and rejected theapplication. There was no evidence to show that the representation was untrue.  Further, as said before, at all material times HFEnterprises knew that the Bank required them to regularise their account and this was a precondition which HF Enterprises must satisfybefore submitting their request for exchange of securities to the credit approval committee for consideration.  Thus, there is noevidence that the Second Representation was false.  The Plaintiffs have not pleaded why they said that the Second Representationwas false.  Mr Tong SC made no submission in respect of the claim under the Second Representation.  I think the Plaintiffsâ pleadedcase under the Second Representation is defective and fatal. </p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  The Plaintiffsâ claim for misrepresentation must be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading"><a name="_TOC261273160" id="_TOC261273160">BREACH OF WARRANTY</a></p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  The Plaintiffsâ claim for breach of warranty is based on a collateral contract preceding the oral agreement.  Mr Tong SC submitsthat the collateral contract still subsists despite the oral agreement failed to materialise.  With respect, I am unable to agree. On the facts of this case, in the absence of a concluded oral Swap Agreement or misrepresentation, I am quite unable to see howand when a collateral contract preceding the Swap Agreement could have been formed.  In the circumstances, the claim under this headmust fall together with the claim for breach of the Swap Agreement and misrepresentation.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  If there were a collateral agreement, the question of the governing law of that agreement would arise.  For reasons as will be explainedin the section under the alternative scenario, the governing law of the collateral agreement would be PRC law.  The collateral agreementwould also be null and void under PRC law.</p>    <p class="heading">THE CONVERSION CLAIM</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  There is no dispute that relying on the First Representation, the Plaintiffs submitted the five LUCs to the Bank on 16 July 1996and thereafter dealt with the Bank for twenty-six months without demanding or taking legal action to enforce their return in thefalse expectation that the swap would materialise.  The certificates were then conveyed by courier to Shenzhen and kept in the safeof the Shenzhen branch of the Bank.  When the Bank finally rejected HF Enterprises application for an extension of the loan of $35million, HF Enterprises demanded return of the five LUCs on 17 September 1998.  The Bank returned the five LUCs to HF Enterpriseson 24 September 1998 in Shenzhen.  The Plaintiffsâ pleaded case on conversion is that the Bank ought not to have kept the fiveLUCs or ought to have returned them to the Plaintiffs promptly upon receiving them. </p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  The Bankâs defence is that the Plaintiffs had never demanded the return of the five LUCs during the twenty-six months when thecertificates were in the Bankâs possession, that they were promptly returned to the Plaintiffs upon demand and that there was noconversion of the certificates under PRC law.  In addition, it was suggested that the wrongful act was committed in the PRC and thePlaintiffs have to justify bringing the action in Hong Kong by proving that the requirement of double-actionability is satisfied.</p>    <p class="heading">Conversion under Hong Kong law</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a>  Mr Chan SC submits that to constitute the tort of conversion under Hong Kong law, there must be a refusal to surrender the propertybelonging to the plaintiff on demand.  He quoted the following passages from <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> <i>(19th Edition)</i>, paragraphs 17-22:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe ordinary way of showing a conversion by unlawful retention of property is to prove that the defendant, having it in possession,refused to surrender it on demand. Indeed, such a demand is generally a precondition of the right of action for detention: the mereunpermitted possession of anotherâs chattel is not as such a conversion of it.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>        <p class="quote">  It should be noted, however, that the defendantâs obligation is normally only to allow the claimant to collect the goods, notto deliver them to him.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  Mr Tong SC argues that demand and refusal is not the only way to establish conversion by wrongful retention.  All that is requiredis some positive, overt act of withholding possession.  He quoted the case of <i>Barclays Mercantile Business Finance Ltd And Another v Sibec Developments Ltd And Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20WLR%201253" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 WLR 1253</a> at 1257-1258.  Indeed, the learned authors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> only submitted that demand and refusal is the ordinary but not the only way of proving conversion. In <i>Barclays Mercantile Business Finance Ltd,</i> Millett J, as he then was, quoted the earlier edition of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> and said at 1257:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 16<sup>th</sup> ed. (1989), at p.1234 conversion by keeping is described as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âMere unpermitted keeping of anotherâs chattel is not a conversion of it.  There must be some detention consciously adverse tothe rights of the owner, such as an assertion of a lien that does not exist.  The ordinary way of showing a conversion by unlawfulretention of property is to prove that the defendant, having it in his possession, refused to give it up on demand made by the partyentitled.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr. Mann, who appeared for the applicants, seized on the word âordinaryâ to submit that the making of a demand is not a preconditionof the cause of action for damages in conversion. That is so, but in my judgment the use of the word was not intended to contradictthe opening sentence: âmere unpermitted keeping of anotherâs chattel is not a conversion of it.â Demand is not an essentialprecondition of the tort: what is required is an overt act of withholding possession of the chattel from the true owner. Such anact may consist of a refusal to deliver up the chattel on demand, but it may be demonstrated by other conduct, for example, by assertinga lien. Some positive act of withholding, however, is required; so that absent any positive conduct on the part of the defendant,the plaintiff can establish a cause of action in conversion only by making a demand. In my judgment so much is clear from <i>Clayton v. Le Roy</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%202%20KB%201031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] 2 K.B. 1031</a>, where the need for a demand in a simple retention case is clearly stated. The reason for this is clearly stated by Fletcher MoultonL.J., at p. 1048:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe question as to the exact moment at which a cause of action arises may seem a very technical one, but in my opinion it is apoint of substance in this case, and for the following reason. In an action of detinue, as in other actions of tort, the Statuteof Limitations runs from the time when the cause of action arose; consequently, if nothing has happened to give rise to an actionof detinue, there is no period of time which can operate to extinguish the title of the real owner. He may have been deprived ofcontrol over his chattel for 100 years, but it still remains his property, and an action will lie to recover it, unless there havebeen a demand and a refusal which would be sufficient to give rise to a cause of action. If there is a demand by the owner from theperson in possession of the chattel and a refusal on the part of the latter to give it up, then in his six years the remedy of theowner is barred; it is therefore very important for the owner that the law should lay down the principle some clear act of that kindis required to constitute a cause of action in detinue.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">And, at p. 1050:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âthe plaintiff must establish that at the moment of issue [of the writ] he was in a position to bring an action of detinue; in otherwords, that there had been a wrongful denial by the defendant of the plaintiffâs title to the watch.  At first the case was treatedas though the question was as to the effect of a demand by the plaintiff of his watch and a refusal by the defendant to hand it over;but this point was practically abandoned, for there had been neither demand nor refusal.  Then the question was treated, but rathervaguely, as one of conversion, and the defendantâs letter of 16 May was said to be evidence of conversion.  But the mere fact thatthere was evidence pro and con on such a point would not be enough; it is necessary to find as a fact that there was a demand andrefusal before the issue of the writ.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">  In my judgment, those purposes show clearly that an overt act of withholding goods from the true owner is a condition precedentto the tort of conversion and that absent any overt act on the part of the party in possession the true owner must establish bothdemand and refusal before he can establish a cause of action.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  Thus, the law is clear.  An overt act is needed to establish a cause of action in conversion.  A demand and refusal is generallyrelied on as such an act.  Possession without more is not an overt act.  In <i>Barclays Mercantile Business Finance Ltd</i>, Millett J held that the plaintiffs failed to establish conversion against the administrators who did nothing save retaining thegoods and declining to give their consent for the applicants to retake possession.  The Bank was in a similar position as the administrator. It was given possession of the five LUCs.  It kept them in safe custody.  Other than that, it did nothing which is inconsistentwith the rights of the owner.  Upon demand, it promptly facilitated their collection by HF Shenzhen.  The Plaintiffs could not havea cause of action against the Bank.    </p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  Mr Tong SC tried to get around the difficulty by arguing that the Bank had an obligation under an implied term of the Swap Agreementto return the five LUCs if the swap was not effected within a reasonable time.  I have rejected that argument on implied term.  Sucha term could not be implied into the Swap Agreement under the <i>Moorcock</i> principle.  Nothing could be simpler than for the Plaintiffs to ask for the return of the five LUCs after the lapse of such timeas they considered reasonable or appropriate.  Besides, the obligation of the Bank as bailor of the goods whose right to retentionof the goods has been terminated is to allow the rightful owner to come and take back the goods.  There was no obligation on theBank to take the initiative to return the five LUCs.</p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  Lastly, Mr Tong SC argues that the only reason why the Plaintiffs had not demanded the return of the five LUCs at an earlier stagewas because of the Bankâs representation that it was willing to effect the swap and was processing the swap and the Plaintiffswere concerned not to demand the return which might provoke retaliation.  Hence, Mr Tong SC submits that it is not open to the Bankto rely on its own wrong to argue that there was no conversion.  I can well understand the grievance felt by the Plaintiffs becauseof the conduct of the Bank.  However, that is no answer to the need to have an overt act in order to establish a cause of action. I have to conclude that there was no conversion under Hong Kong law.</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  In view of the above conclusion, whether the alleged wrongful act was committed in Hong Kong or the PRC is irrelevant. There wasno conversion under Hong Kong law.  If the wrongful act was committed in the PRC, the requirement of double-actionability could notbe satisfied.  I do not find it necessary to venture into the realm of PRC law.  The Plaintiffsâ claim under this head must bedismissed. <a name="_Toc261273169" id="_Toc261273169"></a></p>    <p class="heading">THE BANKâS COUNTERCLAIM</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  The Bank counterclaims against the Plaintiffs in respect of their obligations under the Consolidated Facility, Facility 3 and Facility4 and financial documents related thereto.  There is no dispute that HF Enterprises borrowed money from the Bank under the aforesaidfacilities and failed to repay. The Bank obtained judgment in Shen 654/1998 against HF Enterprises and HF Shenzhen in respect ofthe outstanding loans under Facility 4.

Mr Tong SC argues that this judgment is only enforceable in the Hong Kong courts to the extent of the outstandingprincipal, interest and default interest but not double interest awarded by way of penalty by the PRC courts.  </p>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  The relevant rule of international law is that the courts of one country are prohibited from enforcing the penal laws of a foreignstate or enforcing penalties recoverable in favour of the foreign state.  The rule is summarised in paragraph 14-020 of <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins on</i> <i>The Conflict of Laws</i> (14<sup>th</sup> ed) as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFor a claim to be brought to enforce a foreign judgment, the judgment must be for a definite sum of money, which expression includesa final order for costs, e.g. in a divorce suit. It must order X, the defendant in the English action, to pay to A, the claimant,a definite and actually ascertained sum of money; but if a mere arithmetical calculation is required for the ascertainment of thesum it will be treated as being ascertained; if, however, the judgment orders him to do anything else, e.g. specifically performa contract, it will not support an action, though it may be <i>res</i> <i>judicata</i>. The judgment must further be for a sum other than a sum payable in respect of taxes or the like, or in respect of a fine or otherpenalty. It is well settled that <u>an English court will not entertain an action for the enforcement, either directly or indirectly, of a penal or revenue law of a foreigncountry.</u> Since âthe essential nature and real foundation of a cause of action are not changed by recovering judgment upon it,â it followsthat the court cannot entertain an action for the enforcement, either directly or indirectly, of a foreign judgment ordering thepayment of taxes, fines or other contributions or penalties. <u>A penalty in this sense normally means a sum payable to the State, and not to a private claimant, so that an award of punitive orexemplary damages is not penal.</u> But it is possible that an award of multiple damages, e.g. in an anti-trust action, might nevertheless be regarded as penal at commonlaw. If the purpose of the damages as awarded by the foreign court is to punish the defendant, enforcement of the judgment may befound to be against English public policy, with which the rule against enforcing foreign penal laws will overlap. If the foreignjudgment imposes a fine on the defendant and also orders him to pay compensation to the injured party (called the â<i>partie civile</i>â in French proceedings), the latter part of the judgment can be severed from the former and enforced in England.â</p>        <p class="quote">  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  Mr Tong SC then referred to <i>Schnabel v Lui</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] NSWSC 15</a> (lexis copy), in which the Supreme Court of New South Wales refused to enforce an award for punitive damages ordered by the UnitedStates court.  By analogy, Mr Tong SC submits that the award of double interest by the PRC court in Shen 654/1998 as quoted aboveis a penalty which this Court shall not enforce.  </p>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  The issue is therefore whether the award of double interest by the PRC court is a penalty.  The Supreme Court of New South Walesconsidered this issue in <i>Schnabel v Lui</i>.  It referred to <i>Huntington v Attrill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%20AC%20150" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] AC 150</a> which was quoted by <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> in support of their proposition above.  In that case, Lord Watsons explained that the very essence of this rule of internationallaw is that criminal wrongs are only punishable in the country where they were committed.  His Lordship said at 156:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe rule has its foundation in the well recognised principle that crimes, including in that term all breaches of public law punishableby pecuniary mulct or otherwise, at the instance of the State Government, or of some one representing the public, are local in thissense, that they are only, cognizable and punishable in the country where they were committed. Accordingly no proceeding, even inthe shape of a civil suit, which has for its object the enforcement by the State, whether directly or indirectly, of punishment imposedfor such breaches by the <i>lex fori</i>, ought to be admitted in the Courts of any other country...</p>        <p class="quote">In its ordinary acceptation, the word âpenalâ may embrace penalties for infractions of general law which do not constitute offencesagainst the State; it may for many legal purposes be applied with perfect propriety to penalties created by contract; and it therefore,when taken by itself, fails to mark that distinction between civil rights and criminal wrongs which is the very essence of the internalruleâ¦ But the expressions âpenalâ and âpenaltyâ, when employed without any qualification, express or implied, are calculatedto mislead, because they are capable of being construed so as to extend the rule to all proceedings for the recovery of penalties,whether exigible by the State in the interest of the community, or by private persons in their own interest.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  Lord Watsons then quoted with approval the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <i>Wisconsin v The Pelican Insurance Co</i> 127 US (20 Davis) 265 that the rule applied not only to prosecutions and sentences for crimes and misdemeanours but also to all suitsin favour of the state for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for any violation of statutes for the protection of its revenue orother municipal laws and to all judgments for such penalties.  His Lordship said at 157-158: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTheir Lordships do not hesitate to accept that exposition of the law, which, in their opinion, discloses the proper test for ascertainingwhether an action is penal within the meaning of the rule. A proceeding, in order to come within the scope of the rule, must be inthe nature of a suit in favour of the State whose law has been infringed. All the provisions of Municipal Statutes for the regulationof trade and trading companies are presumably enacted in the interest and for the benefit of the community at large; and personswho violate these provisions are, in a certain sense, offenders against the State law, as well as against individuals who may beinjured by the misconduct. But foreign tribunals do not regard these violations of statute law as offences against the State, unlesstheir vindication rests with the State itself, for the community which it represents. Penalties may be attached to them, but thatcircumstance will not bring them within the rule, except in cases where these penalties are recoverable in the instance of the State,or of an official duly authorised to prosecute on its behalf, or other member of public in the character of common informer.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Simply put, the test of the enforceability is whether the penalties attached to violation of statute law are recoverable at the instanceof the state.</p>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  The Supreme Court of New South Wales also referred to the English Court of Appeal decision a hundred years later in <i>United States of America v Inikley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%201%20QB%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 1 QB 225</a>, in which Purchas LJ set out the approach in determining whether a penalty falls within the meaning of the rule.  His Lordship saidat 265:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFrom these authorities the following propositions seem to emerge which are relevant to the present appeal: (1) the considerationof whether the claim sought to be enforced in the English Courts is one which involves the assertion of foreign sovereignty, whetherit be penal, revenue or other public law, is to be determined according to the criteria of English law; (2) that regard will be hadto the attitude adopted by the Courts in the foreign jurisdiction which will always receive serious attention and may on occasionsbe decisive; (3) that the category of the right of action, ie whether public or private will depend on the party in whose favourit is created, on the purpose of the law or enactment in the foreign state on which it is based and on the general context of thecase as a whole; (4) that the fact that the right, statutory or otherwise, is penal in nature will not deprive a person who assertsa personal claim depending thereon, from having recourse to the courts of this country; on the other hand, by whatever descriptionit may be known if the purpose of the action is the enforcement of a sanction, power or right at the instance of the state in itssovereign capacity, it will not be entertained; (5) that the fact that in the foreign jurisdiction recourse may be had in a civilforum to enforce the right will not necessary affect the true nature of the right being enforced in this country.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Thus, the approach is to look at the true nature of the right being enforced in the local jurisdiction.  The nature of that rightis to be determined according to the law of the local jurisdiction having regard to the attitude adopted by the courts in the foreignjurisdiction which ordered the penalty.  The fact that the right may be enforced in the foreign jurisdiction in civil proceedingsis not conclusive of its true nature.</p>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  In <i>Schnabel v Lui</i>, the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that the word âpenaltyâ was wide enough to cover civil liability for punitive damages. However, the punitive damages in that case were in fact punishment for the defendant for failing to comply with an order of courtof the Unites States and to deter others from doing the same.  It was for that reason that the Supreme Court of New South Wales tookthe view that the damages fall within the categories of punishment under either a penal law or other public law of the foreign jurisdictionand was unenforceable.</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a>  In the present case, the double interest ordered by the PRC court was pursuant to Civil Litigation Law(æ°è¨´æ³).  I have not beenreferred by either parties to that statute, which I presume to be article 232 of the Civil Litigation Law of the Peopleâs Republicof China(ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ°äºè¨´è¨æ³ã).  It provides as follows: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="qoute"><a name="229">ã</a>ç¬¬äºç¾äºä¸äºæ¢ãè¢«å·è¡äººæªæå¤å³ãè£å®åå¶ä»æ³å¾ ææ¸æå®çæéå±¥è¡çµ¦ä»éé¢ç¾©åçï¼æç¶å åæ¯ä»é²å»¶å±¥è¡æéçåµåå©æ¯ãè¢«å·è¡äººæªæå¤å³ãè£å®åå¶ä»æ³å¾ææ¸æå®çæéå±¥è¡å¶ä»ç¾©åçï¼æç¶æ¯ä»é²å»¶å±¥è¡éãã</p>        <p class="qoute">Translation:</p>        <p class="quote">âArticle 232. If the person subject to execution fails to fulfill his obligations in respect to payment of money within the timelimit specified by a judgment or order or any other legal document, he shall pay a multiplied interest on the debt for the periodof deferred fulfillment. If the person subject to execution fails to fulfill his other obligations within the time limit specifiedby a judgment or order or any other legal document, he shall pay a surcharge for the deferred fulfillmentâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  That statute apparently governs all civil proceedings in the PRC.  Under that provision, double interest may be awarded by the PRCcourt to a party in a civil proceeding for failing to pay damages for breach of contract ordered by the court.  Presumably, the doubleinterest is a sanction imposed to ensure the courtâs orders are promptly complied with.  The purpose behind that is to ensure justiceto be dispensed promptly and effectively.  The award is to be paid to a party whose civil right has been infringed and whose rightto judgment delayed.  Subject to the courtâs discretion in determining the time within which its order is to be complied with andthe amount of the additional interest to be paid, the right and sanction are to be applied to all litigants and not discriminatelyat any particular individual.  It is a punishment for violation of the courtâs order made under a statute and is recoverable atthe instance of the party but not the state.  Even assuming that the statute was enacted for the regulation of civil litigation inthe interest and for the benefit of the community at large and that persons who violate those provisions are, in a certain sense,offenders against the state law, the victim of such violation is the successful party in a civil litigation who is injured by beingdenied of the judgment which he is entitled.  On the face, the statute and the award contains no element of punishment under eithera penal law or other public law.  It is not enforceable at the instance of the state.  </p>    <p><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a>  Mr Tong SC argues that the Bank sought to enforce the PRC judgment and bears the burden of proving that the award is not a penaltybut has not discharged that burden.  I accept that the legal burden rests on the party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment to provea valid judgment.  However, the evidential burden, at least, of proving that a valid foreign judgment is not enforceable as a penaltyrests on the party against whom the judgment is sought to be enforced.  On the face, the award is not a penalty.  I have not heardargument or expert evidence on PRC law to the contrary.  There is no evidence of the nature of the double interest awarded and theattitude of the PRC court towards such award.  Though in my view on the facts of this case the rate of double interest of 38% perannum is on the very high side, it is, nevertheless, far short of the 60% limit imposed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 24</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Money Lenders Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>, above which a money lending transaction would be rendered illegal.  From what I could assess using criteria under HongKong law, I am unable to find the award was penal in nature.  I am not satisfied that the evidential burden is discharged by thePlaintiffs by merely relying on the PRC judgment without showing how under the relevant statute the double interest is a penalty. Thus, as a matter of law, the PRC judgment is wholly enforceable against the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  However, the double interest is so high that this Court feels inappropriate to enforce once it has assumed jurisdiction over thematter upon the Bank filing a counterclaim.  The counterclaim was filed on 1 March 1999 before the judgment of the PRC courts.  Inparagraph 67A, the Bank prayed for interest according to the contractual rate or under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 48</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">49</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a>.  The Bank pleaded similarly in respect of repayment of the loan under the Consolidated Facility.  In the circumstances, I thinkjustice would be best served by awarding the Bank interest at contractual rate, including default rate if applicable, or judgmentrate, whichever the less.  For the above reasons, the double interest awarded by the PRC court will not be enforced by this Court. The judgment of the PRC court Shen 654/1998 shall be enforced to the extent stated above.</p>    <p class="heading">The indebtedness under the Consolidated Facility</p>    <p><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  The relevant facility letter was dated 28 February 1996.  It was signed by Chan on behalf of HF Enterprises and constituted a contract. The amount of outstanding principal advanced under the Consolidated Facility was $21,190,543.97. </p>    <p><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  Pursuant to clause 6(4) of the facility letter, HF Enterprises procured Lung Shing Property to executed a charge over the two lotsof land in Longgang as security for the indebtedness of HF Enterprises in favour of the Bank on 13 March 1996. </p>    <p><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  On 18 April 2000, the Bank obtained judgment from the Shenzhen Intermediate Peopleâs Court in Shen 655/1998 against both HF Enterprisesand Lung Shing Property in respect of the indebtednesses under the facility.  HF Enterprises defaulted at the hearing.

There was no appealagainst the judgment in Shen 655/1998 which is therefore final and conclusive.  The Bank seeks to enforce that judgment.  The Plaintiffscriticized the Bank for charging compound interest and for seeking to enforce a penalty under a foreign judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  The Bank relied on clauses 2.3 and 2.4 of the facility letter which provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ã2.3 è²´å¸ææ¼æè¡æå®çæ¥ææ¯ä»æä»å©æ¯ãå¦ææªè½ææä»æ¯ï¼<u>åè©²æä»å©æ¯è¦çºæä»æªä»å©æ¯</u>ã</p>        <p class="quote">2.4 æè¡ææ¬å°é¾ææå°ææä»æªä»çæ¬¾é æ¶åéç´å©æ¯ãâ¦â¦ éç´å©æ¯æ<u>é¾ææ¬¾é </u>åå¯¦éé¾æå¤©æ¸ææ¥æ¯0.05%è¨æ¶ï¼ç±éç´ç¼çèµ·è³è©²æ¬¾é å¨é¨æ¸éæ­¢ãã (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr Chan SC argues that under clause 2.3, if the HF Enterprises failed to pay interest due, the interest due shall be deemed to beinterest due and unpaid.  Hence, he submits that such interest due and unpaid constituted monies due and unpaid within the meaningof clause 2.4 and attracted interest at default interest rate. </p>    <p><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  Mr Tong SC argues that clauses 2.3 and 2.4 draw a distinction between âinterest due and unpaidâ and âmonies due and unpaidâand that only the latter attracted default interest, but not the former.  If the former was subject to default interest, it wouldbe of the nature of compound interest.  He referred to clause 2.3 of the facility letter under Facility 3, in which it was providedthat HF Enterprises shall pay interest after the end of the interest period on a date specified by the Bank and that such interestdue but unpaid shall be capitalised and subject to interest.  Clause 2.4 of that facility letter is similar to clause 2.4 of thefacility letter under the Consolidated Facility which imposed default interest on monies due and unpaid.  Hence, Mr Tong SC submitsthat if the intention of the Bank was to charge interest on interest due and unpaid, it would have used the clearer formula in thefacility letter in Facility 3.</p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  Construction of a document is to ascertain the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the backgroundknowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract:see <i>Investorâs Compensation Scheme Limited</i>.  In October 1995, the Bank charged interest on interest due and unpaid under Facility 3.  Then four months later, the Bank grantedthe Consolidated Facility which was a combined facility of Facility 1 and Facility 2.  If the Bank intended not to charge intereston interest due and unpaid, nothing could be easier than deleting the last sentence of clause 2.3 without the trouble of deemingsuch interest as interest due and unpaid.  If that were the intention of the Bank, the entire sentence would be redundant. On theother hand, âmonies dueâ include loan capital due to be repaid as well as interest arising therefrom.  Thus, in my view, thewords âmonies due and unpaidâ are wide enough to cover âinterest due and unpaidâ.  That explains why there was no need touse the word âcapitaliseâ in clause 2.4 of the letter under the Consolidated Facility.  I agree with the construction submittedby Mr Chan SC.</p>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  For reasons as explained earlier, the Plaintiffs have failed to discharge the burden of proving that the double interest awardedby the PRC court was a penalty. However, for the reasons set out in paragraph 207, the judgment of the PRC court in Shen 655/1998shall be enforced to the extent of the outstanding principal with interest at contractual rate, including default rate if applicable,or judgment rate whichever the lower.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion,</p>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  For reasons as explained above, the Bank is entitled to judgment against the Plaintiffs on the counterclaim.  It is entitled tobe awarded: (1) the capital sum of $2,000,000 in respect of Facility 3; (2) the capital sum of $933,116.61 in respect of Facility4; and (3) the capital sum of $21,190,543.97 and the case acceptance fee of $122,193, totalling $21,312,736.97 in respect of theConsolidated Facility.  The Bank is entitled to enforce the judgments awarded by the PRC courts in Shen 654/1998 and Shen 655/1998on the capital sums and interest due under Facility 4 and the Consolidated Facility respectively to the extent as stated in paragraphs207 and 214.  The Bank is entitle to possession of the Sheung Shui Property which it may realise in satisfaction of the outstandingloan under Facility 3.  The Plaintiffs dispute the interest rates applied by the Bank.  Accordingly, for expediency, I shall enterjudgment on the counterclaim on the capital sums only with interest to be assessed.  I shall give directions to the parties to agree,without prejudice to their right to appeal against my finding on liability, on the amount of interest payable after verifying theproper interest rates.</p>    <p><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  The Bank is entitled to interest on the capital sums and interest calculated in accordance with the following principles:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)        the interest shall be calculated at the contractual rate from the date on which interest started to accrued under the respectivefacilities until the date of default;</p>        <p>(2)        thereafter at contractual default rate until 1 March 1999, the date of filing of the Defence and Counterclaim;</p>        <p>(3)        thereafter, at judgment rate or default rate, whichever the lower until full payment; and</p>        <p>(4)        the Bank is entitled to interest upon capitalised interest which were due and unpaid.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  On procedures, I give the following directions. The parties shall agree on the computation of interest within four weeks from thedate of this judgment, failing which the parties shall file their respective computations within one week thereafter for my determination. Where appropriate, the parties shall support their computations with affidavits, if they entertain any disputes on the factual basisof their computation such as prime rate.</p>    <p class="heading">CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  In conclusion, the Plaintiffsâ claim is dismissed. </p>    <p><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  On the Defendantâs counterclaim:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)        the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs are jointly and severally liable to the Defendant in the amount of $933,116.61 in respect of unpaid loan capital advancedunder Facility 4 with interest to be assessed;</p>        <p>(2)        the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff is liable to the Defendant in the amount of $2,000,000 in respect of unpaid loan capital advanced under Facility 3 withinterest to be assessed; and</p>        <p>(3)        the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff shall within 30 days of this judgment deliver vacant possession of the property known as Section A of Lot No.725 in DemarcationDistrict No.94, Lin Tong Mei, Sheung Shui, New Territories, Hong Kong which the Defendant may dispose of in accordance with the termsof the mortgage deed in order to repay the outstanding loan under Facility 3 to the Bank.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a>  Having succeeded in both the defence and the counterclaim, the Defendant is entitled to costs from the Plaintiffs.  However, theDefendant was much to blame for its conduct in handling the Plaintiffsâ application to swap the securities, which led to the litigation. Though its conduct is short of making a concluded agreement, it induced the Plaintiffs into the belief that the parties had reacheda concluded agreement.  It advanced factual evidence which was almost totally rejected by the Court.  It raised unnecessary factualdisputes such as the judgment in Yue 311/2003, which unduly and unnecessarily wasted a lot of time and costs.  Its accounting expertwas unnecessary.  Its expert witnesses in quantum were typical hired guns.  The same could be said of the Plaintiffsâ legal expert. But the blame is mainly on the Defendantâs.  Much time was wasted by the Defendant in engaging in such meaningless or unmeritoriousfactual disputes.  It could have equally well succeeded had LYT told the truth and had its expert witnesses not attempted to misleadthe Court.  To show the disapproval of the Defendantâs conduct, it is appropriate to deprive it of its costs in defending the action.On the counterclaim, the Plaintiffs have no valid defence, it is appropriate for costs to follow the event.  Accordingly, I makea costs order <i>nisi</i> that there shall be no order as to costs on the Plaintiffsâ claim and that the Plaintiffs shall pay the Defendantâs costs ofthe counterclaim.</p>    <p class="heading"><a name="_TOC261273175" id="_TOC261273175">THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO</a></p>    <p><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a>  I now consider the alternative scenario, assuming that there were a concluded Swap Agreement.  I shall deal with this very briefly. Whether that agreement was based on the discussion reached at the meeting on 9 July 1996 or the telephone conversation on 8 October1996 does not matter.  The question which immediately arises is what is the proper law of the Swap Agreement.</p>    <p class="heading">The proper law of the Swap Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  The proper or governing law of an agreement is to be determined by the court before which the agreement is being litigated, i.e.the Hong Kong High Court applying the law applicable in Hong Kong as a matter of <i>lex fori</i>.  The tests to be applied in determining the proper law of contract are summarised in sub-rules 1, 2 and 3 of Rule 180 in <i>Dicey &amp; Morris: The Conflict of Laws 11<sup>th</sup> edition</i>.  Basically, the test is to ascertain the intention of the parties.  Firstly, when the intention of the parties to a contract asto the law governing the contract is expressed in words, this expressed intention, in general, determines the proper law of contract.Secondly, in the absence of an expressed intention, the partiesâ intention as to the proper law is to be inferred from the termsand nature of the contract, and from the general circumstances of the case.  Thirdly, when the intention was neither expressed norcould be inferred from the circumstances, the contract is to be governed by the system of law which the transaction has its closestand most real connection.  There was no express choice of law under the Swap Agreement.  In the circumstances of the present case,the inferred intention as to the proper law is best ascertained by finding out objectively that system of law which the transactionhas its closest and most real connection.  Thus, the second and third tests are the same.</p>    <p><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  Mr Tong SC argues for Hong Kong law as the proper law by emphasising on the following factors.  While HF Shenzhen is a PRC companyincorporated in the PRC, it is nevertheless a subsidiary of HF Enterprises which is a company incorporated in Hong Kong under the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.  Though the Bank is a PRC corporation, it was registered under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part XI</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> with a place of business in Hong Kong.  It conducted business with HF Holdings through its Offshore Department in Hong Kong.  Chanwho discussed the swap on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Wong who handled the follow up work were resident in Hong Kong, while LYT,the Bankâs key personnel responsible for the discussion concerning the swap, was based in Hong Kong.  Mr Tong SC also argues thatthe underlying transaction in which the Swap Agreement arose provided the context in which the proper law of the agreement shouldbe considered.  He also argues the fact that Hong Kong was the place of performance of the Swap Agreement, i.e. the place where thefive LUCs were delivered, and that the loan was denominated in Hong Kong dollars point to a Hong Kong direction.</p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a>  The Swap Agreement was to exchange the securities represented by the two LUCs for those represented by the five LUCs.  The startingpoint of the inquiry must therefore be the nature of the securities to be exchanged; the facility letters, the deeds of guarantee,the mortgage documents, the proper law governing those agreements and the location of the parties thereto.  I have found that theexchange did not extend to the securities over the PRC Factory and Sheung Shui Property.  I shall not take any of the factors relatingto those securities into consideration.  Even if I were to, those factors would cancel each other and the conclusion would be thesame.</p>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a>  Clause 13 of the facility letter dated 28 February 1996 regarding the Consolidated Facility which was secured against the two lotsof land stated that the governing law of the facility letter was PRC law. The two lots of land are real properties in the PRC.  Clause6(4) of the facility letter stated that the mortgage must be registered with the Shenzhen Land Bureau.  The legal owner and mortgagorof the property was Lung Shing Property, which is a PRC corporation.  Clause 5 of the mortgage guarantee(æµæ¼æä¿æ¸)dated 13March 1996 executed by Lung Shing Property stated that the mortgage guarantee was governed by PRC law.  All these points heavilyto the inference that the parties and Lung Shing Property must have intended that their legal relationship in the transaction shallbe governed by PRC law where the properties and their legal owner are situated.</p>    <p><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a>  The five lots of land represented by the five LUCs, were all landed properties in the PRC owned by HF Shenzhen, a PRC corporation,though a subsidiary of HF Holdings, a Hong Kong company.  The location of the direct and immediate owner of those properties mustcarry more weight than the location of its holding company.   </p>    <p><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a>  Though the swap of securities could be performed in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, the underlying obligations of the Swap Agreement wouldinvolve the discharge of the old securities and the creation of new securities in their place.  If the Swap Agreement were to becarried out, the five lots of land would have to be mortgaged in accordance with the laws of the PRC and the mortgage registeredwith the Shenzhen Land Bureau.  Hence, the creation of the new security must be governed by PRC law.  It is difficult to see howa charge or mortgage of land in the PRC could ever be governed by Hong Kong law. Against such background, it is impossible to drawthe inference that the parties intended Hong Kong law to be the governing law from the relatively neutral fact that the five LUCswere delivered to the Offshore Department of the Bank in Hong Kong and the loan was denominated in Hong Kong dollars, to be advancedto the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in Hong Kong and to be repaid in Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong.  The fact that Chan and Wong had to make a special tripto Shenzhen to negotiate and conclude the Swap Agreement also points to PRC as the proper law.  Even if the Swap Agreement were concludedduring the telephone conversation in October 1996 in Hong Kong, that does not diminish the significance of the meeting in Shenzhenwhere the negotiation first took place.</p>    <p><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  All the objective factors point to PRC law is the system of law which the Swap Agreement has its closest and most real connectionand raise the inference that the parties intended that the proper law of the Swap Agreement shall be PRC law.</p>    <p class="heading">The partiesâ experts on PRC law</p>    <p><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  Having found that the proper law of the Swap Agreement is PRC law, it becomes necessary to consider its validity under PRC law. The Plaintiffs called Zhang of the University of Hong Kong as their legal expert on PRC law.  Zhang has an extremely impressivecurriculum vitae.  He graduated with a bachelor of laws degree from Beijing Fa Zheng University (åäº¬æ³æ¿å¤§å­¸)in 1983.  Hestudied in Indiana University where he obtained his master of laws degree and doctor of jurisprudence degree in 1989 and 1992 respectively. He taught in Hong Kong City Polytechnic University in 1995 and then University of Hong Kong in 1997.  At present, he is a professorand vice dean of the School of Law of Hong Kong University.  He had sixteen yearâ experience teaching and researching PRC lawssince 1983.  But he has never practised law in the PRC.  He had given expert evidence on PRC law before the Hong Kong courts on fouroccasions previously and had given written expert evidence on another four to five occasions without having to attend court.  Hisevidence had been accepted by the courts.</p>    <p><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  Mr Chan SC severely criticised Zhang for his lack of professional qualification to practice law in the PRC and lack of experiencein handling mortgages and registration of land charges in the PRC.  More importantly, he criticised Zhang as a hire-gun and as beingevasive.  These are very serious allegations made against an expert, particularly one who is called to assist the court as a legalexpert.  Zhang is a scholarly academic.  It is understandable that he might became unduly sensitive and defensive when asked abouthis qualification to practise law in the PRC.  I do not consider him evasive.  However, it is well known and common knowledge whichI may take judicial notice of, that the laws in the PRC have undergone unprecedented reforms and expansion since its recovery fromthe cultural revolution in late 1970 and early 1980 and thereafter to cope with its fast economic development to become the worldâssecond biggest economy after the United States.  Thus, Zhangâs lack of professional practice and his being away from the PRC since1983 weigh against the reliability of his opinion. </p>    <p><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  Mr Chan SCâs criticism of Zhang as being a hire-gun is based upon Zhangâs volunteering opinion that the proper law of the SwapAgreement was Hong Kong law which had never been invited from him and for his expert opinion which Mr Chan SC argues were not frankand unsupported by authorities. </p>    <p><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a>  On the uninvited opinion on proper law, Zhangâs explanation was that he did so because the issue had been dealt with by his predecessorand by the Bankâs expert.  That, unfortunately, was not supported by the written opinions of those experts.  His explanation maywell be a convenient one made without much thought at the spur of the moment.  In view of his professorial status, Zhang might wellbe trying to be comprehensive in his opinion as was illustrated by the continuing research he undertook during the course of thetrial.  By itself, volunteering an uninvited opinion which turned out to be wrong is not sufficient to justify such a serious label. Anyway, Zhangâs opinion on that issue was not relied upon by Mr Tong SC at all.  In view of the conclusion which I reached, Zhangwas also wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a>  Mr Chan SC quoted various instances in support of his allegation that Zhang was deliberately being partial not full and frank withcourt.  I shall deal with those allegations when I deal with the relevant aspects of PRC laws.  The somewhat biased and unconvincingway with which Zhang presented his expert opinion on PRC law made me feel he was more of an advocate than an expert witness.  ButI do not find it necessary to make a finding if he was a hire gun.  Suffice it is to say, after due and proper consideration of theliterature produced by Zhang and HH as well as the submission of counsel, I reject most of Zhangâs opinion.</p>    <p><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a>  HH was the expert in PRC law called by the Bank.  He is a practising lawyer in the PRC.  He obtained his bachelor of laws degreefrom Si Nan Fa Zheng Da Xue(è¥¿åæ¿æ³å¤§å­¸)(formerly known as è¥¿åæ¿æ³å­¸é¢) in 1986 and LLM degree (International Finance)from School of Law of Zhong Guo Ren Min Da Xue(ä¸­åäººæ°å¤§å­¸æ³å­¸é¢)in 1991.  He also participated in law drafting work inthe PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a>  Mr Tong SC doubted HHâs impartiality as the Bank had instructed the law firm in which HH was a partner.  Such attack was answeredby the unchallenged evidence of HH that the Bank was not satisfied with the service of the firm and eventually took legal actionagainst the firm.  Another attack was that HHâs firm had been the legal advisor of a PRC company during 1993 to 2002 of which theBank was a shareholder.  However, that retainer was terminated in 2002.  I consider there was no basis to doubt HHâs impartiality. HH appeared to be assertive.  But on the whole, his opinion was not severely criticised and was supported by the legal literaturehe submitted as well as those by Zhang.  I reject some of his opinion founded on factual basis which are contrary to my finding offact.  That apart, I accept most of his opinion.</p>    <p class="heading">Nature of the Swap Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a>  The main thrust of the Plaintiffsâ case on the Swap Agreement under PRC law as argued by Zhang is that it was an agreement toexchange securities and as such there was no formal requirement of any kind under PRC law.  On the other hand, the Bankâs positionas well as the opinion of its expert in PRC law is that the Swap Agreement was an agreement to use some new properties as securitiesto replace some other securities to be released to the Plaintiffs.  It was therefore a foreign economic contract as well as a contractto amend a charge agreement and mortgage agreement which has to be made in writing under Foreign Economic Contract Law of the PeopleâsRepublic of Chinaãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ¶å¤ç¶æ¿ååæ³ãand Guarantee Law of the Peopleâs Republic of Chinaãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæä¿æ³ãapplicableat the material time.   </p>    <p><a name="p237" class="para" id="p237">237.</a>  Zhang was referred to clause 6(3) of the facility letter relating to the Consolidated Facility dated 14 March 1996 which requiredthe registration of the charge of the two lots of lands to be a condition precedent to granting the facility.  He was asked whetherthe Swap Agreement was an agreement to vary the facility contract.  He avoided answering that question by saying that the Swap Agreementmight have included some other terms.  That was contrary to the Plaintiffsâ case that the Swap Agreement did not contain any termsother than those pleaded.  Plainly, on the pleaded case of the Plaintiffs, the Swap Agreement was an agreement to vary the facilityletter which has the effect of amending a charge agreement and a mortgage agreement. </p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a>  It is the common opinion of both experts that a foreign economic contract and an agreement to amend another agreement which underPRC law was required to be in writing must also be in writing.  However, this requirement has been relaxed since 1999 when ContractLaw came into effect.  In the following two sections, I shall deal with the legal questions whether the Swap Agreement has to bemade in writing under relevant PRC laws.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether the Swap Agreement is valid and effective under Foreign Economic Contract Law</p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a>  The Swap Agreement was entered into on 9 July or 8 October 1996.  It was essentially an economic contract.  According to HH, EconomicContract Law of the Peopleâs Republic of Chinaãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååç¶æ¿ååæ³ã(âEconomic Contract Lawâ) applied toeconomic contracts entered into between local parties, while Foreign Economic Contract Law applied to economic contracts of whichone of the parties was a foreign entity.  But there is no question that both laws applied to the same contract.  HHâs opinion isnot challenged.  HF Enterprises is a company incorporated in Hong Kong which was recognised as a foreign party under PRC law.  Thus,the Swap Agreement was governed by Foreign Economic Contract Law which was effective from 1 July 1985 until 1 October 1999 when itwas replaced by Contract Law.  Article 7 of Foreign Economic Contract Law provided that a foreign economic contract was formed whenthe parties reached agreement in writing and signed on the agreement.  It provided as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãç¶äºäººå°±ååæ¢æ¬¾ä»¥æ¸é¢å½¢å¼éæåè­°ä¸¦ç°½å­ï¼<u>å³çºååæç«</u>ãééä¿¡ä»¶ãé»å ±ãé»å³éæåè­°ï¼ä¸æ¹ç¶äºäººè¦æ±ç°½è¨ç¢ºèªæ¸çï¼ç°½è¨ç¢ºèªæ¸æï¼æ¹çºååæç«ã</p>        <p class="quote">  ä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ³å¾ãè¡æ¿æ³è¦è¦å®æç¶ç±åå®¶æ¹åçååï¼ç²å¾æ¹åæï¼æ¹çºååæç«ãã</p>        <p class="quote">(emphasis added)</p>        <p class="quote">Translation:</p>        <p class="quote">âA <u>contract is formed</u> when the clauses of contract are agreed in written form and signed by the parties.

The focalpoint of the dispute between the parties is whether the Swap Agreement has been formed in accordance with Foreign Economic ContractLaw.</p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a>  Zhang argued that the requirement that a foreign economic contract must be in writing under article 7 of Foreign Economic ContractLaw was not an inflexible one.   He referred to an article titledãååæ³æ¢ä¾è©è¿°ãwritten by Vice President Tang De Hua(åå¾·è¯)ofthe Supreme Peopleâs Court which discussed about an action for breach of contract by a chemical company against an exporting company(â<i>Chemical Company Case</i>â) in which the court held on appeal that the oral agreement was valid.  That article is of limited use as it did not contain areport of the judgment of the court.  It is therefore not clear what was the basis of the courtâs decision.  In any event, thedoctrine of <i>staredecisis</i> is not recognised under PRC law.  The author supported the decision of the court for three reasons.  Firstly, he said that accordingto article 56 of the General Principles of the Civil Law of the Peopleâs Republic of Chinaãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ°æ³éåãandarticle 10 of Contract Law which provided that agreements may be made orally or in writing or in other manners.  Secondly, the oralagreement contained all the essential terms required by law.  Thirdly, the oral agreement was one in which the accounts were settledimmediately(å³ææ¸çµåå), i.e. one in which the parties immediately performed their respective obligations under the agreement. The chemical company delivered goods and the exporting company paid forthwith.  The incidents in that case happened in 1990.  Atthat time, both Economic Contract Law and Foreign Economic Contract Law were in force.  The parties in that case were both PRC parties,though the exporting company intended to export to a foreign party.  Hence, the contract was governed by Economic Contract Law andnot Foreign Economic Contract Law.  Article 3 of that law provided that economic contracts other than those in which the accountswere settled immediately, must be in writing:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãç¶æ¿ååï¼é¤å³ææ¸çµèå¤ï¼æç¶æ¡ç¨ç¨æ¸é¢å½¢å¼ï¼ç¶äºäººåååæçæéä¿®æ¹ååçææ¸ãé»å ±ååè¡¨ï¼ä¹æ¯ååççµæé¨åãã</p>        <p class="quote">Translation:</p>        <p class="quote">âEconomic contracts, except for those in which accounts are settled immediately, shall be in written form. Documents, telegramsand charts that relate to the modification of a contract and that are agreed upon by the parties through consultation shall alsobe integral parts of the contract.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>For these reasons, the <i>Chemical</i> <i>Company Case</i> is distinguishable from the present case as the Swap Agreement was not one in which the accounts were settled immediately and nota local economic contract.  Plainly, the rationale in the <i>Chemical Company Case</i> has no application to the Swap Agreement.  This shows the very flimsy nature of Zhangâs expert opinion.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether the validity of the Swap Agreement has been saved by Contract Law and judicial interpretationsãå¸æ³è§£éã</p>    <p><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a>  In the alternative, Zhang argued that the validity of the Swap Agreement has been saved by Contract Law and judicial interpretationsby the Supreme Peopleâs Court.  The following facts are common knowledge which I have acquired from other cases and which I maytake judicial notice of.  By way of background, a lot of legislations were passed by the National Peopleâs Congress of the PRCto cope with its rapid economic development.  The legislative philosophy has been to legislate broadly instead of making detailedlegal provisions and leaving details to be pronounced by government bureaus in the form of administrative directions as and whenrequired.  The Supreme Peopleâs Court was also authorized by the Standing Committee of the National Peopleâs Congress to supplementthe legislations by giving judicial interpretation to legislations.  Judicial interpretations are statement of legal principles ofgeneral application and not statement of facts of a particular case.  Those principles were discussed and approved by the JudicialCommittee of the Supreme Peopleâs Court(å¯©å¤å§å¡æ)before they were published on Ren Min Fa Yuan Bao(äººæ°æ³é¢å ±)in accordancewith prescribed format.

Such judicial interpretations have the force of law.  Of course, such judicial interpretation is unknownto the common law system. </p>    <p><a name="p242" class="para" id="p242">242.</a>  It is the common opinion of both experts that judicial decisions in individual cases or precedents are not recognised under PRClaw.  They are for reference only.  On the other hand, opinions of highly regarded academic writers expressed in legal publicationsare persuasive and may be taken into consideration by the courts.  Many of those writers are judges of the Supreme Peopleâs Court. Zhang has referred to many of those opinions in his argument, which I shall refer to shortly.</p>    <p><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a>  Contract Law was passed in March 1999 and became effective from 1 October 1999 when it superseded and replaced Economic ContractLaw and Foreign Economic Contract Law.  Hence, with effect from that date, there is no longer any requirement that an economic contractwith a foreign entity must be in writing. HH has no dispute with the above propositions.</p>    <p><a name="p244" class="para" id="p244">244.</a>  Zhang then argued that articles 1 and 3 of the Judicial Interpretation of the Supreme Peopleâs Court on Contract Law pronouncedin 1999ãæé«äººæ°æ³é¢éæ¼é©ç¨ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååååæ³ãè¥å¹²åé¡çè§£é(ä¸)ã(âJI-1â) have retrospectiveeffect so as to save the Swap Agreement from being invalid for want of writing.

Those articles were written by senior and respected judges of the Supreme PeopleâsCourt.  Zhang quoted those articles and expressed his agreement with the opinions stated therein.

Thus,before determining whether JI-1 is applicable to the contractual dispute arising out of the Swap Agreement, it is necessary to ascertainfirst whether the contract was formed in accordance with the law at the time, i.e. Foreign Economic Contract Law in the instant case.</p>    <p><a name="p247" class="para" id="p247">247.</a>  In another article titledãæé«äººæ°æ³é¢éæ¼é©ç¨ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååååæ³ãè¥å¹²åé¡çè§£é(ä¸)ãin thesame publication referred to by Zhang, Chao Shi Bing(æ¹å£«åµ)and others set out the general approach to construing JI-1.

They were of the opinion that the article 1 of JI-1 sets out the generalprinciple that legislation is not retrospective.  Thus, they opined that in respect of disputes arising out of contracts formed beforeContract Law, the general rule is that the law at the time of formation of the contract applies and Contract Law only applies inexceptional cases.  The exceptions are governed by articles 2 and 3 of JI-1.  The learned authors then set out three exceptions.The first exception arises out of the time of performance of the contract, i.e. the case of a contract formed before Contract Lawcame into effect but its performance was extended beyond that date.  Article 2 of JI-1 provides that such disputes are to be dealtwith in accordance with the detailed provisions under chapter 4 of Contract Law.  Those provisions have no application to the presentcase.  The second exception arises out of policy considerations of securing safety of a contractual transaction, i.e. giving effectto contractual transactions.  The policy considerations are to reduce the incidence of contracts being rendered void, to promoteand encourage business transactions and to ensure safety of business transactions, which are to the benefit of the business community. To this end, article 3 deals with the effect of a contract formed prior to the implementation of Contract Law.  The rule is thatif the contract would be void under the then existing law but valid under Contract Law, Contract Law applies to preserve its validity. It must be emphasised that this exception applies to the effect of a contract which has been formed before Contract Law came intoeffect.  The third exception relates to the hierarchy of different kinds of laws under the PRC legal system.  The relevant principlehere is that a law of specific application has priority over a law of general application.  The fourth exception is to preserve finalityof litigation.  Hence, article 5 provides that the court will not entertain a retrial of any dispute arising out of contracts formedbefore the implementation of Contract Law if it has already passed a final and conclusive judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p249" class="para" id="p249">249.</a>  In an earlier article titledãæé«äººæ°æ³é¢éæ¼é©ç¨ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååååæ³ãè¥å¹²åé¡çè§£é(ä¸)ãå°è®involume 3 of the same publication, Wang Chuang(çé)gave a similar opinion.</p>    <p><a name="p250" class="para" id="p250">250.</a>  In summary, the opinion of these writers is as follows.  The general principle is that Contract Law and judicial interpretationsare not retroactive but there are exceptions under special circumstances.  The first part of article 1 states the obvious rule thatContract Law applies to disputes arising from contracts formed after the implementation of Contract Law.  The second part of article1 deals with contracts formed before the implementation of Contract Law.  Unless otherwise provided by JI-1, such contract is subjectto the law then applicable.  In the absence of such legal provisions, the legal provisions of Contract Law applies.  Article 3 governsother contracts formed before the implementation of Contract Law.  It focuses on the effect(æå)and not the formation of sucha contract.  It provides that in determining the effect of such a contract, the rule is that if the contract would be void underthe then existing law but valid under Contract Law, Contract Law applies.  Article 3 is highly relevant to the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p251" class="para" id="p251">251.</a>  Zhang argued that an agreement was formed when the parties were <i>ad idem</i>. As the parties had reached consensus in July or October 1996, the Swap Agreement was formed before the implementation of ContractLaw.  Therefore, article 3 of JI-1 applies to the Swap Agreement.   Hence, he further argued that pursuant to article 3, ContractLaw applies to the Swap Agreement which has legal effect although is was not a written agreement.  He relied on the following extractfrom Wang Chuangâs article in support of his proposition that the Swap Agreement was formed when the parties were <i>ad idem</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãå çºåææ¯æ§æçæ­£äº¤æçç²¾ç¥äºä»¶ï¼ååæ¯ç¶äºäººåæççµæï¼æ¯ååèªç±ååçé«ç¾ï¼å æ­¤ï¼åªè¦ç¶äºäººéæ¹æ ¹æãååæ³ãæè¦å®è¦ç´åæ¿è«¾è¦åå°±ååçä¸»è¦æ¢æ¬¾éæä¸è´ï¼æèç¬¦åãååæ³ãç¬¬ä¸åä¸æ¢ç­æè¦å®çæå½¢ï¼è©²ååå³åæç«ãã</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p252" class="para" id="p252">252.</a>  With respect, Zhang was quoting the opinion of the author of that article out of its proper context.  The author was discussingabout JI-1 and Contract Law.  The author recognised the principle of non-retroactivity of legislation and the policy of protectingbusiness transactions.  He saw the need to strike a balance between that principle and policy consideration.  Then he identifiedthree convergent points(å«æ¥é»)in JI-1 between Contract Law and the previously existing legislation, which are the formation ofthe contract, time for performance of the contract and the legal effect of the contract.  As I have already mentioned, the focusin article 3 of JI-1 was shifted to legal effect of the contract formed before the implementation of Contract Law.  There must bea pre-existing contract which has been formed before the question of its legal effect arises for consideration under article 3 ofJI-1.  Hence, when discussing about the second of the three convergent points, i.e. legal effect of a contract, the author identifiedthree different concepts, namely whether a contract has been formed(æç«æä¸æç«); has entered into effect(çææä¸çæ)andhas legal force(æææç¡æ).  He said that whether a contract has been formed is a pre-requisite for considering whether thatcontract has entered into effect or has no legal force and that a contract which has not entered into effect is not synonymous witha contract which has no legal force.  It was in that context, that the author wrote the passage quoted by Zhang.  Just a few linesdown in the same paragraph, the author continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãçæâæ¯èâä¸çæâç¸å°æçæ¦å¿µï¼èä¸æ¯èâç¡æâç¸å°æï¼å æ­¤âä¸çæâä¸ç­æ¼âç¡æâãäººæ°æ³é¢æç¶èªè­å°ï¼<u>ååççæèä¸çæï¼é½æ¯ä»¥ååæç«ä½çºåæçï¼å¦æååæ ¹æ¬ä¸æç«ï¼åæ ¹æ¬è«ä¸ä¸çæçåé¡</u>ï¼æ´è«ä¸ä¸æææç¡æçåé¡ãã</p>        <p class="quote">(emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p253" class="para" id="p253">253.</a>  In the passage cited by Zhang, the learned author was discussing about consensus or <i>ad idem</i> as a general requirement of a contract but not about formation of special contracts which are required by law to be made in writing. Zhang was quoting the author out of the context.  With respect, I think his argument is contrived.  The Swap Agreement was governedby Foreign Economic Contract Law.  Article 7 of that law required that such an agreement must be made in writing.  Putting asidemy finding that the parties had not reached any agreement during the meeting on 9 July 1996 or during the telephone conversationon 8 October 1996 for the purpose of considering this alternative scenario, any foreign economic contract reached orally could nothave been formed under Foreign Economic Contract Law and has no legal force, i.e. null and void under PRC law due to want of writing.</p>    <p><a name="p254" class="para" id="p254">254.</a>  Mr Tong SC seeks reliance on articles 36 and 37 of Contract Law which provide that a contract is formed if there was substantialperformance by one side and such performance was accepted by the other side to save the Swap Agreement from being rendered void forwant of writing.  Mr Chan SCâs reply is that those articles being part of the Contract Law could not apply to such performanceunder JI-1 for precisely the same reason as discussed above.  I respectfully differ.  The rationale discussed above is based on article1 of JI-1 which applies to an oral agreement made at a time when Foreign Economic Contract Law expressly provided that a foreigneconomic contract could not be formed orally.  However, Mr Tong SCâs present argument is based on a contract which would be formedby operation of law and not an oral agreement.  This is precisely the type of situation envisaged by article 3 of JI-1, i.e. thecontract had no effect under the old law but would have effect under Contract Law. Accordingly, pursuant to article 3 of JI-1, articles36 and 37 of Contract Law are applicable to such a contract formed by conduct. </p>    <p><a name="p255" class="para" id="p255">255.</a>  However, the difficulties of the Plaintiffs do not end there. As was pointed out by HH, the exchange of securities would involveother important acts of performance sufficient to turn the five LUCs into securities.  Those acts include the production of signeddocumentation to show that the registered owner of the landed property had agreed to the use of the land as security and the registeredowner of the land attending to the registration of the security.  In my view, mere delivery of the five LUCs with the intention ofmaking them securities is far from being substantial performance.</p>    <p><a name="p256" class="para" id="p256">256.</a>  In another of his desperate attempt to rescue the Swap Agreement, Zhang referred to articles 1, 2 and 30 of the Judicial Interpretationof the Supreme Peopleâs Court on Contract Law pronounced in 2009ãæé«äººæ°æ³é¢éæ¼é©ç¨ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååååæ³ãè¥å¹²åé¡çè§£é(äº)ã(âJI-2â). Article 1 of JI-2 provides that where parties dispute as to whether a contract has been formed, the court shall find the contractformed if it can ascertain the parties name, the subject matter of the contract and its quantity, unless the law or the parties haveprovided otherwise.  The court may also imply other terms into the contract in accordance with articles 61, 62 and 125 of ContractLaw.  Article 2 provides that where the parties have not entered into a contract in writing or orally, the court may find a contractformed if it can infer from the partiesâ conduct the intention to enter into a contract, unless the law provides otherwise.  Thus,before Zhang can rely on articles 1 and 2, Zhang has to overcome two hurdles.  He has to show that JI-2 is applicable to the SwapAgreement and that there were no other legal provisions which would otherwise prevent the court from finding a contract has beenformed.  </p>    <p><a name="p257" class="para" id="p257">257.</a>  In respect of the first obstacle, Zhang relied on article 30 of JI-2 which provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãååæ³æ½è¡å¾æç«çååç¼çç³¾ç´çæ¡ä»¶ï¼æ¬è§£éæ½è¡å¾å°æªçµå¯©çï¼é©ç¨æ¬è§£éï¼æ¬è§£éæ½è¡åå·²ç¶çµå¯©ï¼ç¶äºäººç³è«åå¯©æèæç§å¯©å¤ç£ç£ç¨åºæ±ºå®åå¯©çï¼ä¸é©ç¨æ¬è§£éãã</p>        <p class="quote">Translation:</p>        <p class="quote">âThis interpretation is applicable to disputes arising out of contracts formed after the implementation of Contract Law which havenot been finally determined since implementation of this judicial interpretation; this interpretation is inapplicable to cases whichhad been finally determined but against which determination a party has applied for retrial or a retrial has been ordered pursuantto the trial supervisory procedure.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p258" class="para" id="p258">258.</a>  Zhang argued that the semi-colon (;) after the first clause of article 30 has the same effect as a full stop (.) with the resultthat under the first clause JI-2 applies to disputes arising out of contracts formed after the implementation of Contract Law whichhave not been finally determined since implementation of this judicial interpretation whereas the second clause refers to disputesarising out of all contracts whether formed before or after the implementation of Contract Law which are subject to retrial.  I haveno difficulties with his interpretation of the first clause which accords with the principle of non-retroactivity.  His interpretationof the second clause is problematic.  He has to read the second clause wholly independently of the first and to ignore the wordsâcontracts formed after the implementation of Contract Lawâ.  But even on that interpretation the article does not help the Plaintiffsbecause it would dis-apply JI-2 to contracts formed before the implementation of Contract Law. Hence, Zhang made a twist by arguingthat the word âonlyâ should be implied to the second clause with the result that JI-2 is only inapplicable to retrials in respectof disputes arising out of contracts formed before or after the implementation of Contract Law which had received final judgment. Again, that is not sufficient to enable JI-2 to apply to the Swap Agreement.  Then Zhang made yet a further twist by arguing thatby necessary implication, JI-2 is applicable to disputes arising out of contracts formed before the implementation of Contract Lawwhich have not been finally determined.  If that were the intention of the Supreme Peopleâs Court, why didnât the judicial committeeof the Supreme Peopleâs Court in their collective wisdom not simply put such category of contracts into the first clause?  Thiscan be very conveniently achieved by deleting the words âarising out of contracts formed after the implementation of Contract Law.</p>    <p><a name="p259" class="para" id="p259">259.</a>  There was certainly nothing in JI-2 to justify the construction that it would be applicable to all disputes arising out of contractswhenever made.  The way Zhang interpreted article 30 ignored the important principle against retroactivity of legislation.  It wasnot open to him to construe the semi-colon the way he did.  Plainly, article 30 must be read as one sentence only and subject tothe introductory phrase of âdisputes arising out of contracts formed after the implementation of Contract Lawâ.  Zhangâs interpretationof this article was so contrived as may properly be regarded as ugly.  It well justified Mr Chan SCâs criticism of his hire-gunapproach, a remark which I have hitherto tried hard to refrain from making.  Also, there was no way that Zhang could overcome thesecond hurdle because Foreign Economic Contract Law expressly provided that such contracts shall be in writing.</p>    <p><a name="p260" class="para" id="p260">260.</a>  Furthermore, HH argued that a charge agreement must be in writing in accordance with article 38 of Guarantee Law and article 49ofãæ¿å°ç¢æµæ¼ç»è¨ç®¡çè¾¦æ³ã.  Accordingly, the Swap Agreement to amend the charge agreement must also be in writing.</p>    <p><a name="p261" class="para" id="p261">261.</a>  Zhang relied on article 112 of Opinion of the Supreme Peopleâs Court on guarantee relating to the implementation of the GeneralPrinciple of the Civil Law (for trial implementation)ï¼1988å¹´æé«äººæ°æ³é¢ãéæ¼è²«å½»å·è¡ãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ°æ³éåãè¥å¹²åé¡çæè¦ï¼è©¦è¡ï¼ãï¼(â1988Opinion for trial implementationâ) to argue that the lack of agreement in writing does not necessarily render the Swap Agreementvoid if the charge could be formed by the conduct of the parties.  That article provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãåµåäººæèç¬¬ä¸äººååµæ¬äººæä¾æµæ¼ç©æï¼æç¶è¨ç«æ¸é¢ååæèå¨ååµæ¬ææ¸ä¸­å¯«æãæ²ææ¸é¢ååï¼ä½æå¶ä»è­æè­ææµæ¼ç©æèå¶æ¬å©è­æ¸å·²äº¤çµ¦æµæ¼æ¬äººçï¼å¯ä»¥èªå®æµæ¼éä¿æç«ãã</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p262" class="para" id="p262">262.</a>  HH disagreed.  He pointed out that the General Principles of the Civil Law is a legislation of general application, so must be the1988 Opinion for trial implementation issued to implement that legislation.  But thereafter,ãåå¸æ¿å°ç¢ç®¡çè¾¦æ³ãandGuarantee Law were pronounced respectively on 5 July 1994 and 30 June 1995.  These are more recent and specific legislations.  Theymust override the 1988 Opinion for trial implementation according to the principles that later legislation overrides earlier legislationand specific legislation overrides legislation of general application under PRC law.  Zhang had no dispute with these legal principleswhich are recognised by both PRC law and the common law.  Again, Mr Chan SC commented adversely on Zhangâs failure as an expertto draw the Courtâs attention to the relative timing of these legislations.  I reject Zhangâs opinion.  </p>    <p><a name="p263" class="para" id="p263">263.</a>  As for the need for registration, Zhang said that a charge agreement was not strictly necessary.  He referred to a decision by theZhuhai Intermediate Peopleâs Court, (2001)(ç æ³ç¶çµå­ç¬¬ 70 è).  That was a case involving a written charge agreement whichwas not registered.  On appeal, the Zhuhai Intermediate Peopleâs Court held that the charge agreement and the chargeeâs rightto the charged property upon his failure to register the charge were two different legal issues.  The charge agreement was effectiveon the date it was formed and was binding as between the parties to the charge agreement.  On the other hand, the chargeeâs priorityto the charged property depended on whether the charge had been registered.  If not, the charge is not binding against third parties. In that case there was no third party interest involved.  The court rightly held that the charge was valid and enforceable againstthe chargor at the instance of the chargee.  That was a case where the parties had entered into a written charge agreement.  Thevalidity of the charge agreement was decided on the basis that the charge agreement had been made in writing and not that it wasmade orally.  To that extent, that decision does not help the Plaintiffs.  But I agree with the principle that a charge agreementproperly formed is not avoided due to lack registration.</p>    <p><a name="p264" class="para" id="p264">264.</a>  On the mechanics of registration, Zhang argues that the oral Swap Agreement could nevertheless be registered because the partiesmight register a bundle of correspondence.  His view is unrealistic and he admitted that he had never seen registration of the chargein such a manner.  His opinion is contrary to the view expressed by Chao Shi Bing in an article titledãä¸­åæä¿è«¸åé¡çè§£æ±ºèå±æã. Zhang was unable to explain how an oral charge agreement could be formed and/or registered under Guarantee Law.  Even if ContractLaw applies to the Swap Agreements by virtue of JI-1 or JI-2, it would be void as it failed to comply with the requirement in writingunder Guarantee Law.</p>    <p><a name="p265" class="para" id="p265">265.</a>  The inescapable conclusion is that even if, contrary to my finding of fact, the parties had reached the Swap Agreement to exchangesecurities, the fact that it had not been reduced into writing prevented the agreement from being formed in accordance with PRC law. The Plaintiffsâ claim in contract must fail in all events.</p>    <p class="heading">Reliance relationship (âgua kaoâ) and ownership of the two lots of land</p>    <p><a name="p266" class="para" id="p266">266.</a>  Were the Plaintiffs successful in proving breach of contract, misrepresentation or breach of warranty, the question of HF Shenzhenâsownership of the two lots of land under reliance relationship would arise.  As they have failed, I shall only state some brief observationson the issue.</p>    <p><a name="p267" class="para" id="p267">267.</a>  The Plaintiffsâ case is that HF Shenzhen was the beneficial owner of the two lots of lands under a reliance relationship withthe registered owner, Lung Shing Property, and as such it suffered loss as a result of the Bankâs breach of the Swap Agreement,misrepresentation or breach of warranty.  The Banksâ contention is that the two lots of lands were purchased and owned by LungShing Property and in any event not by HF Shenzhen and there was no room or concept of beneficial ownership of land in the PRC. The legal question is what is reliance relationship under PRC law which does not recognise beneficial interest in land.</p>    <p><a name="p268" class="para" id="p268">268.</a>  Before considering that legal issue, I shall set out the fact and background as to how the two lots of land came to be held underthe name of Lung Shing Property.  HF Group purchased the two lots of land and some other lots in Longgang through its subsidiariesin 1992.  At the time there were restrictions against land ownership by foreign entities, thus the lots of land were held by JiuzhouProperty under a reliance relationship. Then HF Holdings and Jiuzhou Property entered into the Jiuzhou Agreement with Zhenye Holdingsto develop NCG Phase 1 on the land.  In 1994, Lung Shing Property substituted Jiuzhou Property as a party to the joint venture andbecame the legal owner of the two lots of land.  On 8 July 1994, HF Shenzhen entered into a similar agreement with Lung Shing Propertyand Zhenye Holdings in place of HF Holdings, i.e. the Lung Shing Agreement.  The land premium was however paid by HF Shenzhen. </p>    <p><a name="p269" class="para" id="p269">269.</a>  HH argued that according to the terms of the Lung Shing Agreement, Lung Shing Property was the owner of the two lots of land whichit purchased with a loan from HF Shenzhen and that the relationship among HF Shenzhen, Lung Shing Property and Zhenye Holdings wasthat of a business joint venture.  He further argued that under the Lung Shing Agreement, Lung Shing Property was to contribute thetwo lots of land for developing NCG Phase 1 and would obtain RMB40 for each square meter of flat space sold as its share of profit,Zhenye Holdings would finance the development cost, HF Shenzhen would finance Lung Shing Propertyâs purchase of the land and allsale proceeds would be deposited into a joint account.  Accordingly, HH argued that the arrangement pointed to a joint investmentin which Lung Shing Property would benefit from the profit of the joint venture as well as the risk of lost.  As for the loan advancedby HF Shenzhen, HH argued that it only created a creditor and debtor relationship between Lung Shing Property and HF Shenzhen.</p>    <p><a name="p270" class="para" id="p270">270.</a>  The profit of RMB40 per square metre of flat area sold could have no bearing to profit from the so called joint venture.  Lung ShingProperty would receive that fixed award regardless of the amount of profit made or loss suffered.  I also fail to see what businessrisk Lung Shing Property could have under the Lung Shing Agreement.  There is no dispute that HF Shenzhen paid the purchase pricefor the two lots of land as well as some other lots.  In Shen 9964/2005, Lung Shing Property did not dispute that the purchase pricefor two lots of land were paid by HF Shenzhen or its obligation to transfer the two lots of land to HF Shenzhen.  Thus, althoughon the face the Lung Shing Agreement supported HHâs argument, I could have no doubt that it did not reflect the true situationbetween the parties but was a sham agreement to facilitate HF Shenzhenâs purchase of the two lots of land under the reliance relationship. Accordingly, I accept Chanâs evidence that Lung Shing Property held the two pieces of land under a reliance relationship withHF Shenzhen which paid for the purchase price.</p>    <p><a name="p271" class="para" id="p271">271.</a>  Having reached the above finding of fact, the next issue is what is the nature of that reliance relationship and whether under thatrelationship HF Shenzhen has any beneficial interest in the two lots of land.  It is common ground that beneficial ownership in landis not recognised under PRC law until Trust Law of the Peopleâs Republic of Chinaãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååä¿¡è¨æ³ã(âTrustLawâ) came in operation in 2001.  Zhang did not argue that Trust Law has retrospective effect.  He submitted that HF Shenzhen couldhave ownership in the land under a reliance relationship.  He relied upon articles 402 and 403 of Contract Law in support of hiscontention that before 2001 there could be some kind of legal reliance relationship akin to the trust arrangement under Hong Konglaw in the PRC.

They do not specifically deal with beneficial ownership in land and the rights of a beneficial owner against a third party.  Zhangadmitted that he knew of no case in which it was held that a non-registered owner of a real property had proprietary interest inthe property, but he did not rule out the possibility that in fact there were such cases.  That was a fair comment but unhelpful.</p>    <p><a name="p272" class="para" id="p272">272.</a>  Zhang also relied on the doctrine of acts for undisclosed principal(é±åæ°äºæ³å¾è¡çº)and implicitly suggested that HF Shenzhenâsownership of the two lots lands was of such a nature.  He referred to an article downloaded from the Ningboshi Renmin Jianchaynan(âPeopleâs Procuratorateâ)(å¯§æ³¢å¸äººæ°æª¢å¯é¢)on 13 March 2006.  The article reported a case before the Ningboshi PeopleâsCourt.  The facts of that case were as follows.  B purchased a property from A in 1999. The transfer of property was never registered. In 2001, B was desirous to sell the property.  To save the inconvenience of registration, he sought Aâs agreement to sell theproperty in Aâs name with himself as Aâs agent.  A gave B a written authorisation to that effect.  As agent of A, B sold theproperty to C but C failed to complete the purchase.  Then B forfeited Câs deposit and sold the property to D.  C sued for returnof the deposit and a declaration that the sale to him was void.  The Ningboshi Peopleâs Court found in favour of C and orderedB to return the deposit to C and pay compensation of like amount.  The court held that B had no right to sell the property withouthaving first transferred the land use right to himself.  B applied for review to the Peopleâs Procuratorate. The Peopleâs Procuratorateconsidered the court had erred in law in not accepting Aâs authorisation and in holding that B could not sell the property as anundisclosed agent.  The Peopleâs Procuratorate applied to the Ningboshi Peopleâs Court for review.  The case was then settled. Thus, it is not clear whether the doctrine of undisclosed principal is applicable to property transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p273" class="para" id="p273">273.</a>  Zhang also exhibited an article written by Zhang Chor(å¼µæ¥)titledãè«é±åæ°äºæ³å¾è¡çºãpublished in the 5<sup>th</sup> issue of<i>ãæ³å¾ç§å­¸ã</i>in support of his contention that the two lots of land were held by Lung Shing Property on behalf of HF Shenzhen as undisclosed principal. However, his contention was in fact contrary to the full opinion of Zhang Chor as set out in his article.  The author recognisedthe doctrine of acts by undisclosed principal but unequivocally said that it does not apply to industrial property and immovableproperty.  Mr Chan SC complained Zhangâs hire gun approach for not drawing the Courtâs attention to the fact that the authorâsopinion which he quoted was a qualified one and is contrary to the opinion Zhang advocated.  Zhangâs reply was a rather disappointedone that he thought it adequate that he had exhibited the entire article for the Court to read.</p>    <p><a name="p274" class="para" id="p274">274.</a>  The reason why the doctrine does not apply to these two categories of property is obvious.  In the case of immovable property, thisis probably because of the tight control over land ownership and the system of title registration in the PRC.

Zhang referred to a judicial interpretation allegedly reported in <i>[2001]</i> <i>Guide and Study on the Adjudication Supervision, Volume 4(å¯©å¤ç£ç£æå°èç ç©¶)</i> which reported a request by the Shensi Higher Peopleâs Court and an answer from the Supreme Peopleâs Court.  When challengedabout the authenticity of the answer as a judicial interpretation, he produced a book titled <i>Judicial Interpretation of The Supreme Peopleâs Court and Answers to Requests(æé«äººæ°æ³é¢å¸æ³è§£éèè«ç¤ºç­è¦å¨æ¸)</i>and a copy of the answer downloaded from the website of the Shensi Peopleâs Court.  In that case, Yiao paid a fee to a service companywhich applied for the necessary business licence from the authority and permitted Yiao to conduct his retail business under the nameof the service company.  The Shensi Higher Peopleâs Court sought advice from the Supreme Peopleâs Court on the nature of therelationship between Yiao and the service company.  The Supreme Peopleâs Court answered that the business operated by Yiao belongedto Yiao but was held by the service company under a reliance relationship.  The Supreme Peopleâs Court answered as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ãç¶ç ç©¶èªçºï¼è¥¿å®æ¨æºä»¶ç¶é·ç«(ä»¥ä¸ç°¡ç¨±ç¶é·ç«)ççæ¥­å·ç§éç¶ç»è¨çºè¥¿å®å¸è®æ¹åç°åè¥¿è·¯çç¢ãçæ´»æåå¬å¸(ä»¥ä¸ç°¡ç¨±æåå¬å¸)éè¾¦çéé«ä¼æ¥­ï¼ä½æåå¬å¸å¨éè¾¦ç¶é·ç«ä¹ååçæ¥­ä¸­åæªç´æ¥æè³ï¼è©²ç¶é·ç«æ¯é¥å¤©ç¥¿ä»¥æåå¬å¸åç¾©ç³è«éè¾¦ãå©ç¨é¤é·ç15è¬åæ¨æºä»¶ç¶é·éçä¸¦éæ­¥ç¼å±èµ·ä¾çï¼ç¶é·ç«èªè² çè§ï¼èªæç¶çé¢¨éªï¼äººå¡éç¨ãè¾­éãå·¥è³åå¥¬éç¼æ¾åç±é¥å¤©ç¥¿ä¸äººæ±ºå®ï¼æåå¬å¸ä¸¦ä¸å¹²æ¶ï¼ä¹æªæ´¾å¡åèç¶çç®¡çï¼ç¶é·ç«æ¯å¹´ååæåå¬å¸äº¤ç´ä¸å®æ¸é¡çç®¡çè²»ãè¥¿å®å¸å·¥åè¡æ¿ç®¡çå±æ­£å¼çµ¦è¥¿å®å¸ä¸­ç´äººæ°æ³é¢è¦å½ï¼èªå®ç¶é·ç«âå±¬æ¼é¥å¤©ç¥¿ç­äººç±è³éè¾¦èµ·ä¾ï¼ä¸¦æé å¨ç°åä¼æ¥­ç¸½å¬å¸åä¸çç§ç(åä¼)ä¼æ¥­âãæåæä½ é¢å¯©å¤å§å¡æç¬¬ä¸ç¨®æè¦ï¼å³è¥¿å®å¸æ¨æºä»¶ç¶é·ç«çæ§è³ªçºç§çä¼æ¥­ãã</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Shensi Higher Peopleâs Court accepted that answer and ordered the business and some landed property transferred to the servicecompany by the court below to be transferred back to Yiao.  Zhang argued that the answer from the Supreme Peopleâs Court was ajudicial interpretation to the effect that landed property may be held by a registered owner under a reliance relationship for abeneficial owner. </p>    <p><a name="p276" class="para" id="p276">276.</a>  HH disagreed.  His opinion is that the publication was just an answer from the Supreme Peopleâs Court which was a statement offact in a particular case.  It is not binding on the courts as the PRC does not recognize the principle of <i>stare decisis</i>.  A judicial interpretation, on the other hand, is a statement of legal principle of general application, which is binding on thecourts. </p>    <p><a name="p277" class="para" id="p277">277.</a>  Mr Chan SC referred Zhang to the formal requirements of judicial interpretation as set out in the 1997 Working Regulations.  Thoserequirements include (a) that the answer be discussed in and approved by the Judicial Committee of the Supreme Peopleâs Court:article 3; (b) that the answer be published on Ren Min Fa Yuan Bao(äººæ°æ³é¢å ±): article 8; (c) that the answer be publishedin accordance with a prescribed format: article 9 and appendix to the 1997 Working Regulations; and (d) that the answer bears a headingin prescribed form: article 10.  Indeed, the copies of JI-1 and JI-2 complied with the above requirements.  However, the downloadedcopy from the Shensi Peopleâs Court does not meet any of the above requirements.  HH also produced the index from a book titled<i>ãè§£è®æé«äººæ°æ³é¢å¸æ³è§£éã</i>published by the Ren Min Fa Yuan Press and some of the judicial interpretations printed therein.  Those judicial interpretations compliedwith the formal requirements mentioned above, while the answer in <i>Yiaoâs case</i> could not be found in the index.  Zhang was unable to explain the inconsistencies.  Despite that, he obstinately refused to changehis view. This clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of his legal research and opinion, if not also his hire-gun attitude.  In conclusion,HHâs opinion that the answer was not a judicial interpretation is supported by overwhelming evidence.  I reject Zhangâs opinionthat the Supreme Peopleâs Courtâs answer in that case was of the status of a judicial interpretation. </p>    <p><a name="p278" class="para" id="p278">278.</a>  Furthermore, in <i>Yiaoâs case</i>, the landed properties were all purchased by Yiao and were either registered under his name or with his name on the documents.  Thus,the courtâs order to return the properties to Yiao was not referable to his beneficial interest in the properties or the reliancerelationship, but to his legal ownership.  In my view, the answer from the Supreme Peopleâs Court does not support the propositionthat PRC law recognised beneficial interest in land held under a reliance relationship in the name of another person.  Even if theanswer to the Shensi Peopleâs Court were a judicial interpretation, one can deduce no legal principle from that answer.  It didnot define what a reliance relationship is and whether it exists in relation to real property. </p>    <p><a name="p279" class="para" id="p279">279.</a>  This term, âreliance relationshipâ was mentioned in a number of PRC judgments in relation to the two lots of land.  I have alsoseen the term being used in other cases involving business transactions in the PRC.  In Shen 9964/2005, the Shenzhen Peopleâs Courtacknowledged that the two lots of land were held by Lung Shing Property for HF Shenzhen under a reliance relationship.  That relationshipwas not disputed by Lung Shing Property.  It only refused to transfer the land to HF Shenzhen because HF Shenzhen refused to paythe substantial tax involved.  Accordingly, the court ordered the transfer on condition that HF Shenzhen paid all necessary tax andcosts. As Lung Shing Property had no dispute about the reliance relationship, it would not have litigated if the tax involved wasnot substantial.  HH pointed out that the substantial tax showed that the law did not recognise beneficial ownership under the reliancerelationship otherwise no tax would have to be paid or the tax would only be nominal.  HH also argued that if the court regardedHF Shenzhen as the beneficial owner, it would have ordered the transfer unconditionally.  Neither did Zhang challenge HHâs argumentnor did HH produce the relevant tax legislation in support of his contention.  Shen 9964/2005 was a case between the parties to areliance relationship.  Lung Shing Property did not dispute the relationship or that HF Shenzhen had paid for the purchase priceof the land or HF Shenzhen was entitled to the land.  That case can readily be explained by way of a contract between parties tothe contract.  It gives no clue as to the right of the parties against third party in respect of landed property held under a reliancerelationship.  In particular, it gives no clue as to the rights of the âreliance beneficiaryâ against a third party as regardsthe landed property held by the âreliance ownerâ under that relationship, if I may use those terms.  I am left in a state ofignorance as to what PRC law is regarding this reliance relationship.</p>    <p><a name="p280" class="para" id="p280">280.</a>  Zhang argued that the Supreme Peopleâs Court mentioned that term in its judgment in SPC 545/2009 without any disapproval indicatingits endorsement of the legality of the reliance relationship.  Mr Chan SC submits that the Supreme Peopleâs Court was only narratingthe background history as mentioned in the other judgments which could not be taken as a recognition of HF Shenzhenâs beneficialinterest in the two lots of land.  I agree.  Not much could be read into that judgment as to whether there was in fact a reliancerelationship between HF Shenzhen and Lung Shing Property.  But more importantly is that the court did not give any definitive opinionas to what was the nature of a reliance relationship.</p>    <p><a name="p281" class="para" id="p281">281.</a>  Mr Tong SC then referred to the judgment in Yue 311/2003 in which Lung Shing Property was not allotted any of the flats in NCG Phase1 as evidence that Lung Shing Property did not have any interest in the two lots of land under the reliance relationship in supportof his contention that the beneficial interest was vested in HF Shenzhen.  However, the judgment in that case was a compromise amongZhenye Holdings, Lung Shing Property and Chan in his rather ambiguous capacity as representing HF Holdings and not HF Shenzhen. As pointed out by Mr Chan SC, the case only dealt with the disposal of eight blocks and not the rest of the lands, the subject matterof the joint venture.  Also, Lung Shing Property was authorised to dispose of the remaining four blocks and other land in NCG Phase1.  I do not consider that case helpful to the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p282" class="para" id="p282">282.</a>  Neither Zhang nor HH had ever attempted to give any definitive opinion supported by proper authority as to what a reliance relationshipis and its legal effect.  None of the decisions referred to by Zhang cast any light on the nature of that relationship.  The Plaintiffsbear the burden of proof if they wish to rely on that relationship to establish their claim.  But they failed.  Despite that I amsatisfied that Lung Shing Property held the two lots of land under a relationship with HF Shenzhen recognised by the parties as areliance relationship and that HF Shenzhen had paid for the purchase price of the land, I have not been informed by expert evidenceas to the legal nature of that relationship.  In particular, it has not been proved to my satisfaction that under PRC law the âreliancebeneficiaryâ can enforce his right over landed property held by the âreliance ownerâ under that relationship against a thirdparty.  I am not satisfied that HF Shenzhen has any beneficial interest over the two lots of land, which it can enforce against athird party under PRC law.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p283" class="para" id="p283">283.</a>  In conclusion, I accept the proposition of PRC law as submitted by Mr Chan SC.  The Swap Agreement was an economic contract madewith a foreign party to which Foreign Economic Contract Law would have applied. As it was not in writing, the Swap Agreement wasnot formed.  For that reason, Contract Law would not have applied to the Swap Agreement pursuant to JI-1 or JI-2 as to cure the defectof want of writing.  Accordingly, the Swap Agreement was null and void and of no effect under PRC law.  Though articles 36 and 37of Contract Law would apply to the act of delivery of the five LUCs to the Bank and its acceptance of the same, such conduct wasfar short of being substantial as would invoke the operation of those articles.</p>    <p><a name="p284" class="para" id="p284">284.</a>  The Swap Agreement would also be null and void under PRC law because in effect the swap would involve two main obligations whichare the discharge of the existing securities and the creation of securities over the five lots of land.  The nature of the Swap Agreementwould in effect be a contract to amend a charge contract, which is required to be in writing pursuant to article 38 of GuaranteeLaw.  Accordingly, even if the Swap Agreement, in the non-technical sense of the word, were reached during the meeting on 9 July1996 or over the telephone conversation on 8 October 1996, it was null and void under PRC law because it was not made in writing.</p>    <p><a name="p285" class="para" id="p285">285.</a>  Furthermore, there was no expert evidence as to the legal effect of such a reliance relationship under PRC law.  The doctrine ofacts for undisclosed principal does not apply to acts relating to real property. Also, PRC law does not recognise beneficial interestin land.  Thus, even if the Swap Agreement were valid and binding, the Plaintiffs had no interest to sue.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p286" class="para" id="p286">286.</a>  Accordingly, the Plaintiffsâ claim in contract would also fail if the proper law of the Swap Agreement was PRC law.</p>    <p class="heading"><a name="_TOC261273148" id="_TOC261273148">OTHER EXPERT EVIDENCE</a></p>    <p><a name="p287" class="para" id="p287">287.</a>  In view of the conclusion reached on the basis of my finding of fact and on the alternative scenario, I do not consider it necessaryto deal with the expert evidence on accounting, quantity surveying and property valuation.  Other than giving my overall views ontheir evidence, I am not going to over-burden this already long judgment with an analysis of their expert evidence.

That issue is now academic in view of my finding of fact.  I shallnevertheless comment briefly on the expertsâ evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p289" class="para" id="p289">289.</a>  Mr Chan SC criticised the Plaintiffsâ failure to provide underlying accounting documents in support of the audited accounts ofHF Holdings and HF Enterprises.  He argues that in the absence of such accounting documents the Court should accept MBâs writtenopinion that on a proper analysis of those audited accounts, HF Shenzhen had no interest in the two lots of land.  On the other hand,Mr Tong SCâs proposition is that the auditor had misinterpreted the accounts of HF Holdings and HF Enterprises which resulted inthe land investments in Shenzhen being entered into the assets of HF Property.  He demonstrated the inconsistencies between the auditedaccounts of HF Holdings and HF Enterprises in support of his proposition.  He argues that the audited accounts did not accuratelyreflect how the financial resources and assets of HF Group were distributed among the various members of the group.  The capitalverification reports also conclusively supported Chanâs evidence that upon the incorporation of HF Shenzhen he transferred RMB1billion to its account for the purchase the two lots of land and other land for development NCG. </p>    <p><a name="p290" class="para" id="p290">290.</a>  According to MB, the audited accounts of HF Holdings and HF Enterprises did not support HF Shenzhenâs claim to have paid for thepurchase price of the two lots of land.  That may be a fair view of his interpretation of the audited accounts, but it was obviouslybased on inaccurate audited accounts, I could not give much weight to it.  In their evidence in Court, both MB and Poole were ofthe opinion that based on the capital verification report, there was a clear link between the HF Shenzhen and the purchase pricefor the two lots of land.  MB must be taken to have withdrawn his opinion as stated in his written report. Furthermore, the registeredowner of the two lot of land, Lung Shing Property, acknowledged that the purchase price for the two lots of land were provided byHF Shenzhen.  This and the capital verification must be taken to have conclusively proved that the purchase price for the two lotsof land were financed by HF Shenzhen.  </p>    <p class="heading">Quantity surveying expertsâ evidence</p>    <p><a name="p291" class="para" id="p291">291.</a>  The quantity surveying experts were called to give evidence on the building cost required to complete the various blocks of flatsin NCG Phase 1 and Phase 2 for the purpose assessing the Plaintiffsâ loss of profit.  Again, that issue is now academic.</p>    <p><a name="p292" class="para" id="p292">292.</a>  The estimates were made difficult due to the lack of drawings and plans for the flats to be built.  However, there was a fair amountof agreement between the experts of both parties on the principle and approach to be adopted in estimating the building cost.  Despitethat, they were unable to reach agreement on the estimated building cost.  Their differences lie in the choice of Guangdong or Shenzhenreference data to be used as a basis for estimation and in the adjustment to be made from those data in the light of the specificationand type of flats to be built in NCG, such as the framework of the buildings, whether piles would be required and the appropriateallowance for contingency. </p>    <p><a name="p293" class="para" id="p293">293.</a>  Except for the choice of reference data, I consider CTTâs stance unreasonably cautious.  Though drawings were not available, theexperts could and should make reference to the finish and structure of the completed flats.  His interpretation of the specificationof the building standard in respect of the reference data was contrived.  In insisting to make allowance for the cost of piling andmore expensive framework due to the absence geotechnical reports on the soil condition and drawings, he was deliberately ignoringthe fact that the flats were to be built in the same locality in which there was no suggestion that the soil condition was likelyto be very much different.  He was also turning a blind eye to the foundations which were already built for some of the blocks.</p>    <p><a name="p294" class="para" id="p294">294.</a>  In Yue 311/2003 proceeding, the parties thereto, i.e. Zhenye Holdings, Lung Shing Property and Chan, jointly instructed æ·±å³å¸å»ºè¨­å·¥ç¨é å¹ç®¡çç«to estimate the building cost of the eight blocks in NCG Phase 1. The cost was estimated to be RMB37,353,151.14.  That estimate couldbe treated as having been made by an independent and credible body appointed by antagonising parties interested in the outcome ofthe estimate who must have exercised care in the appointment of this joint expert and had properly scrutinised his valuation.  Beingan expert in the locality and instructed at a time much closer to the event, that expert must be in a better position to make a properestimate of the building cost.  That expert must have access to more information, such as building plans and had opportunity to viewthe flats than have Leung and CTT.  However, CTT unreasonably refused to adopt that estimate as a basis of assessment.</p>    <p><a name="p295" class="para" id="p295">295.</a>  CTT has impressed me that his attitude was simply to make allowance for anything he could make an excuse for so as to inflate thebuilding cost for the best interest of his client.  He was being deliberately unreasonable, unrealistic and impractical.  He wasnot acting fairly as an expert should.  He had in mind his clientâs interest more than his duty to assist the Court.  On the otherhand, I consider Leungâs approach proper and his assessment reasonable. I would accept Leungâs assessment, subject to some minoradjustments.</p>    <p class="heading">Property valuation expertsâ evidence</p>    <p><a name="p296" class="para" id="p296">296.</a>  The property valuation experts were called to give evidence on the market value of blocks B-5 to B-8 in NCG Phase 1 and the blocksin NCG Phase 2 which could have been built and sold had the Bank released the two LUCs.  Insofar as blocks B-5 to B-8 were concerned,the valuation is a matter of historical fact, i.e. the consideration stated in the sale and purchase agreement with Lung Shing Propertyand Yue Hua Trading.  The focal point of the expertsâ dispute was on the valuation of blocks C-1 to C-4 in NCG Phase 1 and allthe blocks in NCG Phase 2.  Experts from both sides have no disagreement on the principles to be adopted in the valuation, whichare all very familiar to the Court. However, their valuations differ significantly for two reasons. </p>    <p><a name="p297" class="para" id="p297">297.</a>  Firstly, the Bankâs expert, LCH, took the view that the flats were not marketable and had absolutely no value because the landpremium had not been fully paid.  In his written opinion, he refused to give a valuation.  His duty was to give a valuation and notto decide on the conflicting evidence whether the land premium had been paid which was outside his expertise.  That was a matterfor lawyers or for the Court if necessary.  His assertion that the flats had no value was so irresponsible as to suggest he was actingas a mouth piece of his client.</p>    <p><a name="p298" class="para" id="p298">298.</a>  In his evidence in Court, LCH was asked by Mr Liu, junior counsel for the Bank, to give a valuation nevertheless.  LCH reiteratedhis original opinion and gave a valuation which is significantly lower than the Plaintiffsâ expert, Ng.  This is the second areawhere the experts depart.  Both experts agreed to use the direct comparison method and to use the sale prices of flats in NCG Phase1 as comparables for the purpose of preparing valuation.  They also agreed that only transactions which were made at armsâ lengthshould be used as comparables.  On that basis, Ng excluded all transactions of which he was informed by Chan were sales at a discountto staff of HF Group or Lung Shing Property.  LCH disagreed with the exclusion for the reason that there was no evidence from thepublic record to show that those transactions were sales to staff.  One could not expect such information to be entered in the publicrecord.  The transactions which Ng excluded were at a significant discount from those made at about the same time.  They were outof line with contemporaneous and later transactions.  They were even lower than the price of comparable flats which HF Shenzhen soldto Lung Shing Property.  There was no good reason not to accept Chan's assertion that those transactions were sales to staff.  Clearly,they were not sales at armsâ length, whether they were sales to staff or not.  Those sales should be excluded under well establishedvaluation principles known to the court.  This clearly showed that LCH was only paying lip service to establish valuation principles. It also shows not only that LCH was manifestly wrong professionally, but was deliberately so.  He adopted the approach of a hiregun fighting in the best interest of his client regardless of the duty he owed to assist the court.  I accept Ngâs valuation andreject LCHâs valuation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">( Anthony To )<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Ronny Tong SC and Ms Eva Sit, instructed by Messrs Hogan Lovells, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Edward Chan SC and Mr Liu Man Kin, instructed by Messrs Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2010/830.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
