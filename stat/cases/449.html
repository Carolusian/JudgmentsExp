There is also an applicationby the plaintiff to add one Dr Buddy Wong as the 5th defendant on the ground of an alleged conspiracy by Dr Wong with the other defendantsto pervert the cause of justice.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The 4th defendant is a firm of solicitors which had represented the defendant in a personal injuries action in which the plaintiffherein was also the plaintiff. That was a claim based on an allegation of medical negligence. That action was struck out by SaundersJ for want of proper medical evidence in support. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal gave him onemore chance to provide the necessary medical evidence. But ordered him to pay the costs of the appeal. He then sought leave fromthe Court of Appeal to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal. His application was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. He still failedto provide the necessary medical evidence within the time extended by the Court of Appeal. His appeal to the Court of Appeal againstthe decision of Saunders J then stood dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  When the Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiffâs application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal, the Court alsoordered the plaintiff to pay the costs of that application to the defendant in that case. The 4th defendant herein on behalf of thedefendant there submitted a bill of costs to the Court of Appeal for gross sum assessment. The Court of Appeal was very criticalabout this bill and regarded it as inherently unreliable. The Court of Appeal did not proceed to gross sum assessment but orderedtaxation of costs in the normal course. This bill was not used subsequently for taxation. This bill has however become one of thesubject matters in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The partners and associates of the 4th defendant have, in the course of conducting the defence of the personal injuries action,made some affidavits and affirmations. What they said in these affidavits/affirmations have also become subject matters in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Counsel for the defendants, in his written submissions for this application, only relied on the ground that the plaintiffâs claimdiscloses no reasonable cause of action. I now consider the contents of the statement of claim and see if it discloses any reasonablecause of action.</p>    <p class="heading">The first claim</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The plaintiff pleaded his first claim as the defendantsâ deliberate perjury created specially to obtain monies from the plaintiff,by way of a bills for costs that is deliberately inflated by at least 800% and it was attempted fraud by attempting to gain moniesunder false pretences and the tort of deceit.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The subject matter of this claim is of course the bill of costs that was criticised and rejected by the Court of Appeal. The plaintifffurther pleaded that the bill contained deliberate lies concocted to deceive the Court of Appeal. But I note that the plaintiff hasnot suffered any loss by reason of this bill. This bill was rejected by the Court of Appeal and was not used again in taxations.This first claim therefore discloses no reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p class="heading">The second claim</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The second claim is pleaded as the defendantsâ act for deliberate perjury to obtain monies from the plaintiff by way of normalbills for costs which is now provable as having been deliberately concocted to deceive the courts into ruling against the plaintiff.The plaintiff further pleaded that it was an attempted fraud, attempting to gain monies under false pretences under the tort of deceitand defamation, slander and libel.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  However, the details he provided under this claim were alleged lies and false statements made by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendantsin their affidavits/affirmations made in the personal injuries action. He pleaded that the affidavits/affirmations were made to causehim to lose the action and to defame, malign and slander him as a deliberate vexatious, spurious and frivolous litigant.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  He also pleaded that the 1st to 4th defendants conspired together to take advantage of his imperative needs and legal rights andhave consequently defamed, slandered and libelled him in court in a hearing before Deputy High Court Judge Carlson on 16 July 2009.At the hearing of this application, he referred me to various passages in the affidavits/affirmations that he complained of.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Nevertheless, it is settled law that statements made by lawyers in or incidental to an action in court is privileged from defamationsuit. The position has been set out and explained in <i>Gatley on Libel and Slauder</i>, 11<sup>th</sup> edition at paras. 13.4 to 13.15:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote" style="text-align:center">â(c) Privilege of Lawyers</p>        <p class="quote">13.14  Privilege of advocates. No action will lie for defamatory words spoken by an advocate in his professional capacity in the courseof an inquiry before a judicial tribunal, even though they were uttered maliciously and not with the object of supporting the caseof his client and were entirely irrelevant to the subject-matter of the inquiry. The law is the same whether the defendant be a barristeror a solicitor. â¦</p>        <p class="quote">13.15  Extent of privilege.  The privilege is not confined to words spoken by an advocate, it extends also to any statements containedin a pleading or other document incidental to the action settled by a lawyer engaged in litigation, including <i>inter parties</i> correspondence, even though such statements are irrelevant for the purposes of the action and introduced unnecessarily and withoutany instructions from his client and without any information which would justify them. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Regardless of whether the allegations in the affidavits/affirmations of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants are truthful or otherwise,no defamation suit can be brought in relation to them.  These statements also have not caused the plaintiff any loss.  The secondclaim therefore also discloses no reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p class="heading">The third claim</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The third claim is entitled attempted fraud, attempting to gain monies under false pretences and the tort of deceit and defamation,slander and libel.  Under this claim, he again referred to the affidavits/affirmations of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants.  He allegedthat they contained lies and were concocted to deceive the High Court.  They were to defame, malign, slander and cause libel againsthim by attempting to portray him as a danger to public safety and by alleging that he had subjected the 2nd and 3rd defendants andothers to torrents of verbal abuse outside and inside of court.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  He also pleaded that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants had slandered him by attempting perjurously to persuade the court that he wassuffering from some kind of mental illness and other psychiatric and psychological disorders. He also referred me to the passagesthat he complained of at the hearing. Again, these allegations, regardless of whether they are true, are privileged from defamationsuit for the same reason given above. He also has not suffered any loss by reason of these allegations. This claim therefore alsodiscloses no reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p class="heading">Other matters</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The statement of claim then goes on to describe how the action should proceed and the quantum of his claim. There is then a requestfor an order allowing contingency fees to be charged in this case. This request does not amount to any claim known in the law andtherefore also discloses no reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision on striking out</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The above discussion deals with the matters pleaded in the statement of claim. Since nothing in the statement of claim disclosesany reasonable cause of action, I have no choice but to strike it out. I therefore strike out the writ of summons and the statementof claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Summons for joinder</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I now deal with the plaintiffsâ summons to join Dr Buddy Wong as a co-defendant. Dr Wong was engaged by the 4th defendant on behalfof the defendant in the personal injuries action. His task was to examine the plaintiff for the purpose of that action. The plaintiffâsground for joining him is that he was allegedly in conspiracy with the defendants in this action to pervert the cause of justice.The plaintiff said at the hearing that Dr Wongâs report was untrue. It did not set out what he had told Dr Wong at the examination.He also said that Dr Wong had wrongly opined that his hearing problem was caused by aging. He asserted that Dr Wong was paid to saywhat was said in the report.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  However, the plaintiff had not suffered from the alleged conspiracy at all. His personal injuries action was struck out not becauseof Dr Wongâs report, but because of his failure to provide the necessary medical evidence. The claim he seeks to make against DrWong therefore also discloses no reasonable cause of action. I therefore do not allow the joinder of Dr Buddy Wong as the 5th defendantin the action. I dismiss the plaintiffâs summons dated 9 December 2009.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs orders nisi</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I now deal with costs. I make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff do pay the defendants the costs of their application to strike out the writ of summons and statement of claim.I also make a gross assessment order <i>nisi</i> as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I deal with counsel fees first. This is a relatively simple and straightforward application. I think a junior counsel with lessexperience can handle it comfortably. I therefore allow only $30,000 for counsel fees.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Regarding the costs of the solicitors, I think the $1,000 charged for copying and travelling is reasonable. I also allow $660 forthe one hour attendance by the litigation clerk. I allow half an hour for communication by the partners of the 4th defendant withthe plaintiff and another half an hour for communication with the court. The sum allowed for this hour of work is $4,000. Regardingprofessional work, I allow $1,000 for the 15 minutes required for drafting of the summons to strike out. I also allow a total ofthree hours for perusal by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants of the statement of claim and all other documents served by the plaintiffon the defendants in relation to this application to strike out and the 1st defendantâs preparation for the hearing. That amountsto $12,000. The hearing on 17 December 2009 took one hour and I allow $4,000 for it. The total sum tax and allowed is $52,660.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  For the plaintiffâs summons to join Dr Buddy Wong, I make an order <i>nisi</i> that there be no order as to costs.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  These orders <i>nisi</i> will automatically become orders absolute after 14 days unless there is an application for their variation to be made by either sidewithin the next 14 days.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(L.
