Mr. Fongalso confirmed that his client had never pleaded and therefore would not be relying on the claim relating to the Defendantâs failureto take reasonable skill and care in assisting the Plaintiff in filling out the Application Form.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  I then enquired with Miss Ling, Counsel for the Defendant, who fairly agreed with me that the Plaintiff was not required to pleadlaw. Miss Ling further accepted that the Statement of Claim did contain enough material facts (if found to be true) to support acause of action in deceit.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The elements of the tort of deceit are neatly summarized in para.18-01 of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts (19<sup>th</sup> ed.)</i> and I quote:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>Where a defendant makes a false representation, knowing it to be  untrue, or being reckless as whether it is true, and intends thatthe claimant should act in reliance on it, then in so far as the latter does so and suffer loss the defendant is liable for thatloss</i>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Each aspect of this tort will be discussed in turn below. Meanwhile, I shall firstly set out the background facts.</p>    <p class="heading">The Background</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It is not in dispute that the Defendant was and still is working an insurance agent. The Plaintiff first came to know the Defendantthrough the introduction of the Plaintiffâs aunt, who in turn was and still is one of the Defendantâs clients. The Plaintiffâshusband also gave evidence and which was not seriously challenged by the Defendant that through the Defendant a number of his companystaff had taken out various insurance policies with AXA in the past.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Sometime in or about August 2001, the Plaintiff took out a medical insurance policy with AXA through the Defendant. Thereafter,through the Defendant the Plaintiff also took out various medical and life insurance policies for and on behalf of her son with AXA.It is further common ground that all subsequent claims by the Plaintiffâs son for compensation under his medical insurance policywith AXA were handled by the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  It is pertinent to note at this juncture that although it is common ground that the Plaintiff had consulted one Dr. Wu Kwong Sumfor vaginitis on 30<sup>th</sup> May 1998 and 15<sup>th</sup> July 1999, nothing was said about any of these consultations in either the application form submitted by the Plaintiff to AXA throughthe Defendant in August 2001 or in the Application Form here.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Meanwhile, sometime towards the end of June 2002, the Plaintiff was admitted to the Baptist Hospital for treatment of acute gastritis.The Plaintiff stayed in hospital for 3 days and incurred a total sum of $14,487 in medical expenses. Through the assistance of theDefendant, the Plaintiff was able to recover those medical expenses from AXA.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  However, the Plaintiff decided not to renew her medical insurance with AXA upon its expiry in 2003. The Plaintiff said this wasbecause her husband injured his back and incurred medical expenses of more than $200,000. And yet, he was only compensated for about$30,000 under his medical insurance with AXA. Her husband was very upset and told the Plaintiff not to renew her medical insurancepolicy with AXA.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  There is conflicting evidence on who initiated the idea for the Plaintiff to reapply for medical insurance with AXA in 2005. Bothparties agreed however that when the Plaintiff decided not to renew her medical insurance with AXA in 2003, the Defendant had alreadytold her that in future AXA would be more cautious and might even require her to undergo medical examination before accepting herapplication for medical insurance.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  With this background in mind, I shall look at the respective partyâs case in turn.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffâs case</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case is that at the time when the Application Form was filled out, she had clearly told the Defendant that shewas found to have uterine fibroid during her annual gynaecological check up. The Defendant then asked the Plaintiff if the doctorhad ever told her that the uterine fibroid was going to affect her health in future. The Plaintiff replied that the doctor had toldher not to worry because many females also had similar condition to hers. Furthermore, the uterine fibroid would eventually resolveand this was not going to affect her health in future. Upon hearing that, the Defendant then told the Plaintiff that she did nothave to mention this in the Application Form since this was not going to affect her health in future.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Plaintiff also disagreed with Miss Lingâs suggestion that the Defendant had asked and she had replied to each of the questionslisted in the Application Form. In re-examination, the Plaintiff further clarified that the Defendant had merely asked her aboutmajor illness and for this reason she did not mention to her anything about her consultations for vagnitis in 1998 and 1999 and cervicitisin 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Plaintiff was also cross-examined on the first draft of a letter of appeal to the Claims Department of AXA urging them to reconsiderthe Plaintiffâs claim for compensation. There is no dispute that this first draft was in the Defendantâs handwriting. But thenagain, the Plaintiff denied that it was written by the Defendant on the basis of information provided by her. In particular, thePlaintiff denied that it was she who mentioned in the first draft that she had forgotten about the incident relating to her uterinefibroid.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Plaintiffâs husband further testified that the Chinese words in the first draft to the effect that the Plaintiff had forgottenabout the incident relating to her uterine fibroid were deleted by him. And he said this was because the Plaintiff had already toldthe Defendant about this gynaecological problem when the Application Form was filled out in 2005.</p>    <p class="heading">The Defendantâs case</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The defence case is simply that the Plaintiff never told the Defendant that she had uterine fibroid in the past. The Defendant alsodenied having represented to the Plaintiff that there was no need to state in the Application Form any gynaecological problem thather doctor had said was not going to affect her health in future.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In her evidence in chief, the Defendant said that when the Plaintiff asked her in 2005 if it was possible for her to reapply formedical insurance with AXA, she had already told the Plaintiff that since the previous medical insurance was not renewed in 2003and the Plaintiff had claimed for compensation in the past, AXA might ask her to undergo medical examination or might even refuseto provide insurance coverage for certain kinds of illness.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Defendant also said in her evidence in chief that she had asked the Plaintiff each and every question listed in the ApplicationForm. When being cross-examined, the Defendant further said that she had specifically reminded the Plaintiff to disclose all pastillness. Or else, AXA might refuse to pay her compensation. Indeed, the Defendant went so far as to saying that even if the Plaintiffhad already recovered from fever or influenza, she still needed to disclose the same in the Application Form.</p>    <p class="heading">Evaluation of the evidence</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Having heard their evidence and observed their demeanour when testifying, I have no hesitation in believing the Plaintiff and herhusband but not the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It is the Defendantâs case that the Plaintiff asked her in 2005 if it was possible for her to take out medical insurance withAXA again. But if the Defendant had actually reminded the Plaintiff to disclose all past illness, be it a minor influenza or feverand regardless of whether she had recovered from such illness, I wonder why the Plaintiff would merely mention in the ApplicationForm her hospitalization for treatment of acute gastritis back in 2002 but not the more recent discovery of uterine fibroid.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In this connection, I place much weight on the Defendantâs evidence in court that it was the Plaintiff who volunteered the informationon her hospitalization in 2002. As I have said, the Defendantâs case is that she had already told the Plaintiff that AXA mightask her to undergo medical examination or might even refuse to provide medical insurance coverage for certain kinds of illness. Ifail to see why the Plaintiff had to be selective in making disclosure about her past illness.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  One possible explanation is that the Plaintiff had forgotten about the incident relating to her uterine fibroid. But if this wasthe case, I wonder why the Plaintiff and her husband would delete this convenient excuse from the first draft of the letter of appealto AXA. This is particularly true when the Defendantâs case, which I do not accept, is that the first draft was written by heron the basis of information provided by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I find that the Plaintiff had clearly told the Defendant that she was found to have uterine fibroid during her annual gynaecologicalcheckup. I also find that the Defendant had misrepresented to the Plaintiff that she needed not mention this in the Application Formsince this was not going to affect her health in future.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  There can be no doubt that what the Defendant had told the Plaintiff was false. It is also clear from her evidence in court thatthe Defendant knew or ought to have known that the representation was untrue. Mr. Fong rightly referred me to para. 18-19 of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts (19<sup>th</sup> ed.)</i> where the learned editors have this to say on the belief of the defendant and I quote:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>Absence of belief in truth; recklessness</i> <i>If the defendant knows his statement to be untrue he will be responsible for any loss suffered as a result. Little more need be saidon this point. However, liability goes further than this. Even if the party making the representation may have had no knowledge ofits falsehood, he will still be responsible if he had  no belief in its truth and made it, ânot caring whether it was true or falseââ¦</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  As the Defendant said in her evidence in chief, as an insurance agent, every time when she interviewed a client, she needed to askthe client her health condition. If she induced a client to take out medical insurance without so doing, she would be facing a direconsequence. In my view, this clearly shows that even if the Defendant did not know what she had told the Plaintiff was untrue, shewould still be responsible for making the representation without caring whether it was true or false.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Given the fact that the Defendant had been acting as insurance agent for the Plaintiff since 2001 and the Plaintiff and her sonrelied heavily on the Defendant in handling their insurance matters, I have no hesitation in finding that the Defendant intendedthe Plaintiff to act in reliance of the false representation.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Inasmuch as the Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage as a result of AXAâs refusal to reimburse her medical expenses on groundof non-disclosure, I am satisfied on the evidence that the Defendant is liable to compensate the Plaintiff under the tort of deceit.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Miss Ling raises the point that AXA rescinded the medical insurance policy not only because of the Plaintiffâs non-disclosureof the incident relating to her uterine fibroid but also of her other gynaecological problems back in 1998, 1999 and 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  With respect, this argument is misconceived. As the learned editors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (op. cit.) aptly pointed out at footnote 33 on p. [1097]:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<i>The correct criterion is whether the claimant would have acted as he did had the representation not been made. If he would not, thencausation is made outâ¦</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Translating the legal principle into the facts of this case, the Plaintiff was given to understand by the Defendant that she needednot mention in the Application Form the uterine fibroid since this was not going to affect her health in future. It would only bereasonable for the Plaintiff to think that there was also no need to mention her gynaecological problems in 1998, 1999 and 2003 sincenone of them was going to affect her health in future. In any case, the Plaintiffâs evidence in re-examination, which I accept,was that the Defendant only asked her about major illness.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum of damages</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  It is clear from reading the terms and conditions of the medical insurance policy with AXA that the Plaintiff is entitled to reimbursementof expenses incurred everyday during hospitalization. It is equally clear from reading the receipt issued by Baptist Hospital thatspecialist doctorâs diagnosis fee was charged on a daily basis. Subject to my decision on these two points, the following itemsof claim have been agreed by the parties:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse;
