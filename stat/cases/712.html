The 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent was at one time the tenant of the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent in an industrial building operating a printing workshop in the flat so rented. The Applicant is the owner of the flatdirectly below the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondentâs workshop. From about March 2002, a dark brownish oil was found seeping through the ceiling of the Applicantâs unitat various spots.  On some occasions the oil even dripped on to the floor as well. The Applicant contends that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent caused this oil seepage. It is alleged that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent allowed lubricating oil to flow from  its printing machines or equipment to get to the floor of the workshop and thatthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent should be liable to compensate the Applicant for its loss and damage. </p>    <p class="HEADING">Causes of Action, Jurisdiction, Application for determination of Preliminary Points</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  At the commencement of the trial, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent applied to have preliminary points determined and which application I refused. Not only that it is a very late applicationbut that there has been ample opportunity for such application to be made. There have been a number of call-over hearings in whichdirections along the line of High Court Practice were made for the preparation of the trial. If preliminary points should be determined,application should have been made in one of these call-over hearings and as soon as possible.  No explanation has been given whythe application should be made when both parties are ready to commence trial, a short trial. The case could not have been disposedof expeditiously, or costs could have been saved, by entertaining the application. On the contrary, the case could have been draggedon for a long time and greater costs are likely to be incurred.  The application is therefore refused.  The preliminary points oflaw raised are now being pursued by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent in its final submission.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent contends that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction in this claim. Two points of objection are raised. Firstly, this Tribunalhas no jurisdiction to determine claims based on tort. Secondly the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent is not bound by the deed of mutual covenant of the building generally and particularly, the tenancy has terminated andthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent has vacated the flat.  Ms Yeung, counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent, argues that in either case the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Applicant has clarified its position with regard to the cause of action.  The Applicant based its claim on one ground only,namely, breach of a covenant contained in the deed of mutual covenant.  In particular, its counsel, Ms Saing, unequivocally statesthat the present claim is for damages only and is not based on tort for nuisance.  That being the position of the Applicant, thefirst point of objection becomes irrelevant. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  An owner of a building is certainly by bound by the deed of mutual covenant. Section 41(3) of<b><i>the Conveyance and Property Ordinance</i></b>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219">Cap219</a>, extends its binding effect so that a covenant therein, other than a positive covenant, can be enforced against a tenantoccupier.  The Applicant alleged that 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent was in breach of the covenant in clause 10(c) of the deed of mutual covenant. This covenant is not of positive nature. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent was therefore bound by the covenant during the currency of tenancy or before he has vacated the premises.  Terminationof its tenancy and vacating his premises neither alone or together operate by any known legal principle to absolve its liabilityunder the deed of mutual covenant for breach committed while it was the tenant occupier.  The Applicant is not suing for an injunctionorder or damages in lieu.  The Applicant is suing for damages and loss as caused by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondentâs breach committed during its term of tenancy.  This Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with breaches of the deed ofmutual covenants. The Applicant as an owner is entitled to initiate proceedings in this Tribunal.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Ms Yeung has other points of argument which, without disrespect, I do not think I need to address.  In my judgment the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent is bound by the covenant stipulated in clause 10(c) of the deed of mutual covenant and it is within the jurisdiction ofthis Tribunal to determine the claim so framed by the Applicant.</p>    <p class="HEADING">Evidence&amp; Finding on facts &amp; Liability</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  There are two expert witnesses, one from each party. The other witness is Mr. Kong, giving evidence on behalf of  his employer,the Applicant.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Early in the year of 2002, Mr. Kong discovered oil seepage in the ceiling of the Applicantâs flat. Apparently he took no heedof it until May 2002, when the problem had shown no sign of improvement and was getting worse instead, and he made a complaint tothe management office of the building. There upon he visited the Respondentâs workshop, accompanied by the staff of the managementoffice. He was received by a person, apparent in charge of the operation and maintenance of a large printing machine.  That machinewas right in the position above the spot on the ceiling where oil seepage occurred. On the floor there was black machine oil allover. The man explained to Mr. Kong that the oil flowed from the machine when printing was in operation. The man promised him thathe would clean up the oil flowing out during the printing process and guaranteed that the seepage problem would be stopped. Despitethe promise and guarantee given by the man, the problem did not go away and was getting worse during the following months.  On 20May 2003, Mr. Kong made a second visit to the workshop, about 12 months after the first, again accompanied by the staff of the managementoffice. This time he could not get in touch with any person who would speak for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent. He then left leaving a message for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent to contact the Applicant. However no one from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent responded to the message to contact him or the Applicant until about 9 July 2003, three days after the Applicantâs solicitorswrote a complaint and warning letter to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent, when one Ms Tang rang to say she understood the problem and that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent would vacate the flat soon.  The problem persisted and the solicitors wrote another letter in the latter half of August. Eventually in October, Mr. Kong made another visit, the third one, to the flat and discovered that it was vacant. Through the doorhe saw its floor blackened in a large area.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The above account of evidence is not a just a summary of what Mr. Kong said in evidence, but practically a recounting of every detailsof his evidence.  Although his evidence lacks particularity, it is supplemented by photographs and the visual observation of thetwo expert witnesses of the condition of the Applicantâs flat. One may also be so amazed by the exceptional tolerance on the partof the Applicant that it may lead to doubts whether part of condition of the Applicantâs flat had been pre-existing for quite sometime before Mr. Kong first discovered the oil seepage in 2002.  However some people do have exceptional level of tolerance in orderto maintain a good neighbour relationship. Further Mr. Kong is only an employee and he might not have had the same motivation ashis employer to have the problem rectified promptly.  Ms Yeung is also very fair in not challenging his veracity.  Looking at thetotality of evidence I accept his evidence and find him a truthful witness.  Furthermore I find that oil seepages as seen and describedby Mr. Kong originated from the lubricating oil spilling to the floor of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondentâs workshop from its printing machine while in operation.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The building is over 20 years old. There is no evidence as to the state and condition of the waterproofing work in the slab formingthe ceiling/floor between the flats of the Applicant and the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent.  The building is an industrial building. Operating a printing workshop in the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondentâs flat is within its normal use.   Oil spilling from the printing machine is nothing unusual.   The activities the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent was carrying on were lawful, activities the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent was entitled to carry on. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent is therefore not liable for the damage that occurred before Mr. Kongâs first visit.  As from then on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent cannot be so excused as it has been made aware of the problem and is liable to compensate the loss of the Applicant causedby continuing to allow oil to get to floor of the workshop.</p>    <p class="HEADING">Evidence-expert-quantum</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  No argument has been raised as to what proprietary right, or as to its extent, that the Applicant has in relation to the ceiling/floorconcrete slab between the two flats, one above the other. This concrete slab should be part of the structure of the building. Theclaim of the Applicant could have been framed in different ways.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent apparently has also injured the structure of the building and has thereby been in breach of clause 10(a). To base theclaim on clause 10(a) is not without difficulty. It is the right of the Applicant to choose how to frame its claim in its best interestor to its greatest advantage, with a view to save costs or for some other reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Applicant has chosen to frame its claim in the present form and it is not without its advantage.  It is simple. The Applicantis entitled not to have its enjoyment of property interfered or inconvenienced. The loss it suffered is, as contended by Ms Saing,represented by the cost of repair. Whether or not compensation awarded would be spent on the repair is irrelevant.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The respective repair projects prescribed by the two experts differ widely.  This is basically due to their difference in opinionas to the quality of the concrete.  Mr. Cheng for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent is of the view that the quality of the concrete is not affected. Despite the fact that the total blackened area of theceiling was very large, oil only seeped through a few small areas.   He explains that when oil seeps through and reaches the surfaceof the ceiling it would spread sideways to other parts of the ceiling surface causing the blackening in time. He reached his conclusionusing the infra-red scanning method to identify the seeping through areas. Tests on the concrete samples taken on trouble spots wereperformed. I accept that these are objective tests to ascertain the strength of concrete.  Most of the oil stained area in the ceilingonly has its surface affected.  The remedial work he recommended is therefore of decorative nature.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Lee, the Applicantâs expert, is of the view that the quality of concrete is affected. He recommended extensive structuralrepairs requiring to bore holes right up and through the floor of the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondentâs flat above. He confirms that should his project go ahead, it would require the cooperation of the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent.  When he came to his view that the quality of the concrete is affected, he relies heavily on the presence of fatty acids. In cross-examination, he conceded that process of attack is slow taking some 8 to 10 years. He did not know whether dry fatty acidswould attack concrete.  His logic is simply that once oil is dripping from the part of the ceiling, the concrete of that part needsto be re-cast.  He did not have the concrete samples tested for pH value or chlorides. He discounts the reliability of the tests.As in his undated second report, he disagrees with every tests and every findings on the quality of concrete reached by the otherexpert Mr. Cheng.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Of the two expertsâ evidence, I preferred that of Mr. Cheng. He explains his findings coherently and has relied on objective testsas well as visual inspection. In discounting the pH value tests, Mr. Lee does not give a convincing reason. He agrees that pH valuecan measure the extent of attack of acid on the concrete. Yet he did not perform the test. As to the chlorides test, he thinks itis not useful because the original value is not known.  He entirely misses the point of Mr. Cheng who is giving opinion on the qualityof the concrete as it is, not by what extent it has been affected. As to other tests and methods employed by Mr. Lee, he discountedthem merely by citing their short- comings. Of course, every test, no matter how good it is, there must be short-comings or limitsbut these are not reasons for not using them. Mr. Lee does not suggest what better tests should be done, nor has he performed anysuch tests. When he took samples of concrete for tests. One sample does not produce the expected result.  He explained that the workertaking the sample must have contaminated it. However the sample must have been taken under his supervision and he offers no elaborationon how contamination could have happened.  He places emphasis on the presence of fatty acids in reaching his conclusion. In the courseof his argument he cited a passage in a text book in Appendix 8 in support. On closer reading of the text book, the passage relatesto the time of casting the concrete, and precautions that should be taken at the time, i.e. when the concrete is still wet. Bondingbetween steel and concrete only sets in when the concrete dries.  He admits this. It is a different situation that we are dealingwith. The bonding has already set in and we are concerned about how a bonding already set in would be weakened. All these tend toshow that Mr. Lee is too anxious to defend his  opinion and runs into the error of being too critical of his counter-part withoutany justification. For all these reasons, I prefer the opinion of Mr. Cheng.</p>    <p class="HEADING">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Applicant has settled the claim with 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent for $10,000.  The claim against 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent is not exactly the same as that against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent. The amount claimed against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent is the repair costs which does not take into account other losses, say, inconvenience during the whole year and beforethe 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent is made aware of the problem.  Therefore it should only be fair that this $10,000 should not be set off from the awardwhich I now make, namely, $50,000 as estimated by Mr. Cheng.  I will not make the usual order nisi for costs as parties have indicatedthey wish to be heard on costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(H.
