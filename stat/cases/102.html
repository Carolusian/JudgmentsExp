Briefly, his case is that he was sent by the Defendant to China to see tothe delivery of certain goods by the Defendant's supplier to the Defendant. He signed a guarantee to procure the release of the goodsby the supplier. The Defendant did not pay the supplier. The Plaintiff was therefore detained. Two sums were paid to secure his release:US$5,000.00 and RMB80,000.00. The Defendant is liable to pay him these two sums. It would be convenient to refer to the Plaintiff'sclaims for these two sums as his claims for special damages. The Plaintiff also claims for general damages to be assessed for themental distress and anxiety he suffered when he was detained in China. He has not specified an amount.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The Defendant denies that it had asked or authorised the Plaintiff to sign any guarantee and does not admit that the Plaintiff wasdetained in China. The Defendant has a counterclaim against the Plaintiff. It is the Defendant's pleaded case that it had providedthe Plaintiff and one Mr. Leung Kwan Pak (PW2) who were both at the time under the Defendant's employ with the sums of $1,000.00and RMB18,000.00 as travelling expenses. The Plaintiff has failed to account for these two sums of money. The Defendant is the beneficialowner of these two sums of money. The Defendant claims for a declaration that these two sums of money are held by the Plaintiff onresulting trust for the Defendant, an account, as well as repayment by the Plaintiff on the basis of money had and received.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiff denies that the Defendant has ever paid him the two sums of money.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Issue on Jurisdiction</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The District Court has no jurisdiction to try any claim which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal or theSmall Claims Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The Defendant raised the challenge about jurisdiction at trial instead of doing it as it should, prior to the trial in its pleadings.I allowed the objection to be raised.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> At an early stage of the trial, the issues about jurisdiction were framed. The views and stances of the parties were sought for andclarified in the process.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In relation to the Plaintiff's claims for special damages in the sums of US$5,000.00 and RMB80,000.00, the following issues wereframed: <i>"(1) That the Plaintiff's claim is not a claim for a sum of money which arises from the breach of a term in the contract of employmentbetween the Plaintiff and the Defendant as it is a claim for a sum of money which arises from the fact that the Plaintiff was actingas the Defendant's Agent at the material time such that the duties said to be owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff under paragraph3 of the Statement of Claim were duties owed by the Defendant in its capacity as the Principal of the Plaintiff instead of in itscapacity as the Employer of the Plaintiff, and hence the claim is not within Paragraph 1(a) of the Schedule to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a>; and</i><i> </i><i>(2)</i><i> </i><i>That the Plaintiff's claim is founded in tort. Notwithstanding the contract of employment between the Plaintiff and the Defendant,the Defendant owed an independent duty of care in tort as set out in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim. The Defendant was inbreach of that duty of care and the Plaintiff had suffered consequential loss and damage in the payment of the above two sums.</i><i>"</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> In relation to the Plaintiff's claim for general damages to be assessed for the mental distress and anxiety he suffered when he wasdetained in China, the following issue was framed: <i>"(3) That the Plaintiff's claim is founded in tort. Notwithstanding the contract of employment between the Plaintiff and the Defendant,the Defendant owed an independent duty of care in tort as set out in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim."</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Counsel for the Plaintiff has confirmed that the Plaintiff's claims for special damages in the sums of US$5,000.00 and RMB80,000.00are not restitutionary claims. I would focus on these two claims for the time being and come back to his claim for general damageslater.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Schedule to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> sets out the claims which fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Paragraph 1(a) of the above Schedule is apposite. A claim for a sum of money which arises from the breach of a term, whether expressor implied, of a contract of employment is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal if the employment is to be performedin Hong Kong. It is clear that the Plaintiff performed some of his duties in Hong Kong and this is reckoned as performance in HongKong: William Barry Preen v. Industries Polytex Ltd., Labour Tribunal Appeal No. 171 of 1995, 8 March 1996 considered and applied.So, does the Plaintiff's claim fall within the above Paragraph 1(a)?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> It is of course the Plaintiff's position that his claims for special damages in the sums of US$5,000.00 and RMB80,000.00 are notwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal. From the framed issues, the claims are outside Paragraph 1(a) of the aboveSchedule and not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> It is not absolutely clear if Counsel for the Defence has disputed that the state of the pleadings does not permit the framing ofthe above issues in the manner they were framed. I consider that he did. I would not accept such objection to be valid. The challengeon jurisdictional ground was made at the eleventh hour. Any amendment of the pleadings would result in delays and possibly an adjournment.Issues were thus framed. The parties were involved in the issue framing process. The framed issues were of course live issues inthe trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim is in the following terms: <i>"It was an implied term of the said Employment and/or duty at common law between the Plaintiff and the Defendant that the Defendantas an employer owed to the Plaintiff a duty to indemnify or reimburse the Plaintiff against all expenses, losses and liabilitiesincurred by the Plaintiff in the execution of the Defendant's instructions, or within the authority granted to the Plaintiff by theDefendant or during the reasonable performance of the Plaintiff's employment."</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim has in fact pleaded a number of matters capable of different permutations:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="16">(1)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="16">It was an implied term of the said Employment and/or </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="19">(2)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" height="19">duty at common law </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">that the Defendant <u>as an employer</u> (emphasis my own) owed to the Plaintiff a duty to indemnify or reimburse the Plaintiff against all expenses, losses and liabilitiesincurred by the Plaintiff</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">in the execution of the Defendant's instructions, or </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">within the authority granted to the Plaintiff by the Defendant or </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="89%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">during the reasonable performance of the Plaintiff's employment. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Paragraph 3 refers to the Defendant as <i>"an employer"</i>. The expression is capable of denoting the engagement of an agent by a principal. It is not uncommon to refer to a construction companybeing employed by a real estate developer to erect a building. It is not uncommon to describe the former as the employer of the lattereven though obviously the contract is a contract for service and not a contract of service.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Defendant has sought further and better particulars of Paragraph 3. The Requests were: <i>"1. State all the material facts upon the basis of which the implied term is alleged to arise"</i> and <i>"2. State all the material facts upon the basis of which the duty at common law is alleged to arise".</i> The Plaintiff furnished the following Answers: <i>"1. The Plaintiff was at all material times an employee of the Defendant and the term was implied by operation of law"</i> and <i>"2. See Answer to 1 above".</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> In a contract of employment (i.e. a contract of service), there may also be an incidence of agency. Employment may give rise to anagency relationship. Some employees have agency powers, some not.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In the present case, it is pleaded that the Defendant had employed the Plaintiff as its merchandiser. A merchandiser will at timesact as the agent of his principal (the employer).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Even if it were to be accepted that the Plaintiff has pleaded that there was a contract of employment between the Plaintiff and theDefendant, it should not preclude the Court from finding that there was a breach of the duties owed by the Defendant towards thePlaintiff in their respective capacities as principal and agent in relation to each other: Chesworth v. Farrar &amp; Another,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%201%20QB%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 1 QB 407</a> considered and applied.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> That however is not the end of the matter. Once found to be outside the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal, the Plaintiff'sclaim for US$5,000.00 falls squarely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal. I consider that I have no jurisdictionto try that claim. I take the view that the Plaintiff's claims for US$5,000.00 and RMB80,000.00 are two separate claims, not one.They were so pleaded in the body of the Statement of Claim and prayed for as individual items of relief. I consider that I may derivesupport for my view from Estinah v. Golden Hand Indonesian Employment Agency, HCSA 6/2001, 21 August 2001 in which Hon. Kwan J. said<i>"A "claim" is not the same thing as a "cause of action", the latter denotes the factual or legal basis out of which a claim arose."</i> Although <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a> provides that <i>"a claim within the jurisdiction of the tribunal may be brought in another court if there is included in such claim a claim for someother relief, redress or remedy, other than a claim for costs",</i> I do not consider that this proviso assists the Plaintiff. There is no other claim for some other relief etc. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The Plaintiff's claim for RMB80,000.00 exceeds the jurisdiction ceiling of the Small Claims Tribunal and is within the jurisdictionof the District Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> I would now turn to the Plaintiff's claim for general damages. Paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim is relevant here. It reads asfollows: <i>"It was also an implied term of the said Employment and/or a duty at common law that the Defendant as an employer owed to the Plaintiffas an employee a duty to take necessary steps and use its best endeavours in restoring freedom of movement of the Plaintiff".</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The Defendant has sought further and better particulars of Paragraph 4 and the Plaintiff has provided his Answers. All in all, thePlaintiff's pleaded case is that the duty at common law arose from the employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> An employer may owe a duty of care towards an employee under the contract of employment or in tort. The Plaintiff's position is thatthe claim is grounded in tort. A claim in tort is outside the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal. But, whether or notthe claim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal will depend on whether it is within the $50,000.00jurisdiction ceiling of the Small Claims Tribunal. Although the Plaintiff has not pleaded the amount, the fact that this claim wasbrought to the District Court and maintained during the trial in the face of jurisdictional challenges is tantamount to an assertionthat the amount is above $50,000. I consider that it is open to me to frame the issue for this claim as well as to try this claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> If I have understood Counsel for the Defendant correctly, the Defendant has not contended that the Plaintiff's claim for generaldamages is outside the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> As for the Defendant's counterclaim, the claim for repayment on the basis of money had and received is within the exclusive jurisdictionof the Small Claims Tribunal. The claims for a declaration and an account are not. Accordingly, by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, supra, the counterclaim may be brought in the District Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Witnesses</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The Plaintiff himself testified as PW1. He called the former employee of the Defendant Mr. Leung Kwan Pak as PW2. On the Defendant'sside, only the Defendant's director Madam Fong Sai Quen testified as DW1.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>The Plaintiff's evidence</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In Court, the Plaintiff told his story as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The Plaintiff was employed by the Defendant as its merchandiser with a monthly salary of $15,000.00 per month and he started workon 24 June 2005. DW1 gave the Plaintiff some documents and told him to follow up on the dealings between the Defendant and one ShenzhenRongjian Technology Development Co. Ltd. ("Rongjian"). The documents included a Purchase Order No. PO26/05 dated 26 April 2005 forkid's jeans placed by the Defendant on Rongjian (see page 108 of the Trial Bundle, hereafter "TB108", mutatis mutandis) and a PurchaseOrder No. PO28/05 dated 3 May 2005 for man's jackets (see TB109). There was a dispute between the Defendant and Rongjian on thesetwo deals at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> On 11 July 2005, Mr. Peter Wong ("Peter Wong"), the husband of DW1, gave the Plaintiff a memo telling him to speak to one Mr. WangMing Ding ("Wang") in relation to the two deals. That afternoon the Plaintiff went to Shenzhen and met Wang. A discussion was held.The Plaintiff spent the night at Shenzhen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> On 12 July 2005, the Plaintiff returned to Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> On 13 July 2005, one Mr. Wan ("Wan") who acted as the representative of Wang in Hong Kong called the Defendant. The Plaintiff spoketo Wan. Wan agreed to provide compensation in the sum of RMB150,000.00 to the Defendant in relation to the two deals in two stages.At the 1st stage, the Defendant would be given a deduction in the price of the goods under the two deals for about RMB70,000.00 toRMB80,000.00. The remaining portion of the compensation (RMB80,000.00 or RMB70,000.00, as the case may be) would be applied towardsdeduction of the price of goods to be ordered by the Defendant in future.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> After the telephone conversation, the Plaintiff on behalf of the Defendant issued a fax (see TB110) to Wan in confirmation of thatunderstanding.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> On 15 July 2005, DW1 instructed the Plaintiff and PW2 to go to Shenzhen to check the goods. They duly carried out their instructions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> On 16 July 2005 at about 8:30 am, the Plaintiff and PW2 arrived at the warehouse in Shenzhen where the goods were stored. Wang wasthere but he refused to release the goods. Wang said that as the Defendant had not yet provided him with a cashier order for theprice, the goods would not be released.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The Plaintiff then received a fax from the Defendant which showed two cashier orders: one was for US$13,249.10 which he understoodto be for the payment of the price of the goods under Purchase Order No. 26/05 and the other one was for US$91,781.45 which he understoodto be for the payment of the price of the goods under Purchase Order No. 28/05.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> As the actual cashier orders did not come into the hands of Wang, Wang did not give his permission for the release of the goods thatday.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> On 17 July 2005, Peter Wong called the Plaintiff and was informed of the situation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> On 18 July 2005, the Plaintiff met Wang for a discussion over dinner in Shenzhen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> On 19 July 2005, the Plaintiff met Wang again to process the documents necessary for the export of the goods to Hong Kong. The Plaintiffobserved the process of the loading of the goods onto a container truck for delivery to Hong Kong. He reported to DW1 that the 1sttruck was loaded only with kid's jeans whereas the man's jackets were still awaiting to be loaded onto a 2nd container truck.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> At about 12:30 pm that day, the 1st truck with the load of goods arrived at Man Kam To in Shenzhen in readiness to cross the borderfor delivery of the goods to Hong Kong. The Plaintiff and PW2 went to a hotel to have their meal. He faxed the packing list of thegoods loaded onto the 1st truck to the Defendant (see TB134-5). The packing list showed the goods to be kid's jeans.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> At about 3 pm that day, Peter Wong called the Plaintiff and asked him to procure a deduction in the price of the goods loaded ontothe 1st truck. The original price of the goods (which comprised part of the goods under the two deals) was about US$51,000.00. Asthere was a prior agreement with Wan that there would be a deduction in price of about RMB70,000.00 to 80,000.00 for the goods underthe two deals, Wang agreed to reduce the price of the goods loaded onto the 1st truck to US$41,875.40. The Plaintiff informed PeterWong of the result over the telephone and the Defendant accordingly prepared a cashier order in that amount (see TB136).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Wang sent Wan to the Defendant's office in Hong Kong to collect the cashier order. The secretary of the Defendant called the Plaintiffand told him that both DW1 and Peter Wong were not in the office.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The Plaintiff called DW1 at about 4 pm on 19 July 2005 (later on he said that it was on 20 July 2005) and DW1 told the Plaintiffthat she was at Tsimshatsui to get the cashier order prepared. At about 5 pm that day, the Plaintiff received a faxed copy of thecashier order for US$41,875.40 at his hotel. The Plaintiff understood that Wang had not given permission for the 1st truck with theloaded goods to cross the border as Wang still had not received the cashier order. The Plaintiff called DW1 and the latter told himthat she would send someone to deliver the cashier order to Shenzhen the following day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The Plaintiff gave evidence that on 20 July 2005 at about 6 pm, he and PW2 took a taxi to Man Kam To at Shenzhen where the 1st truckloaded with the goods was stationed. Wang was there. Wang would not give permission for the 1st truck with the load of goods to crossthe border as he still had not received the cashier order. Then Wang wrote out the guarantee (see TB137). The guarantee providedfor inter alia the Plaintiff's assumption of personal legal liability towards Wang for the payment of the price of the goods loadedonto the 1st truck, in the sum of US$41,875.40. The Plaintiff signed and dated the guarantee and wrote down his Home Visit Permitnumber thereon. Upon seeing that, Wang gave permission for the 1st truck with the loaded goods to cross the border to Hong Kong.Up to this stage of his testimony, the Plaintiff had not yet mentioned any telephone conversation with DW1 prior to his signing ofthe guarantee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The Plaintiff in his testimony later said that on 20 July 2005, he had a telephone conversation with DW1 while he was at Man KamTo. It was about 6 pm then. DW1 over the telephone assured the Plaintiff that she would send someone to deliver the cashier orderto Shenzhen the following day. After the telephone conversation, the Plaintiff signed the guarantee at TB137. Up to this stage ofhis testimony, the Plaintiff had not yet mentioned his having read the contents of the guarantee to DW1 over the telephone beforehe signed it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The Plaintiff in his evidence later said that he had read the contents of the guarantee at TB137 to DW1 over the telephone. DW1 toldthe Plaintiff that it was all right and that the Plaintiff should sign it. He therefore signed it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> On 21 July 2005, the Plaintiff called Peter Wong at about 8 am and asked when the cashier order would be delivered. Peter Wong saidthat he would let DW1 handle the matter. Wang and a group of men waited at the hotel where the Plaintiff and PW2 stayed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> After lunch time that day, a staff of Wang handed to Wang a fax from the Defendant (see TB141). In the fax, the Defendant indicatedits refusal to take delivery of the goods and asked Wang to take the goods back.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The Lo Wu Public Security Bureau was by the side of the hotel where the Plaintiff stayed. Wang and his group of men together withthe Plaintiff and PW2 went to the Lo Wu Public Security Bureau that evening. At the Lo Wu Public Security Bureau, the Plaintiff telephonedDW1 and the latter said that she would send one Mr. Chau Bing to bring them back to Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The Plaintiff said that before Chau Bing came, he wrote a 3 pages document to tell the Hong Kong Police about their detention inthe hotel. Also, while at the hotel, the Plaintiff called the Tsimshatsui police station to alert them of the situation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> While at the Lo Wu Public Security Bureau, the officers there said that it was an economic dispute and advised them to resolve thematter through discussion. Wang and his group of men together with the Plaintiff and PW2 then went back to the hotel to wait forChau Bing. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> That evening Chau Bing came and had a discussion with Wang which did not bear any fruit. Then Chau Bing left.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> The men brought by Wang slept inside the Plaintiff's hotel room that night.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The next day on 22 July 2005, the Defendant sent one Mr. Lam Ping to the hotel who also had a discussion with Wang over the issue.Lam Ping in the end told the Plaintiff that the Defendant would not take delivery of the goods and the Plaintiff and PW2 had to farefor themselves.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> That evening, the Plaintiff called the Hong Kong Police for the second time. The call was made through the Immigration Department.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Then the Nan Hu Public Security Outpost sent people to take the entire group of people to their office for enquiries. The Plaintiffwas given to understand that the Hong Kong Police had referred the matter to the Nan Hu authorities. The Nan Hu officers took awaythe Home Visit Permits and identity cards of the Plaintiff and PW2. At about 11 pm, the person in charge of the Nan Hu authoritiestold the Plaintiff that it was an economic dispute and the matter would be referred to the Investigation Team of the Economic Unitof the Lo Wu Public Security Bureau for follow up.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> As the office of the Investigation Team did not start work until 9 am the next day, the Plaintiff spent the night at the Nan Hu PublicSecurity Outpost.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The next day the entire group of people were taken to the office of the Economic Unit of the Lo Wu Public Security Bureau but wereinformed that they were engaged in other work and would not be free to take up the matter until 9 am on 25 July 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> From 23 July 2005 onward the Plaintiff stayed at one Hing On Hotel. On 25 July 2005, the Plaintiff went to the Economic Unit of theLo Wu Public Security Bureau to give a statement. The process was completed at about 4 pm. The officers of the Lo Wu Public SecurityBureau Economic Unit said that they would have to obtain some information from the Hong Kong Police.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> From 25 July to 26 July 2007, the Plaintiff stayed at the hotel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> On 27 July 2005, the Plaintiff and PW2 went to the Economic Unit of the Lo Wu Public Security Bureau. They asked if they would becharged with any offence. They were told that there was no criminal element in the matter. They asked when their travel and identitydocuments would be released to them. Eventually they got their documents back.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Then at that moment, 10 odd people surrounded them trying to take them to a van. The Plaintiff and PW2 called out for help and thePublic Security officers came. They were all taken to the Dong Men Public Security Outpost where the matter was taken up by the CivilCase Mediation Centre. The Plaintiff again gave his statement there and had his finger prints taken. The person in charge at theMediation Centre suggested that the Plaintiff and PW2 should raise the sums for the goods to secure their release.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> That evening the Plaintiff and PW2 returned to the hotel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> On 30 July 2005, the wife of PW2 managed to raise the sum of $40,000.00 and the elder brother of the Plaintiff managed to raise thesum of US$5,000.00. The payments were made at the Mediation Centre. Then PW2 was allowed to return to Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> On about 16 August 2005, the elder brother of the Plaintiff raised another $80,000.00 and the Plaintiff was allowed to return toHong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> The Plaintiff said that from 27 July to 16 August 2005 he could not return to Hong Kong as the Mediation Centre had detained histravelling documents.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> According to the Plaintiff, the 3 pages letter at TB278-280 was the first written account of the matter he produced. He said thathe could not remember whether he prepared the document while he was at the hotel or he was at the Lo Wu Public Security Bureau. The3 pages letter was dated 22 July 2005, not 21 July 2005. On the face of it, it purported to be a letter by the Plaintiff and PW2addressed to the Commissioner of Police in Hong Kong. The contents spoke of an event that took place on 20 July 2005 at about 5 pm,and that was that upon receiving the Defendant's fax of the cashier order, the Plaintiff and PW2 <u>both</u> signed a guarantee in favour of Wang. The contents of the guarantee provided that the two of them had on behalf of the Defendantguaranteed the delivery of the cashier order to Shenzhen the next morning. Both of them would take the cashier order to Wang andexchange it for the guarantee that they had signed the day before, on 20 July 2005. The guarantee was referred to in the documentas annex 3.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> The guarantee so described in the 3 pages letter does not tally with the guarantee presented before the Court. The guarantee presentedbefore the Court at TB137 contains no stipulation for the delivery of the cashier order to Shenzhen in the morning of 21 July 2005nor for the exchange of the cashier order for the guarantee. The Plaintiff confirmed that Wang had provided him with a copy of theguarantee that he had signed on 20 July 2005 when he had dinner with Wang that evening. He said, however, that he was not sure ifhe had the guarantee with him when he wrote the 3 pages letter to the Commissioner of Police of Hong Kong. He said that he placedthe guarantee inside his bag in the hotel room. As he might have written the 3 pages letter while he was at the office of the LoWu Public Security Bureau, he might not have the guarantee before him when he wrote the 3 pages letter. The Plaintiff however rememberedthat he had written the 3 pages letter in a hurry, spending only about 30 minutes on it. He had it written in a hurry because hewas told by the Public Security officers that he might have to be detained in a Detention Centre. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The terms of the guarantee as described in the 3 pages letter are different from the guarantee before the Court. The Plaintiff saidthat there was only one guarantee, not two.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> The 3 pages letter were addressed to the Commissioner of Police. The Plaintiff was asked what he had intended to do with the 3 pagesletter and he said he intended to give it to Wang. Then he said that the Public Security officers after having read his 3 pages letterhad it handed to Wang. When asked if he knew why the Public Security officers did that, the Plaintiff said that if he were detainedby the Public Security authorities, then they would send the letter to the Hong Kong Police on his behalf. As he was not so detained,after writing up the 3 pages letter, he gave it to Wang.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> The 3 pages letter said that the Plaintiff and PW2 had signed the guarantee upon receiving the fax copy of the cashier order. Therewas no mention of any telephone conversation with DW1 or her authorising the giving of the guarantee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> The Plaintiff said that when he eventually returned to Hong Kong, he had with him a copy of the guarantee but not the 3 pages letter.On 17 August 2005, the Plaintiff gave a statement to the Hong Kong Police (see TB149-153). The statement given to the Hong Kong Policemade no mention of the Plaintiff's having read the contents of the guarantee to DW1 nor did it say that DW1 had told the Plaintiffto sign any specific guarantee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Rather, the witness statement to the Police said that DW1 had asked the Plaintiff to sign whatever document was required. In Court,however, the Plaintiff said that apart from the specific instructions given by DW1 to sign the guarantee (the contents of which hehad already read out to DW1 over the telephone prior to the signing), DW1 had not given the Plaintiff other instructions to signanything in general.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> The Plaintiff had prepared a witness statement for this trial at TB65-91. The witness statement said that DW1 had instructed thePlaintiff to sign all documents which Wang required him to sign to ensure the export of the goods to Hong Kong without delay. However,there was no mention of the Plaintiff having over the telephone read the contents of the guarantee to DW1 and obtained her specificinstructions to sign that specific guarantee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> At the time when according to the Plaintiff he signed the guarantee, he had been working for the Defendant for less than a month.The Plaintiff's evidence is that he was well experienced in China trade.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>PW2</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> The evidence of PW2 is short. He was the Defendant's former employee who went to Shenzhen together with the Plaintiff. He adoptedthe contents of his witness statement as his examination in chief. His witness statement confirmed the Plaintiff's story. Among otherthings, PW2 said that the Plaintiff had told him that DW1 had given the Plaintiff instructions to sign the guarantee in order toprocure Wang to send the 1st truck to cross the border to deliver the goods to Hong Kong. Under cross examination, he said that on21 July 2005, the matter had not yet been referred to the Public Security Bureau. He said that it was when he and the Plaintiff werehaving dinner on 22 July 2005 that the Public Security Bureau came to them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>DW1</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> There was no objection to DW1's adoption of her witness statement as her evidence in chief and I had granted such leave.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> She was the Director of the Defendant company which had been carrying on the business of garment trading for about 15 years sinceits incorporation. Her husband Peter Wong is also well experienced in the garment trade. Peter Wong also managed the business ofthe Defendant. The Defendant's business was to secure goods from suppliers in China to meet orders placed by its own overseas buyers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The Plaintiff had claimed that he had extensive experience in China trade and had been working as a merchandising manager for a mainlandcompany. DW1 heard of this from her husband Peter Wong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> In early 2005, DW1 came to know Wang and Wan. Wang nominated Rongjian to trade with the Defendant. The Defendant did place the twoPurchase Orders No. PO26/05 and PO28/05 with Rongjian. Rongjian delayed in making delivery of the goods to the Defendant and theDefendant had demanded for compensation (on account of the necessity to air freight the goods to its overseas buyer) in late June2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> The Plaintiff suggested to Peter Wong that he might be able to resolve the dispute with Wang.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> On 11 July 2005, the Defendant did send the Plaintiff to China to discuss with Wang to procure the delivery of the goods under thetwo deals. It was emphasised to the Plaintiff that the Defendant's foremost concern was to obtain the supply of the man's jackets.The Plaintiff did go to China on 11 July 2005 and came back to Hong Kong on 12 July 2005. The goods under the two deals were notdelivered to Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Between 13 &amp; 14 July 2005, the Defendant and Wang struck a compromise for Wang to provide the Defendant with compensation inthe sum of RMB150,000.00. The terms were as described in the Plaintiff's evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> On 15 July 2005 the Plaintiff went to China in connection with the two deals and returned to Hong Kong on 16 July 2005. The goodsunder the two deals were still not delivered to Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Under cross examination, DW1 said that the Defendant had prior to the procurement of the cashier order dated 20 July 2005 for US$41,875.40(see TB136), the Defendant had also previously procured cashier orders in respect of the price of the goods under the two deals.Two such cashier orders dated 15 July 2005 are included in the trial documents (see TB126). DW1 explained that these were preparedto show to the supplier that the Defendant did have the means to make payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> On 18 July 2005, the Plaintiff went to China for the same purpose. DW1 handed cash of $1,000.00 and RMB18,000.00 to the Plaintiffon account of his travelling expenses. She was asked to explain but she did not at first explain how the amount was arrived at. Shesaid that for making trips to Shenzhen or Kwangtung, the Defendant usually would not give a large amount of money as travelling expensesto its staff. Later on, she said that a bigger sum of money was given to the Plaintiff as there might be a need to pay the storagecharges for the goods. She then went on to say that it was not the Defendant's responsibility to pay the storages charges for thegoods. The Plaintiff had not given any receipt for the alleged payment. DW1 said that the Defendant was a small sized company andoperated in a less formal manner. The payment was not even recorded in the books of the Defendant. DW1 paid it out of her own pocket.When asked why the Defendant did not pay the Plaintiff and entered the item in its accounting record, DW1 said that it was the usualpractice and the Defendant did not have an account for RMB. Peter Wong in the previous proceedings before the Labour Tribunal hadhowever said that the amount paid to the Plaintiff was RMB15,000.00 instead of RMB18,000.00.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> It is DW1's evidence that on 20 July 2005, the Defendant was eager to obtain delivery of the man's jackets for delivery to its ownoverseas buyer. In her cross examination, DW1 said that when the cashier order for US$41,875.40 was procured on 20 July 2005, shedid not pay much attention as to whether the payment was meant for the man's jackets or the kid's jeans. She at first said that thepayment might be for both types of goods. She denied that when the cashier order was prepared, she was aware that it was meant tobe the payment for kid's jeans only. She however agreed that the Defendant had received the fax copy of the packing list (see TB134-135)when the cashier order (TB136) was procured. The packing list clearly shows the goods to be transported to Hong Kong were kid's jeans,not man's jackets.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> In her cross examination, DW1 said that at the time of the preparation of the cashier order, she did not pay attention to all thedetails in the packing list (TB134-135). She only noted the amount and the nominated payee stated therein. She said that it was afterthe procurement of the cashier order that she found out the payment was related to the kid's jeans. She then called the Plaintiffand questioned why the goods did not include the man's jackets. The Plaintiff told her that the 1st truck was already fully loadedwith the kid's jeans. She did not give the Plaintiff further instructions then.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> In her cross examination, DW1 said that after procuring the cashier order, she gave it to one Miss Pao, the secretary of Peter Wong.She did not remember if she had told Miss Pao to fax the cashier order to China. She said that she did not know if the cashier orderwas faxed to the Plaintiff or to Wang. She said that she was aware that it was faxed out on 20 July 2005. She was told by Peter Wongthat it was required in China. She did not know exactly why it was so required. According to DW1, the agreement was that the Defendantwould give the cashier order to Wang or Wan upon the arrival of the goods in Hong Kong, in exchange for the documents for collectionof the goods from the warehouse.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> In her cross examination, DW1 said that Wan did come to the Defendant's office on 20 July 2005 with a view to collect the cashierorder which was then held by her. According to DW1, she then told Wan that the Defendant was not yet ready to give it to him yet.Then Wan left without further ado. Wan did not ask her for any reason. DW1 told the Court that as the goods had not yet been transportedto the Hong Kong warehouse and the Defendant did not yet have the opportunity to check the goods in Hong Kong, she considered thatit was not yet the right time to give the cashier order to Wan.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> DW1 said that it should be in the afternoon of 21 July 2005 that the Defendant examined the goods delivered to Hong Kong. The staffof the Defendant examined the goods and found that there was a short shipment of the goods under Purchase Order no. PO26/05. Underthe contract, the Defendant expected to obtain kid's jeans of 3 different sizes and various styles. There was no shipment of kid'sjeans of the smallest size and there was a short shipment of the other two sizes. The fax dated 21 July 2005 (TB141) from the Defendantto Wang however said that the Defendant had found out that there was a problem with the quality of the goods. There was no mentionof any short shipment. Further, in earlier legal proceedings between the Defendant and the Plaintiff in the Labour Tribunal, PeterWong had told the Labour Tribunal that on 21 July 2005 at about 8-9 am, he received an email from the overseas buyer of the Defendantthat it no longer wanted the goods. DW1 however said that she did not remember having seen any such email, and the Defendant didnot usually start work until it was 10-10:30 am.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> It was suggested to DW1 that the Defendant could not have enough time to check the quantity of the goods delivered to Hong Kong beforethe Defendant sent the fax to Wang on 21 July 2005 informing Wang of the Defendant's decision to reject the goods. DW1 said thatthe staff of the Defendant did not count the goods piece by piece but had noted the particulars of the goods from what was writtenon the carton boxes containing the goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> The Defendant had in the end never given Wang the cashier order that was intended to be payment for the goods delivered to Hong Kong.Wang never retrieved the goods despite the Defendant's request that he should take the goods back. The Hong Kong warehouse informedthe Defendant that the Defendant would have to be responsible for payment of warehouse charges for the goods. The Defendant eventuallyarranged for the goods to be sold locally.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> On 21 July 2005, the Defendant instructed the Plaintiff to return to Hong Kong but was told that his travel documents had been seizedby the China authorities. The Defendant did not then know if the Plaintiff was truly detained by the Chinese authorities. The Defendantsent one Chau Bing to China to investigate into the situation who after meeting the Plaintiff there told the Defendant that the Plaintiff'stravel documents had not been seized.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> On 22 July 2005, the Defendant summarily dismissed the Plaintiff. The 2nd truck that was supposed to deliver the man's jackets toHong Kong  never came. The Defendant dismissed the Plaintiff as the Plaintiff had failed to procure such delivery.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> The Defendant learnt from the Hong Kong Police that the Plaintiff was unlawfully detained in China. The Defendant instructed itssolicitors to write to the Secretary for Security to seek assistance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> The Defendant had never given any instruction or authority to the Plaintiff to sign any guarantee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Discussion and Finding</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> As noted earlier, I do not consider that I have the jurisdiction to entertain the Plaintiff's claim for the sum of US$5,000.00.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> However, even if I were to accept that the Plaintiff's claims for the sums of US$5,000.00 and RMB80,000.00 are both within my jurisdiction,I would nonetheless find against the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> I am not persuaded that the Defendant had instructed the Plaintiff to sign the guarantee at TB137 or any guarantee in general. Iam not persuaded that the Plaintiff had signed the guarantee at TB137 to procure the release of the goods to Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> I consider that there is a very real possibility that the whole course of events which the Plaintiff claimed to have happened tohim from 21 July 2005 to 16 August 2005 was something orchestrated by the Plaintiff and Wang in concert. In other words, I am notpersuaded that it is probable that the Plaintiff's experience of loss of personal liberty in Shenzhen during that period, assumingthat he did go through all that as he had so described in his evidence, was under any real compulsion. Also, I am not persuaded thatthe alleged payments of US$5,000.00 and RMB80,000.00 to secure the Plaintiff's personal liberty were in fact made. If they were infact made, I am not persuaded that they were made to secure the Plaintiff's personal liberty.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> In this case, there is no acute dispute as to what happened prior to the alleged signing of the guarantee. The Defendant did challengethe bona-fides of the representations that the Plaintiff had made to the Defendant in his job application. There is good reason todoubt whether the Plaintiff had been fully frank and honest in that connection, but this is only a peripheral matter and I do notattach much significance to it in trying to determine the truthfulness or otherwise of the core issues.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> I find that prior to the alleged signing of the guarantee, the facts boiled down to little more than this: the Plaintiff appliedfor a job and the Defendant employed him as a merchandiser. The Defendant had placed two purchase orders with Rongjian as abovementioned.There was a delay in delivery of the goods and the Defendant had disputes with Wang over the two deals. Both parties were still tryingto resolve their differences and to close the two deals. The parties came to a compromise in principle as abovementioned. The Defendanthad prepared two cashier orders on 15 July 2005 with a view to close the two deals but that was to no avail. The Defendant had sentthe Plaintiff to follow up on the two deals in Shenzhen. While the Plaintiff was in Shenzhen he did receive the fax showing the twocashier orders. The goods were not exported to Hong Kong on that occasion. The Plaintiff was later sent to Shenzhen again to procurethe completion of the two deals. He was to see to the export of the goods under the two deals to Hong Kong on 20 July 2005. He wasthere with PW2 and they met Wang, and there were telephone contacts between him and DW1. The Defendant did procure a cashier orderin the sum of US41,875.40 and fax it to the Plaintiff. Wan had on behalf of Wang went to the Defendant's office on 20 July 2005 witha view to collect the cashier order but the attempt was unsuccessful.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> As to what actually happened thereafter in relation to the alleged signing of the guarantee and its aftermath (i.e. what happenedto the Plaintiff thereafter), it is an enigma shrouded in suspicious circumstances. Except for matters that the parties were on commongrounds or not in dispute, I am not prepared to find the disputed facts on the Plaintiff's case. I accept that the goods in the 1sttruck were delivered from Shenzhen to Hong Kong on 21 July 2005. The Defendant refused to take delivery but Wang refused to transportthe goods back to Shenzhen. The Defendant eventually sold the goods and it has not paid for the goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> As noted earlier, paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim has pleaded a number of matters capable of different permutations. It islacking in clarity and precision. In view of my finding of fact against the Plaintiff, I do not propose to address in detail as towhether as a matter of law all the Plaintiff's contentions are valid. It suffices to say that I find no such implied term in thecontract of employment. I agree that a principal does have a duty to indemnify its agent against losses incurred in the carryingout of the principal's instructions. I would leave it at there and simply note that none of the contentions raised in paragraph 3of the Statement of Claim has established the Plaintiff's claims, on facts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> I would make one passing comment. I take judicial notice that there were occasional reports in the news that some representativesof certain Hong Kong companies were detained in China in connection with alleged outstanding liabilities owed by those Hong Kongcompanies towards their trading partners in China. However, I am not prepared to find that a Hong Kong employer/principal who hasordered for goods from a Chinese supplier in sending its employee/agent to China in that connection invariably owes the latter ageneral contractual or tortious duty to exercise reasonable care to ensure that the employee/agent would not be subject to unreasonabledetention by that Chinese supplier or other connected parties when a trade dispute does arise between the Hong Kong employer/principaland the Chinese supplier.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> I am not prepared to find any trickery on the part of the Defendant designed to expose the Plaintiff to financial losses or the riskof losing his personal liberty, in order to procure the shipment of the goods to Hong Kong. I am not prepared to find that the Plaintiff'sloss of personal liberty (assuming that it did happen to him), was reasonably foreseeable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> I consider that it has not been proved that the Defendant had been in breach of any duty owed to the Plaintiff whether in tort orin contract or under the law of agency which had caused the Plaintiff to suffer the alleged losses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> As to the Plaintiff's claim for general damages, by the same reasoning, I consider that the contentions that the Plaintiff has reliedon in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim are not established. There was no such implied term in contract nor did such a duty intort ever arose. In any event, on facts it has not been established that the Plaintiff had under any real compulsion lost his personalliberty. It follows that the matters pleaded in paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Statement of Claim are also not established. For thesake of completeness I would set out paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Statement of Claim herein: <i>"18. Wrongfully and in breach of its duty at common law and/or the implied term of the said Employment as pleaded in paragraph 4 above,the Defendant deliberately did not take necessary steps and use its best endeavours in restoring freedom of movement of the Plaintiff."</i> and <i>"19. In the premises, the Plaintiff was wrongfully detained and deprived of his liberty from 21st July 2005 to 16 August 2005 andhas suffered mental distress and anxiety as a result of his fear for his personal safety."</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> I would now turn to the Defendant's counterclaim. I am not persuaded that the Defendant had in fact provided the Plaintiff with thesums of $1,000.00 and RMB18,000.00 as alleged or at all. On the evidence before me, if the sums were indeed provided they were notprovided by the Defendant but by DW1 personally. The Defendant's counterclaim must also fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Order</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> The Plaintiff's claims and the Defendant's counterclaims are all dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> On the question of costs, I note that the Defendant had challenged the Plaintiff's claims on jurisdictional grounds and I have foundagainst the Defendant on that. I note that the Plaintiff is under legal aid. I would order the Plaintiff's own costs be taxed inaccordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>. I would make the following Orders Nisi for costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> The Plaintiff do pay 4/5 of the Defendant's costs in defending the Plaintiff's claims, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> The Defendant do pay the Plaintiff's costs in defending the Defendant's counterclaims, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> There be Certificate for Counsel for the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> Unless there is an application to vary the above Orders Nisi, they will become absolute in 14 days.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(R.
