According to the plaintiff, he had been approached 8-10 times by the defendant's agents, a Mr. Chan Choi and someone froma solicitor firm Messrs. Edward Wong and Ng to surrender his tenancy. Such approaches began from the end of 1990 or early 1991 untilMay 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In June 1991, the plaintiff had a one year contract to work in a hotel in Beijing commencing on 20th June 1991 and he was given homeleave every 3 months for 7-10 days. In his absence, the plaintiff had asked a friend of his Mr. Benny Cheung (P.W.2) to collect mails,to pay for the bills and to generally look after the said premises for him and he had given a set of keys to Mr. Cheung.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Before the plaintiff left for Beijing in June 1991, he was aware that the Building Authority had ordered certain repair works tobe carried out at No. 8 Cameron Road, Kowloon and he had told Mr. Cheung that if such repair works were required to be carried outin the said premises, Mr. Cheung should co-operate with the landlord and let the workers enter the said premises to carry out suchrepair works.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiff came back to Hong Kong in or about October 1991 for his first home leave, he realized that the repair works requiredby the Building Authority for No. 8 Cameron Road, Kowloon had been completed.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It was not in dispute that the Building Authority did require the defendant to carry out certain repair works to the building includingthe demolition of certain illegally built balconies at the rear of the building under certain orders dated 28th March 1991, 20thMay 1991 and 10th June 1991 (pages 4, 12 and 15 of the agreed bundle of documents), and the defendant had engaged the service ofMr. Daniel Ho Tak Wah, an authorized person of the Archicorp (H.K.) Ltd. to carry out such works as required by the Building Authority.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It was also not in dispute that a joint inspection of the building in question had been carried out in early November 1991 and bya letter dated 25th November 1991 (page 26 of the agreed bundle) addressed to the defendant by the Building Ordinance Office, itwas certified that the works required by the Building Authority under the aforesaid orders had been complied with.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff having spent another 3 months in Beijing, returned to Hong Kong on 10th January 1992. He returned to No. 8 CameronRoad, 3/F, at about 9 p.m. He was unable to gain entrance into the said premises as the locks for the iron grill and the main doorhad been replaced by new ones. He found a scaffolding outside the building and the tenants of the 2nd and 4th floors were no longerthere.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> As it was getting late and the plaintiff could not enter the said premises, he went to Mei Foo Sun Chuen to spend the night at afriend's place.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiff returned to his home shortly after 8 a.m. the next morning, he found some workers working inside. He asked the workersto open the door to let him in. He found his home in a complete mess. The entire external wall of the said premises facing CameronRoad with the windows and the air-conditioner in it had been removed leaving a big hole and workers could be seen climbing up anddown the scaffoldings, working.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The workers were unable to answer the plaintiff's queries. The plaintiff contacted the general manager of the defendant, a Mr. Ma,and asked him why his home was broken into. Mr. Ma said he knew nothing about the matter and asked the plaintiff to contact a Mr.Chan Choi who had previously discussed with the plaintiff for the surrender of the tenancy of the said premises. The plaintiff wasable to speak to Mr. Chan Choi over the telephone but Mr. Chan said he no longer bothered about such matters. The plaintiff thenreported the matter to the police.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiff returned to the building and was able to speak to the sub-contractor, a Mr. Ho, who told the plaintiff that the landlordhad authorized him to carry out the work therein and he had no idea about other matters. Mr. Ho nevertheless gave the plaintiff keysto enable the plaintiff to enter the said premises.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Inside the said premises, the plaintiff found his furnitures were stagged up in the sitting room and the bed had been turned to reston one side against the wall. The entire external wall facing Cameron Road had been demolished with the windows as well as the air-conditionerwhich was subsequently put on the floor. All the curtains had been removed and placed on the floor. The wall paper was damaged andthe electric wirings were exposed and hanging from the wall. There were also concrete, dust, bamboos, bricks, cements bags and otherdebris in the master bedroom. The toilet was full of rubbish and excrement. Photographs of the inside of the said premises, in particularthat of the master bedroom had been taken (p. 33- 41 of the agreed bundle of documents).</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The plaintiff then locked up the master bedroom which was the part facing Cameron Road and accounted for about 1/3 of the said premisesin order to minimize the effect of the works being carried out therein and he just used the rest of the said premises while he stayedin Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> An attempt to restrain the defendant from continuing with the works by injunction was subsequently compromised and the defendantwas allowed to complete the works.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> As a result of the renovation works, the appearance of No. 8 Cameron Road is completely different from what it was before. For thefacade of each of the floors facing Cameron Road, a floor to ceiling tempered glass had been installed and affixed to a metal frame.There is no window that can be opened on the side facing Cameron Road.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The building now looks like a commercial building with a huge signboard made up of 6 large Chinese characters reading "No. 8 GeneralMerchandise Plaza".</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> A comparison of the 2 photographs D1 and D2 clearly demonstrates the effect of the renovation works in the building in question.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The plaintiff's major complaint at the moment is that the master bedroom that he used to sleep in cannot be used as a bedroom anymore as there is no ventilation and the floor to ceiling glass wall also reveals the whole bedroom to the outside.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The issues involved in the dispute appears simple and straightforward. But Mr. Bell on behalf of the defendant had raised a numberof points.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Firstly, it was suggested that the plaintiff's cause of action against the defendant was one of breach of the implied covenant ofquiet enjoyment only and whatever remedies available to the plaintiff would be confined to remedies peculiar to breach of impliedcovenant of quiet enjoyment.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Secondly, it was suggested all the alleged wrongful acts, with the exception of the demolition of the wall, were committed by anindependent contractor without the consent of the defendant and the defendant could not therefore be liable for such wrongful acts.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Thirdly, the defendant argued that a property owner had the right and duty to prevent premises to become dangerous and what the defendantdid to the building in question was just a discharge of such duty.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Fourthly, it was suggested that Mr. Benny Cheung, the plaintiff's representative had at least given implied permission to the defendantto carry out the works in question.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Fifthly, the defendant argued that the wrongful acts complained of by the plaintiff were just temporary inconvenience and could notconstitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Lastly, there was a vague suggestion that the plaintiff had at the material time sub-let the said premises and he was not in occupationand therefore not entitled to bring the present proceedings against the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The alleged sub-letting was raised in the defence, but simply there was no evidence to support the allegation. On the evidence, theplaintiff clearly remained the tenant at all material times and the suggestion that he had sub-let the said premises simply couldnot be sustained.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I reject the argument that the plaintiff's cause of action is confined to that of a contractual one, namely a breach of the covenantof quiet enjoyment. The matters complained of by the plaintiff as set out in the Statement of Claim clearly gave rise to a tortiousaction of trespass as well as an action for breach of quiet enjoyment. Lord Denning in <u>Drane v. Evangelou</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20WLR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 W.L.R. 455</a> had the following to say at p. 458 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Counsel for the defendant submitted that that claim was for breach of a covenant for quiet enjoyment. He cited a passage from Woodfallon Landlord and Tenant 27th Ed (1968) para. 1338. "Since the claim is in contract, punitive or exemplary damages cannot be awarded."The judge at once said : "What about trespass? Does the claim not lie in trespass?" Counsel for the defendant urged that trespasswas not pleaded. The judge then said: "The facts are alleged sufficiently so it does not matter what label you put upon it." Thejudge was right. The plaintiff in the particulars of claim gave details saying that three men broke the door, removed the plaintiff'sbelongings, bolted the door from the inside: and so forth. Those facts were clearly sufficient to warrant a claim for trespass. Aswe said in <em>In re Vandervell's Trusts</em> (No. 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20Ch%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] Ch. 269</a>, 321-322.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It is sufficient for the pleader to state material facts. He need not state the legal result. If, for convenience, he does so, heis not bound by, or limited to, what he has stated. He can present, in argument, any legal consequence of which the facts permit."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The facts as pleaded by the plaintiff clearly also support a claim for trespass. The argument that the plaintiff's remedy is limitedto that for a breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment must fail.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> This conclusion would dispose of the argument that the inconvenience being temporary would not give rise to a cause of action ofbreach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. In any event, I do not agree with that the inconvenience can be described as temporary.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Quite apart from the removal of the window and wall and the fitting of a floor to ceiling tempered glass, thus depriving the plaintiffof ventilation to the master bedroom and rendering it no longer suitable to be used as a bedroom, the actual construction work lasteda few weeks. After the construction work had been completed, there was no attempt to clean up the said premises and according tothe plaintiff, the said premises in particular the master bedroom was left in more or less the same state as depicted in the photographswith debris and waste material lying around. It was not until a few months later that the plaintiff cleaned up the places by himselfwhen he returned to Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The suggestion that the matters complained of were just temporary inconvenience was not supported by the facts and must be rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> I shall now deal with the allegation that Mr. Benny Cheung (P.W.2) had consented to the renovation works in question as the representativeof the plaintiff. The consent was alleged to have been given to a sub-contractor, a Mr. Ho. Mr. Ho had not given evidence and theonly evidence on that aspect of the case came from Mr. Benny Cheung.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> According to Mr. Cheung, in response to a letter by the defendant's solicitor dated 21st August 1991 (pages 20 &amp; 21 of the agreedbundle), he telephoned a Mr. Joseph Chan and left his pager number with him. He was then contacted by a contractor and an arrangementwas made for him to allow the contractor access to the said premises in order to carry out the repair works required by the BuildingAuthority. Whilst such works were in progress, he opened the door for the workers every day and in fact spent some time in the premiseswhen the works were going on.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Mr. Cheung had not been told to allow anyone further access to the said premises for any further renovation works, and he had noidea at all about the subsequent renovation works carried out in December 1991/ January 1992. He remembered at around that time,he went to the said premises in the evening and found the wooden door and iron grill locked up. He could not open them with the keyshe had. He saw a note on the wall with the pager number of a person surnamed Ho. He subsequently contacted Mr. Ho and was told thatthe landlord had asked him to carry out works and an appointment was made for Mr. Ho to open the door of the said premises. OnceMr. Cheung gained entry, he found the living-room and the bedroom in a messy state. New locks were installed. Mr. Ho told him thatit was the landlord who told him to lock up the said premises and to carry out the works. Mr. Cheung said at that time, the workshad already commenced and he just let the plaintiff to handle the matter with the landlord. He said he did not know Mr. Ho and hewould not let him do the work. Mr. Cheung's attitude was one of helplessness and frustration. It could not be construed as eitherexpress or implied consent to the carrying out of the renovation works in question. There was no evidence nor suggestion that Mr.Cheung was aware of the nature of the renovation works in question. It was also doubtful that Mr. Cheung was authorized to give thealleged consent. The argument that the renovation works in question were carried out with the consent of the plaintiff could notbe sustained.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> According to the architect in charge of the renovation works in question, Mr. Daniel Ho Tat Wah of Archicorp Ltd. (D.W.5), it wasdiscovered, in the course of the repair works to the building in August/September 1991 as required by the Building Authority, thatthe external wall plastering of the building was made of decomposed granite. Such decomposed granite plastering, unlike cement andsand plastering, was not durable and would break easily and lose its adhesiveness after prolonged attack by rain and wind. Mr. Hofelt that there would be future danger as further deterioration of the building could not be ruled out. Because of the potentialdanger of the plastering coming down, on Mr. Ho's suggestion, the defendant made a decision to appoint a contractor Bestskill EngineeringLimited to carry out a better and more substantial renovation. The nature of such renovation works was set out in a quotation submittedby Bestskill Engineering Ltd. to the defendant (pages 27-29 of the agreed bundle).</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> On such evidence, it was submitted that what the defendant did was a lawful discharge of the defendant's duty to take reasonablecare to prevent the building from becoming dangerous.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The defendant relied on an Irish case of <u>Gerard Bowes v. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Dublin</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20IR%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] I.R. 476.</a></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> On the evidence, I found such submission very bold. If the defendant's argument is correct, every landlord of any old building inHong Kong can just demolish any part of the building without consulting the tenants or obtaining their consent.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The court cannot ignore that earlier remedial works to the building as required by the Building Authority had been completed in orabout October 1991 and certificates under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulations 25</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A" class="autolink_findacts">Building (Administration) Regulations</a> had been issued.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> It therefore meant that the building was considered to be safe and not liable to become dangerous in or around October/November 1991.Yet within a month or two, the defendant chose to completely demolish the front external wall and windows and replaced them withfloor to ceiling tempered glass.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> There was evidence that the building at No. 8A Cameron Road which was right next to the building in question and in fact shares acommon staircase with it was built at the same time. There was also evidence that No. 8A had also been subject to certain ordersby the Building Authority and repair works to it had been carried out and completed at or around the same time as those to the buildingin question as required by the Building Authority. The appearance of No. 8 before and after the repair works could be seen from thephotographs produced. Such matters were totally inconsistent with the suggestion that the building in question required the substantialrenovation works in December 1991/January 1992 to prevent it from becoming dangerous. The nature of the renovation works and themanner in which such works were carried out without notifying the plaintiff or obtaining his consent were also inconsistent withthe suggested motive of the defendant of trying to prevent the building from becoming dangerous and such suggestion must be rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> The only remaining matters put forward by the defendant related to the question of whether the defendant could be liable for theacts of the sub-contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The defendant's case, if I understand it properly, was that while the defendant admits responsibility for demolition of the externalwall, the acts of trespassing into the plaintiff's premises and the messing up of it were done by the independent contractor withoutauthority nor consent from the defendant and the defendant could not be liable for such wrongful acts.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Mr. Lui Shing Moon, a director of the defendant, D.W.2 and Mr. Daniel Ho, the Architect, D.W.5 both said they believed that the saidrenovation works in question could be carried out entirely from the outside of the building and entry into the said premises wasnot necessary nor contemplated. They also said they did not consent to nor expect that the contractor would enter the plaintiff'spremises at all.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> I have considered the evidence carefully. The renovation works in question were not just patching up of cracks on the external wallnor whitewashing. It involved the removal of an air-conditioner and the curtains, the completed demolition of the wall and the windowsof the bedroom of a premises rented out to a tenant.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> I found the suggestion that entry into the plaintiff's premises in connection with the renovation works not necessary most surprising.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Would it not be necessary to remove the curtain and the air- conditioner and to arrange the furniture so as to avoid damaging them?Would it not be necessary to ensure that the electric wiring and socket were removed before the demolition work started so as toensure safety for the workers? Would it not be a lot more convenient to carry out the work as anticipated under quotation by Bestskillfrom within the premises?</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Indeed, Mr. Yeung Kai Tat, a shareholder and director of Bestskill conceded that to carry out the renovation works in question properly,entry into the plaintiff's premises was necessary.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> On the evidence I reject the suggestion that the defendant did not expect the workers to enter into the plaintiff's premises. Itwas not in dispute that the defendant was under a duty to make available the site to the contractor to carry out the works and onthe evidence, I also find that the defendant had not made any attempt to contact the plaintiff or his representative in order tomake available the said premises to the workers in connection with the renovation works in question.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> On the facts as found by the court, the wrongful act of trespassing into the plaintiff's premises and messing of it must be withinthe reasonable contemplation of the defendant when it ordered the contractors/workers to carry out the works and such wrongful actsmust have been expressly or impliedly authorized by the defendant and the defendant must be liable for the same.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> None of the matters put forward by the defendant thought ably argued by Mr. Bell, constitute any defence to the plaintiff's claimand the court have no hesitation in finding for the plaintiff on the question of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> I shall now deal with the question of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The plaintiff had not pleaded any special damages and was only claiming for general damages. In addition, it was argued by Mr. Chanon behalf of the plaintiff that this is a proper case for the court to award exemplary damages because of the behaviour of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Mr. Chan had referred the court to the case of <u>Wong Choi Kiu v. Poon Pan Wo Nelson trading as Thorough Construction Co.</u>, H.C. Case No. A2482 of 1988 in which Master Chan awarded general damages for discomfort, inconvenience and distress.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> The facts as found by the court indicated that the defendant had, while the plaintiff was away, broken into his premises and renderedit extremely messy and dirty. When the plaintiff returned to Hong Kong on 10.1.1992, he found himself being locked out of his ownpremises. He had to spent the night at a friend's place and then reported the matter to the police before taking legal proceedingsagainst the defendant. For a considerable period, he had lost the use of the master bedroom which accounts for 1/3 of the said premises.Even though the plaintiff had to work in Beijing in the first six months of 1992, and would not be living in the said premises exceptwhen he was on home leave, he was entitled to feel assured that he would have a nice flat to go to on his return to Hong Kong andshould the necessity arise, he could allow friends or relatives to live there.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> The defendant's wrongful acts had completely destroyed such assurance, comfort and convenience.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> The plaintiff was still unable to use the master bedroom for its intended purpose due to the complete lack of ventilation.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> I am satisfied that the discomfort, inconvenience and distress to the plaintiff arising from the defendant's wrongful acts are notinsignificant and call for substantial damages. I am also satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to recover a sum sufficient toenable him to render the master bedroom fit for its intended purpose. That would involve the installation of a split type air- conditionerand a new curtain.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> There was evidence from Mr. Daniel Ho that a split type air- conditioner fitted for the master bedroom in question would cost $6000.00and that the difference in the costs of running such a split type air-conditioner and an ordinary window type would be about $300.00a month on the assumption that the master bedroom in question would be air-conditioned round the clock. Of course, had there beenwindows that could be opened, it might not be necessary to turn on the air-conditioner as often.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Assessing the damages is by no means an easy task in the present case. Doing the best I could and taking into consideration all theaforesaid matters, I am of the view that a sum of $50,000.00 would be a reasonable award for general damages.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> In dealing with the question of exemplary damages, it is important to determine the reasons for the defendant committing the wrongfulacts in question. The facts as found by the court indicated that the defendant had decided to carry out the renovation works in questionwithout obtaining or trying to obtain the consent of the plaintiff. The defendant carried out the works with no regard for the viewof the plaintiff and without even letting him know about them beforehand.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> The only reasonable and logical conclusion is that the defendant intended to create a situation whereby everything would be completedby the time the plaintiff became aware of the situation. If the defendant had wanted to notify the plaintiff, it could write to himdirectly or through the solicitors just like what was done in connection with the repair works required by the Building Authorityin August/September 1991. After all, such earlier attempt resulted in positive response when Mr. Benny Cheung who took the troubleto open the door for the workers and supervise them when they were carrying out the earlier repair works. There was also evidencethat the defendant or its agent was in possession of the pager number of Mr. Benny Cheung yet no attempt was made to contact himbefore carrying out the renovation works. Instead the defendant through its agent chose to break open the lock of the said premisesto carry out the works.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> If the defendant had not been acting mala fides, was it not reasonable that they should work out an acceptable arrangement with theplaintiff before carrying out the renovation works in December 1991 or January 1992. After all, there was no suggestion of any urgencyin the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> The court cannot ignore that the appearance of the building after the renovation works and its effect had created a situation wherebythe said premises can no longer be described as suitable as a domestic premises.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> There had been previous unsuccessful attempts to persuade the plaintiff to give up the premises and clearly the value of the buildingwould be significantly increased should the defendant be able to recover possession of the said premises from the plaintiff despitethe denial by Mr. Liu Shing Moon on such matters.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> The defendant might want to improve the appearance of the building and hence enhance its value. I am of the view that it was probablethat the defendant also intended to harass the plaintiff with a view to evict him and in so doing had adopted a blatant and willfuldisregard for the right and interest of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> I am satisfied that the outrageous conduct of the defendant calls for punitive damages.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> In <u>Laventer v.

That had not been the plaintiff's pleaded case and there was insufficientevidence to support such conclusion.
