When at trial the action appeareddoomed the plaintiff accepted his solicitor's and counsel's advice to drop the case and settle as best as he could the other side'scosts. And he did.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> By these proceedings he now sues the defendants in negligence for not having been advised, as he should have been, that his actionstood very little chance of success; alternatively, if his solicitor was of the view he had reasonable prospects, he should not havebeen advised to go for a dismissal.</p>    <p class="heading">The History</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> This is somewhat convoluted; it is necessary to go back a number of years to get to the beginning.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiff (Mr Delhaise) is Belgian born. He must have been an outstanding student, for his tertiary education resulted in a numberof degrees in engineering and economics and the like. Of his many undoubted attributes it was also apparent during the course ofthe trial that he has a flawless command of English, speaking, writing and understanding it as if native born.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> He chose as his career path banking. By 1984 he had risen to a senior position in the Belgian Bank. That year he was seconded tothe Belgian Bank in Hong Kong and came to settle here with his wife of 8 years (Miss Christine Gioan) and their two daughters. Thefamily home became a rented apartment in Discovery Bay. The following year Mr Delhaise opted for a change of direction. He left thebank and set up on his own account. But this was not a financial success; after 2 or 3 years, with funds depleted, he was obligedto explore alternative ways to earn enough to support his family. This included a possible return to live and work somewhere in Europe.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> By mid 1988 Mr Delhaise had either secured a position in Europe or was high on a short list. But by then Miss Gioan had sought legaladvice on the marriage from David Glynn, the senior partner of Hampton Winter v Glynn (HWG). Mr Delhaise says that she did not wantto leave Hong Kong and this because she had taken a lover here. On 26 July 1988 Mr Glynn's then assistant Sharon Ser (Miss Ser isnow a partner of HWG) issued a petition on behalf of Miss Gioan for judicial separation. On the same date she filed <em>ex parte</em> an application. This was to be the event giving rise to three separate actions culminating in the one before me. The applicationMiss Ser brought was for an injunction restraining Mr Delhaise from surrendering the lease on the family home at Discovery Bay andcompelling him to keep the rent up, and prohibiting his departure from Hong Kong. The result of that was drastic; Mr Delhaise couldnot return to Europe and lost his chance of employment there. He immediately engaged Stevenson, Wong &amp; Co. (SW) to act for him.It seems no steps were taken to pursue an immediate discharge or variation of the prohibition and mandatory orders, for the nextevent was the return date, fixed and heard on 9 August, 14 days after the order first made. On that date the order was dischargedwith costs because there was material non-disclosure of the family's financial circumstances, and in particular Mr Delhaise's needto secure a job in Europe. He says this was known to Mr Glynn and Miss Ser prior to the application for prohibition because it wasdealt with in correspondence preceding the July order, but withheld from the presiding judge. Mr Delhaise formed the view that thenon-disclosure was deliberate and as such amounted to gross professional misconduct. He laid a complaint against Mr Glynn and MissSer in January 1989 with the Hong Kong Law Society. There was an enquiry, but the upshot was a letter from the Law Society that theProfessional Conduct Committee had accepted the explanation of Mr Glynn and Miss Ser and found there had been oversight but not misconduct.Mr Delhaise was told to seek legal advice if he wanted to take the matter further.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> He did so. In or about December 1990 he consulted Mr John Edwards of Kao Lee &amp; Yip. Mr Edwards told him that there was a possibleclaim grounded in malicious prosecution of civil proceedings but that it would be novel law and may be difficult to prove. Mr JohnBleach of counsel was called in. His advice was no more encouraging. In any event at the time Mr Delhaise had no available fundsand took the matter no further.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> But in February 1992, Mr Delhaise did file a writ, against SW. This was the first of the three sets of proceedings I have referredto. I shall call it the 1992 Action. By that action he sued in negligence by reason of SW's failure to advise him that immediatelyfollowing service of the <em>ex parte</em> order he could have applied to discharge the order or vary the terms or have the Court call for an undertaking in damages as a conditionof its continuing. As it was he was deprived of that remedy when the truth emerged and the order was discharged. He sued for DiscoveryBay rent of $17,763, costs, less those recovered, of $16,183, loss of earnings of $50,541, and Mr Edwards' bill of $23,530; in all$108,018, plus costs. In the event the matter was settled by SW paying to Mr Delhaise the sum of $120,000. A consent order to thateffect was made in July 1992.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> By now the marriage was effectively over. Miss Gioan's petition, amended to one for a divorce, had come before the Court in 1990.But Mr Delhaise chose to defend it; he was, after all, the victim of her adultery. Appearing unaided, he was successful. Returningto France, he initiated a divorce himself. Again unaided, his petition succeeded.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> But Mr Delhaise was still unhappy. The events so far had not addressed what was a serious miscarriage of justice; a deliberate andcynical disregard by Miss Ser and Mr Glynn of their professional obligations to his ruination. Concerned that time was running outhe issued on 17 June 1994 a writ against Mr Glynn, Miss Ser and HWG seeking damages for their misconduct. This has been called forshort the 1994 Action and I shall continue to do so. It is the second of Mr Delhaise's three sets of proceedings. He drafted thestatement of claim without legal assistance, using as he says books, documents he could get hold of and the internet. Perhaps couldbe added that he would have derived assistance from the proceedings he had by then been involved in. In any event the statement ofclaim had the appearance of being professionally drawn, though I accept that it was not. He recorded the descriptions of the parties,the terms of the <em>ex parte</em> order and the practical effect, that it was grounded in bad faith, maliciously and with ulterior motive and then, in detailed particulars,he pleaded why that should be so. The loss he claimed in damages was the Discovery Bay rent of $17,763, the unrecovered costs of$16,183 and the loss of earnings of $50,541 - the amounts that comprised the damages sought against SW in the proceedings ultimatelysettled. In addition he claimed $14 million for the loss of freedom between 26 July and 9 August 1988, that is $1 million per day,and aggravated damages as might be determined by the court.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> My intention is to commend Mr Delhaise rather than criticise local standards when I state that I have seen many examples of proceedingsless competently drawn.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The named defendants filed a defence. Recounting the history, it was pleaded that the <em>ex parte</em> order asked for and obtained was in direct compliance with Miss Gioan's instructions. She was concerned that Mr Delhaise had terminatedthe Discovery Bay tenancy and was planning to leave Hong Kong which would force her and the children to do likewise or face abandonmentand penury in Hong Kong. They did as instructed in the honest and reasonably held belief that this was a reasonable, lawful and necessaryremedy to preserve the family's status quo. Failure to disclose the correspondence which was to come before the judge on the returndate was an oversight. It was further pleaded that whilst denying liability for damages there was no loss for the plaintiff had alreadybeen compensated his pleaded loss in the compromised action against SW; further, that a claim for unrecovered costs is bad in law.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Having filed his claim when he did to avoid it being time-barred Mr Delhaise was concerned about what he should do after that. Hewas by then, in 1994, in a more comfortable situation financially. But he was alive to the difficulties; he remembered Mr Bleach'ssomewhat pessimistic advice about his prospects. And Mr Edwards had told him his chances were slim; that it would be difficult toprove malice on the part of HWG's principal and employee; that there was no known precedent for a claim of this sort, most caseson malicious civil proceedings invariably involving bankruptcy proceedings and the like.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> In October 1994 Mr Delhaise came to be introduced to Mr Christopher Erving, then a principal of Ng &amp; Co., the first defendantherein. Early on in the solicitor-client relationship that developed Mr Erving was asked to consider the merits of Mr Delhaise'scase and, depending on the result of that to decide whether or not he should take it on. What Mr Erving's advice was is in materialdispute; my finding on that will lead inexorably to the outcome of this action; I shall return to that. What is not contentious isthat Mr Erving's firm did agree to represent Mr Delhaise in his claim, Mr Erving having conduct throughout. A notice to act dated12 December 1994 was filed. (The 2nd defendant, Erving Brettell, took over in August 1966 when the 1st defendant was dissolved andMr Erving's subsequent firm, the 2nd defendant, came into being).</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Matters moved on. On 26 April 1995 there was a check-list hearing. Mr Erving advised the wisdom of briefing counsel and Mr Delhaiseinstructed accordingly. Mr Allman-Brown was engaged. The brief is detailed; I highlight three excerpts.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Your Instructing Solicitors' primary concern is whether or not the Plaintiff will be able to establish his claim in the light ofthe obvious defence of the Defendants that at all material times they were acting on the instructions of their client, the Plaintiff'sex-wife because if the Defendants can establish that that is the case, it is Instructing Solicitors' view that the Plaintiff's claimwill fail.</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>        <p class="quote">Counsel should be made aware that attempts had been made to persuade the Plaintiff's ex-wife to give evidence because she has alwaysmaintained that she was told what to do by Glynn and Ser rather than be advised and then make her own decision.

She now lives in France and has declined aninvitation to speak to your Instructing Solicitors.</p>        <p class="quote">...</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Counsel will please consider the papers and advise Instructing Solicitors and the Plaintiff on the prospect of succeeding with thisquite noble claim."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In his witness statement subsequently deposed to as his evidence-in-chief in these proceedings Mr Allman-Brown stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="85%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="90%" colspan="2" class="quote">"...</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">6.</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">After reviewing and considering the documents accompanying the instructions from Mr Erving, I perceived there to be a number of weaknessesin Mr Delhaise's claim.

The purposeof this conference was to discuss generally my view on the merits of Mr Delhaise's claim. During the conference, I explained to MrDelhaise amd Mr Erving that I had serious conerns about Mr Delhaise's ability to establish both liability and loss. As to liability,I emphasised that in view of how the Defendants' Defence had been pleaded, it was clear to me that evidence from Ms Gioan neededto be produced to rebut the Defendant's assertion that they were acting under her instructions, and thus had not intended any malicetowards Mr Delhaise. I told Mr Delhaise that it would be very difficult for him to prove malicious prosecution against any of theDefendants without supporting evidence from Ms Gioan.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="83%" class="quote"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="2%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">9.</td>                <td valign="top" width="83%" class="quote">On the question of quantum, I explained to Mr Delhaise that if he succeeded on the malice point, he would need to produce evidenceof additional loss or damage in order to, first, rebut the Defendants' double recovery defence, and secondly, to base his claim forexemplary or aggravated damages. I pointed out that there appeared to be no evidence of any loss or damage above and beyond thatrepresented by the amount of damages already received from Stevenson, Wong &amp; Co. Mr Delhaise's response was to claim that thefinancial compensation he had recovered from Stevenson, Wong and Co did not reflect all the damages actually suffered by him.

Mr Remedios began by delivering a prepared opening address. The trial was not to advance beyond that.There is no transcript; the judge declined a request for one. Mr Erving's clerk called Miss Cheng was in attendance and took a note.Mr Remedios' account, backed up by the note, was that the judge had formed a view on the papers; not long into his submissions MrRemedios was in a debate with him on whether the law on malicious prosecution could be extended to the circumstances of the case.Mr Remedios attempted to introduce some Australian authorities which he regarded as being in support. The judge declined to heedthem. By the end of the second morning and the opening submissions not yet complete Mr Remedios had by now decided that the chancesof success were negligible. He told Mr Delhaise. Various alternative courses were considered. One, that the question of law be determinedas a preliminary issue, had already been refused by the judge. Another, that Mr Delhaise proceed, lose, and then look to the Courtof Appeal was rejected by him because he was not prepared to invest anything more in the litigation. Finally it was agreed that MrRemedios should negotiate a settlement, with a view to limit the other side's costs he would inevitably have to meet. The proposalthat these be fixed at $500,000 was accepted; and so the case settled.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> But before the judge released the parties he let it be known that he was considering an Order 62 rule 8 RHC costs order by whichmeans a judge can, after first giving a solicitor the opportunity to be heard, order him to refund costs incurred by his client.The judge stated he was concerned that Mr Delhaise may not have been properly advised of the merits of his claim. On this point MrRemedios stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In reply, I advised His Lordship that:</p>        <p class="quote">(a) Mr Delhaise had been advised of the difficulties of his claim both in terms of liability and quantum; and</p>        <p class="quote">(b) In spite of such difficulties and advice, Mr Delhaise's instructions were to proceed the matter to trial."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> In the event, by letter from the judge by his clerk one or two days later, the judge stated that he was not after all going to pursuean enquiry under O. 62.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> A few days later Mr Delhaise wrote to Mr Erving. In it he stated that he was deeply affected by the judge's comments that he wasthinking of invoking an O. 62 enquiry. He then went on to state that if the case was as hopeless as the judge had said it was heshould have been told he had no cause of action. Then he wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"All told, I am now wandering whether, in fairness to me, you should not ask yourself if the case was handled the best it could havebeen."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He then went on to propose a drastic revision of the 2nd defendant's fees.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Mr Erving's response was to state:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have discussed the hearing with Leo Remedios and we both remain firmly of the view that you did have a good cause of action, suchthat before another judge the result could have been quite different."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He went on then to criticize the manner in which the judge had conducted the trial. Dealing with the proposal that his fees be reduced;he was not prepared to accede to that course, whilst writing that if professional negligence was alleged Mr Delhaise should seekindependent advice.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> And that is what he did. The upshot was that by writ dated 27 November 2000 Mr Delhaise's present solicitors issued these proceedings,the third of the three to devolve from the <em>ex parte</em> order.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> I come to the pleaded case next.</p>    <p class="heading">The Pleadings</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> In his statement of claim Mr Delhaise recites the circumstances leading up to the <em>ex parte</em> order being granted and the consequences; the claim against SW and the resultant settlement; the issue of the writ against HWG andothers and the pleaded case; and then breach by the 1st and 2nd defendants of the implied terms of his contracts with them that skill,care and diligence would be exercised in the advice he was to receive from them. In particulars, he pleads that he should have beentold the claim for damages had already been made and settled; that a claim for distress, mental anguish and loss of liberty wouldnot, even if successful, have warranted a prosecution; that malice in the circumstances of the case would have been very difficultto prove; that the claim for exemplary or aggravated damages stood no chance of success without proof of malicious prosecution. Thushe pleads that through the 1st defendant Mr Erving should have advised him "that the 1994 Action stood very little chance of successand that even if it were to succeed there was a substantial risk that the damages awarded might be below the High Court limit"; furtheror in the alternative, Mr Erving through the 2nd defendant should not have advised him to settle at the trial of the 1994 Actionif he was of the view that Mr Delhaise had reasonable prospects of succeeding; on the other hand if he was not of that view it wasnegligent of him not to have advised him at a much earlier stage.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> What is claimed are the costs incurred and paid to the 1st and 2nd defendants of $589,507 and the settled costs of the 1994 Actionof $500,000, interest and costs.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> By their defence the 1st and 2nd defendants deny the negligence pleaded. The advice of Mr Allman-Brown was referred to. On 29 March1995 and again on 23 November 1995 Mr Erving gave Mr Delhaise advice of the difficulties that he would be facing in establishingliability and quantum; in particular, that damages claimed had already been recovered, that there was no evidence of loss associatedwith the loss of freedom; that there was a need to prove malice; that there was a need to overcome the defence that HWG was actingon client's instructions; that exemplary and/or aggravated damages must be evidenced by loss flowing from the malicious prosecution;notwithstanding such advice the plaintiff instructed that the 1994 Action proceed to trial. As to the events at the trial itselfMr Delhaise was advised by counsel of the difficulties of his case; notwithstanding, his instructions were to proceed. The plaintiffinstructed both Mr Erving and counsel to pursue settlement upon advice from counsel that the judge's inclinations were by then sufficientlytelegraphed to make it clear that the action would not succeed.</p>    <p class="heading">The Issue</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> That being the pleaded case it becomes apparent that the central issue is as to whether Mr Erving in his capacity as Mr Delhaise'ssolicitor through the conduct of the 1994 Action exercised the necessary level of care, skill and attention of a reasonably skilledsolicitor in the advice that he gave Mr Delhaise as his client. Crucial to the outcome is whether or not Mr Erving warned Mr Delhaiseof the difficulties he would have to surmount in achieving a successful prosecution. I come to deal with that next by reviewing theaccounts of the principal protagonists.</p>    <p class="heading">The Evidence</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> First, that of Mr Erving.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> He stated in his witness statement that was to become his evidence-in-chief that he was first instructed by Mr Delhaise in earlyOctober 1994. Then it was there was a meeting at which Mr Delhaise introduced him to the history, taking him through documents andthe pleadings of the 1994 Action already filed. Mr Erving noted the claim was essentially one of malice. He told his client he wouldneed to prove improper motive. He told him he could not advise him properly on the merits of the claim until after discovery hadbeen completed. Between October and December Mr Delhaise supplied him with the documents he needed for the List of Documents. Therewere meetings between solicitor and client in March, during the course of which Mr Delhaise's draft of evidence was reviewed anddiscussed. There was a particular meeting of 29 March. I repeat verbatim Mr Erving's evidence about that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="85%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:right" valign="top" width="2%" class="quote">"</td>                <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">14.</td>                <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="5%" class="quote">On 29th March 1995, I met Mr Delhaise in the First Defendants' offices to discuss my amendment to his draft statement. During themeeting, I discussed with Mr Delhaise the merits of his claim generally and more specifically, the evidence that I needed him toproduce in support of his claim. I emphasised that there were, in my view, a number of difficulties with his claim. I explained tohim that it would be difficult for him to prove malice on the part of the Defendants without any direct evidence from Ms Gioan torebut the Defendants' defence that they had acted under her instructions, and thus that no malice could have been intended.

I explained that his draft statement did not address this point.I made it clear to Mr Delhaise that without such evidence, he was unlikely to be able to recovered any damages, apart from a nominalamount, even if he was successful in establishing liability against the Defendants. Mr Delhaise agreed that he would take the amendeddraft away and consider my amendments. However, he told me that despite my advice he would nonetheless like to proceed the claimto trial as soon as possible.

So, a solicitor engaged to represent the client in a contentious matter should always put his mind to the merits ofhis client's case. If he considers the proposed claim or defence to be hopeless he should say as much, even if not specifically askedto form a view. - see <em>Jackson &amp; Powell</em> on Professional Negligence, 5th edition 10.165. But where that advice is given and the client nevertheless wishes to proceed thesolicitor must do so, or withdraw. By doing so, he cannot be held liable in negligence or breach of contractual duty. I quote from<em>Cordery on Solicitors</em>, 9th edition 371:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>[371]</em></p>        <p class="quote">In contentious business or where litigation is likely, it is the duty of a solicitor to make proper investigation into the cause ofaction, or otherwise to ascertain the relevant facts, so that either he or, if instructed, counsel, can form an opinion as to whethera cause of action exists, or is likely to succeed, or a defence is sustainable. If he decides no good cause or defence exists, itis the duty of the solicitor so inform the client, but if the client nonetheless insists on proceeding, the solicitor is under noliability in negligence; and if the client chooses not to follow the advice, the solicitor is under no obligation to compel the clientto accept it, as long as he has made sure that the advice has been understood. However, it is not the duty of the solicitor "to imposea pre-trial screen through which a litigant must pass before he can put his complaint or defence before the court, so that the merefact that a claim or defence failed is neither, of itself, negligence nor necessarily evidence thereof."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Where it is disputed as to what advice was given on the merits of a client's case, a strong indication against the proposition thatproper and appropriate advice was given is the absence of an attendance note or other written communication. As was stated by theeditors of <em>Jackson &amp; Powell (supra)</em> at para 10.174:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There is no substitute for a proper attendance note, recording the gist of the advice that was given. The lack of attendance noteshas materially increased the number of successful claims that are brought against solicitors."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> One assumes that the difficulty a solicitor faces in establishing that advice was given against his (former) client's assertion tothe contrary is that he will inevitably have to recall a conversation going back several years during which there will have beennumerous similar situations to cloud his recall. The client by contrast probably will have only the one to hark back to.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> One further principle needs to be recorded; once the solicitor has told his client of material difficulties and he instructs thesolicitor to proceed regardless, there is no need for him to keep repeating his advice. The editors of <em>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</em> 17th edition stated at p. 59:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If he has given the client competent advice and ensured that the advice is understood, the solicitor is not in breach of duty innot forcing the client to accept that advice so as to save him from his own folly, ... he is not generally required to remind hisclient of advice once given."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> One can see the logic of this. Once a client has made up his mind to pursue a course of action, alive to the risks associated, itwould be irritating in the extreme to be constantly reminded that he is unwise to be doing so by the person entrusted to do his bestto make it happen, notwithstanding the odds.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Mr Erving did not commit pen to paper as to what it was he said to Mr Delhaise in the early days of their association. He statedfrom the witness box that this was once a personal failing; but no more. Now he does so conscientiously. That may well be so; butfor this case he is in the position of a busy practitioner whose memory is asked to retrieve conversations nearly nine years oldwithout the assistance of a contemporaneous note.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> However there are many other material factors. Mr Delhaise came to the 1994 Action no stranger to litigation. He had mounted a successfulclaim in the 1992 Action, unaided. He had defended and defeated his wife's petition for divorce and then succeeded with his own,also without legal help. He was the author of the original statement of claim in the 1994 Action, and I have already commented onthe high standard of that. From Messrs Edwards and Bleach of counsel he had learned early on of the difficulties. And he is, as Ihave said, well educated and qualified and articulate. He came to Mr Erving already knowledgeable in the law and of his case's shortcomings.So if he was, as Mr Erving attests, told that his chances were slim or words to that effect, he was told nothing new.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> But let me assume for the moment that he was not; that Mr Erving did not as he attests tell him the case was a difficult one. Certainlyin the fullness of time he was told of such difficulties by both counsel who came to represent him. Their advice separately givenwas unequivocal; that proving malice was going to be a struggle; that he would need to provide proof of loss beyond what had alreadybeen won from SW; that the defence of acting in the interests of a client was a viable one.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Thus he had ample opportunity to accept that there were to be problems and pull out at a number of milestones along the way. Thathe did not is a compelling factor towards the proposition that he got the same advice at the outset, from Mr Erving.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> I believe a further important feature of the case is the depth of feeling exhibited by Mr Delhaise against those members of HWG whoplayed a role in the prohibition order having been granted <em>ex parte</em>. References to "Glynn's head on a stake"; "go for the jugular" "until the beast is killed" are graphic and self-evident. Readingand listening to the evidence as a whole, I form the view that whilst monetary compensation was Mr Delhaise's primary motivationin running the 1994 Action, not far behind was a wish, harboured for all the years since 1988, to have HWG members publicly grilledto their discomfort and embarrassment; winning the case was not a necessary function to achieve that.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> I am satisfied that from the outset Mr Delhaise was apprised of the difficulties he faced in prosecuting the 1994 Action. He wasreminded of these as the case progressed to trial by both counsel as well as Mr Erving. He was not interested in behind the doorsresolution (the meeting pre-writ) or a drop hands settlement (the proposal pre-trial).</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> The judge's robust treatment of his case was an unusual approach and one his solicitor and counsel could not have expected. It mayhave been that and the judge's preliminary view on costs that sparked his feeling that he had not been well treated by those representinghim. Perhaps so. But having had the advantage of reading and hearing all the evidence adduced I form the view that Mr Erving didexercise such care and skill to be expected of a reasonably competent solicitor at the outset and thereafter. Given the judge's statedposition after a day and a half of debate, I find there was nothing improper about the advice given to settle at that point, havingregard to the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> There was no breach of contractual duty and no negligence by either of the defendants; the claim fails, with judgment in favour ofthe defendants. Costs, <em>nisi</em> at first instance, are to the defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(D M B Gill)<br />            Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr C Smith, SC, instructed by Messrs Susan Liang &amp; Co., for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr N Kat, instructed by Messrs Herbert Smith, for the 1st and 2nd Defendants</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <appeal>Remarks: Appeal by the Plaintiff to Court of Appeal.
