The plaintiffclaims that he was lawfully travelling as a passenger in the ' back of '  a goods vehicle No. CD9331 which was travelling in a northerlydirection along the highway towards Tuen Mun when a private car registration No. CH7333 driven by the deceased crashed head on intothe front of the goods vehicle. The plaintiff alleges that at the material time, the deceased was driving the car during and in thecourse of his employment with the 2nd defendant as the servant and/or agent of the 2nd defendant. He alleges that the damages resultingfrom the personal injuries which he suffered in the accident were caused by the negligence of the deceased. All the usual particularsof negligence are alleged and in particular, it is alleged that the deceased drove the car in a manner such as to cause or permitit to cross the double white dividing line on the said highway into the carriageway for vehicles proceeding in the opposite direction.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Negligence is admitted by the 1st defendant. However, somewhat surprisingly the 2nd defendant denies that the deceased was negligentat the time.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> I do not propose to waste any time on this matter. I am satisfied that the accident was caused by the negligence of the deceasedwho, allowed his car to cross the double white line and to collide head on with the goods vehicle in question. There being no evidenceto explain why the private car should have done this, the doctrine res ipsa loquitor applies.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The next question which arises on the pleadings is whether the negligence of the deceased caused the personal injuries sustainedby the plaintiff. This issue arose from the fact that there was a second collision very soon after the first collision when a privatecar following the goods vehicle collided with the of side rear of the goods vehicle. Again, at the trial, this issue was not seriouslycontested and I am quite satsfied that the accident and the plaintiff's injuries were a direct result of the negligence of the deceased.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:center" class="heading"><u>VICARIOUS LIABILITY</u></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I come next to the question whether the 2nd defendant should be held vicariously liable for the 1st defendant's negligence. Thisis obviously the most important issue from D2's point of view.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In respect of this allegation, the plaintiff can rely on a number of admissions made on behalf of the 2nd defendant shortly afterthe accident occurred.</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="75%" colspan="2" valign="top">                In the Form 2 (Notice by employer of the death of an employee or of an accident to an employee resulting in deathor incapacity) issued under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282">Cap. 282</a>.

She argues that thepoint is that the 2nd defendant made positive statements in formal legal proceedings as a result of which $140,000 has been paidto the deceased's estate. Therefore, the 2nd defendant must be estopped from denying the fundamental facts on which such judgmentis based. To say otherwise, she argues, makes for injustice. In this regard, she says the court always has an inherent jurisdictionnot to permit the prosecution of proceedings which are vexatious, scandalous or an abuse of the process of the court. She relieson paragraph 18/19/17 of the 1985 White Book, and some of the cases referred to therein. In the alternative, she argues that an estoppelby conduct has been raised to prevent the 2nd defendant from denying the fact that the deceased was acting in the course of his employmentat the time of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> I hold that the 2nd defendant is not estopped from denying these facts. The plaintiff was not a party to the former proceedings andno judgment or decree has been exhibited in this court. Furthermore, he was not a party to the compromise application and he wasnot induced to act in a particular way so as to alter his position as a result of the compromise.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It is therefore open to the 2nd defendant to contest this issue in this court. However, in doing so, the 2nd defendant faces considerabledifficulties in view of all the admissions made very shortly after the accident to the effect that the deceased was acting in thecourse of his employment at the time. For though the burden of proof remains on the plaintiff, the admissions are evidence of theplaintiff's contention. However, I must look at the evidence as a whole and decide whether the plaintiff has succeeded in establishingon the balance of probabilities that the deceased was acting in the course of his employment at the time of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In support of the plaintiff's contention, Miss Lai of the Taiko Royal Insurance Company gave evidence as to the admissions containedin the telephone conversations on the 12th and 16th of November with Mr. Mundell and Mr. Chu respectively. With the consent of thedefence, she put in the notes that she had made at the time of the conversations, exhibits P2 and P3. She is an intelligent, andobviously well educated woman. She was in my view an impartial and honest witness and it seems to me unlikely that she would haveincluded anything in her notes which had not been mentioned to her in these telephone conversations. There appears to be no reasonwhy she should. These telephone conversations had resulted from her receiving a copy of the Form 2 which the 2nd defendant had submittedto the Labour Department which she assumed meant that the insured wished to claim on the policy. It was Miss Lai's task to investigatethe claim on behalf of the insurers. As a result of the information she got from the 2nd defendant in these two telephone conversations,she was satisfied that the deceased was acting in the course of his employment at the time of the accident and $140,000 was in duecourse, paid out by the insurers.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Three witnesses were called by the 2nd defendant on this issue. The first was Mr. Cheung Pui Ming who was the other employee in theprivate car which the deceased was driving at the time of the accident. He testified that on the 2nd November 1981, the weather wasvery bad for the whole day. There being rain, he and the deceased could not do anything. Eventually, they left the construction sitetogether at about 4 o'clock in the deceased's car. He testified that there were two reasons why the 1st defendant took him in thecar. The first was that they were "on the same way" and the second was that "it was the instruction of the company". He explainedwhat he meant by "on the same way" by saying that the deceased lived in Kowloon whereas he himself lived in Tsuen Wan and so, thedeceased will have to pass by Tsuen Wan anyhow, so he would drop him at Tai Wo Hau on the way. He testified that he did not knowwhere the deceased was going to go after dropping him. On the matter of time, he testified that he looked at his watch after leavingthe site and it was about 4 o'clock. However, later in cross-examination, he admitted that it was possible that they had left thesite as early as 3:35 p.m. He further admitted that it would only take about half an hour to get from the place of the accident tothe laboratory in Tokwawan. He also said in cross-examination that "the deceased had his own construction site but whenever he hasgot some problems, he would come to the laboratory in Tokwawan to discuss with Mr. Chu about the problem."</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The second witness for the defence was Mr. Chu Pak Koon. He admitted talking to Mr. Mundell about the accident but he could not recallexactly what he had said. He did, however, remember that he had said the following:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Just a few days before the accident, I have asked Mr. Chiu Kwok Kuen when he has time to come to report to me in respect of the sitebecause he was just posted to that construction site for less than a month and that he was a very responsible person and that hefollowed all the instructions I had given him before. So I told Mr. Mundell that I believed he was coming to make a report to meat that time."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> He explained the basis for his belief as being first that the deceased was a very responsible person, secondly, that the deceasedsometimes came to see him to make reports from other constuction sites on previous occasions, and thirdly ,that when a man has justpassed away, he will only think of his good deeds and never think of the bad side. He maintained that he definitely had not madean appointment to see the deceased that afternoon. He admitted that the deceased's working hours on the 2nd November should be 8:00a.m. to some time after 5:00 or 6:00 p.m., but testified that he did not know where the deceased was going at the time of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> He was cross-examined with regard to his telephone conversation with Miss Lai and said that he did not remember the contents of thetelephone conversation. However he testified under cross-examination that he had told the deceased to come and see him and make areport on a certain matter when he had time. He admitted telling Mr. Mundell that he thought that the deceased was coming to thelaboratory to report to him. Although he claimed he could not remember the contents of the telephone conversation with Miss Lai,he was adamant that he had not told her that the employee had an appointment with him. He did, however, agree that at the time ofthe accident, problems had arisen at the site and these problems made it necessary for the deceased to have a discussion with him.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> I was not greatly impressed with Mr. Chu as reliable witness. His evidence was not consistent and it was contradicted by Miss Lai.Furthermore at one stage, he appeared to suggest that he did not understand that it was necessary for an employee to have sufferedhis injuries in the course of his employment in order to get Workmen's Compensation. Yet, it is clear, in my view, on the evidencethat he fully appreciated the importance of this fact from the point of view of the deceased's family.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The third witness for the 2nd defendant was Mr. Mundell, the gentleman who signed the Form 2, and who had the first of the two telephoneconversations with Miss Lai. He testified that at the time when he filled in the Form 2, he thought that the deceased was almostcertainly on his way home. The reason for this was that it had rained fairly heavily that day and there was no further work on thesite. As such, it was quite normal for sites to close and staff to go home. He thought they would all be going home and he said thatthere was no reason for Mr. Cheung, the other employee, to go to the office at all. He said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Basically, I was informed that the deceased may have been travelling to the office to see Mr. Chu and that the staff felt that thedeceased was entitled to Workmen's Compensation."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>He went on to say that he did not believe that the deceased may have been travelling to the office to see Mr. Chu because the sitehad closed down and under normal circumstances, there was very little cause for the deceased to see Mr. Chu. He did not, in fact,believe that the deceased was going to see Mr. Chu but since he had been told that he was, that was why he completed the form inthat way.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> So far as the telephone conversation with Miss Lai is concerned, he could not even remember having such a conversation. He had thoughtthe matter would be investigated by the insurance company and eventually sorted out by the insurance company and the deceased's family.Despite the fact that he could not remember the telephone conversation with Miss Lai, he denied that he had ever said some of thethings recorded by her in her note, exhibit P2. Under cross-examination, he said that he was very sure in his own mind that the deceasedwas travelling home at the time of the accident and he supported this by saying that there was no logical reason for him to believethat the deceased was travelling to the office to see Mr. Chu. This seems strange in view of his earlier evidence that he was informedthat the deceased may have been travelling to the office or the evidence of Mr. Chu that he had told Mr. Mundell that he had askedthe deceased to go and see him about problems. However Mr. Mundell denied that Mr. Chu had ever told him the latter. He said he wasquite sure of this. His reason for believing that the deceased was going home was because he suspected the motives of Mr. Chu andsome of the staff to obtain Workmen's Compensation for the deceased's family, because he knew there were sympathy resulting froma previous incident. Finally, he said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is what I believe and there were no facts to substantiate the fact that he was going home or that he was going to the office.It is an assumption on my part."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It will be seen that there are contradictions between the evidence of Mr. Chu and Mr. Mundell and between the evidence of both ofthem and that of Miss Lai of the Taiko Royal Insurance Company.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I am satisfied that Mr. Mundell was very shortly after the accident admitting to Miss Lai that he believed that the deceased wastravelling to the Kowloon main office. Mr. Chu in his telephone conversation with Miss Lai not only said that he believed this butsaid that he had an appointment with the deceased at the main office. Both of them have now denied these assertions but I am quitesatisfied that they were, in fact, made to Miss Lai, very shortly after the accident on 12th and 16th November 1981 respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I am satisfied on the evidence as a whole that the plaintiff has established that it was more likely than not that the deceased wasdriving his car to the Kowloon main office at the time of the accident and was in the course of his employment at that time. Indeedthe second defendant has allowed its insurers to pay out a large sum of money on this basis. I, hold that the 2nd defendant is vicariouslyliable in respect of the negligence of the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> There was a further contention on behalf of the plaintiff that, quite independently of this first point, as the deceased was receivingan allowance for the use of his car in driving himself and his colleague to work and back, in addition to his use of his car in theperformance of his duties once he has arrived at the site where he worked or before he left work at the end of the day, he was thusby so driving his car, acting in the course of his employment. A considerable number of authorities have been cited on this point,but in view of my finding above, I do not propose to deal with this aspect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:center"

in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damages, but the damagesrecoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court

class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In <u>Davies</u> v. <u>Swan Motor Company (Swansea) Limited</u>, <sup>(1)</sup> Lord Denning described the position as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The amount of the reduction is such an amount as may be found by the court to be just and equitable, having regard to the claimant's,share in the responsibility, for the damage.

He had been standing on the dust cart's step where he was forbiddento be, and was crushed in the collision, which was in no way cuased or contributed by his presence there. However, because his faultcontributed to his injuries, the damages payable to his widow were reduced by one-fifth.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In <u>Jones</u> v. <u>Livox Quarries Limited</u>, <sup>(2)</sup> Denning L.J. at page 615 said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Although contributory negligence does not depend on a duty of care, it does depend on foreseeability. Just as actionable negligencerequires the foreseeability of harm to others, so contributory negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to oneself. A personis guilty of contributory negligence if he ought reasonably to have foreseen that, if he did not act as a reasonable, prudent man,he might be hurt himself; and in his reckoning he must take into account the possibility of others being careless."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> This test was adopted by Edmund Davies L.J. in <u>O'Connell</u> v. <u>Jackson.</u> <sup>(3)</sup></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> In <u>Jones</u> v. <u>Livox Quarries Limited</u>, <sup>(2)</sup> the plaintiff was injured while standing on the towbar at the back of a traxcavator into which a dumper vehicle collided from behindcausing the plaintiff to suffer serious injuries. The conduct of standing on the towbar had been expressly forbidden by his employer.In the course of his judgment, Denning L.J. said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Once negligence is proved, then no matter whether it is actionable negligence or contributory negligence, the person who is guiltyof it must bear his proper share of responsibility for the consequences. The consequences do not depend on foreseeability, but oncausation. The question in every case is: What faults were there which caused the damage? Was his fault one of them? The necessityof causation is shown by the word 'result' in section (1) of the Act of 1945, and it was accepted by this court in Davies v. SwanMotor Co. (Swansea) Ltd.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p class="quote">        There is no clear guidance to be found in the books about causation. All that can be said is that causes are different fromthe circumstances in which, or on which, they operate. The line between the two depends on the facts of each case.

It is often a relevant factor, but it is not decisive.Even though the plaintiff did not foresee the possibility of being crushed, nevertheless in the ordinary plain common sense of thisbusiness the injury suffered by the plaintiff was due in part to the fact that he chose to ride on the towbar to lunch instead ofwalking down on his feet."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> In that case, the Court of Appeal approved the trial judge's assessment that the plaintiff was one-fifth to blame for his injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> In <u>O'Connell</u> v. <u>Jackson</u>, <sup>(3)</sup> the facts were that a moped rider was hurt when a car collided with his moped. The car driver was responsible for the accident, butthe moped rider's injuries would not have been so severe if he had been wearing a crash helmet. At that time, it was not compulsoryfor him to wear a crash helmet, but the Highway Code advised "When on a motor-cycle, scooter or moped, always wear a safety helmet".The judge took the view that due to the short time before the accident that that particular edition of the Highway Code had beenissued, it was seriously open to doubt that the driver of the moped would have seen a copy of it. However, in that case, there wasevidence that the plaintiff was alive to the risk and had only himself to blame for failing to remedy the omission. He was held 15%to blame for his injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In the present case, the defendants rely upon the seat belt cases.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In <u>Froom and others</u> v. <u>Butcher</u>, <sup>(4)</sup> it was held that the reduction of damages for failure to wear a seat belt should be 25% for those injuries which would have beenprevented by wearing a belt and 15% for injuries which would have been less severe and that there should be no reduction if the injurieswould have been the same if a belt had been worn. The Court of Appeal approved the trial judge's overall assessment of 20% responsibilityfor his injuries.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> At the time when this decision was made, it was not compulsory for passengers in a vehicle to wear seat belts, although it was compulsoryfor them to be fitted in motor vehicles in the front seats.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> That case was followed in <u>Patience</u> v<u>.

I come now to the facts in this case.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Facts</u></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The plaintiff was a passenger in the back of a goods vehicle. On board, the goods vehicle were about 25 to 26 bags of powder whichwere described by the plaintiff as being 18" x 24" "just like size of cement". They were stacked in the middle of the tail compartmentof the goods vehicle on a wooden rack or pallet, of the sort which is suitable for being lifted by a fork lift truck. The bags weretied together but not secured in any way to the sides of the goods vehicle. Each bag weighed about 50 kilos. At the front of thetail compartment of the goods vehicle and immediately behind the driver's cabin, were two rows of plastic containers of Nitric Acideach weighing about 10 kilos. The plaintiff had positioned himself between the pile of bags and the containers of Nitric Acid. Hehad taken one of the bags down from the top of the stack of bags and was half sitting on it and half leaning on the remaining bagsbehind him. He was facing the driver's cabin. When the accident happened, the evidence is that the pallet slid across the floor ofthe tail compartment of the goods vehicle towards the driver's cabin. Both the plaintiff and the stack of bags were thrown forward.The plaintiff ended up facing the driver cabin with his feet touching it and all the bags were infront of him. He does not rememberprecisely what happened but it is clear from his evidence and that of the driver of the goods vehicle that afterwards the plaintiffwas partially trapped under some bags of powder. Indeed, it was not until the firemen arrived after the accident that he was extricated.The plaintiff sustained "a left knee injury with torn interior crociate and medial collateral ligaments and a fracture of the transverseprocess of the first lumbar vertebra".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Mr. Wedderburn in his report of the 29th April 1985, exhibit P4(c), stated that the injury to the knee is usually a result of a manbeing either struck on the outside of the knee or having the affected leg firmly on the ground while making a turning movement. Hesaid it is a common injury in skiing when an attempt is made to make a sharp turn and the other leg turns but the affected ski isheld by the snow.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Although it is very difficult to say exactly how these injuries occurred, it seems to me that there is a possibility that they werecaused to some extent by the fact that the bags of powder were propelled against him and fell on top of him. On the other hand itis possible that being propelled forward onto the plastic containers to the driver's cabin, his knee was somehow wrenched.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> I will now examine the ways in which it is alleged that the plaintiff was at fault.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> The first way in which it is claimed that the plaintiff was at fault is that he did not securely position himself. I do not considerthat there is anything in this allegation as there were no seats or belts provided in the tail compartment.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> The second allegation is that he did not sit properly. Again, I can see nothing in this allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> It will be convenient to consider the third and fourth allegations together.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The third allegation is that he did not securely position the goods while the fourth allegation is that he did not take any or adequateprecautions.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Rule 99(1) of the Road Traffic (Construction and Use) Regulations, which were in force at the time of the accident, provided:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Every motor vehicle, every trailer drawn thereby and all parts and accessories of such vehicle and trailer shall at all times bein such condition, and the number of passengers carried by, and the weight, distribution, packing and adjustment of the load, ofsuch vehicle or trailer shall at all times be such that no danger is caused or is likely to be caused to any person on the vehicleor trailer or on a road."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> It is clear that the plaintiff in this case was lawfully in the tail compartment of the goods vehicle and was a passenger at whoseprotection this regulation was aimed. It was the duty of the person or persons responsible for loading the vehicle to ensure thatthe plaintiff by reason of the fact that he had to travel in the back of the vehicle would not be endangered by the weight distributionpacking or adjustment of the load.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Mr. Leung, the third witness for the plaintiff, who was the owner of the goods vehicle gave evidence to the effect that he does notgive instructions to his workers as to how the goods are to be loaded into the back of his lorries. He said: "They ought to knowwhat to do".</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> Mr. Lee, the second witness for the plaintiff, who was the lorry driver stated quite categorically in the witness box that it wasnot necessary that the bags should be secured.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The plaintiff himself testified that there was no need to tie the tins or the bags down "because they were not such goods". He saidcartons of recording tapes or refrigerators were the sort of goods which were tied down. He testified that the goods on board atthe time of the accident were the sort of goods which were delivered every day and that before the accident it had never been necessaryto tie them down because the sides of the tail compartment were fenced off by the boards, so even if they extended for the wholearea of the tail compartment, they would not fall out. He admitted that he hadn't contemplated that he might be hurt in an accidentin the way he was. He said that there were no ropes or cables provided to secure the goods to the vehicle and there was no necessityto tie goods down when there was a small quantity of goods.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> It would be difficult to say that the injuries which the plaintiff suffered would not have occurred if the goods had been securedto the vehicle in some way. The forces exerted in a head on collision are very powerful. Dr. S. Lingard who is a consulting engineerwith the Hong Kong University Department of Mechanical Engineering, gave expert evidence on the forces involved. He made a calculationon the basis of the speed of the goods vehicle and the speed of the private car both travelling at 35 mp.h. towards one another andtaking into consideration their respective weights and based on a coefficient of restitution of 1.15 he came to a conclusion thatthe result indicates a value for the impulse applied to both vehicles during the impact of 33 kNs. This corresponds he said witha maximum force during the impact of about 660 kN (66.4 Ton f). It appears from the evidence that the speeds of the vehicles werenot greatly different from those assumed by Dr. Lingard for his calculations.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> In this case, there is no clear indication that the plaintiff had the say in the way in which those particular goods were loaded.It seems highly probable on the evidence that the goods were placed in the vehicle by the use of a fork-lift truck and that becauseof the weight and size of the load, it was not felt necessary that any further precautions should be taken. What was done was donein accordance with the usual practice. No ropes or belts or cables were supplied by his employer to secure the goods in place, otherthan those which secured the bags in a pile before being placed on top of the wooden pallet. At the time of the accident, the plaintiffwas not in any way acting contrary to any instructions from his employer, he was doing what was usually done.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> In all the circumstances, taking into consideration the test of causation and blameworthiness, I consider that if there was any faulton the part of the plaintiff which might have contributed to his own injuries, it was so minimal and the contribution so speculativeas to be of no practical significance. In the circumstances, I will not make any reduction from the damages to be awarded in thiscase on the basis of contributory negligence.</p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:center" class="heading"><u>QUANTUM</u></p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> The plaintiff sets out his particulars of injuries as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td width="62%" colspan="3" valign="top" class="quote">                The plaintiff's injuries included:-                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="21%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">(i)</td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote"></td>            <td width="54%" valign="top" class="quote">                left knee injury with torn anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments;                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="21%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">(ii)</td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote"></td>            <td width="54%" valign="top" class="quote">                fracture of transverse process of 1st lumbar vertebra;                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="21%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">(iii)</td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote"></td>            <td width="54%" valign="top" class="quote">                left upper abdominal pain;                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="21%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote">(iv)</td>            <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:right" class="quote"></td>            <td width="54%" valign="top" class="quote">                left loin pain.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="21%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td width="62%" valign="top" colspan="3" class="quote">                The plaintiff was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital shortly after the accident on 2nd of November 1981 wherehe was treated conservatively.

Dr. Wedderburn, however, was not prepared to agree with that but he didsay that in addition to the physiotherapy which he was receiving at the Out-Patient Department, the plaintiff was advised to do exercisesat home to build up the wasted muscles. He did express the opinion that he would have been very surprised if the plaintiff had donethe exercises at home in between the physiotherapy sessions because the muscle wasting was so gross. Dr. Wedderburn pointed out infairness to the plaintiff that he had had 7 or 8 months of physiotherapy, 3 times a week under supervision and he had also had anoperation and he may well have lost faith in physiotherapy as an essential agent.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> It does seem that the plaintiff in this case did not show a great deal of perserverance in carrying out the exercises which he hadbeen advised to do at home. He had been seen 3 times by Dr. Wedderburn and on the second occasion when he was seen on the 28th October1983 and when Dr. Wedderburn informed him that there had been considerable improvement in the muscle redevelopment of the left thighhe strongly denied this and became quite indignant. It would appear that the plaintiff is not a man of great perseverance and determination,with a very postive outlook but it seems to me that a person who commits a tort on another person must take that person as he findshim. All persons do not have the same degree of courage and perseverance.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> I have been referred to a number of authorities with a view to assessing the damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities. Thenearest to the present case is <u>Yu Man Chui</u> v. <u>Chow Chi Fun</u> <sup>(8)</sup> where an award of $20,000 was made. There, it would appear that the victim made a more speedy recovery than the plaintiff in thepresent case. Furthermore, in that case, osteoarthritis was inevitable. In the present case, of course, there was the fracture ofthe transverse process of the first lumbar vertabra, and the pain and suffering and convalescence lasted longer. I consider thatfor the purpose of assessing the quantum of damages under this head, these two cases are not greatly dissimilar. Making an allowancefor inflation, I consider that the plaintiff in the former case would have been awarded something in excess of $26,000 today. I considerin all the circumstances $30,000 is an appropriate assessment in the present case and I so award.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Special Damages</u></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Of the special damages, a number of items have been agreed, namely:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="8%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">Hospital expenses at the Princess Margaret Hospital and Caritas</td>            <td width="12%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$380</td>            <td width="12%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="8%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">Physiotherapy</td>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">$714</td>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="8%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">Clothing</td>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">  $18</td>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="8%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="68%" valign="top">Travelling expenses</td>            <td width="12%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$648</td>            <td width="12%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Bonesetter's fees were disputed in this case. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> The plaintiff claimed $1,000 under this head representing 20 visits at $50 a time. However, when he was giving evidence, he couldnot remember the exact number of times he had been to the bonesetter and he could produce no receipts. He thought it was 10 odd timesto 20 times. It is quite clear from his evidence that he believed that the treatment which he received from the bonesetter was doinghim some good. This evidence was not very precise but I consider that it would be reasonable in the circumstances to assess a figureof $500 under this head.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> So far as tonic foods are concerned, Mr. Ozorio for. the 1st defendant did not wish to address me and Mr. Spicer for the 2nd defendantappeared to accept that the figure claimed was more than reasonable. The amount claimed by the plaintiff for tonic food was $168and I will accept and assess the damages accordingly.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">Loss of Earnings</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Pre-trial loss of earnings</u></p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> There is evidence that at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was on probation earning $1,700 per month. He was on sick leavefrom the 2nd November 1981 (the date of accident) until the 31st August 1983;. From the latter date until he started work with SunDairy Industrial Company Limited as a moulding machine operator in June 1984, he had part time jobs and his total earnings duringthis period were $2,500. His average monthly earning with the Sun Dairy Industrial Company Limited since the beginning of June 1984until the present time is $2,496.53 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> Mr. Ozorio for the 1st defendant submits that the plaintiff was fit for sedentary work as from at least the 1st November 1982 relyingupon an answer given by Dr. Wedderburn in cross-examination. However, Dr. Wedderburn qualified his earlier reply later on by sayingthat he had known some who had gone back to work when they were on sick leave, but it was one in a thousand. I do not consider thatit would be reasonable to reduce the damages on the basis that the plaintiff could have gone back to any sort of work whilst he wason sick leave.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> Miss Bridges for the plaintiff submits that I should take a figure of $2,287.50 as his loss of earnings per month during the periodthat he was on sick leave and through to the time he started working for Sun Dairy. This is based on the evidence of his former employerto the effect that although the plaintiff was earning $1,700 at the time of the accident, he was on probation at that time and thatas soon as he had finished his probation, he would become a permanent worker and would get what he should get as a permanent worker.He testified that if the plaintiff had carried on working with him, he would have been earning the same as his replacement.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> On the strength of this, Miss Bridges asked the court to assess his loss of earnings on the basis that he would have earned a medianfigure of $2,287.50 for 31 months from the 2nd November 1981 until the end of May 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> I consider that for the purpose of calculating his loss of earnings during the pre-trial period, the calculation should be basedon 3 periods. The first is from the date of the accident until the end of his sick leave on the 31st August 1983, a period of some22 months.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> The second period should be from the end of his sick leave until the day he started working with Sun Dairy at the beginning of June1984, a period of some 9 months.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> The third period is from June 1984 until the present time, a period of some 12 months.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> So far as the first period is concerned, I do not consider $2,287.50 per month is an accurate figure for his monthly earnings. Itseems reasonably clear on the evidence that his probation period was almost over. His former employer Mr. Leung Choi Wan (PW3) testifiedthat when the plaintiff came to work for him, he had no experience in this trade before and so his starting salary was a bit lower.When he finished probation he would get what a permanent worker gets which would be what his replacement Mr. Leung Hon Bun earned.He gave evidence of Mr. Leung Hon Bun's earnings as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="60%" valign="top">1/11/81 -

Therewas evidence that he could have earned approximately 50% of his monthly wage at some stage during this time as a rattan worker. However,he did not accept the job which had been found for him under the selective placement scheme of the Labour Department. I do not considerthat he did enough to mitigate his damages during this period.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> For this period I assess his loss of earnings as half what his replacement earned</p>    <table border="0" width="101%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" rowspan="2"></td>            <td width="18%" style="text-align:center"><u>$39,000</u></td>            <td width="69%" rowspan="2">x 1/2 x 9 = $14,525</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="18%" style="text-align:center">    12</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> The third period covers the last 12 months while he has been working for Sun Dairy. The evidence is that during this period, accordingto the schedule of his earnings during this time (Exhibit P6), he has earned on average $2,496.53 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> Mr. Ozorio for the 1st defendant challenges this figure as not being representative of the plaintiff's "working capacity" becauseit includes three short periods when the plaintiff's earnings dropped dramatically when he went back to China.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> The evidence was, however, that he would earn $60 per day over a period of some 26 working days. It would appear that the calculationof his average earnings takes into account a considerable amount of overtime and in my view that more than makes up for the 3 lowearning periods. I consider the figure of $2,496.53 to be a fair figure as representing his current earnings during this third period.That means that his loss of earnings during this period is:</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> $3,100 - $2,496.53 = $603.47 x 12 = $7,241.64</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> His total loss of earnings to date therefore is:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:right">$50,850.00</p>                <p style="text-align:right">$14,525.00</p>                <p style="text-align:right"><u>  $7,241.64</u></p>                <p style="text-align:right">$72,716.64</p>            </td>            <td width="50%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> It is agreed that from this figure must be deducted the total of sums he received from his former employer by way of Employees' Compensation,namely $33,580.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> That leaves a sum representing loss of earnings of $39,136.64.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading"><u>Loss of Future Earnings</u></p>    <p><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> The evidence is that if the plaintiff was still working for his former employer he would be earning $3,100 per month. He is in factearning with Sun Dairy $2,496.53 per month. That represents a shortfall of $603.47 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> He is now 30 years of age. Miss Bridges asks me to adopt a multiplier of 14 to calculate his loss of future earnings.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> Mr. Ozorio disputes that there will be any loss of future earnings due to the fact that there was evidence from Mr. Lee Kwan Yeeof Sun Dairy that when a moulding machine operator has 3 years experience his salary will be increased from $60 per day to $80 or$90 per day, a rise of approximately 33.3% to 50%.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> Miss Bridges asks me to ignor the possible advantages plaintiff may reap from his new job in the future but look at the earningsnow.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> I consider that I must take into account the future benefits the plaintiff will get from his present employment. In another 2 yearstime he can expect his earnings to rise dramatically and he will be better off than he would have been had he stayed with his formeremployer. So although he will be suffering a monthly loss for the next 2 years, this will be more than compensated for in the yearsahead when he will be earning a better wage.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> In the circumstances I do not consider that any award should be made for loss of future earnings.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> I assess and award damages as follows :-</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> Special Damages</p>    <table border="0" width="73%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top">Hospital Expenses</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$380.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top">Physiotherapy</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$714.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top">Clothing</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">   $18.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top">Travelling Expenses</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$648.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top">Bonesetter</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$500.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top">Tonic Foods</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$168.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top">Loss of Earnings to trial</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$39,136.64</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">_________</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$41,564.64</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top"><u>General Damages</u></td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$30,000.00</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">_________</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="52%" valign="top">Grand Total</td>            <td width="34%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">$71,564.64</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> I give judgment for the plaintiff against both defendants in this sum.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> Finally I come to the 2nd Defendant's claim for indemnity against the 1st Defendant.
