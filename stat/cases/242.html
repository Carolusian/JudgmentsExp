The 1st/2nd Defendants and the 3rd Defendant were sued severally in the action herein and not jointly, or in the alternative.</p>    <p>2. The 1st and 2nd Defendants having made payment into Court and accepted by the Plaintiff within the stipulated time of 14 days thereafter,the Plaintiff is entitled to accept money paid into Court in satisfaction of all the causes of action in respect of which he claimsagainst the paying-in 1st/2nd Defendants without leave of the Court by giving notice in writing in accordance with O.22, r.3(1) andunder O.62, r.10(2). By the same order, he is also entitled to tax his costs of the action incurred up to the time of giving Noticeof Acceptance which should only include his costs of action incurred against the 1st and 2nd Defendants.</p>    <p>3. If the Plaintiff herein wished, as he did, to discontinue his action against the other Co-Defendant, i.e. the 3rd Defendant herein,he could apply for leave to discontinue the action against him. As the parties agreed that the action against the 3rd Defendant shouldbe discontinued, the Court has jurisdiction to consider what is the appropriate order of costs as between the Plaintiff and the 3rdDefendant, including whether the 1st and 2nd Defendants in this case should pay the Plaintiff's costs incurred in bringing the actionagainst the 3rd Defendant and the 3rd Defendant's own costs in defending the action.</p>    <p>4. In exercising that discretion in this case, where the Plaintiff and the 1st/2nd Defendants both have already agreed not to askfor an order that the 3rd Defendant should pay its own costs, the Court considered that it is not unreasonable for the Plaintiffto pursue this action against the 3rd Defendant as well and to maintain the same until the 1st and 2nd Defendants made payment intoCourt. Accordingly, the Court exercises its discretion against the 1st and 2nd Defendants in favour of the Plaintiff and the 3rdDefendant and a Sanderson Order is made that the 1st and 2nd Defendants should pay the costs of the 3rd Defendant directly and thePlaintiff's costs of prosecuting the claim against the 3rd Defendant.</p>    <p>5. The 1st and 2nd Defendants should also pay the costs of the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant in the Amended Summons including thecosts of the adjournment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p style="text-align:right">HCA5570/96</p>    <p style="text-align:center">IN THE HIGH COURT OF THE</p>    <p style="text-align:center">HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION</p>    <p style="text-align:center">COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE</p>    <p style="text-align:center">ACTION NO.5570 OF 1996</p>    <p style="text-align:center">------------</p>    <!--sino section party --><parties>        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="25%">BETWEEN</td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="25%"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">GENERAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE ASIA LIMITED (NEW ZEALAND INSURANCE CO LTD)</td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="25%">Plaintiff</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="25%"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="25%"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">AND</td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="25%"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="25%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="25%"></td>                <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">HAMPTON WINTER &amp;

It was lost in October 1990 in the premises of theHong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. Having paid its assured in January 1991, it became entitled to bring a subrogated claim against theparties responsible or liable for the loss of the said cargo.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In December 1990, the Plaintiff's Singapore office had retained the 3rd Defendant to assist in investigating the Plaintiff's claim.Shortly afterwards, the 1st Defendant was appointed to advise and act on the Plaintiff's behalf in bringing the Plaintiff's claimagainst the parties responsible.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In January 1992, the 3rd Defendant re-instructed and retained the 2nd Defendant, a solicitor of a firm of solicitors, the 1st Defendant,to handle the aforesaid Plaintiff's claim.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In August 1992, the 1st and 2nd Defendants, commenced proceedings on the Plaintiff's claim against Singapore Airlines Limited andHACTL in Action No.CL88/1992.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> On 1 May 1995, by an order concluding CL88 action, the Plaintiff's claim was lost and it became liable to pay the cost of HACTL andSingapore Airlines. Thereafter the Plaintiff settled Singapore Airlines' costs at $400,000 from its claim at $1.3 million odd therefor.HACTL's claim for cost at $800,000 odd is still pending.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The Plaintiff has also incurred fees and disbursements in CL88 in the sums of about $120,000 and ï¿¡2,000 odd. The Plaintiff is alsoliable for the balance of costs incurred and charged to it by and due to the 1st and 2nd Defendants and the Third Party herein. TheThird Party is another firm of solicitors when the 2nd Defendant in and after April 1995 changed his job from the 1st Defendant tothe Third Party.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In the action before me, the Plaintiff claims against the three Defendants for breaches of contracts and negligence. However, thePlaintiff's respective contracts with the 1st Defendant (a firm of solicitors) and the 3rd Defendant (recovery agent) are differentcontracts. Each one is liable to the Plaintiff (if at all) for breaches of its own contract.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The Plaintiff's claim in negligence against the 1st and 2nd Defendants on one hand and the 3rd Defendant on the other are in respectof different duties of care. Different particulars of negligence have been pleaded against the 1st/2nd Defendants and the 3rd Defendantrespectively. In short, whilst the Plaintiff claims against all three Defendants for breaches of contracts and negligence in handlingCL88, the causes of action against each of them are different.</p>    <p class="heading">I. Joint/in the Alternative Or Several Claims</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The relevance of distinguishing a joint claim or a claim in the alternative on one hand and several claims on the other is this :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1. Where the Plaintiff sues a number of Defendants whose liability are "joint" or "alternative" :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) a payment into Court by some but not all the defendants cannot be paid out to the plaintiff without an order of the Court : seeO.22, r.4(1)(a) which provided as follows :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"><em>"4.

Where the plaintiff sues a number of defendants whose liabilities are "several" (i.e. neither joint nor alternative) :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) a payment into Court by some but not all the defendants can be paid out to the plaintiff <em>without</em> an order of the Court : see O.22, r.3(6) which provided that :-</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">" (6) A plaintiff who has accepted any sum paid into court shall, subject to rules 4 and 10 and Order 80, rule 12, be entitled toreceive payment of that sum in satisfaction of the cause or causes of action to which the acceptance relates."</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) The stay of proceedings under O.22, r.3(4) only applies as regards to those claims against the paying-in defendants but not asregards those against the non-paying defendants. (See the case of <em>Townsend v. Stone Toms</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%201153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 WLR 1153)</a></p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Accordingly it is important to distinguish between whether the causes of action are joint or in the alternative, or several. Thequestion of joint and several torts has been considered in <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em>, 17th Ed. 1995. In paragraph 4-54, it has been said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Joint and several torts.</em> Where damage is caused as the result of torts committed by two or more tortfeasors, the tortfeasors may be (1) joint tortfeasors,(2) several tortfeasors causing the same damage or (3) several tortfeasors causing different damage. In one of a number of jointtortfeasors, or of several tortfeasors causing the same damage, is sued alone, he is liable for the whole damage, though he did buta small part of it. In the case of several tortfeasors causing different damage, on the other hand, each is liable only for the damagewhich he has caused."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Further at paragraph 4-56, in respect of joint tortfeasors, it has been said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Definition of joint tortfeasors.</em> Who, then, are joint tortfeasors? One way of answering the question is to see whether the cause of action against each tortfeasoris the same. If the same evidence would support an action against each, they are joint tortfeasors. They will be jointly liable fora tort which they both commit or for the commission of which they are both responsible, but not for a tort where each is responsiblefor a different <em>injuria</em> and the two <em>injuriae</em> happen to produce the same <em>damnum</em>."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> However in the case before me the Plaintiff's claims against the 1st/2nd Defendants and the 3rd Defendant are for breaches of differentcontracts. The claim in negligence is also in respect of different duties of care. Different particulars of negligence have beenpleaded against the 1st/2nd Defendants and the 3rd Defendant respectively. Thus, the contractual liabilities cannot possibly be regardedas "joint". The liabilities of the 1st/2nd Defendants and the 3rd Defendant in negligence cannot be joint either.

With respect to Otton J in a case fallingwithin Ord 62, r 5(4), to which because the causes of action against two or more defendants are several, Ord 62, r 4 does not apply,I hold that a court has no discretion. Either the words 'his costs of the action' relate in every case to the costs incurred by theplaintiffs against other defendants or in no case does it do so."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Judge Fox-Andrews Q.C. decided that the latter is the case, i.e. "his costs of their action" does not relate to the costs incurredby the plaintiffs against the other non-paying defendants. He continued on to say (at p.71) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" In such a case the giving of written notice does not automatically stay proceedings against another defendant. In the absence ofagreement by another defendant, an application to discontinue or withdraw the claim against him must be made and it is then a matterof discretion whether to accede to the application and if so on what terms. These circumstances militate strongly against the words'his costs of the action' relating to any costs other than the costs he incurred in pursuing the claim against the defendant whohas made the payment in. I follow the decision in <em>QBE Ltd v Mediterranean Insurance</em>. Had the plaintiffs themselves given written notice of acceptance, then the only costs they could recover would be the costs thatthey had incurred in suing the first defendants."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In short, Judge Fox-Andrews said he followed Webster, J. in <strong>Q.B.E.</strong> rather than Otton J. in <strong>Hodgson</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Did Otton J. decide in <strong>Hodgson</strong> that the Court has no jurisdiction? The headnote said he did :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>Held</em> -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The court's discretion under RSC Order 62, rule 5(4) to order a paying-in defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the action waswide enough to include not only the costs to co-defendants but also the plaintiff's costs of proceeding against the co-defendantsif the circumstances justified such an order."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The case of <strong>Hodgson</strong> has to be considered in more detail. This case involved a plaintiff who suffered personal injuries when she inhaled noxious fumeswhich had escaped from the premises adjourning the premises where she worked. The plaintiff had been evacuated from her work premiseswhen the fumes were first noticed and inhaled the fumes when she returned to her work after being told by the local fire brigadeand the police that it was safe to return. The action was brought by her for damages against :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1. D1, her employer;</p>        <p>2. D2, the owner of the premises from where the fumes escaped;</p>        <p>3. D3, the local fire authority; and</p>        <p>4. D4, the police.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> By their defences, D1, D3 and D4 denied liability and blamed each other.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> D2, however, denied liability and alleged contributory negligence only on the part of the Plaintiff. Shortly before the trial, the2nd defendant paid into Court in satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim against them. The plaintiff, who wished to accept the amountpaid in and to discontinue the action against the other defendants on the basis that they paid their own costs, applied for her costsof the proceedings against all the defendants to be paid by the 2nd defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Otton J. eventually held, in all the circumstances of the case, that the plaintiff was entitled to have her costs of the proceedingagainst all the defendants to be paid by the 2nd defendant. (I shall come back to this point as to how he exercised his discretion.)At page 827 of his judgment, he relied on the old <em>Supreme Court Practice 1988</em> Vol.1 paragraph 22/4/2 where it was stated that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The term 'sued jointly' in this rule does not mean the same thing as 'joint liability', but only that other defendants have beenjoint together in this action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At page 828, Otton J. said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" That leaves the question as to the construction of Ord 62, r 5(4), and in particular the phrase to which I have made reference.I reject the narrow construction urged by Mr Bennett. It seems to me that the expression 'his costs' permits the court to order thepayment by the defendant making the payment in of costs over and above those directly incurred by the plaintiff in bringing the actionagainst the paying-in party alone. In arriving at that conclusion I have considered the commentary on Ord 22, r 3 in The <em>Supreme Court Practice 1988</em> vol I, pp 383-386, and in particular para 22/3/4 under the heading 'Effect of acceptance on claim'."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Insofar as the decision in <strong>Hodgson</strong> decided that O.62, r.5(4) in England [which is equivalent to our O.62, r.10(2)] was wide enough to include not only the costs ofco-defendants but also the plaintiff's costs of proceeding against the co-defendants if the circumstances justify such an order,I agree with Judge Fox-Andrews that it was <em>not</em> wide enough and a court has no jurisdiction under O.62, r.5(4) in England [our O.62, r.10(2)].</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> However, Otton J. also decided the case on the concession of Counsel for the 2nd defendant and on the wider discretion given to theCourt. At page 828, he said this :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" As I understand it, Mr Bennett [Counsel for the 2nd Defendants] conceded that Ord 62 entitles the court to order the second defendants,who are the paying-in defendants, to pay the other defendants' costs. But he still maintains that it is not wide enough to coverthe plaintiff's costs incurred against a co-defendant. I do not think that on a proper construction his contention is good law andif one takes the concession that he appears to have made I do not see why the matter should stop there. In my judgment the discretiongiven to this court and the power given to this court is very wide indeed and is certainly wide enough not only to order the paying-indefendant to pay the costs of the co-defendants but also to cover the plaintiff's costs incurred against co-defendants if the circumstancesjustify."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It is actually in line with the construction of Webster J. in the case of <strong>Q.B.E.</strong> (which was said to be followed by Judge Fox-Andrew in <strong>Fell</strong>). Webster J. in <strong>Q.B.E.</strong> actually did <em>not</em> decide that the Court has no jurisdiction at all. He just decided that the jurisdiction did not come under r.5(2) and the words "itscosts of the action" can only be construed as meaning, "his costs of action as against that defendants" i.e. the paying-in defendant.However, he considered that the Court also has jurisdiction when the plaintiff applied to recover from a defendant, who had paid-in,the Plaintiff's costs against the other defendants. The facts of the case in <strong>Q.B.E.</strong> are somewhat different if examined more closely.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> In that case the paying-in 2nd Defendant paid the taxed costs of the Plaintiff in bringing the action against them. The 1st Defendantwho had agreed to pay the Plaintiff's costs in bringing the action against them did not eventually pay that set of costs as taxed.There was simply no order obtained by the Plaintiff that the 2nd Defendant should also pay that set of costs in respect of the 1stDefendant, i.e. the Plaintiff's costs in bringing the action against the 1st Defendant. It is not surprising that the writ of <em>fi fa</em> should not be obtained against the 2nd Defendant for the Plaintiff's costs against the 1st Defendant when there was simply no orderof costs against them in that respect. Accordingly when O.62, r.5(4) is not wide enough to cover that set of costs, the writ of <em>fi fa</em> must be set aside.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> However, Webster J. did say as I have said before, that the Court would have jurisdiction should the Plaintiff applied for such anorder. At p.576 F-H Webster, J. said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" In order to avoid injustice, therefore, in the application of rule 5(3) and (4) the words 'his costs of the action' need to be construedas meaning, in paragraph (3) 'his costs of the action as against that party' and, in paragraph (4), 'his costs of the action againstthat defendant.' I do not see how this construction can do injustice to anyone. It is convenient to note that the provisions of rule5 create an automatic right to costs without any order; in those circumstances the order should, in my view, be strictly construedso as to avoid any possible injustice, not in any particular case, but in any particular category of cases. I therefore construethe words 'his costs of the action' in paragraph (4) in the way I have just described. Construed in that way, the rule is much lesslikely to cause injustice than the wider and more literal construction and, <em>if it can cause any injustice at all, it would be open to a plaintiff, who could reasonably claim to be entitled to recover from adefendant who had paid in his costs against the other defendants, to apply for such an order which the court would, in my view, havejurisdiction to make.</em>" (<em>emphasis added</em>)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> In other words this case did not decide whether there was such a jurisdiction but by way of obiter, Webster J. said the Court didhave jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The second case relied on by Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Defendants herein is <strong>Carrs Bury St Edmunds Limited v. Whitworth Partnership and Barnes Group</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%2013%20Construction%20Law%20Journal%20198" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 13 Const LJ 198.</a> Here, there are two defendants, the contractor (Barnes) and the architect (Whitworth). Barnes made the payment into Court in March1996. Carrs did not accept the payments-in made by only one Defendant. The next month in April 1996, Whitworth also made a paymentinto Court. Within 21 days of that payments-in, Carrs indicated that it wished to accept both payments-in and indicating that leavewould be needed to accept, and that it thought that a special cost order would be needed in respect of the two sums of payments-in.Carrs, thereupon issued a Summons for the Court's order as to who should bear the costs incurred by Barnes after March 1996, i.e.21 days after Barnes' payments-in. Judge Esyr Lewis Q.C. followed the case of <strong>Fell</strong> and decided that the Court has no jurisdiction or discretion to make any order other than that in <em>RSC</em> O.65, r.5(4). However, the Court also decided that, where a plaintiff is given leave to accept payments-in after 21 days, the Courtshould only exercise its discretion as to costs when there are exceptional and compelling reasons for so doing. In the present case,there were no such reasons and Carrs should therefore bear the costs incurred by Barnes after March 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> For the same reason given herein before and below, I, with respect, would not follow the decisions of <strong>Fell</strong> and <strong>Carrs</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Consequently the next question is where does that wider discretion and jurisdiction come from?</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I agree with Counsel for the Plaintiff herein that the Court's jurisdiction and discretion can come from O.21, r.3 and s.52A of the<em>Supreme Court Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap.4</a>.</em></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Order 21, r.2 provided that leave to discontinue an action is not required within 14 days of the filing of the defence of a defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Order 21, r.3 provided that such leave is necessary otherwise as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"3.

In such an application under O.21,r.3, the Court has jurisdiction to grant leave on such terms as to costs as <em>it thinks just</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Two further decisions of the Court of Appeal in England are also helpful. First in the case of <strong>Goldsworthy v. Brickell and Another</strong> [1987] 1 Ch.378, the plaintiff, a widower aged 85, sued the 1st defendant tenant for rescission of the tenancy agreement on the groundof undue inference. Alternatively, he also sued his former solicitors for negligence in failing to advise him with regard to hisright to have the tenancy agreement rescinded.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> The trial Judge Goulding J. found that there was undue inference but the 1st defendant's defence of promissory estoppel succeededand therefore the plaintiff's claim for rescission failed. He also dismissed the alternative claim against the solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> On appeal, the Court of Appeal (Parker and Nourge L.JJ. and Sir John Megaw) reversed the decision on the issue of promissory estoppeland decided in favour of the plaintiff against the 1st defendant in that the plaintiff had not affirmed the agreement and the defenceof promissory estoppel could not succeed. Accordingly, the tenancy agreement was set aside. In respect of costs, Parker L.J. saidat page 417 :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" PARKER L.J. So far as the question of costs is concerned, we are entirely satisfied not only that it was reasonable for the plaintiffto join the defendant solicitors as soon as the matter in paragraph 21 had been raised; but that it would have been extraordinarilyill-advised not to join the second defendants at that stage.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">That being so, it is plain that we have a discretion with regard to the costs of all parties.

On the facts, although the plaintiff had commenced proceedings against all possible defendantsbecause it was not known, and no attempt had been made to ascertain, who was responsible for the accident it was not unreasonablefor her to continue the action against all the defendants since apart from the second defendants they had each blamed everyone elsein their defence thereby encouraging the plaintiff to carry on against all four defendants with reasonable prospect of being ableto safeguard her costs in the event of the action going to trial or being settled. Furthermore, it was by no means certain that ifthe action had proceeded to trial the plaintiff would have succeeded against the second defendants, in which case she would havebeen left with her cause of action against the other defendants. Although there was one issue on which it was doubtful whether theplaintiff would have succeeded against the defendants, that issue could not be taken into account in reducing the costs payable bythe second defendants because it would require the court to judge that issue purely on the papers.

(as he then was)) also adopted a similartest, i.e. whether it was reasonable to join the other defendants. The headnote of the case reads as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" This was a claim for damages for personal injuries arising from a collision between two vehicles. The plaintiffs sued the driversof both vehicles as the 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">When the action came for trial, the 1st defendant conceded liability and judgment was entered against her with costs against the 1stdefendant. Judgment was entered against the plaintiffs in favour of the 2nd defendant with costs.</p>        <p class="quote">The plaintiff's appeared the order for costs.</p>        <p class="quote">Both the defendants had blamed one another in the Magistrates Court when the 1st defendant was prosecuted for 'careless driving' andthey went on to do so in their defences, with the 1st defendant going so far as to issue a notice claiming indemnity from the 2nddefendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The judge found that the 1st defendant was wholly liable for the accident and that in the absence of any evidence to indicate a degreeof responsibility on the part of the 2nd defendant it was unreasonable to join him as a party.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>Held:</em></p>        <p class="quote">1. The plaintiffs were entitled to assume that the 1st defendant would give evidence in support of the case pleaded by the plaintiff'sand by her against the 2nd defendant's exoneration from blame at the conclusion of the trial as assured.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2. If proceedings are reasonably maintainable then it is reasonable to join both defendants to the action, whatever their relativeresponsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.</p>        <p class="quote">3. Whilst the judge properly held that the onus was on the plaintiffs to show that in all the circumstances it was reasonable to jointhe 2nd defendant as a party to the action, he erred in failing to appreciate that the plaintiffs could reasonably have felt doubtsand uncertainties as to what would transpire at the hearing and commenced and maintained the proceedings against both defendantsaccordingly.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Appeal allowed and a <em>Sanderson</em> order for costs substituted. "</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Kempster, J.A. said at page 91 :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" In the circumstances the plaintiffs were throughout entitled to assume that the first defendant would give evidence in support ofthe case pleaded by the plaintiffs and by her against the second defendant and, in my opinion, would have been foolhardy to regardthe second defendant's exoneration from blame at the conclusion of the trial assured. What the effect to the evidence would havebeen if called and adduced no one will now ever know. Indeed, it is difficult to think that any competent counsel or experiencedsolicitor, aware of the vicissitudes of litigation, would have advised the plaintiffs to sue only the first defendant. If proceedingsare reasonably maintainable it is usually wise to seek judgment against two defendants, whatever their relative responsibility forthe plaintiff's injuries as between themselves, rather than one. The judge, who properly held that the onus was on the plaintiffsto show that, in all the circumstances, it was reasonable to join the second defendant as a party to the action, erred in failingto appreciate that they could reasonably have felt doubts and uncertainties as to what would transpire at the hearing and have commencedand maintained the proceedings against both defendants accordingly."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> It should be noted that since the 1st Defendant had conceded liabilities and dropped out from the case, the effect of the evidenceof the 1st Defendant on the trial, if he were called and adduced, "no one will now ever know". I am not unconscious of the fact thatin the case of <strong>Leung Lai-ha</strong>, the 1st defendant had conceded liability whereas the 1st and 2nd Defendants in the case before me has only made payment into Courtwhich is not equivalent to any admission of liability. Further, there was a trial of the action in <strong>Leung Lai-ha</strong> against the other defendants and the trial judge decided in favour of the 2nd defendant against the plaintiff whereas the 3rd Defendantin the case before me succeeded in agreeing with the Plaintiff that the action against it should be discontinued. I therefore inexercising my discretion attach no liability whatsoever on the 3rd Defendant herein, no matter what the pleadings and the allegationsof the other parties said.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Similarly, in the case of <strong>Parkes v. Knowles and Another</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%201%20WLR%201040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] 1 WLR 1040</a>, the plaintiff suffered personal injuries whilst travelling in a motor-car driven by the 1st defendant when it collided with an omnibusowned by the 2nd defendant. Lynskey J. said at page 1043 that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I think I ought to exercise my discretion here in exactly the same way as I would have exercised it if this action had been foughtto conclusion and the conclusion come to was that the first defendant was alone to blame and that the proper amount to be paid wasï¿¡100. That being so, it seems to me that if the plaintiff was reasonable in joining both defendants in the action he is entitledto recover his costs. Having regard, first of all, to the letter that was written and, secondly, to the allegations, and lack ofallegations, of negligence in the two defendants' pleadings, it seems to me that the plaintiff was not only reasonable in joiningboth defendants but would have been extremely foolish if he had not done so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Under those circumstances it seems to me that the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the first defendant the costs he is to payto the second defendant. If I make what is known as a Bullock order it involves double taxation, which I do not like - it only addsto the costs and does not help anybody, so what I propose here to make is a direct order.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">So far as the second defendant is concerned he is not affected by the plaintiff's choosing the High Court. He has been brought here;he has had to fight here. In those circumstances it seems to me that the proper order to make here is that the first defendant paythe plaintiff's costs on scale 3 of the County Court scales, and the first defendant pay the second defendant's costs on the HighCourt scale."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> In exercising my discretion, I consider the following facts as admitted either in the statements or letters of the Defendants asrelevant. It does not involve a resolution of any disputed facts. They are separated into different stages of the events leadingto the action herein, namely:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1. In relation to the handling of the recovery action, i.e. CL88 :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(1) Admittedly, little progress has been made during 1992 and at the end of which Plaintiff was just told by the 3rd Defendant thatDefences have been filed and further steps would be taken.</p>            <p>(2) The Plaintiff was informed by the 3rd Defendant of payments-in and on 16 July of costs consequences. The Plaintiff had not beenadvised that the claim was a "loser" and "speculative from the start which would have accepted payments-in and cut losses".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(3) Instead, it was advised in July 1993 to proceed to the completion of discovery and then review the case which the Plaintiff hadaccepted.</p>            <p>(4) The 3rd Defendant said on 15 April 1994 that the 1st Defendant had made substantial amendments for the delay.</p>            <p>(5) The Plaintiff was told in December 1994 that Counsel considered the claim to be a good one subject to further enquiries. Admittedly,the Plaintiff did not know that Counsel had made a mistake by relying on the <em>unamended</em> version of the Warsaw Convention.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(6) However, in April 1995, the 3rd Defendant informed the Plaintiff that the 2nd Defendant had advised shortly before that "we donot have the evidence to succeed at trial", which was due to start in May 1995.</p>            <p>(7) Shortly before the conclusion of the recovery action in May 1995, 2nd Defendant's letter dated 20 April 1995 was suggesting thatthe Plaintiff was embarking on speculative litigation and that the 3rd Defendant's approach to the merits was over optimistic andthat the 3rd Defendant knew the litigation was speculative and that there were delays in the 3rd Defendant's giving instructionsabout the expert evidence.</p>            <p>(8) Thereafter in the 2nd Defendant's letter dated 17 January 1996, the 2nd Defendant said that the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendanthad decided this was a speculative litigation and strenuously denied liability and insisted that the 1st Defendant and the thirdparty had performed the instructions of the 3rd Defendant.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(9) However, in his letter dated 20 April 1995, the 2nd Defendant actually admitted that the case had not been properly prepared fortrial and that was his responsibility. He also admitted that certain specified steps were not taken describing this failure as "inexcusable".He conceded also that at least the performance of the omitted steps "may have facilitated the prospect of settlement upon more favourableterms that presently possible without the necessity to incur the costs associated with final preparations for trial".</p>            <p>(10) In the pre-action letters, the 2nd Defendant on 17 January 1996 under the letterhead of the third party, alleged that the 1stDefendant had acted on the instructions of the 3rd Defendant and that the allegations against the 1st Defendant were misconceived.He would "strenuously deny the allegations" put forward against him.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2. The Defence of the 1st and 2nd Defendants put the blame on the 3rd Defendant as stated under the chronology of events at the beginningof this judgment. It was only then the Writ was served on the 3rd Defendant.</p>        <p>3. The Contribution Notices of the 3rd Defendant against the 1st and 2nd Defendants on 10 April 1997 and of the 1st and 2nd Defendantsagainst the 3rd Defendant on 6 May 1997 must be construed as the parties putting the blame on each other. This is the case in spiteof the bold submission of Ms Newell, for the 1st and 2nd Defendants, that they were not so.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> By reason of the aforesaid matter, it was not unreasonable for the Plaintiff to join the 3rd Defendant as well and to serve the Writof Summons on them and to continue on with the action against the 3rd Defendant. Accordingly, in exercising my discretion, I am ofthe view that the 1st and 2nd Defendants are liable to pay the aforesaid two sets of costs, namely :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1. The Plaintiff's costs of prosecuting the claim against the 3rd Defendant; and</p>        <p>2. The 3rd Defendant's costs of defending the Plaintiff's claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> In fact, even if I adopt the test of "most compelling reason" to order costs against the 1st and 2nd Defendants as suggested in thecases of <strong>Fell</strong> and <strong>Carrs</strong>, I would also come to the same view that it is most compelling in this case that the aforesaid two sets of costs should be borneby the 1st and 2nd Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> However I must add here that whilst I have adopted the test of "not unreasonable to sue" in the case before me, I am not saying itis the only test the Court should employ in arriving at a just solution. The only test provided by the Rule &amp; Statute is "asthe Court thinks just". Due to myriad numbers of circumstances producing different matrixes of facts, it is dangerous to lay downa hard and fast rule to suit all situations. Further the case before me could be decided on the merits in relation to costs withouttrial on the merits of the case itself. I consider it is a just result.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs of the Amended Summons and the adjournment</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> The cost of the Amended Summons would obviously follow the event and that is the 1st and 2nd Defendants should also pay the costsof the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant for this Amended Summons.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Parties are also in dispute as to the costs of adjournment of the hearing of the Amended Summons on 12 August 1998. The then Counselfor the 1st and 2nd Defendants put in, which I must say, clear and well written submissions. However, it was submitted there andthen that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Plaintiff has not filed any affidavit, but only refers to certain selective correspondence. If this application is to be pursuedby P, the Court should give directions for the filing of affidavit evidence by the parties, so that the full picture would be placedbefore the Court."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> It was for this reason that the hearing was adjourned and directions were given for the filing of the affidavit. In the end, theaffidavit did not assist the Court. The opinion and suggestions or submissions in the affidavit were not considered by the Court.(They should not be included in an affidavit any way.) The Court only referred to those correspondences as were already put beforethe Court there and then. For the same reason, the 1st and 2nd Defendants should bear the costs of the adjournment as well.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Conclusions</em></p>    <p>(1) The 1st/2nd Defendants and the 3rd Defendant were sued severally in the action herein and not jointly, or in the alternative.</p>    <p>(2) The 1st and 2nd Defendants having made payment into Court and accepted by the Plaintiff within the stipulated time of 14 daysthereafter, the Plaintiff is entitled to accept money paid into Court in satisfaction of all the causes of action in respect of whichhe claims against the paying-in 1st/2nd Defendants without leave of the Court by giving notice in writing in accordance with O.22,r.3(1) and under O.62, r.10(2). By the same order, he is also entitled to tax his costs of the action incurred up to the time ofgiving Notice of Acceptance which should only include his costs of action incurred against the 1st and 2nd Defendants.</p>    <p>(3) If the Plaintiff herein wished, as he did, to discontinue his action against the other Co-Defendant, i.e. the 3rd Defendant herein,he could apply for leave to discontinue the action against him. As the parties agreed that the action against the 3rd Defendant shouldbe discontinued, the Court has jurisdiction to consider what is the appropriate order of costs as between the Plaintiff and the 3rdDefendant, including whether the 1st and 2nd Defendants in this case should pay the Plaintiff's costs incurred in bringing the actionagainst the 3rd Defendant and the 3rd Defendant's own costs in defending the action.</p>    <p>(4) In exercising that discretion in this case, where the Plaintiff and the 1st/2nd Defendants both have already agreed not to askfor an order that the 3rd Defendant should pay its own costs, the Court considered that it is not unreasonable for the Plaintiffto pursue this action against the 3rd Defendant as well and to maintain the same until the 1st and 2nd Defendants made payment intoCourt. Accordingly, the Court exercises its discretion against the 1st and 2nd Defendants in favour of the Plaintiff and the 3rdDefendant and a Sanderson Order is made that the 1st and 2nd Defendants should pay the costs of the 3rd Defendant directly and thePlaintiff's costs of prosecuting the claim against the 3rd Defendant.</p>    <p>(5) The 1st and 2nd Defendants should also pay the costs of the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant in the Amended Summons including thecosts of the adjournment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(D.
