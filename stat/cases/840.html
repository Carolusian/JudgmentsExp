The decision that I have to makeinvolves an important matter of principle as to whether a duty of care is owed by the Commissioner to the plaintiffs for negligenceat common law and or breach of statutory duty for economic loss. As this is a preliminary point of law I must assume that all thefacts that are pleaded in the statement of claim are true.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The four plaintiffs were depositors with the America and Panama Finance Company limited (the Company) which was registered as a deposit-takingcompany on the 22nd September 1980. The plaintiffs' investments were made between August and December of 1982. The authorised capitalof the company was $10 million of which $5 million was issued and $2.5 million was paid up. The company ceased business on the 7thJanuary 1983 and its registration as a deposit-taking company was revoked by the Commissioner on the 17th January 1983. A petitionto wind up the company on the grounds of insolvency was presented on the 27th January 1983 and a winding-up Order was made on the25th February 1983. The reasons for the failure of the Company are not known, but were not the fault of the Commissioner. As a resultof the collapse of the company the plaintiffs lost their life savings which were represented by the sums that they had invested withthe company on fixed deposit. The amounts lost were as follows: the 1st plaintiff US$9,565.22; the 2nd plaintiff US$10,000; the 3rdplaintiff HK$109,000 and the 4th plaintiff HK$140,000.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> By the present action the plaintiffs claim payment of these sums together with interest, general damages and damages for distresson the grounds of negligence and or breach of statutory duty. Although deposit-taking companies have been operating in Hong Kongfor about the past fourteen or fifteen years, no legislation was introduced to monitor their activities until 1976 when the Deposit-taking<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> was passed. The preamble to the Ordinance reads as follows:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"To regulate the taking of money on deposit and to make provision for the protection of persons who deposit money and for the regulationof deposit-taking business for monetary policy purposes."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>It will be necessary for me to make reference to several sections in this ordinance. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> deals with the restriction on the taking of deposits and provides that a registered deposit-taking company shall not repay any depositwithin three months without the written permission of the Commissioner whilst <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8</a> provides that the minimum sum by way of deposit shall be the sum of HK$50,000. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 9</a> sets out the requirements upon an application for registration of a deposit-taking company and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10</a> deals with the registration of the deposit-taking company by the Commissioner. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10(1)</a> reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Subject to subsection (2) the commissioner shall on receipt of an application in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> register a company as a registered deposit-taking company."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>Sub-section (2) then deals with matters which the Commissioner shall consider when he comes to make a decision as to whether he shouldrefuse to register a company. Only one sub-paragraph, sub-paragraph (e) gives the Commissioner a right to exercise his discretionto refuse an application for registration if it appears that it is not a fit and proper body to be registered. Paragraphs 6 and 7of the statement of claim refer to the application and registration of this deposit-taking company from which it can be inferredthat the plaintiffs contend that the company should never have been registered, but no particulars have been given as to why theapplication should have been refused. In my judgment no cause of action is revealed by these two paragraphs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I then come to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 14(1)</a> of the Ordinance which refers to the powers of the Commissioner with regard to the revocation of a registration. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 14(1)(d)(i)</a> gives power to the Commissioner to revoke a registration if the company is not a fit and proper body to remain registered whilst<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 14(1)(d)(iv)</a> gives power to the Commissioner to revoke a registration if the business of the company is being carried on` in a manner detrimentalto the interests of its depositors. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 17</a> provides for annual accounts to be lodged by a company with the Commissioner. Section 17A deals with the place of business in HongKong. Section 17B relates to the appointment of the Chief Executive. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18</a> requires deposit-taking companies to exhibit accounts at their places of business. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19</a> requires deposit-taking companies to notify certain changes to the Commissioner. Section 19A imposes a duty upon a deposit-takingcompany to report its inability if it should arise to meet its obligations. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20</a> provides for monthly and quarterly returns, to be submitted but with a discretion to the Commissioner to allow them to be made atless frequent intervals. The Commissioner may also require a deposit-taking company to provide further information including an auditorscertificate if he considers it to be necessary. Section 21A requires a deposit-taking company to maintain reserves. Section 21C providesthat a deposit taking company shall not grant any advance, loan or credit facility against the security of its own shares. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22</a> prohibits a deposit taking company from lending more than 25% of the company's paid-up capital and reserves to any person or companyor any group of persons or companies controlled by that person or company. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 23</a> prohibits deposit-taking companies from granting loans or other facilities which are unsecured to one or more private companies inwhich the Directors of the deposit-taking company have an interest either as a director or partner, manager or agent when the aggregateof such loans exceed 10% of the paid-up capital and reserves of the company. Section 23A provides for a limitation on advances toemployees and sections 23B, C and E limit the acquisition of shares and land by reference to shareholders' funds. Section 24A providesthat a company shall have a minimum amount in specified liquid assets. Section 31A gives power to the Commissioner to examine atany time the books accounts and transactions of the company. Section 31B provides for production of books to the Commissioner bythe company. By <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(1)</a> the Commissioner may recommend that an investigation of a deposit taking company be made. The Financial Secretary has power to orderan investigation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(2)</a> and also has power to wind up a company under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 40.</a> Section 3B empowers the Governor to give directions to the Financial Secretary and to the Commissioner with respect to the exerciseor performance of their powers, functions and duties under the Ordinance either generally or in a particular case. Criminal sanctionsare provided or in the ordinance for breach of certain provisions by a company and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31</a> sets out the details of the criminal liability of directors and other executives of the company.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> A number of allegations are pleaded in the statement of claim which the plaintiffs contend amount to a breach of statutory duty bythe Commissioner. These include monies invested by the company in land which exceeded the statutory limit of 25% of the paid-up capital,improper loans and withdrawals of deposits within the minimum statutory period. The plaintiffs also allege that the Commissionerwas aware of large accumulated losses during the period from February to November 1982 which showed that the financial position ofthe company was unstable. In addition allegations are made that although inspectors were appointed by the Commissioner to investigatethe affairs of the company, they were not appointed promptly whilst the eventual investigations were not carried out properly orthoroughly. As a result the plaintiffs contend that the Commissioner failed to regulate the company properly, did not exercise prudentialsupervision and failed to ensure that the provisions of the Ordinance were being fully complied with. In particular it is allegedthat the Commissioner failed to revoke the registration of the company when it became apparent that it was not fit to remain registeredor upon inspection of the various returns or accounts which would have revealed the company's financial position. Reliance is placedon <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 14(1)(d)(iv)</a> which gives power to the Commissioner to revoke the registration when the business is being carried on in a manner detrimental tothe interests of its depositors.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Attorney General made the following propositions in support of the application to strike out the statement of claim. Firstlyno action lies against a public official for his failure to exercise statutory discretionary powers in a particular way. Secondlythere was not a sufficient proximate relationship between the Commissioner and the plaintiffs to give rise to a legal duty of careto avoid damage to the plaintiffs of the type complained of, that is, loss of money. Thirdly the mere fact that it was reasonablyforeseeable that another person is likely to suffer pecuniary loss as a result of lack of care is not enough to give rise to a causeof action. Fourthly there are good policy reasons for denying the plaintiffs as depositors a right of action against the Commissioner.Fifthly the Commissioner is under no civil liability for breach of statutory duty. In his reply the Attorney General modified hisstance with regard to the fifth proposition for he conceded that liability could arise in certain circumstances having regard tothe decision in <u>Cutler v. Wandsworth Stadium  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) AC 398</a></u> and the speech of lord Diplock in <u>Leung Chow Public Car Company v. Attorney General PC App. 30/81</u>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Kaplan, Counsel for the plaintiffs, in his reply commented that there was something inherently unattractive about the AttorneyGeneral trying to strike out the plaintiffs claim. He emphasized that the plaintiffs have lost their life savings and that they arelegally aided. In the circumstances the action should be allowed to proceed to trial on its merits as it is a matter of public importanceand there are complex issues of law involved. However I am unable to accede to this submission. The Attorney General is perfectlyentitled to make this application irrespective of any sympathy that one has for the plaintiffs in their plight or any views thatmight be held with regard to the state of the financial sector in Hong Kong. The court must not shrink from its duty to strike outa statement of claim just because a case is of public importance and also if it has complex legal issues to determine. The test thatI have to adopt in considering the application is whether the plaintiffs' case is unsustainable or in the words used in <u>Drummond Jackson v. BMA  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%201%20WLR%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 1 WLR 688</a></u> that it is a plain and obvious case that the statement of claim should be struck out. For the purposes of this application as I havealready said I assume that all the allegations contained in the statement of claim are true. If the plaintiffs have no reasonablecause of action the statement of claim will be struck out otherwise the action will proceed to trial.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> During the course of their most helpful submissions I have been taken by the Attorney General and Mr. Kaplan through a number ofauthorities from which copious passages were read showing how the law of negligence has developed in such cases as <u>Donoghue v.

Rather thequestion has to be approached is two stages. First one has to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who hassuffered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of theformer, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter- in which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly,if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there are any considerations which ought tonegative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breachof it may give riser see Dorset Yacht case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20AC%201004" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) A.C. 1004</a>, per Lord Reid at p.1027.

The reason for this is, I think, that Parliamentdeems it to be in the public interest that things otherwise unjustifiable should be done, and that those who do such things withdue care should be immune from liability to persons who may suffer thereby.

There are perhaps two strands in this line of thought. The first is the fear of an unreasonable imposition of liability ontoo great a scale to be tolerable. This is the so-called "floodgates" argument, which has recently been criticised (by lord Roskillin Junior Books Ltd. v. Veitchi Co. Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%201%20AC%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 1 A.C. 520</a>, 539). I only comment that there are, perhaps, some of us who prefer a controlled opening of the gates, permitting the flooding ofa reasonably foreseeable area, rather than a wholesale inundation of unforeseeable and uncontrolled proportions. But in any eventit is also necessary to consider whether the "floodgates" argument is, in the particular circumstances, founded upon blind conservatism,or has a rational basis. And, in the case of liability in negligence for economic loss the second strand in the line of thought thatlimits must be imposed upon a generalised liability is indeed based on good sense. This is the theme of lord Reid's speech in theDorset Yacht case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20AC%201004" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) A.C. 1004</a>, and of Lord Denning M.R.'s judgment in the Spartan Steel case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20QB%2027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) Q.B. 27</a>, a theme which is taken up in the current edition of Salmond &amp; Heuston on Torts, 18th ed. (1981), p.191. It is to the effectthat the philosophy of the market place presumes that it is lawful to gain profit by causing other economic loss, and that recognisedwrongs involving interference with others' contracts are limited to specific intentional wrongs such as inducing a breach of contractor conspiracy. Certainly there seems to have developed an understanding that economic loss at the hands of others is something wehave to accept without legal redress, unless caused by some specifically outlawed conduct such as fraud or duress; though how farthis is the outcome of our reasoning, or the product of our law, is not altogether clear. But a striking result of this line of thoughtis that criticism of the absence of recovery for economic loss tends to be concentrated on those cases where liability has in factbeen caused to person or property, though not to the person or property of the plaintiff himself."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. Kaplan referred to an American authority <u>Indian Towing v.

It is contended by the plaintiffs thatas depositors they form part of a special category whom the legislature intended to protect when the Ordinance was passed. They thereforecontend that they were in a direct relationship or proximity with the Commissioner and the Commissioner must have had them withinhis contemplation when they became depositors so that there is a duty of care owed to them upon breach. In order to determine whetherany duty is owed to the depositors it is necessary to consider as I have said before the provisions of the Ordinance. Mr. Kaplansubmits that the Ordinance was passed for the protection of investors or depositors. However from the preamble it is clear that thepurposes of the Ordinance are threefold. Firstly to regulate the taking of money on deposit which means that only a deposit-takingcompany which is registered or licensed can accept deposits on the terms provided for in the Ordinance. Secondly it incorporatesprovisions for the protection of depositors by imposing safeguards, designed for the better management of deposit-taking companies.Thirdly the Commissioner acts as a regulatory body for monetary policy purposes. Apart from the duty to register the company andsuch other duties ac to maintain a register of deposit-taking companies, to Gazette each year the names of deposit-taking companiesand to maintain secrecy no other specific duties are imposed upon the Commissioner. The way in which the Commissioner carries outhis duties is a matter for his discretion dependent upon such matters as the numbers employed on his staff and what prorities headopts. He is under no specific duty to carry out inspections as contended by Mr. Kaplan, but he is free to carry them out as andwhen necessary. It is in fact pertinent to observe that there are about three hundred and thirty registered deposit-taking companiesoperating in Hong Kong so that there is obviously a limit to the number of investigations that can be carried out at any one time.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> When the plaintiffs decided to invest their monies they entered into a contract with the company. No representations had been madeby the Commissioner to the plaintiffs that they should invest their monies in that company to come within the situation of HedleyByrne. The Commissioner has no right of control over a deposit-taking company nor can he interfere in the day to day management ofthe company which of course is exercised by the company's directors and executives. There is nothing in the ordinance which indicatesthat the plaintiffs were to form part of a special category of persons to enable them to take civil proceedings for damages, fora breach of a statutory duty to take care. Further I am unable to accept that the statements made by the Commissioner and the FinancialSecretary that the role of the Commissioner was one of prudential supervision, can be engrafted as Mr. Kaplan suggested onto theOrdinance. These words were uttered in a political context and cannot form the basis of a cause of action. The object of the legislationis quite clear. It is to provide safeguards to the public at large for the general administration and operation of deposit-takingcompanies. It does not create a duty of care by the Commissioner in favour of an individual depositor in his private capacity togive rise to a civil action in damages if he carries out his duties negligently. Further there was no direct relationship or proximitybetween the plaintiffs and the Commissioner to come within the neighbour principle enunciated in Donoghue v. Stevenson. The Commissioner'sduty is to act in a supervisory role and to exercise his powers in accordance with the discretion vested in him. His accountabilityis to the Government. Foreseeability by itself does not establish a duty of care and here I refer again to Leigh and Sillivan Ltd.v. Aliakmon Shipping Co. Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20WLR%20289" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 WLR 289.</a> In any event I agree with the Attorney General's submission that the Commissioner could not possibly have foreseen in 1980 that thecompany would eventually be wound up with a consequential loss to the plaintiffs in 1983.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Finally upon the matter of public policy I am in entire agreement with the Attorney General that there are very good policy reasonswhy the plaintiffs should not be permitted to pursue this action. It would lead in my opinion to the opening of the flood gates forthe Commissioner would find himself faced with unlimited claims from an unascertained class it was well expressed by Cardozo C.J.in the United States in the well-known case of <u>Ultramares Corporation v. Touche  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%20255%20NY%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 255 NY 170</a> NE 441 at 444</u>:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>By analogy the Commissioner of Police and the Commissioner of I.C.A.C. with regard to the prosecution of criminals could find themselvessubject to legal proceedings for damages by a failure on their part to exercise their powers in the manner that has been contendedfor in this case whilst other departments of government could also be exposed to claims for damages where it acts as a regulatoror as an inspector. As the Attorney General submitted where would it end? The consequences to the Treasury if a duty of care is owedand damages are awarded could be quite alarming.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The plaintiffs invested their monies with the company at a time when it was on the brink of collapse. They were placed there voluntarilyby the plaintiffs who were no doubt attracted by the higher rates of interest offered than those offered by the more conservativeinstitutions. The plaintiffs were under no obligation to put their monies in a deposit-taking company for they could have placedtheir funds in shares, or in property or commodities or even on fixed deposit with a bank. All forms of investment carry some elementof risk. The higher the stakes the greater the risk. Not only is the Commissioner required to exercise prudence in carrying out hisduties by way of prudential supervision, but the ordinary depositor must also act with prudence in conducting his business affairs.These were commercial transactions so that the maxim caveat emptor applies.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Kaplan postulated that if the case goes to trial evidence may be forthcoming concerning the Commissioners inactivity at a timewhen he may have become aware that fraud had been perpetrated by officers of the company. This submission is however irrelevant forI can only consider the application on the basis of the pleading and not on the realms of speculation. There is no allegation inthe statement of claim that the Commissioner acted outside the ambit of his authority. Whilst sympathy must be expressed to the plaintiffsthey are not entitled to reimbursement for their losses out of the Treasury at the expense of the taxpayers. There is no duty uponthe defendant to insure the plaintiffs against their losses.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> With regard to the Attorney General's five propositions I answer them as follows:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" align="left">                <p align="left">(l)</p>            </td>            <td width="66%">                An action does not lie against the Commissioner in his capacity as a public officer if he fails to exercise a statutorydiscretionary power in a particular way;                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" align="left">(2)</td>            <td width="66%">                There was no sufficient proximity of relationship between the Commissioner and the plaintiffs to give rise to a legalduty of care to avoid damage to the plaintiffs for economic loss;                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" align="left">(3)</td>            <td width="66%">                Foreseeability by itself is insufficient to give rise to a cause of action;                <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" align="left">(4)</td>            <td width="66%">                As a matter of public policy the plaintiffs should have no right of action against the Commissioner;               <p> </p>            </td>            <td width="17%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" style="text-align:right"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" align="left">(5)</td>            <td width="66%">No statutory duty of care is owed by the Commissioner to give rise to civil liability for breach unless he acted ultra vires for exampleby reason of male fides, wilful misconduct or deliberate failure to exercise his statutory powers or if he acted for some, ulterioror improper motive.</td>            <td width="17%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Clearly improvements are necessary for the supervision and regulation of deposit-taking companies, but they can only come about asa result of legislation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The case presented by the plaintiffs is wholly misconceived and untenable.
