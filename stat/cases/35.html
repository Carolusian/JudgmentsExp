These sums fell within the 15% limit on investments notspecifically identified in the Information Memorandum.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Concerns were voiced about the investmentâs structure because of Mainland prohibition upon direct foreign investment.  In June1997 a Hong Kong firm of solicitors, D S Cheung &amp; Co, was commissioned by the Manager to advise and report upon investments alreadymade by the Company in the Zhongbei project.  That memorandum, delivered to Mr Hon, was intended for a meeting in Beijing a few dayslater.  It listed key points for discussion in relation to the Zhongbei investment and raised a number of questions about the methodwhich had been adopted of injecting money into Zhongbei and it also contained proposals for a new structure because, so the solicitorssaid, the present structure exposed the fund to very high risk.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Beijing meeting was postponed to 14 July 1997, but a meeting of the Investment Committee was held on 5 July 1997 at Mr MurrayâsHong Kong residence.  It was at that meeting that the Investment Committee recommended further investment of US$9 million.  On 14July 1997, various agreements were signed called âsupplemental loan agreementsâ which catered for structural changes referredto in the D S Cheung memorandum.  At a Board meeting in London on 21 July 1997, approval was given for the further US$9 million investment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It was the suggested failure of the Manager to produce the memorandum at the 5 July meeting or to inform the Committee of its contents,and the failure to inform the Board on 21 July 1997 of the changes in the structure of the investments that had by then been incorporatedby the supplemental loan agreements, that was one of the breaches alleged in the Bermuda proceedings and that eventually took centrestage in those proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Bermuda proceedings</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(1) The pleadings</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In April 2000, the Manager issued a specially endorsed writ in Bermuda by which it was asserted that in February 1999 the Companyhad purported to terminate the management agreement and had failed to pay fees due in the sum of US$2,244,109.97.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Company filed a Defence and Counterclaim in June 2000, by which it contended that the Manager had breached the agreement andits duty of care to the Company by failing to assign sufficient staff or afford sufficient time to its duties or to provide properadministrative services or exercise control over the Companyâs subsidiaries.  By amendments made in July 2003, after the trialhad commenced, a series of further allegations were made in relation to specific joint venture investments, including one calledChang An, another called Jianling and also the Zhongbei project.  By a re-amendment on 7 July 2003, it was asserted in relation toZhongbei that the Company had suffered loss, for which it counterclaimed because:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">The [Manager] failed to report to the Investment Committee meeting which was held on 5 July 1997 for the purpose inter alia of consideringand approving an additional investment of US$9 million into the Zhongbei project, the advice which it had received from Messrs DS Cheung &amp; Co dated 14th June 1997 that under the then structure the money provided by the defendant of the US$11 million wasexposed to a very high risk and that it would not be desirable for the [Company] to suffer such a risk.â<a>[3]</a></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  By the Re-Amended Defence to Counterclaim, the Manager asserted that by or on 5 July 1997 âthe substance of the memorandum wasknown to members of the Investment Committee together with the proposed methods whereby the [Company] could be further protectedin its investment in Zhongbei.â<a>[4]</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(2) The trial</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The trial took place in Bermuda before Mr Justice Storr from the 30 June 2003 to 14 July 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On 24 February 2004 judgment was given in favour of the Manager for the unpaid fees and the Companyâs counterclaim was dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In relation to the claims relating to the three named investments, the Manager denied any breach of its duties, said that all theinvestments it recommended had been authorised and it relied upon indemnities afforded it under the management agreement which didnot, however, protect it from liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  As to the D S Cheung memorandum, the Companyâs case, presented mainly through the testimony of Mr Mayer, was that the reservationsexpressed by D S Cheung &amp; Co had been withheld by the Manager and that had the Company known of them, the US$9 million loan wouldnot have been approved on 21 July 1997. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The Managerâs assertion, through the testimony of Mr Wong, was that if the Zhongbei investments were contrary to Mainland lawthen this was known to the Committee, the Board, the Audit Committee and the Companyâs financial adviser when investments weremade in 1995 and increased in 1997.  It was common ground that the memorandum was not produced at either meeting in 1997 but theManagerâs case was that the substance of the advice was conveyed to the Investment Committee and that that Committee, includingMr Murray, realised that the fund was exposed to a very high risk. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Murray testified at the Bermuda trial saying that he had no recollection of seeing the memorandum although when asked in cross-examinationwhether Mr Hon had said words to the effect that the lawyers had identified an issue and had suggested how it should be rectifiedhe replied: âI donât specifically recall it but I have no problems with it.â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  It is clear from the judgment of Storr J that the Counterclaim narrowed at trial to the issue of investments in the three namedprojects.  He held that the Manager had acted with the Companyâs authority save, possibly, in relation to the 1997 investment inZhongbei, to which issue the judge therefore devoted âparticular attentionâ<a>[5]</a>.  As to that issue, the judge said that the principal witness for the manager, Mr Wong, âdid not have the opportunity of givingconsidered evidence about this matter [the allegation of withholding the D S Cheung memorandum].

In May 2000, the Manager issued proceedings in Bermuda for an anti-suit injunction which in due course was granted.  In a Rulingthere dated 6 October 2000, Mr Justice Simmons held that Bermuda was the natural forum for the trial of the action<a>[12]</a> and noted also that the solicitor for the Company had failed to disclose the agreementâs jurisdiction clause to the Hong Kong courtor that the agreement was governed by the law of Bermuda.

The assertion is made that Chum and Wong acted <i>mala fides</i> and for improper purposes, deliberately withholding the effect of the report because they wished the Manager to continue to managethe Companyâs investments and to receive management fees.

It was conceded thatthe plaintiffs were dissatisfied with the manner in which the Bermudan proceedings had been managed.  As for not joining Mr Chumand Mr Wong as parties to the proceedings in Bermuda, it is said that it would have been cumbersome and unnecessary to do so especiallyat the very late stage at which the documents now at the heart of this case, pointing to culpability of these defendants, were discoveredor their significance realized.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(2) The judgment</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Stone J held that the characterisation of the Bermudan litigation as âbadly managedâ was insufficient reason for the re-openingof the issue âsimply by means of changing the identity of the defendants.â<a>[15]</a>  He took the view that there was âa danger that the administration of justice will be brought into disrepute by permitting a partyto continue with a claim which has the effect of relitigating a cause which in substance already has been lost in another court ofcompetent jurisdiction; I bear in mind, also, that in the present cases no extraneous matters of fact are asserted in terms of theâabuse issueâ which demand further discovery or inquiry.â<a>[16]</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  He held also that âpotential unfairnessâ arose from the fact that it had been open to the plaintiffs to join these defendantsto the Bermudan proceedings<a>[17]</a>. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(3) The complaint</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  It is conceded before us that the Hong Kong proceedings are a collateral attack upon a final determination of another court of competentjurisdiction.  That said, the fact of a collateral attack is not, it is argued, sufficient of itself to constitute an abuse of process. It may or may not do so; but there must, says Mr Strachan for the plaintiffs, be something more, an added factor, and that nonehas been identified in this case.  It is said in particular that Stone J adopted a test that was overly rigid and that he wronglyread the key part of a speech by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Arthur J</i><i> </i><i>S Hall &amp; Co. v Simons<a>[18]</a></i> â wherein his Lordship in the House of Lords stipulated the need, before an abuse was demonstrated, for the defendant to show thatthe proposed further litigation would cause manifest unfairness or would bring the administration of justice into disrepute â asbeing restricted to cases brought by disgruntled litigants against their former legal advisers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  It is contended that in any event the judge failed to address squarely the questions of unfairness or harm to the administrationof justice; wrongly held that unfairness had been shown; and in deciding that there was an abuse failed to give weight, or sufficientweight, to the importance of the discovery, since the Bermudan trial, of documentary evidence that cogently supported the case againstthese defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(4) The law</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  âWhere a final decision has been pronounced on the merits by an English or (with certain exceptions) a foreign judicial tribunalâsjurisdiction over the parties and subject matter any party to such litigation as against any other party â¦ is estopped in any subsequentlitigation from disputing such decision on the merits, whether it be used as the foundation of an action, or as a bar to any claim,indictment, affirmative defence or allegation provided the party entitled raises the point at the proper time.â</p>    <p style="text-align:right">Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley â<i>Res Judicata</i>â<a>[19]</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  This doctrine, <i>res judicata</i>, is not a rule of evidence but one of substantive law, for which the underlying public policy is the interest of the community inthe termination of disputes and the finality of judicial decisions and, further, the need for individuals to be protected from vexatiousmultiplicity of suits.<a>[20]</a>  It arises where a claim has previously been finally determined between the parties, or their privies<a>[21]</a>, by a court of competent jurisdiction and the same issue falls directly in question in subsequent proceedings (cause of action estoppel)or where the issue has been determined by such a court as a necessary step in reaching judgment in case between those parties ortheir privies (issue estoppel)<a>[22]</a>.

It matters not, they say, that in the Hong Kong proceedings the Manager is not a defendant, because thedefendants are the Managerâs privies.  To this question I shall later return. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The assertion that the Hong Kong proceedings constitute an abuse of process is founded on an extension to the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine, an extension that recognizes that where the doctrine does not strictly apply there may nonetheless be circumstances inwhich a collateral challenge to a previous decision offends the principles underlying the doctrine.

More recent examination of theprinciple and its application has found its context in actions brought against legal advisers by those who have been disappointedin the result of an earlier civil action.  One such case, that has prominently featured in argument in this appeal, is <i>Arthur Hall</i>.  In each of the three cases there under consideration, the defendant had compromised proceedings upon legal advice but sought insubsequent proceedings to allege negligence on the part of his or her legal advisers.  The risk was of a conflict between the judgmentin the new proceedings and the judgment in the old, in that not only was it incumbent on the aggrieved former client to show negligencebut also that the negligence would adversely affect the outcome of the earlier proceedings<a>[35]</a>.  Whilst the parties to the two actions were not the same, the underlying principle applied:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">The law discourages relitigation of the same issues except by means of an appeal.

They are usually mentioned in tandem but it is importantto notice that the policies they state are not quite the same.  The first is concerned with the interests of the defendant: a personshould not be troubled twice for the same reason.  This policy has generated the rules which prevent relitigation when the partiesare the same: autrefois acquit, res judicata and issue estoppel.  The second policy is wider: it is concerned with the interestsof the state.  There is a general public interest in the same issue not being litigated over again.  The second policy can be usedto justify the extension of the rules of issue estoppel to cases in which the parties are not the same but the circumstances aresuch as to bring the case within the spirit of the rules.â<a>[36]</a></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The judgment of Stone J states<a>[37]</a> that the argument advanced before him included the contention by the plaintiffs that <i>Arthur Hall</i> established a rule of less rigidity than that proposed by Lord Diplock in <i>Hunter</i>.  The comparison was between an approach which says that a collateral challenge is of itself an abuse and, on the other hand, onethat finds an abuse in a collateral challenge only if it is shown by the person asserting the abuse that the second action visitsmanifest unfairness upon the proposed defendant, or that the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The argument before us was to a slightly different effect, which is that whilst both <i>Hunter</i> and <i>Arthur Hall</i> required demonstration of one of the two conditions precedent â manifest unfairness or bringing the administration of justice intodisrepute â Stone J wrongly assumed that <i>Hunter</i> propounded the more restrictive view and that <i>Arthur Hall</i> relaxed the rule in <i>Hunter</i> but only in the context of actions against former legal advisers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Whether Stone J did so approach the case is a matter to which I will turn, but it suffices at present to say that in my view thereis no difference in essence between the approaches dictated by the two decisions.  The point of suggested difference finds its originin the fact that in <i>Hunter</i> Lord Diplock said<a>[38]</a> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">The abuse of process which the instant case exemplifies is the initiation of proceedings in a court of justice for the purpose ofmounting a collateral attack upon a final decision against the intending plaintiff which has been made by another court of competentjurisdiction in previous proceedings in which the intending plaintiff had a full opportunity of contesting the decision in courtthe by which it was made.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  To view that statement as one that treats all collateral challenges as abusive of the courtâs process is to view it in isolationand to disregard the earlier passage to which I have referred in which Lord Diplock expressly referred to the two conditions precedentto the exercise of the power.  As Lord Hoffmann explained in <i>Arthur Hall</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">I do not think that [Lord Diplock] meant that every case falling within this description was an abuse of process or even that therewas a presumption to this effect which required the plaintiff to bring himself within some exception.

This, in my judgment, is an approach that is overly nice or precise, for all that has to be established is that the fresh proceedingsresult in manifest unfairness or that pursuit of the same issue will bring the administration of justice into dispute.  In some cases,the surrounding circumstances will show that the collateral attack is an abuse; in others not.  In <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</i><a>[42]</a> it was argued<a>[43]</a> that in cases in which an abuse was alleged because an issue could have been but was not raised in earlier proceedings, there wasa need to look for an additional element; additional to the fact of that failure.  The argument was rejected and the lead judgmentin that case, to which I now turn, is instructive in relation to the similar point taken in this appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Not all re-litigation constitutes a collateral attack: see, for example, the <i>Henderson</i> line of cases, of which <i>Johnson v Gore Wood</i> is one, in which an issue raised in the second proceedings was not but could have been raised in the first.  Such situations âneednot involve the reopening of a matter already decidedâ<a>[44]</a> but may nonetheless amount to an abuse.  It is in the context of the âcould and should haveâ cases that Auld LJ in <i>Bradford and Bingley Building Society v Seddon<a>[45]</a></i><i> </i>suggested that in such cases the courts should look for an additional element and it is noteworthy that amongst the examples he providedof such an additional element was a collateral attack.  It is in this regard that Lord Bingham in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood</i> said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> abuse of process, as now understood, although separate and distinct from cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, has much incommon with them.  The underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and that a party shouldnot be twice vexed in the same matter.  This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in theconduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and public as a whole.  The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defencein later proceedings may, without more, amount to an abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse)that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if was to be raised at all.  I would not accept thatit is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decisionor some dishonesty, <i>but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive</i>, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment ofa party.  It is, however wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, soas to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive.  That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what shouldin my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes accountof all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing orabusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.  As one cannot comprehensivelylist all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is tobe found or not.  Thus while I would accept that lack of funds would not ordinarily excuse a failure to raise in earlier proceedingsan issue which could or should have been raised then, I would not regard it as necessarily irrelevant, particularly if it appearsthat the lack of funds has been caused by the party against whom it is sought to claim.  While the result may often be the same,it is in my view preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a partyâs conduct is an abuse than to ask whether the conductis an abuse and then, if it is, to ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances.â<a>[46]</a> (Emphasis added).</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  So, in so far as Mr Strachan suggests that something more than a collateral attack must be established before an abuse is demonstrated,he is correct in the sense that it will only be an abuse if one of the two conditions are met.  But that is all that is needed. In all the circumstances of a particular case, a collateral attack may be manifestly unfair or an affront to the administration ofjustice in the minds of right-thinking people.  If so, that suffices to establish an abuse.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(5) This case</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I do not agree with the contention that the judge below applied incorrect principle to the question of abuse.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Criticism is levelled at the judgeâs comment<a>[47]</a> that in <i>Arthur Hall</i>, Lord Hoffman was making observations âas to relaxation of the doctrine within the specific context of claims brought by the losingparty in the previous litigation against its own previous legal advisersâ; and his remark that he, Stone J, did ânot to takeLord Hoffmannâs speech to presage a general erosion or pollution of the abuse of collateral attack doctrine.â  The suggestionon the part of the plaintiffs is that the judge thereby demonstrated an adherence on his part to a narrow and strict confine whichhe thought was dictated by <i>Hunter</i>, and which he thought was not relaxed by <i>Arthur Hall</i>.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In that the judge below rejected the suggestion that the concept of abuse in the case of collateral attack had been diluted or otherwiserelaxed by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Arthur Hall</i>, he was, for reasons I have provided, correct, for Lord Hoffman in <i>Arthur Hall</i> did not relax anything: he merely put to rest any possible misconception about what Lord Diplock had intended in <i>Hunter</i>.  It is not clear to me what the relevance was of the judgeâs allusion to the specific context of <i>Arthur Hall</i> but it is clear to me that Lord Hoffmannâs observations<a>[48]</a> were of general application and not restricted to the context of actions against legal advisers.  Be that as it may, the fear thatthe judge misled himself is obviated by the judgeâs express reference<a>[49]</a> to the fact that there did not exist any concept of a presumptive abuse and, specifically, that âin considering any fact situationthe court has two yardsticks, that of unfairness and of bringing the administration of justice into disrepute, and armed with thesebenchmarks it simply has to make a judgment in the particular circumstances of each case.â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  It is then said that the judge spoke merely of âunfairnessâ rather than âmanifest unfairnessâ.  The point is not a goodone.  One can safely assume that the judge, having referred to a number of authorities which articulated the express test of âmanifestunfairness,â was well aware of it.  In relation to manifest unfairness, however, I do, with respect, disagree with the judgeâsapproach and conclusion.  The unfairness that the judge identified was, as he put it, that the defendants could have been, but werenot, joined in the Bermudan litigation and that it was, absent the provision of good reason for that failure, unfair to raise nowthe very matters that could have been raised previously.<a>[50]</a>  It is unwise to attempt any categorisation of the manifest unfairness that might constitute an abuse of process.  It will often,I think, tend to be conduct that constitutes harassment of a litigant; but I do not think that the mere fact in this case of joiningthese defendants when they might have been joined in Bermuda is, without more, manifestly unfair.  Whether in all the circumstancesof the case, to do what the plaintiffs now seek to do is conduct that would, if permitted, bring the administration of justice intodisrepute is another matter.  But the defendants were not joined and they incurred no expense and they have suffered no harassmentsave that a further suit, if it proceeds, would mean that Mr Wong would again have to testify.  That is not manifestly unfair; norcan any cogent argument be advanced that they have suffered by reason of any expectation that the dispute was over.  It is no surprisethat in the conduct of this appeal the defendantsâ assertion of manifest injustice is not pursued.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  In his affirmation in opposition to the defendantsâ applications to set aside leave to serve out of the jurisdiction, Mr Mayerasserted that the significance of the D S Cheung report was only apparent shortly before the trial in Bermuda because, by reasonof some happenstance, it was only then translated into English.  This is a markedly weak point given that the memorandum had beenin the possession of the plaintiffs then legal advisers for about five years before the Bermudan trial<a>[51]</a>, legal advisers with professional and support staff well versed in the original language of the report, namely, Chinese.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  More significantly to the plaintiff's case is their contention that it was only after the trial in Bermuda that they discoveredthe Board Book that had been used for the meetings of July 1997.  The suggested significance of the Board Book is that whereas inrelation to other investments it incorporated copies of, or reference to, specific legal advice, there was a conspicuous absencefrom the Book of any reference to the D S Cheung report.  This fact was not before the Bermudan courts and had it been might well,so the argument runs, have made all the difference for that conspicuous absence supported the suggestion that the fact and contentof the report had deliberately been withheld by the Manager.  Mr Mayer says in his affirmation that he found a copy of the BoardBook in his offices, but only after the trial.  On a point of this suggested importance, it is noteworthy that he does not describethe circumstances in which he came to find a book that had been in the Companyâs possession for some considerable time before thetrial, or where the Book had been kept, or whether any attempt had been made to find it for the purpose of the trial and, if not,why not and, most specifically, whether it was found before the appeal in Bermuda.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The basis upon which the discovery of new material might, in cases of estoppel, avail a plaintiff, and the circumstances in whichit will not, are these:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">If the party can show that at the time of the former proceedings he was excusably ignorant of some matter, which would have alteredthe whole aspect of the case, he is entitled to claim that no issue estoppel shall take effect against him.  The estoppel howeverstands if there was no newly discovered fact, if it was newly discovered only in the sense that the party realised its importance,if the party had actual knowledge of the fact or might with reasonable diligence have acquired such knowledge, or if it was not sufficientlymaterial.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:right">Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley â<i>Res Judicata</i>â.<a>[52]</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The same principles must apply, so it seems to me, to cases of extended <i>res judicata</i>.  It is of no avail to say that the significance of the D S Cheung memorandum was not apparent to the plaintiffs until shortly beforetrial.  It was for long in their possession.  And in relation to the Board Book, there is no excuse or reason put forward for itslate discovery.  It is surely a document that could with reasonable diligence have been discovered by the plaintiffs within theirown offices and produced in time for trial.  Whether that would have made any difference is doubtful, because it was never the defendantsâcase that the report was actually produced at the July meetings; merely that the effect of it was drawn to the attention of the Companyat those meetings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  What we have in this case is an attempt to overturn a final determination in previous proceeding on the very issue, the identicaland fundamental question, determined in those proceedings.  The appeal in Bermuda was restricted almost entirely to the counterclaimon the very ground now raised.  It is of no avail to the plaintiffs to complain about the reasoning of the Bermudan courts or tosuggest that their case was somehow mismanaged: this is openly to use relitigation as a disguised appeal, where there has alreadybeen an appeal that has failed.  The nature and the effect of the Hong Kong claim is no different from the nature and effect of theclaims in Bermuda and the justification advanced for the collateral challenge is honest but insufficient in so far as it relies upondissatisfaction with the determination, and devoid of merit in so far as it relies upon a suggestion of fresh evidence.  The procedureadopted in this case is one that, in my judgment, offends the spirit of the rule of <i>res judicata</i>, and the use of different parties â first in the form of TSL and then in the form of these individual defendants â is but a cover,a matter of form and not substance.  TSL has in truth no interest separate from that of its holding company.  The writ in HCCL 10of 2003 was issued eight days before the first instance judgment in Bermuda; and the writ in 54 of 2003 very shortly before the hearingof the Bermudan appeal, timing that was not, it can safely be inferred, coincidental.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The action in Bermuda against the Manager was premised upon acts of the Managerâs directors â none other than the present defendantsâ the very same acts of the very same people in respect of which and against whom the Hong Kong proceedings are directed.  Indeed,it was specifically asserted by Mr Mayer when testifying in Bermuda that the Company always viewed Mr Chum as âpart of the manager.â<a>[53]</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Mr Strachan relies upon the fact that the judge at first instance in Bermuda, in holding that the Company was aware of the riskshighlighted by the D S Cheung memorandum, pointed to the fact that Mr Chum (and Mr Lo) signed the cheques for the 1997 further investmentand, as experienced businessmen, would not have done so unless satisfied that all was in order.  He argues that the judge failedto appreciate that Mr Chum was alleged by the plaintiffs deliberately to have withheld material information, and that this thereforeopens the door to the present challenge.  But the Court of Appeal in Bermuda acknowledged this very contention,<a>[54]</a> held nonetheless that the judge had ample ground to accept Mr Wongâs evidence and themselves agreed with his findings,<a>[55]</a> noting that Mr Murray had himself asked for a review of the existing agreements; that there was evidence that Mr Lo, a member ofthe Board, was fully conversant with the proposed new arrangements; that it was inherently unlikely that the investment would havebeen approved by the Board without information as to the legal risk; and that no reason had been given âfor supposing that theManagers and Mr Anthony Lo, together or <i>individually</i>, were likely to withhold such obviously material information from the Investment Committee and the Board.  No allegation of bad faithor âwilful misconductâ is made against them.â<a>[56]</a> (Emphasis added).  What the plaintiffs now seek to do is to provide reasons they did not provide, but could have provided, in theformer proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Looking at all these circumstances it seems to me, as it did to Stone J, that the Hong Kong proceedings, if allowed to proceed,would constitute an abuse of process; and in this regard I have in mind as well a factor not expressly raised thus far which is thefact of judicial time and resources engaged by a re-run of this case; a fact that should sit ill with the right-minded observer inthe absence of good reason for the proposed exercise.  I here echo a point made in <i>Sea Culture International Pty Ltd v Scoles<a>[57]</a></i> where French J said<a>[58]</a>:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Underlying the power that the courts have assumed to stay or dismiss proceedings for abuse of process is a policy of preventing wasteof judicial resources and their use for purposes unrelated to the determination of genuine disputes.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Upon the ground of abuse of process alone, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Issue estoppel</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The respondentsâ notices ask that the judgment below be affirmed on the further ground, closely allied to the abuse question,that the judge ought to have set aside his <i>ex parte</i> orders on the basis that there was no serious issue to be tried because the plaintiffs were barred from proceeding by issue estoppel.

In this regard reliance is placed upon a passage in <i>Gleeson</i> in which the Vice Chancellor said:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">I do not say that one must be the alter ego of the other: but it does seem to me that, having due regard to the subject matter, theremust be a sufficient degree of identification between the two to make had just to hold of the decision to which one party shouldbe binding in proceedings to which the other is party.â<a>[64]</a></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  That statement, viewed in isolation, has been âcriticised as circuitous and not helpful in identifying when the necessary degreeof identification is present.â<a>[65]</a>  The essence or sense of the term seems best gleaned by study of examples; one of which is that provided by the Vice Chancellor immediatelyfollowing the passage now relied upon the plaintiffs: that of trustee of property in dispute and beneficiary.  The required commonalityis a direct interest in the subject matter of the litigation, a parallel or corresponding interest in that subject matter and notsimply a financial interest in the result of the action: <i>Genesee Enterprises Ltd v Abou-Rached<a>[66]</a></i>, so that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Privies include any person who succeeds to the rights or liabilities of the party upon death or insolvency, or who is otherwise identifiedin estate or interest.

The <i>Distillers</i> case concerned the liability of a company for grave disfigurement caused by thalidomide to a child whose mother had, whilst pregnantwith her, purchased and consumed the drug in New South Wales, after the drug had been manufactured in England and sold to an Australiancompany.  The question considered by the Privy Council was whether there was a cause of action which arose within the jurisdictionof New South Wales and three possibilities were canvassed: that every ingredient of the cause of action must have occurred withinthe jurisdiction; that it sufficed if the last ingredient had occurred within the jurisdiction; or that âthe act on the part ofthe defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint must have occurred within the jurisdiction.â<a>[78]</a>   The third option was preferred by Lord Pearson and it was in that context that he gave as a reason that it was:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ manifestly just and reasonable that the defendant should have to answer for his wrongdoing in the country where he did the wrong.â<a>[79]</a></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Endorsing this theme, Lord Goff in <i>The Albaforth</i> said that it followed from the <i>Distillers</i> decision and another he reviewed<a>[80]</a> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ where it is held that an alleged tort has been committed within the jurisdiction of the Court, the test which has been satisfiedin order to reach that conclusion is one found on the basis that the Court, so having jurisdiction, is the most appropriate Courtto try the claim, where it is manifestly just and reasonable that the defendant should answer for his wrongdoing.  This being so,it must usually be difficult in any particular case to resist the conclusion that a Court which has jurisdiction on that basis mustalso be the natural forum for the trial of the action.  If the substance of an alleged tort is committed within a certain jurisdiction,it is not easy to imagine what other facts could displace the conclusion that the Courts of that jurisdiction are the natural forum. Certainly, in the present case, I can see no factors which could displace that conclusion.â<a>[81]</a></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  The effect of <i>Spiliada</i> is that in applications for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction it is for the judge to identify the place at which the case canmost suitably be tried for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice, which include questions of efficiency and economy,the onus being on the applicant to show that the forum put forward for the claim is the appropriate forum for the trial of the actionand that that is clearly so.  The assessment is pre-eminently one for the trial judge.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The suggestion made in this appeal as to the factors to be considered in determining appropriate forum is that <i>Spiliada</i> addressed generalities, whereas the <i>Albaforth</i> addressed the situs of the tort, not just as one of the <i>Spiliada</i> factors, but as a factor that has its discrete policy-driven consideration which it will normally be difficult to displace.  Theargument is that this was not recognized by the judge who therefore erred in principle.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Mr Shieh SC for the first defendant contends that the place of commission of the tort is a factor that ought not to be treated asone driven by some special policy reason but ought, rather, to be treated as a <i>Spiliada</i> factor, that happens with some regularity to come to the fore simply because the parties to an action founded on tort and the witnessesto a tort tend to be in one place and tend to be in the place of the tortâs commission.  The suggestion that it was ever intendedgenerally to apply some special policy status in <i>forum conveniens</i> cases to the place of the tort ignores, he asserts, the peculiar parentage of the point, namely, the <i>Distillers</i> case which had nothing to do with <i>forum conveniens</i> but with the question whether there was a cause of action which arose within the jurisdiction.  That, historically, is correct butit has to be said that Lord Goffâs dictum about the place of tort in forum cases and the policy reason for it, has been repeatedwith apparent approval elsewhere, not least by the House of Lords in <i>Berezovsky v Michaels</i><a>[82]</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  I do not in the event think it necessary in this case to engage the question raised by Mr Shieh, interesting though it is.  Thatis because, although the pre-eminent weight which Lord Goff might be thought to have attributed to the place of the tort has sincebeen modified or clarified, it is nonetheless well established that the starting point is to be viewed as the place of the tortâscommission.  <i>Berezovsky</i> made clear that there was no conflict between <i>Spiliada</i> and <i>The Albaforth</i> and, in particular, in relation to the weight to be given to the place of commission of the tort, Lord Hope said<a>[83]</a> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">The principle which Ackner LJ articulated in <i>The Alabaforth</i> provides the starting point, but no more than the starting point, for a correct application of the <i>Spiliada</i> principles to the question whether the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under Ord 11 r4(2).â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:right">See also <i>Lennox Lewis &amp; Others v Don King<a>[84]</a></i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  I am satisfied that the judge well understood the starting point.  He specifically referred to Lord Goffâs comments in <i>The Albaforth</i> in relation to the significance of the place of the commission of the tort<a>[85]</a> and to the fact that this was prima facie the natural forum<a>[86]</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  I am satisfied too that the judge did not misapply relevant principles.  In so far as the plaintiffs emphasise the place of thetort, it seems to me that they elevate that factor to one that is non-contextual.  The tort factor is one that must necessarily besensitive to nature and context.  In this case there was between the parties a pre-existing relationship which was governed by thelaw of Bermuda; the alleged tortious acts took place not only in Hong Kong but London also; and the very same assertions have beenthe subject of litigation elsewhere.  The plaintiffsâ concentration for its suggestion that Hong Kong was the centre of gravityof the case concentrated then, as now, on history rather than on questions of convenience at the date when the question of jurisdictionfell to be addressed by which latter date the factors had changed significantly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Once one is satisfied, as I am, that the judge well appreciated the principles, one is left with the exercise of a judicial discretionthat, as Lord Templeman said in <i>Spiliada</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ is pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge â¦  An appeal should be rare and the appellate court should be slow to interfere.â<a>[87]</a></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Mr Strachan complains that the test applied by the judge introduces fluidity: the forum changes every time witnesses move.  I cannotagree, for the question is determined at a fixed time: the time at which the issue of appropriate forum comes to be determined. He then asks the question: If not Hong Kong, where?  This, with respect, is not the correct question.  The correct question is whetherthe plaintiffs have established that Hong Kong was clearly the <i>forum conveniens</i>.  In his assessment of that issue, I see no error of principle made by the judge; nor any matter taken into account that he oughtnot; nor the failure to take into account any matter that he ought; and there is no merit in the contention that he was plainly wrong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Accordingly, in my judgment, this limb of the appeal also fails.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Material non-disclosure</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  The judge was of the opinion that this aspect of the case was âessentially incidental to the main argumentsâ<a>[88]</a>; and he did not consider that a sufficiently strong case had been made out under this head.

In this affidavit, reference is made tothe trial in Bermuda under a heading devoted to it.  There is mentioned the nature of the defendants claim; that is to say, thatit was a claim for fees.  Then, as to the counterclaim, it is said that that was for breach of fiduciary duty âin relation to theirmanagement of the [Companyâs] affairsâ.  Nothing more specific than that.  The fact is related that judgment had not yet beendelivered, and then this: âThe circumstances surrounding the non-disclosure of the D S Cheung report played a prominent role inthe counterclaim at the trial.â  This was, I think, a strange phrase to use.  It would have been easier and more direct, surely,to say that the sole issue asserted in the Hong Kong proceedings fell for determination as a discrete issue in Bermuda.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  The affidavit asserted that the significance of the non-disclosure of D S Cheung report had not been discovered until a few daysbefore the Bermudan proceedings.

The affidavit contained the same phrase as did the February affidavit, as tothe âprominent roleâ of the D S Cheung report, and the deponent then said that: âJudgment was delivered in March 2004 in favourof the Investment Manager.  That judgment is currently under appeal to the Court of Appeal in Bermuda.â  In what regard that judgmentfavoured the Investment Manager is not stated.  What, one is bound to wonder, was so difficult about disclosing to the Hong Kongcourt that the judge in Bermuda had expressed himself satisfied that the Board of Directors of the Company had all necessary information;that the Bermudan court had rejected the Companyâs claim that the Manager had failed to disclose the nature of the advice tenderedby D S Cheung; and that the pending appeal, a matter of weeks away, concentrated upon this very issue?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Exhibited to one of these affidavits was part of the examination-in-chief of Mr Murray in the Bermudan trial in which he had saidthat he had never received the D S Cheung memorandum.  During cross-examination of Mr Murray, he was taken through the history ofevents in mid-1997 and asked whether he had instructed the Manager to review yet again the existing agreement with Zhongbei to ensurethat the Companyâs interest was protected.  It was put to him that in that context Duncan Hon, the Managerâs representative,had said at the meeting of 5 July that âthe lawyers had identified an issueâ and further that âthey had also suggested howto deal with it.â  Mr Murray answered, in cross-examination: âI donât specifically recall it, but I have no problems with it.â This was, it might be thought, a concession of some potential significance, particularly since it was common ground that the Managerhad never tabled the memorandum at that meeting and that the Managerâs case was, rather, that the effect of it was orally revealed. Yet the affirmation mentioned only the evidence-in-chief.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  There are other suggested instances of material non-disclosure but those to which I have referred suffice for present purposes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  The duty upon an <i>ex parte</i> application of the present kind is to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts, which is to say facts material for thejudge to know: <i>Brinkâs Mat Ltd v Elcombe</i>.<a>[90]</a>  It is self-evident in this case that in determining whether to exercise his power to grant leave to serve out of the jurisdictionâ a serious step indeed â the fact that the proposed Hong Kong proceedings ran the same issue as had been run elsewhere and,later in the piece, that the proceedings constituted a collateral attack upon the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction onthat self-same issue was highly material for the judge to know.

It must always be rememberedthat the granting of ex parte relief provides (albeit so that justice can be done) an exception to the most basic rule of naturaljustice â that both parties should be heard.  Thus the need for full disclosure by the party seeking relief â and thus to mymind the need to continue to make full disclosure while the proceedings remain on an ex parte basis.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:right">Commercial Bank of the Near East Plc. v A, B, C and D<a>[91]</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  In the Bermudan anti-suit proceedings the non-disclosure â by the same individual solicitor, it so happens, albeit not the samenon-disclosure â was heavily criticised.  So, in my judgment, it deserves to be in this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  This was not a case in which non-disclosure was restricted to some point of fine detail at which only a counsel of perfection wouldbaulk.  What was not disclosed was central, important and straightforward information; and I find myself, with respect, in fundamentaldisagreement with the judge's conclusion on this issue.  The fact that I would have taken a different decision is not, in the exerciseof an appellate function, dispositive of this aspect of the respondentsâ notice, because the judge below was acting in the exerciseof a discretion and the sound point is made by the plaintiffs that the judge was also the tribunal that heard the <i>ex parte</i> application.  All that said, I am of the view, with respect, that in the exercise of that discretion, the judge plainly erred. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  In coming to his conclusion he said that he did not consider this aspect of the case as anything but essentially incidental to themain arguments<a>[92]</a>.  This aspect of the case was, I would answer, only incidental in the sense that the defendants did not need to rely on it once theysucceeded on other grounds and because the judge had, by the time he came in his judgment to determine the issue of non-disclosure,already decided the issues of abuse of process and <i>forum non conveniens</i> in favour of the defendants.  But that was not to the point, because the question of material non-disclosure was one to be determinedin isolation, assuming for that purpose that the issues of abuse and forum had not been decided.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Secondly, the judge took the view that the criticisms had resonance âwith the benefit of hindsightâ.  If one puts oneself inthe shoes of the deponent of these affidavits, a person thoroughly familiar with the history of the case, most particularly withthe history and detail of the proceedings in Bermuda, it is difficult to see where hindsight comes into it.  It is not as if he failedby some unfortunate oversight to address a subject matter that, with the benefit of hindsight, he ought to have addressed; or thathe overlooked or misjudged matters of detail.  He addressed the fact of proceedings in Bermuda and in addressing it he must havechosen what to say and how to say it.  Yet he conspicuously failed to tell the court that the very factual issue upon which the HongKong proceedings depended had already been determined against his clients in another court of competent jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  I would therefore hold that the judgments should be affirmed on the further ground of material non-disclosure by the plaintiffs. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  For the reasons I have
