It authorised the search of premises of a corporate service provider (âRmbsaâ) which were alsothe premises of a foreign law firm.  The warrant was executed.  By an application for judicial review, Rmbsa (first applicant) andthe law firm (second applicant) challenged the validity of the warrant and of its execution.  That application was dismissed by HartmannJ on 10 August 2006.  This is an appeal from that dismissal. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>    With the authority of the Central Government, Hong Kong is party to a series of agreements for mutual legal assistance in criminalmatters.  The Ordinance gives domestic legal effect to specific arrangements for mutual legal assistance between Hong Kong and otherjurisdictions and in respect of which the Chief Executive in Council has by order directed that the Ordinance shall apply<a>[1]</a>.  One such arrangement, in respect of which such an order has been made, is between Hong Kong and the Government of the Republicof the Philippines<a>[2]</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>    The arrangement requires the signatory parties to provide assistance in the investigation and prosecution of criminal offencesand in proceedings related to criminal matters, so long as that assistance accords with the provisions of the arrangements.  Suchassistance includes the execution of requests for search and seizure.<a>[3]</a>  Requests are to be made by and to a designated Central Authority in each jurisdiction.<a>[4]</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>    On 18 January 2006 the appropriate authority for such purposes in the Philippines made a request to the Secretary for Justicefor legal assistance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>    The assistance sought was the issue and execution of a search warrant for the purpose of an investigation in the Philippines inconnection with the construction of a terminal at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila.  The allegations include the suggestionthat the bank accounts of two companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, Jetstream Pacific Ltd (âJetstreamâ) and MainlandGlobal Ltd (âMainland Globalâ) were used for the transfer of corrupt funds to a person whom we shall call L whose function itwas to bribe officials in the Philippines.  Those two companies were administered in Hong Kong by Rmbsa, the company that providescorporate services.  It is said that very substantial sums of money passed through these accounts.  The law firm, at its principaloffice in the Philippines, acts as counsel for a company alleged to have been complicit in the corrupt activities<a>[5]</a>.  No allegation is made against the law firm.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>    In January 2005, the office of the Ombudsman of the Republic of the Philippines â which, we are informed, carries out a prosecutorialfunction â issued indictments against a number of individuals, and investigations into the alleged bribery continues in the Philippines. The purpose of the request to Hong Kong for mutual legal assistance was to pursue those investigations.  The evidence is that theassistance sought included a request for the search of the offices of Rmbsa, the registered office of Jetstream and Mainland Global,and for the seizure of such items there as related to Rmbsaâs relationship with those two companies as well as to other matters,to the details of which I will return<a>[6]</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>    After receipt of the request, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (âICACâ) obtained records from the Companies Registryand conducted observation outside the registered address of Rmbsa.  Its Articles of Association show that it was established to actas secretary, director, accountant, registrar, and to provide nominee, custodian, trusteeship and other corporate services.  Theentry in the Companies Registry showed that the only shareholders were a Mr Alejandro and Mr Buenaventura who together with a MrRamiro were the directors.  The registered office of Rmbsa was at Far East Finance Centre, Harcourt Road, Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>    The complication which is at the core of this case is that that registered address is also the address of the law firm, whichis a foreign law firm registered as such in Hong Kong of which Mr Alejandro and Mr Buenaventura are partners.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The warrant</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>    On 7 April 2006, an application was made by information of Tse Yuk-tsing, an investigating officer of the ICAC, to a magistratefor the issue of a search warrant under section 12 of the Ordinance.  The uncontested evidence is that the magistrate was asked whatpremises were to be searched and that he was told by Mr Tse that âthe premises to be searched included the Hong Kong office ofa Philippine law firm, which provided company secretarial services.â<a>[7]</a>  The information included the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="85%" valign="top" class="quote">âThe companiesâ articles of incorporation provide no information regarding their owners, although the registered director of both[companies] accounts is Rmbsa Nominees Ltd, a Hong Kong affiliate of [Pâs] Philippine legal counsel, the law firm of Romulo MabantaBuenaventura Sayoc and de los Angeles.  â¦ ( Rmbsa Nominees has since changed its name to Rmbsa Corporate Services Ltd).â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The reference to [P] is to a company that secured the contract to build the terminal and is said to have been involved in the allegedcorruption. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>    The magistrate issued the warrant.  Its terms are important.

It is common ground that upontheir production Mr Alejandro asserted that the material in the files were covered by legal professional privilege since they relatedto an arbitration in the Philippines to which Jetstream and Mainland Global were parties.  Mr Tse reported this to Mr Walsh and,in accordance with his instructions, the two files were sealed in an envelope in the presence of Mr Alejandro.  Mr Tse left the premises. After he left, one of his colleagues asked if there was storage space in the premises designated for Rmbsaâs files and was toldthat there was and a room in which filing cabinets were located was inspected but nothing further was seized.  A list of seized itemswas provided to Mr Alessandro.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>    Mr Alejandroâs testimony, on affidavit, contradicts that of the ICAC officers as to the claims for privilege.  Mr Alejandroasserts that he made clear to the officers that the premises were the offices of a law firm and was told that that was irrelevantbecause the warrant was addressed not to the law firm but to the first applicant at its registered address<a>[11]</a>.  He says that he told the officers that all the materials on the premises were subject to legal professional privilege.<a>[12]</a>  He agrees that some of the material was sealed at the premises, but not the two ânon-kitâ files of Jetstream and Mainland Global. Be that as it may, by letter dated the 13 April 2006 solicitors acting for the law firm wrote to the ICAC asserting privilege inrelation to all the documents seized and demanding that all be sealed pending judicial determination.  The items not sealed on 12April were sealed in the presence of the solicitors on 13 April.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The application for judicial review</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>    The notice of application for leave to apply for judicial review, dated 2 May 2006, challenges the decision of the magistrateto issue the search warrant, the decision of the Commissioner of the ICAC to execute it, and the decision of the Commissioner toseize matters that were or appeared to be subject to legal professional privilege.

It was, he contends, obvious on the facts presented to the magistrate that there was inherent in the proposed search and seizurea risk that material protected by legal professional privilege might be included in the items covered by the application for thewarrant and he asserts that, as a matter of law, it was therefore incumbent upon the magistrate to set conditions for the executionof the warrant, namely, a condition that no item the subject of such privilege was to be seized and a further condition that if lawyerswere not present at the time of entry they should be notified before any search commenced.  He makes suggestions for further conditionsthat might be imposed, such as one requiring an independent lawyer to accompany the law enforcement authority to the search so thatthat individual might then determine at the scene whether documents intended to be seized were or were not privileged from seizure,but he does not suggest that these conditions are a <i>sine qua non</i> of validity, for which reason I do not intend to address them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>    With one exception, all the authorities to which Mr Dykes drew our attention were cases of searches authorized on the officesof legal advisers, there being no suggestion in any of those cases that any other business was conducted at the premises by anothercompany or for purposes unconnected with the rendering of legal advice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Analysis</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(1) The question of privilege</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>    A search warrant is a serious inroad upon the integrity of a personâs property and upon his privacy.  Such an inroad can onlybe lawful if clearly authorized by law: see <i>Entick v Carrington</i><a>[21]</a> and <i>Attorney General of Jamaica v Williams</i><a>[22]</a>.  The law relied upon for the requested intrusion in this case is the Ordinance.  It follows that the warrant will be invalid onlyif the requirements of the Ordinance properly construed have been breached: see <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v Rossminster Ltd<a>[23]</a></i>; <i>R v Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte Tamosius &amp; Partners (a firm)</i> <a>[24]</a>; <i>Re an application by a firm of Solicitors</i><a>[25]</a>; and <i>Apple Daily Ltd v Commissioner of the Independent Commission against Corruption</i><a>[26]</a>.

Statutes authorizing the issue of warrants vary widely in their requirements. So, to take examples from cases to which we have been referred, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which governs the subjectin the United Kingdom expressly requires the magistrate to satisfy himself that the material sought does not consist of or includeitems subject to legal privilege,<a>[29]</a> and there is a whole series of highly specific conditions governing orders for search and seizure of other information of a confidentialnature, referred to as excluded and special procedure material.  Section 20C of the Taxes Management Act 1970 provides that the issueof a warrant under that regime does not authorise the seizure and removal of documentation in respect of which a claim to professionalprivilege could be maintained, but the extent of the search and seizure permitted, once the warrant is issued under the procedurethere prescribed, does not then depend upon the terms of the warrant for once the warrant is issued the officer is entitled to seizeand remove âany things whatsoever found there which he has reasonable cause to believe may be required as evidenceâ.<a>[30]</a>  Mr Dykes, in this case, as in <i>Apple Daily</i>, has taken the Court to a number of decisions in other common law jurisdictions, primarily to some which suggest the inclusion uponwarrants of conditions of the type for which he contends in this case; although as I have emphasized the cases, save one, concernsearches directed at law firms themselves.  As pointed out by Nazareth VP in <i>Apple Daily</i> cases elsewhere âdo reveal some difference in the effect they held to result from deficiencies in warrants, in particular minordeficiencies that apparently did not have any practical or consequential significance.â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>    In this case we are concerned with the provisions of section 12 and by reason of that section, a warrant will be valid if:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">an authorised officer properly nominated by the Secretary for Justice has reason to believe that the thing to which the foreign requestrelates is or will at a specified time be upon or in any premises, on a person, on certain land, or otherwise in a personâs effectivecontrol;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">that officer lays an information which sets out on the grounds for that belief;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the magistrate is satisfied, with the benefit of such further information, if any, as he may require concerning the grounds on whichthe issue of the warrant is sought, that there are reasonable grounds for issuing the warrant; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">there is a statement in the warrant of the purpose for which it has been issued, the time at which the search is authorised and thedate of its expiry, as well as a description of the kind of thing that is authorised to be seized.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>    On its face, all these conditions were satisfied in this case as was the prescribed form of warrant.  I accept, however, thatthe magistrate may not authorize the seizure of material which he knows or on reasonable grounds believes to be subject to legalprofessional privilege.  So much is common ground as a matter of fundamental principle, and implicit from section 2(10) of the Ordinance. Subject only to a question to which I will return touching upon one specific item, the warrant in this case did not authorize, eitherexpressly or impliedly, a search or the seizure of privileged material.  It did not even authorize a search of the files of a solicitorâsfirm, and it is in this regard that this case is to be distinguished from the many upon which Mr Dykes invited us to rely.  I respectfullyagree with the factual analysis of Hartmann J<a>[31]</a> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the company named in the warrant was a corporate services company that shared office space with a law firm, but was an entity separatefrom the law firm; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the search warrant on its face limited search and seizure to documents in the possession of the company Rmbsa and was not directedat any of the law firmâs practice files or other practice documents; </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">there was no material described in the warrant that was on its face protected by legal professional privilege, although the possibleexception to this was item (ii) which sought things ârelating to [Rmbsaâs] relationship to the â¦ law firmâ; as to which Iwill say more later; and </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">if there were a requirement in the circumstances of a particular case to spell out in the warrant the exclusion of privileged documents,the likelihood of the documents sought in this case being privileged was not such as to warrant such an express condition. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>    I commented earlier that it seemed relatively clear that no separate facilities had been set aside to accommodate the corporateservice files of Rmbsa<a>[32]</a>.  My impression during the hearing that that was common ground is qualified only by a passage in the evidence which has since caughtmy eye: it arises in an affirmation of an ICAC officer, Mr Ho, who says that after Mr Tse left the premises he ââ¦ asked Mr Alejandrowhether there was any storage space in the premises designated for Rmbsaâs files.  He answered in the affirmative and indicatedto me a room where file cabinets were located.â<a>[33]</a> The thrust of the evidence however was that no clear division had been effected.  In the Notice of Application the applicants assertedthat âfor all practical purposes, the first and second applicants share the same staff, file cabinets and office facilities.â<a>[34]</a>  Furthermore, in his affirmation of 26 July 2006 Mr Alejandro said that when asked by the ICAC officer if there were things in thewarrant other than the corporate kits that had been produced, âI repeated â¦ that our HK office was a law office and that thematerials kept on the premises were subject to legal professional privilege.â<a>[35]</a>  In the same affidavit he described the offices as shown by photographs exhibited to it and there is no suggestion there of any separatefacility or storage for corporate service companies.<a>[36]</a>  Indeed, he went on to say that Rmbsa ââ¦ is at all time treated as part of the legal practice of our HK office, and we draw nodistinction between the two entities.â<a>[37]</a> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>    I proceed first on the assumption, which seems a safe one in the light of the passages to which I have drawn attention, that nodistinction was drawn between the two entities.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>    It seems to me that a solicitor should not so organize his firmâs affairs that its records become mixed with those of a separatebusiness which he is lawfully entitled to run, with the result, though not intended by the solicitor, that a client may obstructlawful requirements for expeditious disclosure which that client would not otherwise be able to resist.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>    Principle 2.08 of the Hong Kong Solicitors Guide to Professional Conduct, by which foreign law firms registered as such in HongKong are also bound provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">A solicitor shall not by himself or with any other person set up or operate a separate business, other than a solicitorâs practice,which offers any service which may normally be offered by a solicitor as part of his practice; provided that this principle shallnot apply to a wholly-owned executor and trustee company, nominee company or company to provide company secretarial services.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Mr Dykes would have us read that as a requirement upon a solicitor to treat such a secretarial service as part of his practice, therebyendorsing by implication the non-separation of files that, on one view of the evidence, we see in this particular case.  I do notagree with that interpretation.  It seems to me clear from that provision, and more particularly as a matter of practical commonsense,that the company secretarial service if established by a solicitor is to be treated by him as âa separate businessâ, with allthat that implies.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>    The fact that documents happen to be housed in the same premises as are occupied by a firm of solicitors but which have not beencreated or delivered there for the purpose or as a result of seeking or providing legal advice does not, simply because they happento be there, transform them into privileged material or attract to them the sort of privilege-related condition which Mr Dykes wouldhave us require as a material part of a search warrant.  Were it otherwise, it is easy to see with what readiness those with a motiveto avoid search warrants would deliver documents to their solicitors.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>    In this case the assumption seems to have been made by the firm that everything in the premises was part of the practice and thateverything there was therefore necessarily covered by solicitor-client privilege.  That was not a correct assumption either on thefacts or as a matter of law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>    The point has been made in <i>Perry Kilbreath and others v The Attorney General of Saskatchewan<a>[38]</a></i> â a case in which the court refused to hold that the warrant was invalid simply because it did not set out terms and conditionsdesigned to prevent breach of solicitor-client privilege â that the conditions that must be established before the solicitor-clientprivilege applies:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">15.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="80%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ are often misunderstood or forgotten by lawyers who mistakenly believe that whatever they do and whatever they are told is privilegedmerely by the fact that they are lawyers. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">16.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="80%" valign="top" class="quote">Thus, as examples that are by no means exhaustive, the solicitor-client privilege does not attach to documents unrelated to the givingof proper advice, but stored with the solicitor to avoid seizure.

There is nothing on the face of the warrant which suggeststhat it expressly or impliedly authorised a search of the law firmâs legal advisory documents or documents that had come into itspossession for that purpose.  The search warrant is directed at documents belonging to a company which may or may not be a clientof the law firm, and in relation to the affairs of companies and connected individuals for which that corporate entity (not the lawfirm) provides corporate (not legal advisory) services.  As in <i>Kilbreath</i>, the assertion of privilege in this case is not representative of the classic situation with which the authorities placed beforeus were concerned, namely, search warrants directed at legal advisory entities in whose premises one could safely say privilegedmaterial inevitably would be kept.  The suggestion that the facts of the case were bound to raise in the magistrateâs mind thespectre of solicitor-client privilege because he, the magistrate, knew that the address was the same as that of a law firm entailsan assumption that, contrary to sensible practice, the documents of the corporate service provider would be enmeshed with those ofthe solicitorâs practice files.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>    If on the other hand, Mr Hoâs testimony<a>[39]</a>, which seems at odds with that of the applicants, is correct and is to be read as indicating a clear division of facilities accordedto Rmbsa, then all the more obvious should it be to the firm that Rmbsaâs affairs were not part of the firmâs legal advisoryservice; and, further, on such a factual scenario, the likelihood of stumbling across privileged material is of a quite differentorder, rendering the applicantsâ arguments correspondingly weaker.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>    It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to decide whether the conditions for which Mr Dykes contends would have beennecessary had a warrant authorised a search of practice papers or had it been known or believed on reasonable grounds that the materialsought was subject to legal professional privilege, but assuming for the sake of argument that that were so, that is not the presentsituation and I am not prepared to hold that in the present circumstances such conditions were necessary or that their absence rendersthe warrant invalid.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>    There is in the warrant one matter itemised which may be said to stand in a category different from the others listed.  It isthe one described as âthings of Rmbsa â¦ relating to ... its relationship to the Philippine law firm, Romulo Mabanta BuenaventuraSayoc and de los Angeles.â  One knows not how this was relevant to the investigation in the Philippines but, be that as it may,Mr McCoy SC for the respondent contends that this was directed not at communications related to the seeking or giving of advice,but at the structural relationship between the two entities.  On its face that would appear to be what was intended, for which reasonit seems to me that the warrant does not in this particular authorise the seizure of privileged material although the warrant inthis regard was not drawn with the precision that was desirable to ensure that the search and seizure went no further than its intent. It seems to me also that the seizure of such material as went to the nature of the relationship ran a risk that it might revealprivileged documents.  Even so, that is in my judgment not a fact that in this case renders the warrant a nullity.  Putting the matterat its highest against the respondent on this point, and even assuming that the warrant gave authority in this one regard which itcould not in law give, such excess of authority went to only one of a series of items and that in my assessment would not renderthe entire warrant invalid.  If the conditions for the issue of a warrant have been observed, the fact â if it be a fact â thatone part of the warrant was surplus in the sense that it purported to give authority which it had not the power to give does not,absent prejudice to the person affected by it, render the warrant invalid: <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i>, above.<a>[40]</a>  There was no prejudice caused in this case.  As Hartmann J emphasized,<a>[41]</a> care was taken in this case to ensure that privileged documents were safeguarded: officers of the ICAC took legal advice before executingthe warrant and were advised that if privilege was claimed during the search of items for which such a claim was made should be sealedin the presence of the claimant without examination; a lawyer for Rmbsa was present when the warrant was produced at the premisesand executed; there is evidence that he was told that the officers were interested only in documents related to the secretarial serviceprovided by Rmbsa; further legal advice was taken by the officers when at the premises after a claim to privilege was made; and documentsin respect of which a claim was made were sealed, even though in this last regard there is an issue as to timing of some of them. There is no suggestion that any information has been passed to the investigators.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(2) The presence of lawyers </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>    As for the contention that the warrant ought to have embraced a condition that the warrant was not to be executed without thepresence of a lawyer, it would in my opinion on the facts of this case have been better to include such a condition; and I wouldadd that since the premises of Rmbsa was shared with the law firm, the hours for the search ought in the warrant to have been restrictedto office hours, or to such other hour of which prior notice had been given.  But neither of these features are in this case suchas to render the warrant invalid and one notes, as matters transpired, that the warrant was executed within office hours and withRmbsaâs lawyers present.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(3) An allegation of non-disclosure</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>    There is one separate matter advanced by the appellants which is the suggestion that the warrant was obtained in the face of materialnon-disclosure.  It is not a matter dealt with in the judgment of the court below though we are assured that it formed the subjectmatter of submissions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>    It is not necessary to delve into the detail of the complaint because I am satisfied that it does not get off the ground.  Itsuffices to say that the complaint relates to non-disclosure to the magistrate of the suggested fact that at the time of the applicationfor the search warrant, there were related court proceedings in the Philippines that had been made the subject of a stay order; anorder, I understand, now under appeal.  There is some dispute as to the status of those connected proceedings at the date of thatapplication but that matters not for present purposes.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>    The appellantsâ contention is that by virtue of the provisions of the international arrangement encompassed in the Order, thePhilippine authorities were bound to bring those procedural developments to the attention of the Central Authority in Hong Kong. There is an obligation upon an applicant for the warrant to make full and frank disclosure of such facts as may be relevant to theexercise of the judicial power to issue a warrant, and the failure to do so may mean that the warrant will be set aside<a>[42]</a>.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>    There is no suggestion that the authorised officer was aware of these connected proceedings or of their status and there is noquestion of him misleading the court.  It remained the fact, as it does today, that a âcriminal matterâ<a>[43]</a>, as defined by the Ordinance<a>[44]</a>, had by then been commenced and it remained the fact that there were reasonable grounds to believe that things relevant to the investigationsthat constituted the criminal matter were located in Hong Kong and that the officer had reason to believe that the specified thingsto which the request related were to be found in the premises of Rmbsa.  That being so, the magistrate was duty-bound to issue thewarrant.  If it were to transpire in any particular case that there has been a breach of the terms of the international arrangement,that would be a matter for the Executive ultimately to consider if and when it comes to decide whether to send seized material tothe requesting jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>    For these reasons, this appeal should, in my judgment, be dismissed.  I would make a costs order nisi that the costs of this appealbe to the respondent, to be taxed if not agreed.  There is a respondentâs notice that asks the court to examine the files seizedto determine the claim of privilege; and a suggestion of some breach of the Foreign Practice Rules.  It has not been necessary togo into that, and I would make an order nisi that there be no order as to the costs of that notice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Yeung JA:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>    I agree with the judgment of Stock JA and have nothing to add.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Ma CJHC:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>    For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed.
