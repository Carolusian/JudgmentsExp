On week days, theplaintiff was then sending out its staff twice daily for collecting the takings of these stall-owners.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> There was an earlier robbery at the end of January 1977, which occurred at the former assembly point of the plaintiff's collectionstaff on the first floor of one of the shops in the market. At the time, the plaintiff had already engaged the defendant for cashdelivery service, but at that particular junction the defendant's guards had not taken charge of the cash.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The defendant's service commenced on or about the 13th January 1977 although the agreement was dated the 18th January. Guards ofthe defendant were to take possession of the monies collected by the plaintiff's collectors for delivery to a branch bank of theplaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> After the January robbery, the plaintiff set up another assembly point known as the Receiving Centre on the first floor of No. 15Shek Lung Street in the Yaumati Fruit Market.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In each team, the number of guards provided by the defendant for the Receiving Centre varied from 2 to 3 On the 11th July 1977 whentwo guards, one of whom was armed with a shot gun, were escorting the monies collected from the plaintiff's customers in the YaumatiFruit Market to a security vehicle parked in Reclamation Street outside the lorry park exit, they were waylaid and robbed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The 11th of July was a Monday which would include the customers' week-end takings. The collection amounted to $565,498.90, and thatwas with the guard escort at the time of the robbery. After the robbery, a sum of $59,044.63 was recovered. Therefore, in the Julyrobbery, the plaintiff lost $506,454.27.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The court was told of a third robbery in the Yaumati Fruit Market involving the plaintiff in 1978 when the plaintiff was served bya team from "Po Wai Kuk" with two armed guards. No particulars were given of that third robbery.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> According to Mr. Au, a clerk of "the plaintiff's Nathan Road Branch, at the beginning of the defendant's service, one of its guardschained the canvas bag for money to his waist, but that practice ceased after a time. Metal containers were USED after the Januaryrobbery but for only about a week. The reason was that the metal containers were just not big enough for all the leather bags ofthe size of a briefcase used by the plaintiff's collectors. After the July robbery, subject-matter of this action, metal containerswere reintroduced and one of the defendant's guards, the carrier, also resumed chaining the container to his waist. The revived practiceof chaining again stopped after a time.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The plaintiff has now engaged "Guardforce" which provides two teams of four guards each, two of whom are armed, for any one collection.In addition, on the first day following every holiday, three teams of identical composition are provided for each collection.</p>    <p>           </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> As for the plaintiff's collectors, they went individually to the stall-owners in the Yaumati Fruit Market and made their own roundof collection with the bank's prepared receipts. Each of them carried a leather bag in the shape of a briefcase. Collection time,twice a day, was dictated by the business hours and convenience of the stall-owners. It was to commence at about 11:00 a.m. and before3:00 p.m. The guards of the defendants would call daily at the Receiving Centre at noon and 3:00 p.m. They were fairly punctual.Waiting time was not more than 5 to 10 minutes. By the appointed time in the morning and in the afternoon, all the plaintiff's collectorswould normally have returned to the Receiving Centre with their collections in leather bags which were then put into a canvas bagready for the guards of the defendant. The canvas bag was locked before it was handed over to the guards against the defendant'sreceipt.</p>    <p>           </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In the course of this trial, statements made to the police of the two guards as well as one of the robbers were admitted. They arenot statements made specifically for this trial and, therefore, they are far from being as comprehensive as one would wish them tobe for the purposes of these proceedings. They are lacking particularly in matters of preventive measures and effectiveness of theteam. The statements provided a narrative of what transpired rather than what could have been prevented. The makers were also notmade available for cross-examination. Subject to these limitations, there appears to be no good cause for doubting the truthfulnessof the outline of the events given.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Once admitted, aside from evaluation, evidence is evidence of the trial open to all legitimate use by either party to these proceedings.The statements of the defendant's two guards in the July robbery, Mr. Or and Mr. Chau were introduced by Mr. Mills-Owens, counselfor the plaintiff. It was thus contended that without the service of a hearsay notice and presumably a follow-up application, thedefendant was precluded from relying on any of these two statements. Mr. Mills-Owens referred me to page 592 of the 1985 White Bookwhere <u>Letraset Limited</u> v. <u>Dymo Limited</u><sup>(1)</sup> was cited. At line 4, page 68, from the observation of counsel for the plaintiffs in that case, it is clear that Letraset was grantedleave to read, subject to prior notice, the transcripts of an earlier proceeding as evidence without further proof but that, havinggiven such notice, the plaintiffs had not sought to introduce these transcripts in evidence or made any use of them. The defendantsapplied for leave to admit the same transcripts in the absence of a hearsay notice. It was resisted on, inter alia, the ground thatcounsel had had no chance to deal with this proposed evidence when no reference was made to it in cross-examination of the plaintiffs'witnesses or in the defendants' own evidence. Graham J. refused the application with this comment: "It would be wrong to allow thedefendants to rely upon it particularly when they only seek leave, at this stage." Letraset does not support what seems, at firstsight, to be a fairly sweeping statement in that paragraph of the 1985 White Book.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The robbery in question as described in the statements was: The defendant's guards saw at least 4 robbers, three with guns, one witha knife. In the course of an attempt by a robber to snatch the shot gun from the team commander, the shot gun was accidentally fired.Another robber was aiming a pistol at the bag carrier, Mr. Chau, who also had a knife pointed at his right hip by another man frombehind. The circumstances were terrifying. The team commander, Mr. Or said categorically that he "was very scared", so much so thathe "forgot to shout out for help". From the robber's statement, we learned that this group with a varying membership attempted noless than 5 robberies, including the one in the fruit market on the 11th of July. In fact, for this particular July robbery, theyhad aborted an earlier attempt when one of their members was recognised by people in the fruit market. This time in July, they likewiseshared a common purpose and barely carried it out with success. They certainly all harboured an intent to come to the aid of oneanother by force if necessary against possible resistence, and the execution of their planned enterprise was with such violence thateven the team commander was put to fear. The robbers made good their immediate escape, and as a result the plaintiff sustained aloss of $508,304.25. The plaintiff's claim against the defendant for its loss in the July robbery is founded on breaches of contractas well as the defendant's common law duty to take proper care as required of it as a bailee in the circumstances of this case see<u>Houghland</u> v. <u>R.R. Low (Lucury Coaches) Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(2)</sup></strong></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The defendant was to provide a caste transit delivery service, and it was required to use any special or professional skill thatit held itself out as prossessing. See Vol. 2 Halsbury's Law of "England 4th edition, paragraph 1521. A private carrier has the sameobligation as that of a bailee and as such he is only liable in negligence and deliberate acts inconsistent with the bailor's ownership.See Vol. 5 Halsbury's Law of England 4th edition, paragraph 307. As for a common carrier, as opposed to a private carrier, his liabilityseems to be put on a slightly different footing. Lord Justice Donaldson, as he then was, in The "Raphael " <strong><sup>(3)</sup></strong> reiterated the summation of Lord Justice Bankes in <u>Rutter</u> v. <u>Palmer</u><strong><sup>(4)</sup></strong>:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Thus in Rutter v. Palmer, Lord Justice Bankes contrasts the position of the common carrier and the railway carrier with that of theordinary bailee. The former operate subject to liabilities independently of negligence the latter do not."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p> </p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Loss or non-delivery is prima facie evidence of negligence of a private carrier in his capacity as a bailee. See 5 Halsbury's Lawof England 4th edition, paragraph 307. It is, therefore, for the defendant as bailee to show that the loss occurred without any neglecton its part or that if the loss was caused by its neglect, it was absolved by the exemption clause. See <u>Port Swettenham Authority</u> v. <u>T.W. Wu &amp; Co</u>. <strong><sup>(5)</sup></strong> and the observation: of Denning L . J., as he then was, in <u>J. Spurling Ltd.</u> v. <u>Bradshaw</u><strong><sup>(6)</sup></strong>:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A bailor, by pleading and presenting his case properly, can always put on the bailee the burden of proof in the case of non- delivery,for instance, all he need plead is the contract and a failure to deliver on demand. That puts on the bailee the burden of provingeither loss without his fault (which, of course, would be a complete answer at common law) or, if it was due to his fault, it wasa fault from which is excused by the exemption clause."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Therefore, "procedurally, not only is the onus on the defendant, but the plaintiff is not required to give particulars and the defendantcannot apply for further particulars of negligence". See generally page 238 Atkins Court Forms Vol.6. the defendant was well awareof its burden to show that it was not at fault. There was no request for time to meet any particular point arising in the courseof these proceedings.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Turning to the contractual side of the defendant's obligation, by an Agreement in writing dated the 13th January 1977, the defendantagreed to provide cash transit delivery service from Monday to 3:00 p.m. on Saturday, public holidays excluded. The Agreement wasmade subject to the standard conditions printed on its back. Condition 3 reads as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The company shall not be liable for any non-delivery, loss or damage directly or indirectly happening through any of the followingoccurrences, namely:-</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="14%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td width="65%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">                Earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, subterranean fire or other convulsion of nature.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="15%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td width="65%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">                Typhoon, hurricane, tornado, cyclone, flood, or other atmospheric disturbance.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="15%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td width="65%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">                War, invasion, act of foreign enemy hostitities or warlike operations .

The Yaumati Fruit Market area was describedby Senior Superintendent Paang as "a bad area for Crime". The plaintiff's expert Mr. Hill told the court that the area was congestedand would provide ample opportunity for potential robbers to mingle with the crowd in obscurity. Mr. Hill was at pains to emphasizethat the locality was a good place for ambush. The defendant's team commander, Mr. Or who was carrying the shot gun at the time ofthe July robbery, said in his statement that as it was known to be "a dangerous point", he loaded his shot gun before he left theReceiving Centre.</p>    <p>           </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The defendant issued Standing Orders for its own personnel, end disobedience of these Standing Orders would be visited by the penaltyof instant dismissal or appropriate disciplinary action. The defendant's expert, Mr. Howells, considered the area as one of suchhigh risk that he "would try desperately to avoid entering into a contract in the first instance." He "personally would have preferredat least four or five armed guards which he knew would be completely outside the client's budget". He expected a prospective clientto decline his quotation, if asked to pay for a force of armed guards of his own preference. Mr. Howells concluded that even if hehad accepted a contract for such service, he would have insisted on "absolutely no liability whatsoever the circumstances". Mr. Howellsalso stated the obvious that it was up to the security company to anticipate the risk and danger that they might have to face. Heconcluded that any security company providing such cash transit service must have been aware that the operation was highly vulnerable.It was no doubt a high risk area, but professionally there must be a minimum degree of force below which all would decline to advise.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The court was constantly reminded of the dual purpose of an armed escort: first, as a deterrent and if need be as a force of resistance.Success of an attempted robbery, so Mr. Hill opined, would depend much on speed, and likely delay caused by even token resistancein any form or shape would deter an attempt and undermine its success. All preventive measures taken, so Mr. Hill explained, wouldhave a cumulative effect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The plaintiff was quite justified in its criticism that whilst the burden of proof lay squarely on the shoulders of the defendant,the defendant had led no evidence apart from that of its expert, Mr. Howells. The team commander and the carrier were not calledto offer evidence with a view to establishing loss without the defendant's negligence. As I have said, the statements of one of therobbers, Mr. Yim and the team members, Mr. Or and Mr. Chau were primarily solicited for the purpose of proving the criminal quiltof the culprits.</p>    <p>           </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The focal point is not the likelihood of staging a robbery attempt with a gang commensurate with however formidable an escort force.The crux of the matter can only be whether the defendant had taken proper care and precaution as demanded by the known circumstances.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> It is not difficult to visualize that loss can be suffered in a crime without any negligence of the bailee or that a crime, as anovus actus interveniens, could shut out negligence as a cause for the loss. Indeed, in <u>Hollier</u> v. <u>Rambler Motors Ltd.,</u> <strong><sup>(7)</sup></strong> Salmon L.J. envisaged a burglary without fault on the part of the bailee from a laundry. For the other side of the coin, we havecases like <u>Olley</u> v. <u>Marlborough Court</u><strong><sup>(8)</sup></strong> in which the hotel management was held negligent in not keeping the guest room key in safe custody resulting in a foreseeable theftof the guest's valuables. In <u>Richmond Metal Co.Ltd.</u> v. <u>J. Coales &amp; Son Ltd.,</u><strong><sup>(9)</sup></strong>Mocatta J. referred specifically to one of the known duties of a haulage contractor as bailee to take precaution "to lessen the risk"of robbery.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> I descend now to the specific aspects of precaution said to be required of the defendant in the circumstances:</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Parking</u>:</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Senior Superintendent Paang readily conceded an error in his letter offering advice to the bank after the July robbery. His estimated10 minutes' walking time to the security van should be 2 minutes. The Senior Superintendent knew not precise nature of the containerused at the material time; nor in fact was any real detailed study made of the incident by his own section. However, there seemedto be enough information for his gratuitous guidance. His task was not detection of crime or prosecution of the offenders.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> As for parking of the security vehicle, Senior Superintendent Paang was of the view that it heel to be in the layby in Waterloo Roadclose to Shek Lung Street. He concluded that there was hardly any other alternative. He suggested that perhaps security could beimproved by moving the war further up or down the same road on different occasions.</p>    <p>           </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Mr. Howells favoured the same parking space as that actually used by the security van in the July robbery. Mr. Hill preferred thelayby in Waterloo road, but be conceded that parking should alternate between Waterloo Road and Reclamation Street. Mr. Hill furthersuggested that when Reclamation Street was used, the security van should be brought closer to the entrance into Shek Lung Street.Mr. Hill also advised the Guards to use the Shek Lung Street as exit to Reclamation Street avoiding the lorry park.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Of course, the route of the men on foot is material, but the shortest safe distance must be dictated by the position of the securityvan. On the occasion of the robbery in July, the security vehicle vas parked right next to the lorry park exit, and the comparativelyshorter route to the security van so parked was through the lorry park. Mr. Hill was speaking of a space close to the junction ofShek Lung Street and Reclamation Street, and I accept his evidence that alternating of parking places was more desirable than Seniorsuperintendent Paang's suggestion and that the lorry part should be avoided at virtually all cost. On this occasion on the 11th July1997, the defendant should have caused its security van to he parked higher up the road closer to the junction between Shek LungStreet and Reclamation Street so as to facilitate the team avoiding the lorry park and using an equally short if not shorter routethrough Shek Lung Street. It is not so much where the security van was parked along Reclamation Street, but the team should havetaken Shek Lung Street instead of the lorry park. And when using Shek Lung Street, it would plainly be desirable to move the securityvan closer to the junction. On this occasion, the defendant was negligent in not instructing its team to avoid the lorry park andalso in its team using the lorry park.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Number of guards and armed guards</u>:</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr. Hill told the court that two armed guards would diminish "the ease of the robbers' task", that the vision of a single armed guardwas limited as he could net possibly survey an area of <strong>360<sup>0</sup></strong> that two armed guards would provide a better lookout, that they would be able to complement each other and that two armed guardswould present a more formidable show of force as a deterrent. In effect, as Mr Hill summed up, two armed guards would be more thantwice as good.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> It must be recognised that no precaution is fool-proof. There is always the possibility of the will and capability of arranging fora superior force, but as Senior Superintendent Paang pointed out that a higher level of concerted effort and timing would be requiredto overpower or overpower simultaneously more armed guards. The duty of the defendant was also to parade a sufficient show of forceso as to lessen the risk of robbery in addition to providing better security for making it more difficult to succeed. Mr. Hill'sconclusion was that there should be a minimum of one more armed guard though he fairly conceded that the addition would probablyhave made no difference. Mr. Hill was in fact asked whether, given the determination of the gang and their planning including thepositioning and undercover activities assigned to the men, the provision of one more armed guard would have made any difference.Mr. Hill had no personal knowledge of the robbery. Before his reply, he had not been given the information that this gang had noexperience with more than one armed guard, that they were not altogether highly efficient, that they called off an earlier attemptjust because one of their members was recognized and another one had previously worked in the market, that these two members werediscarded but asked to serve only as look-outs, that the robbers detailed to intercept and rob were too slow and that one of thelookouts threw in his unscheduled intervention and struggled with the armed guard. Mr. Hill's concession was made on the assumptionthat the robbery was put into execution as planned without any miscalculations. His concession was also made without reference tothe past history and the site performance in July of this not too efficient band of men.</p>    <p>           </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Mr. Howells agreed that one armed guard was inadequate. I was not impressed by the attempt to qualify this unambiguous answer inhis re-examination. Mr. Howells' view, however, was that less than three armed guards would not likely make any difference to theend result, and he preferred personally four or five armed guards. Like Mr. Hill, Mr. Howells was not invited to correlate the effectof an extra armed guard and other factors cumulatively. I will deal with the cause and effect of an extra armed guard later, butit is convenient here to set out part of an internal memorandum of the defendant dated the 11th August 1977:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Within insurance limit, vehicle usually has two armed guards but on this occasion due to a manpower shortage, only three-man crewwas available."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p> </p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Senior Superintendent Paang's conclusion was that an extra armed guard would make an attempted robbery a much more difficult proposition.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> I find that the defendant was negligent in providing only one armed guard on that occasion, but as to whether negligence on thisaspect was a cause of the loss in the robbery, I will come back to it later. Some insurance companies were said to have acceptedcoverage in the case of one armed guard escort, but I know not on what considerations was the policy of these insurance companiesformed nor their premia charged. Their course of dealings, in the absence of full explanation, cannot be very material.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>More secured container</u>:</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The canvas bag used on the occasion of the July robbery was more bulky, heavier and soft. It was thus more difficult to manage orcarry away by the robbers than a tin. Before the July robbery, metal containers were at one time used, but they were found to beimpracticable because they could not hold all or as many leather bags of the collectors. Mr. Estcourt of the defendant had discussedwith the plaintiff's officers on the use of metal containers, but he did not insist on such user. Mr. Ho, the Manager of the plaintiff,was adamant that if the defendant had insisted on the use of metal containers, the bank would only have continued with its serviceif there was no other alternative. For all these reasons, the defendant was, I find, not negligent in allowing user of the canvasbag to be continued.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Time of arrival</u>:</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> There was no strong room or vault in the Receiving Centre, and therefore it was essential for the armed escort to synchronize withthe return time of the plaintiff's collectors. The collection by the plaintiff's collectors was much governed by the convenienceof the stall-owners in the Yaumati Fruit Market. Time could not be adjusted. Mr. Estcourt had brought this up for discussion withthe plaintiff's staff. With explanations from the plaintiff, Mr. Estcourt accepted the time for collection. The estimated time fortheir return to the Receiving Centre of the plaintiff's collectors was shortly before noon and 3:00 p.m. and arrival of the escortteam was accordingly arranged. Waiting time was no more than 5 to 10 minutes. I do not find the defendant negligent in adhering tothe fixed time for cash transit duties.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> As for the route to be taken by the security van, it was common ground that that was irrelevant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Chaining the container to the body of the carrier</u>:</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Part of the standard equipment of the cash transit delivery crew of the defendant was two security chains. The Standing Orders ofthe defendant expressly provided for the security chains to be attached to the waist of the carrier. Even Mr. Howells, expert forthe defendant, readily conceded that he would not countenance any breach of the Standing Orders. It was the defendant's onus to showthat their proper duty of care had been discharged. Senior Superintendent Paang was not prepared to accept the belt or the springclip of the defendant by reason that they could easily be unfastened. Mr. Howells was sympathetic on the human aspect of the situationthat the carrier would be reluctant to chain himself to the container. But apart from being part of the Standing Orders, it was adesirable step to take. It would deter and delay an attempted robbery. I find the defendant negligent in not providing more securebelt and spring clip and in its carrier not using the chair as stipulated in the Standing Orders in the July robbery.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The defendant's counter allegations of breach of contract or contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff as to the use ofproper container, variation of arrival time of the team, alleged failure to fellow advice etc. were not pursued, and in fact Mr.Ching did not dwell on any of them n his final address.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> I pass then to consider whether the negligence of the defendant as found caused or contributed to the loss in the July robbery. FromMr. Yim's statement, it was a gang of six, but there was only an effective number of four with the extra two as look-outs. I havereferred to the unexpected participation of one of the look-outs who succeeded in relieving the team commander, Mr. Or, of his shotgun. Three robbers were armed with pistols and one with knife. Mr. Yim in his statement described four previous robberies. The firstone involved three security guards with one carrying a shot gun walking in front. It was a success and they netted some $180,000.The second attempt was a failure: The target was a factory without any security guard, and the failure was brought about by the accidentalfiring of a revolver. The third attempt was also a failure: The gang were waiting outside the goldsmith shop at its closing time.When the iron-gate was reopened, the robbers were not quick enough to gain entry. The foot of one of the robbers was caught in theslamming iron-gate, and he fired a shot to intimidate the employees. All resistance immediately stopped, but the robbers themselvestook flight and scattered. In their fourth attempt, the gang visited the wrong address and tied up the wrong victims. As for thisparticular July robbery, they had made an earlier attempt which was called off because one of the robbers was recognised in the YaumatiFruit Market. This gang were not all that dangerously desperate. From the statement of Mr. Yim, no shot had been aimed at their victimseven it resistance. They were hardly efficient in planning or action. They were unsure of themselves and lacked co-ordination, andthere was no display of ruthless audacity.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> All the aspects of negligence of the defendant as found are best to be examined collectively, and their cumulative effect shouldbe assessed. I have found that the team failed to use Shek Lung Street or avoid the lorry park, that the defender provided less thanthe minimum number of armed guards and that the carrier failed to use the chain as prescribed by the Standing Orders or at all. Asto what transpired, we had only the bare skeleton given in the police statements of the robber and the guards. For this trial, thesestatements have their limitations. Moreover, as pointed out by Mr. Mills-Owens, between the statements of Mr. Or and Mr. Chau, thereis an unresolved discrepancy: Mr. Or stated that he went alone from the parked van to the station whilst Mr. Chau claimed that hewas with Mr. Or in this particular journey.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> One would wonder if the robbery would have been attempted had the team taken the route of Shek Lung Street or had one additionalarmed guard been provided. In my view, probably it would not have been attempted. If efficiency and audacity of this gang were tobe judged by their past performance, particularly not having previously encountered an escort team with more than one armed guard,two armed guards suitably spread would probably have deterred them from putting their planned enterprise into execution. The ShekLung Street route would also present difficulties to the gang in positioning or planting their men. The gang would not likely havemade the attempt. The chaining would have some deterrent effect, but I cannot say that the robbers would have been much discouragedon account of this alone. But I take the view that the cumulative effect of all three would likely have deterred the gang and ifattempted much of the risk of loss would have been reduced. If attempted in Shek Lung Street, raider the protection of two armedguards and with the bag chained to the carrier, it is impossible to say that the gang would never have succeeded, but probably theywould not have. In my view, this much is clear i.e. the risk of loss would have been greatly reduced. By not taking these preventivemeasures to reduce such risk, the defendant contributed to the loss. Since there was no chaining, I need not be concerned with theunsatisfactory belt and clip.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Coming back to the robbery in this case in the lorry park: The armed robbers missed their prime time in ambush, and with two armedguards the robbery would probably have been foiled. Given the actual scene, the defendant, I find, probably caused the loss in therobbery or contributed to its success by the cumulative effect of the insufficient number of armed guards and failure to chain thecanvas bag to the carrier. Naturally the team should have taken but did not take the Shek Lung Street route. In my view, the cumulativeeffect of these two factors would probably have also deterred the robbers at the scene and prevented the robbery. Therefore, I findthat the defendant has not shown that the July robbery was without its negligence in the manner hereinbefore alluded to.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Having endeavoured to ascertain and decided on liability, I turn to consider Clause 3(d) in question. On behalf of the defendant,Mr. Ching submitted that Clause 3(d) exempted the defendant from liability arising from any loss in a riot. Counsel further submittedthat "riot" was "emphatically a term of legal art". See <u>London &amp; Lancashire Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.</u> v. <u>Bolands, Limited</u> <strong><sup>(10)</sup></strong> and <u>Shell International Petroleum Co. Ltd.</u> v. <u>Gibbs</u>.<strong><sup>(11)</sup></strong> It is well established that a criminal law term is not to be differently treated merely because it is contained in a commercial document.See observation of Viscount Sumner in <u>Lake</u> v. <u>Simmons.</u> <strong><sup>(12)</sup></strong> Counsel referrer me to Field v. <u>The Receiver of Metropolitan Police</u> <strong><sup>(13)</sup></strong> for the five elements of a riot, which have been reiterated with annotations in the latest edition of Archbold. I do not proposedto repeat them. The definition of riot in criminal law was applied it an insurance policy case by the House of Lords in <u>London &amp; Lancashire Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.</u> v. <u>Bolands, Limited</u> (ibid). The American District Court took a more liberal view in <u>Pan American World Airways Inc.</u> v. <u>The Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. and Others</u>, <strong><sup>(14)</sup></strong> but in <u>De Lasala</u> v. <u>De Lasala</u>, <strong><sup>(15)</sup></strong> Lord Diplock pronounced that the Hong Kong courts "would be well advised to treat" the House of Lords' decisions on comparable legislation"as if they were straightly binding". Moreover, in <u>Athens Martime Enterprises Corporation</u> v. <u>Hellenic Mutual War Risks s Association (Dermuda) Ltd.,</u> <strong><sup>(16)</sup></strong> Staughton J. declined to embrace the American approach and applied the same definition as did the House of Lords. I need go no furtherthan to say that the robbery in July 1977 in this case was a riot within the meaning of that term contained in Clause 3(d).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Mr. Ching on behalf of the defendant denied negligence as well as any causal link between negligence, if any, of the defendant andthe loss in the July robbery. Counsel further submitted that the July robbery was the effective or dominant cause of the loss ofthe plaintiff and that therefore, negligence of the defendant, if any and causative, should be ignored as being subsidiary. See <u>Wayne Tank &amp; Pump Co., Ltd.</u> v. <u>Employers Liability Assurance Corp., Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(17)</sup></strong> much was also sought to be made of a dictum of Lord Donning M.R.<strong><sup>(18)</sup></strong> for the proposition that even if the defendant's negligence and the crime or robbery had been "equal or nearly equal in their efficiencyin bringing about" the loss, provided one of these causes, such as the robbery as a riot, fell within the exemption clause, the defendantwould still have been wholly absolved from liability.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> But the marked difference between a contract of carriage and a marine insurance policy is "that in the latter case, the causa proximaalone is regarded; whilst, in the former, you may go behind the causa proxima, and look at what was the real or efficient cause.""In the case of a bill of lading you may sometimes look behind the immediate cause". See <u>Thomas Wilson &amp; Son Co.</u> v. <u>The Owners of Cargo per the "Xantho</u>". <strong><sup>(19)</sup></strong></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> At page" 515 in The "Xantho", speaking of the shipowner's duty in a contract of carriage, Lord Macnaghten had this to say:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There is also an engagement on his part to use due care and skill in navigating the vessel and carrying the goods.

In the case of a bill of lading it is different,because there the contract is to carry with reasonable care, unless prevented by the excepted perils. If the goods are net carriedwith reasonable care, and are consequently lost by perils of the sea, it becomes necessary to reconcile the two parts of the instrument,and this is done by holding that if the loss through perils of the sea is caused by the previous default of the shipowner, he isliable for this breach of his covenant."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p> </p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> In <u>Smith, Hogg</u> v. <u>Black Sea &amp; Baltic</u>, <strong><sup>(21)</sup></strong> Lord Wright said of the consequence of negligence of a carrier thus:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="17%"></td>            <td width="67%" valign="top" align="left" class="quote">                "In marine insurance negligence causing the loss does not affect the insured's right to recover.

Therefore, the underlying principles in insurance law have no roomfor application in bailment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> It is just as convenient here as any to deal with construction. Clause 3(e) of the Agreement is concerned only with acts or omissionsof the plaintiff and its authorised agents or servants. Apart from that sub-clause, Clause 3 seems wholly detached from the subjectof negligence, either in contract or in tort. Clause 3(a) specifies the geological risk. Sub-clause (b) is one for meteorologicalrisk. Sub-clause (c) may perhaps be categorized as international risk as opposed to sub-clause (d) for internal risk. Allow myselfthe luxury of borrowing a term from the Maritime Law, having discarded its and general insurance principle, these are all "misfortunerisk". See <u>Photo Production</u> v. <u>Securicor Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(22)</sup></strong> Plainly, there is no express reference to negligence in Clause 3(d) ; nor can I find an expression synonymous with negligence inthat sub-clause. Clause 3(d) has not been widened in scope by words, such as "any act or omission" as in <u>Donoghue</u> v. <u>Stevenson</u>, <strong><sup>(23)</sup></strong> or "all liability whatsoever" as in <u>Canadian Steamship Lines Ltd.</u> v. <u>The King</u>, <strong><sup>(24)</sup></strong>or "in no case" as in <u>National Coal Board</u> v. <u>William Neill &amp; Sons (St. Helens) Ltd.</u> <strong><sup>(25)</sup></strong> In fact, the use of the words "any loss" as in Clause 3 here suggests that the make of the document "is directing attention to thekinds of losses, and not to the cause or origin." See Vol. 1 Chitty on Contracts 25th edition paragraph 878, which also give a listof other possible terms exempting negligence, such as "however arising", "any cause whatever", "however caused", "from whatever othercause arising", "howsoever arising", "arising from any cause whatsoever", "relieves from all responsibility for any injury, delay,loss or damage, however caused", "no liability whatever", "under any circumstances", "at sole risk", "at customers' sole risk", "atowner's risk" or "at their own risk".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> For matters of construction, Canadian Steamship provides the guidelines.

Indeed as May L.J. said in the "Raphael"<sup>(31)</sup>:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If the only head of liability upon which the clause can bite in the circumstances of a given case is negligence, and the partiesdid or must be deemed to have applied their minds to this eventuality, then clearly it is not difficult for a Court to hold thatthis was what the parties intended - that this is its proper construction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> But in the instant case, it was basically a contract for providing an armed guard cash transit service, though the defendant wasalso saddled with the common law duty in his capacity of a bailee. The defendant could be realistically made liable irrespectiveof negligence arising from breach of its bailee's common law duty of care e.g. the defendant could well be in breach of contractfor its failure or delay in performing the Agreement, with or without negligence. The defendant's negligence in breach of its dutyof care at common law was on entirely independent tort. I have said that Clause 3(d) is unconnected with fault or neglect and thatit contains no express reference to negligence. In my view, its terms are clearly no wide enough to cover negligence. Any ordinary,literate and sensible person would be horrified if he were told that the defendant would not be liable, however negligent, in theperformance of its crash transit delivery service. If the parties had intended to exclude negligence, it would have been easy forthem to say so in clear terms. Furthermore, it is inconceivable that at the time of the siging of the agreement in a printed standardform for cash transit delivery service, the parties could have envisaged any tortious liability at common law independent of thecontract. Counsel before me have laboured hard and long in eliciting the principles. In <u>White</u> v. <u>John Warwick &amp; Co. Ltd.,</u> Mr. Gibbons of counsel admitted that the exemption clause there under consideration would not avail for a completely independenttort. <strong><sup>(32)</sup></strong> The exemption clause in that case was in sweeping terms viz. "Nothing in this agreement shall render the owners liable for any personalinjuries ....", and it should have covered liabilities both in contract and in tort arising from failure to provide a good bicycleseat i.e. from a "self-same obligation".<strong><sup>(33)</sup></strong> Counsel's concession in that case suggests the possible existence of some independent tortious liability outside the reasonable contemplationof the contracting parties. But the crux of the matter here is that Clause 3(d) was just not wide enough to cover any negligence,and it is therefore quite unnecessary to apply the third test in Canada Steamship with reference to the bailee's negligence of thedefendant as an independent tort.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In conclusion, Clause 3(d) did not expressly absolve the defendant from negligence; nor was the clause wide enough to cover the defendant'sliability in negligence, particularly its negligence at common law as a bailee. If it were necessary to apply the third test in CanadaSteamship, I would be incline to the view that the defendant's negligence as a bailee was not "the only head of liability upon whichthe clause (could) bite in the circumstances" but that liability could realistically arise elsewhere from breaches of the contractfor cash transit delivery. Consequently, properly construed, Clause 3(d) would not, in any case, exempt the defendant's negligenceas bailee at common law.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> The defendant has failed to establish that the loss in the July robbery was without its negligence. In fact, I have found them tobe negligent or the above various aspects. I have also found that the defendant's negligence caused and/or contributed to the lossin the July 1977 robbery. For all the reasons 1 have given, the defendant has not brought itself within Clause 3(d) by reason onlyof the riot.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> In the circumstances, judgment is given in the sum of $506,454.27 for the plaintiff with, subject to what counsel have to say, costs.I am indebted to both counsel for their very comprehensive submissions on facts and law, which had to be telescoped within the allottednarrow space of time.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <blockquote>                    <p style="text-align:center">(B.
