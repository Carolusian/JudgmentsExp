It is a residential estate consisting of five blocks developed in two phrases.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 17<sup>th</sup> January 2009, the Incorporated Owners of Kai Tak Garden (â<b>IO</b>â) was set up. A management committee consisting of 10 members (â<b>MC</b>â) was elected on that day. The Plaintiff (â<b>Woo</b>â) was elected as the treasurer and the Defendant (â<b>Lam</b>â) as a member of the MC. Besides, Madam Mak Kam Yee (â<b>Mak</b>â), Mr. Lui Muk Shing (â<b>Lui</b>â) and Mr. So Chiu Chow (â<b>So</b>â) were respectively elected as the chairlady, the secretary and a member of the MC. The Housing Society remained as the managerof Kai Tak Garden.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The incorporation certificate of the IO was formally issued by the government on 26<sup>th</sup> February 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Woo, a government servant with the Environmental Protection Department, is the owner of Flat H, 31<sup>st</sup> Floor, Block 3 of Kai Tak Garden since 2000. He is also the Convener of the Supervising Housing Society Action Group (ç£å¯æ¿åè¡åå¬éäºº).So far as the evidence can show, the Action Group has been in operation since at least 2003. Woo alleged that the Housing Societyhad wrongly calculated the management fees and overcharged the residents of Kai Tak Garden. He thus adopted a âprotest approachâin paying management fees (in his own words: âæç¨æç­æ¹å¼å»äº¤ç®¡çè²»â). In effect, he did not pay management feeswhen the same fell due. He, on the other hand, pursued a claim against the Housing Society for refund of the wrongly calculated amount.It was said that the claim was settled by way of the Housing Societyâs repaying certain amount of the alleged overcharged sum.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  There is also evidence before me showing that the Housing Society had commenced a claim against Woo for outstanding management feesincurred between 2005 and 2009 in the Small Claims Tribunal. The small claims case was later transferred to the Lands Tribunal (<i>LDBM 251/2009</i>) <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. Judgment was already given under which Woo was ordered to pay, after trial, all outstanding management fees plus interest in thesum of $34,608.19.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Lam is a retired factory operator at the age of about 70.  He has been living at Flat E, 13<sup>th</sup> Floor, Block 5 of Kai Tak Garden since October 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In March 2009, it came to the notice of Mak (the chairlady) that Woo was in arrears of management fees for a number of years. Thematter was brought up for discussion, directly or indirectly, in such subsequent MC meetings as 30<sup>th</sup> March 2009 and 24<sup>th</sup> April 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On the other hand, on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2009, the Commissioner of the Fire Services Department issued a Fire Notice to the IO requiring the IO to remove, within 24hours, the miscellaneous items placed at the rooftop of Block 3 of Kai Tak Garden which had caused fire hazard; otherwise, a dailyfine of $10,000 might be imposed. Woo did not dispute that the items on the rooftop actually belonged to him. It was said that theFire Services Department had tried 7 times to visit the unit [that owned the items] but in vain<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.  As a result, the IO had to arrange for a cleaner to remove Wooâs items from the rooftop on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2009 and stored his items elsewhere to await his collection. From the evidence available to me, Woo has not collected his itemsup to 6<sup>th</sup> January 2010, despite various reminder letters from the Housing Society<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 8<sup>th</sup> September 2009, a document entitled âno-confidence motionâ (ä¸ä¿¡ä»»åè­°) in respect of Woo and So (â<b>the Motion</b>â) was signed by 8 members of the MC (save and except Woo and So as they were not present) in an internal meeting held on 8<sup>th</sup> September 2009 (â<b>Internal Meeting</b>â). The Motion was issued <i>in the name of the IO</i>. On the same day, it was displayed at the common area of the lobby of and distributed to the residents of Kai Tak Garden.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 16<sup>th</sup> October 2009 during the adjourned 5<sup>th</sup> MC meeting, the Motion was tabled for voting. Woo was present but he refused to be counted as a quorum of the meeting. He chose tobe treated as a sit-in resident of Kai Tak Garden. The Motion was passed unanimously during the meeting. It should be noted that<i>Lam</i> and So were <i>absent</i> in this meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  After the Motion was passed, So settled all outstanding management fees and thus remains up to the date(s) of trial an MC member.On the other hand, by the date(s) of the trial, Woo was already removed from the post of treasurer, as the management fees payableby him was still in arrears.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>The Motion</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  By this action, Woo alleges that defamatory words are contained in the Motion. However, instead of suing the IO, he chose to sueLam in his capacity as a member of the MC. He seeks, inter alias, damages in libel, exemplary and aggravated damages in the totalsum of $150,000; and an apology from Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Chung, Counsel for Woo, confirms at the outset of the trial that Woo would <i>not</i> be seeking an injunction against Lam any more.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Motion in its original Chinese together with its English translation (Ms. Wu, Counsel for Lam, has helpfully confirmed thatshe will not take issue on the English translation) is set out in full text in the Amended Statement of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  For the purpose of this Judgment, the Motion (only the parts referring to Woo) is repeated below (the alleged defamatory parts arein <i>italics</i>):</p>    <p style="text-align:center">â<b>åå¾·è±å(å½©è¹é)æ¥­ä¸»ç«æ¡æ³å</b></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">åå¾·è±ååæ¥­æ¶ï¼</p>        <p class="quote" style="text-align:center"><u>ä¸ä¿¡ä»»åè­°</u></p>        <p class="quote">æ¬å±èæ³åèª2009å¹´2æ26æ¥æç«è³ä»ï¼å¤§é¨ä»½å§å¡ä¸éºé¤åï¼ç©æ¥µåèåç£å¯å±èç®¡çäºåï¼ææ¬æå°æ¼2009å¹´9æ10æ¥çç¬¬äºæ¬¡ç®¡å§ææè­°ä¸å¨éå¸¸æ²éãè¿«ä¸å¾å·²çææ³ä¸å°ç®¡å§æå¸åº«è¡å¾·ä»åçåå§å¡èèçåçè­°æ±ºä½åºä¸ä¿¡ä»»åè­°ãåå å¦ä¸ï¼-</p>        <p class="quote"><u>å¸åº«è¡å¾·ä»åç</u></p>        <p class="quote">1. <u>æ¬ äº¤</u><u>40åæç®¡çè²»âè¡å¾·ä»åç(ç¾ä»»å¸åº«)</u></p>        <p class="quote">(1) è¡å¸åº«èª2005å¹´12æèµ·ï¼å±æ¬ æ¸¯å¹£$31,740.19(å±ç´44åæ)ã</p>        <p class="quote">(2) æ¡ä»¶ç¾å¨åå°å¯©æ ½èå¯©çä¸­ã</p>        <p class="quote"><i>(3)</i> <i>è¡å¸åº«å¨æè­°ä¸­æ¾åå¾å¸«ï¼å¶ä»å§å¡åæ¿åç®¡çå±¤é¢ååå¾ç¢ºèªå·²ç¹³äº¤ç®¡çè²»ï¼äºå¯¦ä¸æ²æï¼å¬ç¶èªªè¬ã</i></p>        <p class="quote">2. <u>æç¨å±é¨å¬å±å°æ¹âå¼è´äººèº«çå½å®å¨åé¡</u></p>        <p class="quote">(1) è¡å¸åº«æ¼ç¬¬3åº§å¤©å°æ¨å±¤ä¹å¬å±å°æ¹æºæ¾ç§äººç©ä»¶ã</p>        <p class="quote">(2) ç¶æ¿åå¤æ¬¡æ¸é¢è­¦åï¼ä»ç½®ä¹ä¸çã</p>        <p class="quote">(3) æ¶é²èèé·æ¼æ¬å¹´7æ31æ¥åæ¬æç¼åºãæ¶é¤ç«è­¦å±éªéç¥æ¸ãã</p>        <p class="quote">(4) åä»¤æ¬æå¿é æ¼24å°æå§æ¸çæéç©åã</p>        <p class="quote">(5) ä¸é¡§åä½æ¶çå½è²¡ç¢ï¼éç¡çãç¡æ³ãä¸åæçï¼è²ç¨±åæéäººä»ç´¢åæ¸¯å¹£ä¸ä»è¬ãé£æäººæ¾ä¸ä»è¬ç§äººè²¡ç¢å¨å¬å±å°æ¹ã</p>        <p class="quote">(6) å¶èªç§ä¹è¡çºæ¥µå¯è½å±å®³åä½æ¶äººèº«çå½å®å¨ã</p>        <p class="quote"><i>3.</i> <i><u>æªæå±¥è¡å¸åº«è·å</u><u>(ä¸æ¥æ¶æéæä»¶)</u></i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>æ¬ææ¼æ¬å¹´5æ12æ¥è´å½è¡å¸åº«åå¾6æ29æ¥ç®¡å§ææè­°ä¸åè¡å¸åº«äº¤æ¶æéæä»¶ï¼æé­è¡å¸åº«æçµãææ­¤ï¼è¡å¸åº«è³ä»ä»æªææ¥æ¶æéæä»¶ã</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>4.</i> <i><u>æ´¾ç¼å®£å³å®å¼µ</u></i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>è¡å¸åº«æ¾æ¼æ¬å¹´8æ9æ¥åæ¨æä»½ä»¥æ³ååç¾©æ¼ååº§å°ä¸å¤§å ä¿¡ç®±åæ¨å±¤æ´¾ç¼å®£å³å®å¼µãææ¬æå¾æªææ­¤å®æï¼äº¦å°æéå®å¼µå§å®¹ä¸æ¦ä¸ç¥ã</i>â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  It is necessary to point out at this stage that of all four paragraphs in the Motion, Woo complained about Â§Â§1, 3 and 4 only.He did not make any allegation that Â§2 in relation to âunauthorized use of common area of the estate â causing life safety problemâwas defamatory.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>The Pleadings</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Woo pleaded that the Motion contained defamatory words and set out in Â§4(2) of the Amended Statement of Claim the particulars ofthe alleged defamatory words (collectively called the â<b>Words</b>â).

Further, Woo averred that the Motionwas not published in good faith and in reasonable manner because it was published before it was approved in a formal MC meeting.The Motion, on the other hand, was published right after an alleged assault incident on 6<sup>th</sup> September 2009 (â<b>alleged assault</b>â) in which Woo alleged that Lam had assaulted him.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Agreed Issues in Dispute</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Pursuant to the Order of the Master made on 9<sup>th</sup> June 2011, the parties have agreed on a Statement of Issue in Dispute. Accordingly, the agreed core issues for determination in thistrial are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Whether Lam or the IO was the proper defendant to be sued in this action when the Motion, allegedly defamatory, was passed asa resolution of the MC of the IO at the meeting on 16<sup>th</sup> October 2009.</p>        <p>(2) Whether the words contained in the Motion as defamatory meanings of which the article was capable of bearing: (a) Woo was tellinglie about whether he has paid management fees, (b) Woo was in breach of his fiduciary duty as a treasurer of the IO and (c) Woo,without permission of the IO, circulated pamphlets purportedly in the name of the IO?</p>        <p>(3) If the above is yes:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>(a) Whether the defence of justification is established?</p>			<p>(b) Whether the defence of qualified privilege is established?</p>		</blockquote>        <p>(4) If the answer to Issue (2)(b) is yes, is the defence of qualified privilege nevertheless defeated by malice?</p>        <p>(5) Whether Lam as a member of the IO, is absolved of personal liability from a matter arising from his discharge of his duties inthe MC as provided for under section 29A of the BMO?</p>        <p>(6) If Lam fails to establish any of the defence, whether Woo suffered any loss and damages as a result of the words? Whether Woois entitled to aggravated damages?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  On these issues, Woo himself is the only witness on his side. The defence, on the other hand, has called Mak, Lui and a Law Fu (asecurity guard of Kai Tak Garden) as witnesses. Lam himself has also given evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I shall now go to deal with each of the above issues in turn.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Whether Lam or the IO was the Proper Defendant</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is beyond dispute that the Motion was passed in the adjourned 5<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting held on 16<sup>th</sup> October 2009, and that it was issued and published in the name of the IO.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr. Chung submits and relies on <i>Wong Wing Ho v Chong Lai Wah &amp; Another</i>, HCA 1948/2005. In that case, two letters, allegedly containing defamatory words against the plaintiff, were issued in the name ofthe management committee of the incorporated owners of an industrial building. Only the chairlady (1<sup>st</sup> defendant) and a member (2<sup>nd</sup> defendant) of the management committee were sued. Chu J (<i>as she then was</i>) held that:</p>	<blockquote>		<p class="quote">âThere is also nothing to support the plaintiffâs case that the defendants published the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Letters in their personal capacity. However, on the basis that the two letters were issued by the IO, it will be arguable, at least,that the defendants had âin their respective capacity as the chairlady and member of the 8<sup>th</sup> Management Committee of the IO, taken part in <i>authorizing the issue</i> of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Letters to the plaintiff and other owners of the Building. It may therefore be arguable that the defendants <i>caused or participated in the publication</i> of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Letters.â (emphasis added)</p>	</blockquote>       <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  This view of Chu J (<i>as she then was</i>) was confirmed by Tang VP when this case went to appeal (<i>CACV 212/2007</i>). The learned Vice President has this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant submitted that the plaintiff should not have sued him personally, that the letters were duly authorized by the IncorporatedOwners and issued pursuant to a resolution passed at the Management Committee Meeting. <i>On this, the learned judge decided against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, and rightly so in my view.</i> The plaintiffâs tactic may smack of victimization but the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is probably entitled to an indemnity by the Incorporated Owners, although that is not a matter for decision today.â (emphasisadded)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I also note that Ms. Wu has not expanded much on this defence in her closing submission.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  That said, I agree with Mr. Chung that while Woo could have sued the IO in this action, he is entitled to sue only Lam in the capacityof a member of the MC. And based on the cases quoted above, I conclude that Lam can be a proper defendant to be sued in this action.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Whether the Words were Defamatory</u></i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>Applicable Law</i></p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The gist of the torts of libel and slander is the publication of the matters (usually words) conveying a defamatory imputation.The burden of proof lies on the plaintiff. In determining whether words are defamatory, there are two stages: (1) to decide whatthey mean; and (2) to decide whether the meaning is defamatory: <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i><b>,</b> 11<sup>th</sup> edition, Â§2.1.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In determining the meaning of words in a libel action, the words are to be construed in their <i>natural and ordinary meaning</i>. Natural and ordinary meaning of the words refer to the meaning in which reasonable people of ordinary intelligence, with the ordinarypersonâs general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs, would be likely to understand them.  The question is <i>what would the words conveyed to the mind of the ordinary, reasonable, fairâminded reader</i>?  See <i>Gatley</i>, Â§3.15.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The notion of natural and ordinary meaning has two elements in it, namely, literal meaning and implication.  It is therefore immaterialwhether the defamatory imputation is conveyed by words of direct assertion or by suggestion, for insinuation may be defamatory asan explicit statement: see <i>Gatley</i>, Â§3.16.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  To decide on whether the meaning of the words are defamatory, the learned authors of <i>Gatley</i>, at Â§1.8, state as follows:</p>	<blockquote>		<p class="quote">âThere is no wholly satisfactory definition of a defamatory imputation. Three formulae have been particularly influential: (1) wouldthe imputation tend to âlower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generallyâ? (2) would theimputation tend to cause others to shun or avoid the claimant? (3) would the words tend to expose the claimant to âhatred, contemptor ridiculeâ?â</p>	</blockquote>        <p class="heading"><i>What the Words Mean</i></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  As a recap, Wooâs complaint is grouped into three categories (see Â§18 above). The natural and ordinary meaning of the Words ispleaded in Â§5 of the Amended Statement of Claim (see Â§19 above).</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  It is not advanced by Lam in the Amended Defence, nor in Ms. Wuâs final submission that the Words complained of do not carry thenatural and ordinary meaning ascribed by Woo in his pleadings.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Accordingly, I find that all the imputations set out in Â§5 of the Amended Statement of Claim arose out of the Words on a naturaland ordinary meaning.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Whether Meaning Defamatory</i></p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Ms. Wu submits to me that the burden is on Woo to prove that the Words convey a defamatory imputation in their natural and ordinarymeaning. She argues that the Words, in particular Categories (2) and (3), are not libellous words but description of facts only.Further, even if the Words were defamatory (which is denied), they are not actionable as defamatory because the Words might onlydamage Woo in the eyes of the residents of Kai Tak Garden but would not affect his reputation in the eyes of the average right-thinkingman. She relies on <i>Tolley v Fry</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%201%20KB%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] 1 K.B. 467</a> at p. 479:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWords are not defamatory unless they amount to an attack on a manâs reputation or character; they must tend to disparage himin the eyes of the average sensible citizen. <i>Words are not actionable as defamatory, however much they may damage a man in the eyes of a section of the community, unless theyalso amount to disparagement of his reputation in the eyes of right thinking men generally</i>. To write or say of a man something that will disparage him in the eyes of a particular section of the community, but will not affecthis reputation in the eyes of the average right thinking man, is <i>not</i> actionable within the law of defamation.â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  With respect, I am not persuaded by Ms. Wuâs submission. When considering if the Words were defamatory, the Court should considerthe Words as a whole. The learned authors of <i>Gatley</i> have set out the general approach at Â§3.13 which is useful to repeat here:</p>	<blockquote>		<p class="quote">â(1) The governing principle is reasonableness. (2) The hypothetical reasonable reader is not naive but he is not unduly suspicious.<i>He can read between the lines</i>. He can read in an implication more readily than a lawyer and may indulge in a certain amount of loose thinking but he must be treatedas being a man who is not avid for scandal and someone who does not, and should not, select one ad meaning where other non-defamatorymeanings are available. (3) over-elaborate analysis is best avoided. (4) The intention of the publisher is irrelevant. (5) <i>The article must be read as a whole, and any âbane and antidoteâ taken together.</i> (6) The hypothetical reader is taken to be representative of those who would read the publication in question. (7) In delimitingthe range of permissible defamatory meanings, the court should rule out any meaning which, âcan only emerge as the produce of somestrained, or forced, or utterly unreasonable interpretationâ¦.â (8) It follows that it is not enough to say that by some personor another the words <i>might</i> be understood in a defamatory sense.â (emphasis added)</p>	</blockquote>        <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In my view, each category of the Words must be read as a whole. And if so, the Words, in their natural and ordinary meaning as pleadedin Â§5 of the Amended Statement of Claim, are capable of conveying a defamatory imputation which tend to lower Woo in the estimationof right-thinking members of the society generally. Accordingly, I find the Words are defamatory.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Analysis of Evidence</u></i></p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Demeanours of Witnesses</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Before I proceed to consider the various defences raised by Lam, I think it is more fruitful for me to first deal with the materialfacts of the case leading up to the Motion because much of the facts are disputed by the parties. In fact, Mr. Chung for Woo spendsquite a substantial part of his written submission on the inaccuracy of the minutes of the MC meetings and the credibility of thedefence witnesses (Mr. Chung says that their demeanours were evasive and antagonistic). A ruling on the material facts includingthe accuracy of the minutes of the MC meetings at this stage would be helpful for the determination of issues and is likely to avoidunnecessary repetition of evidence when I come to consider each defence in turn later in my Judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The factual disputes on the events leading up to the Motion and on accuracy of the various minutes of the MC meetings will be discussedin greater details further below in my Judgment. I would at this stage make the following observations on Mr. Chungâs submissionin respect of the demeanours of defence witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I should start by saying, with respect to Mr. Chung, that I do not agree that the demeanours of Lam, Mak and Lui were evasive, especiallythat of Lam and Mak.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  My overall impression on Lamâs evidence is that he is a witness worthy to be believed.  He impresses me as an honest and fairwitness. For example, when he was cross-examined by Mr. Chung, he readily agreed that he had known as early as March 2009 that Woohad not paid a large sum of management fees, even though the answer would tend to support Wooâs evidence that MC members alreadyhad knowledge of his non-payment of management fees prior to the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting. Lam did not try to hide his true feeling to Woo and gave him comment fairly. In cross-examination, Lam was asked if hehad the feeling that Woo and So often argued irrationally (ç¡çåé¬§) and opposed the other MC members fiercely (ééç¸å°)that caused hindrance in the IOâs intention to serve the residents of Kai Tak Garden. Instead of feigning a reply that he deniedthe proposition, Lam readily replied âa little bitâ. He also honestly pointed out that Lui tried to give Woo the accounts documents<i>after</i>, not <i>at</i>, the 4<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting, despite this might be advantageous to Wooâs allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Mak was not evasive either in her oral evidence. Rather, as I recall, she was told by Mr. Chung more than once not to volunteerinformation when she was not being asked to.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Further, when analyzing evidence and credibility of any witness, this Court should not base only on demeanours, especially whenthere are already contemporaneous documents to rely on. And given it is the usual tactics during cross-examination to try to discredita witness and put to a witness that he /she is telling lies, the witness, being usually layman to law and the court procedures, mighttake it as a personal critique. Moments of losing temper, if any, can easily be understood. In my view, I should not rely solelyon demeanours in assessing credibility of any witness, be it of Wooâs or of Lamâs.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I shall now go to the factual disputes. But before I do that, I would add that the parties have adduced evidence on various eventswhich took place over a period of some nine months leading up to the Motion, some of which gave rise to factual disputes betweenthem. I will not attempt to deal with each and every factual dispute that is irrelevant to the issues or of peripheral significance;suffice to say that I have considered all the evidence and submission from Counsel carefully before I arrive at the conclusion onthe issues.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>1st MC Meeting on 20/3/2009</i></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> meeting of the MC was held on 20<sup>th</sup> March 2009 (â<b>1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting</b>â). Among other things that were discussed and resolved, two items are of relevance and I will set them out in the following.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  It was resolved in the 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting that a letter would be issued to the Housing Society for hand-over of documents to take place before 30<sup>th</sup> April 2009; the hand-over should cover all documents, accounts, movable and immovable properties<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>. The hand-over of documents is relevant to Category (2) of the defamatory words.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  It was also resolved that all documents including letters were not to be issued or posted <i>unless</i> with the approval of the chairman of the IO or the approval by the MC in its meeting; and those who issued or posted documents notin accordance with the above procedures shall be liable personally. The MC also reserved the right to claim for any loss/result causedby the breach of the rules set out above<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>. The distribution of pamphlets relate to Category (3) of the defamatory words.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I note from the minutes of his meeting that when votes on the motion concerning distribution of pamphlets were cast, Woo was notpresent. He had left the meeting at 11.50 p.m. and returned just after this motion was voted on and passed. When he returned to themeeting, he commented on the incorrect procedure adopted in advancing amendment to the motion. But Mak replied by simply saying thatthe motion was already passed.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>   In the circumstance, it is obvious to me that Woo knew that from then on, i.e. the date of this meeting, distribution of pamphletswas not allowed <i>unless</i> with the prior approval of the chairman of the IO or of the MC. Whether he personally agreed to this new arrangement or not is irrelevant.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting of 30/3/2009</i></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting was held until 2.10 am of the next day unfinished. It was thus adjourned to 30<sup>th</sup> March 2009 (â<b>Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting</b>â).</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  There is factual dispute between parties as to the accuracy of the minutes of this meeting, in particular agenda item 1.7 whichwas about the posting of payment records of management fees at each block.  Woo said that he had <i>not</i> claimed that he had paid management fees in the meeting<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. He tendered an audio recording and the transcript thereof to support his allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  I have listened and re-listened to the audio recording on item 1.7. I have also considered the transcript of the audio recording(the content of which is not disputed by Ms. Wu for Lam).  Both the recording and the transcript show that during the Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting, Mak read out a letter dated 26<sup>th</sup> (the audio recording does not say which month) allegedly from a group of residents of Phase One, Kai Tak Garden. The letter saidthat Woo and So, being MC members had <i>not</i> paid management fees for a long time. Mak said that she had double-checked with the Housing Society which confirmed the same to betrue. Mak expressed surprise to learn about this and commented about the need of a MC member setting up a good example to the otherresidents. She asked Woo to give an explanation.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  From what I have listened and re-listened, it seems clear to me that the conversation between Mak and Woo on this topic in theAdjourned1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting was not a happy one. It can also be quite fairly said that Woo was not satisfied at all about Makâs reading out of thisletter on outstanding management fees (in which his name was mentioned) in a formal MC meeting without first consulting him. In theend, Woo refuted and said the following:</p>	<blockquote>		<p class="quote">âä¸»å¸­ : æä¾å®¶è¬ç·ä¿ç®¡çè²»ãæå°ä¾å®¶çåä¿ç®¡çè²»ï¼æå°ç¥éæååæ¢è³[æ]åºé»ã</p>		<p class="quote">è¡ ï¼<i>ææDè³æå¢ï¼å¯ä»¥è­æå¢ä¸»å¸­ä½ æè¬æ¢ä¿æ¯«ç¡æ ¹æã</i>æåä¸æ¬¡ï¼éº¥ä¸»å¸­ï¼èµ·å¢åæä¸é¢å»å®£è®å¢å°ä¿¡, å°æé ææ¢åäººå·å®³ï¼ æé½åç®¡å§ææ´å¤ä½å§å¡è¬ï¼<i>ä½ å°ç¡èµ·æ¥æ¸äºå¯¦</i>, <i>å®¹è¨±ä¸»å¸­å»åå¢æ¨£é,</i> <i>ç®¡å§æäº¦è²¬ç¡æè²¸</i>ãä¸éåé¡ä¿ï¼åå¥½ææï¼å¨åº§åå¤ä½ï¼é¤å·¦ç¡é²é¢æ¢å§å¡ä¹å¤å¢ï¼ä½ å°ååé½è¦å°å¢ä»¶äºè² è²¬ä»»ãâ(emphasis added)</p>	</blockquote>		    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Reading the above lines of Woo as a whole, in particular âææDè³æå¢ï¼å¯ä»¥è­æå¢ä¸»å¸­ä½ æè¬æ¢ä¿æ¯«ç¡æ ¹æâand âä½ å°ç¡èµ·æ¥æ¸äºå¯¦, å®¹è¨±ä¸»å¸­å»åå¢æ¨£é, ç®¡å§æäº¦è²¬ç¡æè²¸â, I am of the view that Woo was trying,in effect, to refute Makâs allegation of his non-payment of management fees on the ground that he had information to show thatsuch an allegation was groundless and was not a fact. I cannot see how the minutes of the Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting which records âè¡å¸åº«æ´èªç¨±å·²ç¹³ä»ç®¡çè²»â is a falsity in the circumstance.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Submission is also made by Mr. Chung on item 1.8 of the Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>. He points out that item 1.8 stated that Woo indicated he would not receive remuneration of $1,200, and in fact both Lam and Maksaid in their oral evidence that Woo was simply silent on this point. Mr. Chung further submits that Mak has in her oral evidenceadmitted that the content of the minutes did not reflect the actual situation<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Again, I have checked the audio recording of the trial.  The recording shows that Mak <i>never</i> said in her evidence that the content of the minutes âdid not reflect the actual situationâ. Rather, she was saying that therewere 4 office-bearers in the MC that could be entitled to remunerations. Three of them, namely vice chairman, Lui and she herself,expressly said that they would not receive remunerations; whereas Woo did not show any response. Since the majority was âagainstâreceiving remunerations, Woo must be bounded by the majority view. That was why the minutes recorded that all four of them wouldnot receive remunerations. She further added that the minutes were drafted by the Housing Society. It had never occurred to her thatsuch wording would mean the otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I accept Makâs explanation to this item 1.8 of the minutes of the Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I find that the minutes of the Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting are true records of what happened on that day.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting of 24/4/2009</i></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> MC meeting was held on 24<sup>th</sup> April 2009 (â<b>2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting</b>â).  Apart from the members of the MC and the Housing Society (as the manager), a lawyer from Tse &amp; Associates (â<b>Lawyer Tse</b>â) attended the meeting on pro bono basis. Tse &amp; Associates later became the legal consultant of the IO. Some sit-in residentsof Kai Tak Garden were also present.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Agenda item 3.3 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting relates to the authorization given to the management office to chase for unpaid management fees, including those outstandingmanagement fees incurred prior to the issuance of the certificate of incorporation of the IO. This agenda item is relevant to Category(1) of the Words.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The minutes on item 3.3 recorded that Lawyer Tse asked if any MC members then present in the meeting owed outstanding managementfees; and if so, should not vote in fear of possible conflict of interest. No one made any response to Lawyer Tse. Then, Lawyer Tseclarified with the Housing Society which units were still in arrears of management fees. Wooâs unit was read out as one of theunits which still owed management fees. Lawyer Tse went on to ask again if any MC members present belonged to the units so read out.Again, no one made any response to Lawyer Tse. The MC members then proceeded to vote on this motion. All members, including Woo,voted in support of this motion.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Woo challenged the accuracy of the minutes of this meeting, in particular this item 3.3. But I have carefully compared the contentof the minutes of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting with the witness statement as well as the oral evidence of Woo. I cannot find there are any material discrepancies amongthem.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  That said, I am of the view that the minutes of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting, in particular item 3.3, are true and accurate records of what happened in the meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  On the other hand, Mr. Chung has made submission on the discrepancies of evidence between Mak, Lui and Lam in respect of this meeting.He submits that Luiâs evidence differed from that of Lam and Mak in that (1) Lui said he did not have any knowledge of Wooâsfailure to pay management fees at all material times including <i>on 24<sup>th</sup> April 2009</i> when the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting was held, whereas Lam and Mak agreed that they knew <i>as early as March 2009</i> that Woo was in arrears of management fees; (2) Lui said in the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting, Lawyer Tse advised those who owed management fees <i>to leave</i> the meeting, whereas Lam and Mak said Lawyer Tse advised those who owed management fees <i>not to vote</i>.  In gist, Mr. Chung says that Luiâs evidence is not believable.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  I have listened to the relevant parts of the recording of the trial. The records show that Mr. Chung began his cross-examinationon Lui by asking a few questions on the setting up of the IO and on what happened in the alleged assault on 6<sup>th</sup> September 2009. Mr. Chung then proceeded to refer to the Motion and the allegation that Woo âopenly tell a lieâ. On this topic,Mr. Chung firstly asked Lui what he understood by âopenly tell a lieâ. In reply, Lui explained what Lawyer Tse had advised inthe meeting and then said that the Housing Society had checked that Woo owed management fees for a number of years. Then, Mr. Chungasked if Lui all along knew that Woo owed management fees. To that, Lui replied: âååæååç¥å,æåååé¸å°é£æåç¥ä½¢ç¡äº¤ç®¡çè²»ãâFinally, Mr. Chung asked if Lui knew on 24<sup>th</sup> April 2009 that Woo was in arrears of management fees. Lui, surprisingly, said he did not know.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  There seems to be a discrepancy among the evidence of the defence witnesses as submitted by Mr. Chung. But on a closer analysis,Lui was <i>not</i> denying that he knew about the non-payment of management fees of Woo; he said he did not know about this at the beginning when theyran for the IO election. Given Luiâs age (he is 67 years old now) and the lapse in time (it was more than 2.5 years ago), it islikely that he might not be able to grasp the date of 24<sup>th</sup> April 2009 immediately when he was asked about it and put it at once in the correct time frame of the chronology of events. Unfortunately,this part of his evidence was not clarified in the re-examination.  Be that as it may, this little blemish is not serious enoughto destroy Luiâs credibility.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  As to Mr. Chungâs submission on the different terminology given by the defence witnesses in their oral evidence, I have checkedthe recording of the trial. Both Lam and Mak used the term âé¿å¸­â in their evidence. Lui used more than one terms to describewhat Lawyer Tse said: âé¢å ´â and âè¡éé¿ä¸é¿â. Frankly, I personally cannot see a big difference among the meaningsof these terms. Even if there was difference, I would think that given the lapse of time and given the relatively old age of Luias well as Lam, one would not expect them to be able to recall what Lawyer Tse had said verbatim.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>   On the whole, I find Lui, as well as Lam and Mak, an honest witness.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Hand-over on 30/4/2009&amp; Letter of 12/5/2009</i></p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  To follow up on the hand-over of documents from the Housing Society to the IO, Mak in the name of the MC issued a letter on 16<sup>th</sup> April 2009 to the Housing Society (â<b>16/4/2009 Letter</b>â). In this letter, Mak set out a list of documents, the original of which should be produced by the Housing Society on 30<sup>th</sup> April 2009 for the purpose of hand-over (â<b>30/4/2009 Hand-over</b>â).  The documents included those which must be relevant to Wooâs carrying out of his duty as the treasurer of the IO, such asmanagement fund, management fees information, audit accounts, monthly revenue and expenditure statements.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Mak said that the 16/4/2009 Letter was also copied to each member of the MC and posted up at the lobby.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Mak also stated in her witness statement that the Housing Society and she herself had tried, a number of times, to call Woo to informhim of the <i>time</i> of the 30/4/2009 Hand-over, but it was in vain. It was because calls to Wooâs home telephone was never picked up and his mobilenumber was never disclosed to the MC or the Housing Society. As a result, Woo was absent in the 30/4/2009 Hand-over.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Since Woo could not be contacted by phone, she said that she had to write him a letter dated 12<sup>th</sup> May 2009 (â<b>12/5/2009 Letter</b>â) asking him to contact her soonest possible for passing over of relevant accounts documents to him. Mak said that Woo showed noresponse.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  It is Wooâs evidence that he did not attend the 30/4/2009 Hand-over mainly because (1) no one had ever told him, orally or inwriting, at what hours the hand-over would take place; (2) the hand-over should have been done in a formal meeting, and 30<sup>th</sup> April 2009 was not a formal meeting; (3) the MC and Housing Society did not reply to his letter dated 17<sup>th</sup> April 2009 written in response to Makâs letter dated 16<sup>th</sup> April 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Further, Woo said that he had not received the 12/5/2009 Letter from Mak at all.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  After considering all evidence, I am not hesitant to reject Wooâs evidence due to the following reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  It was pleaded in the Re-Amended Reply at Â§11 that the 30/4/2009 Letter did not address to Woo and it had mentioned nothing aboutthe treasurer. This allegation totally disregarded the fact that the 30/4/2009 Letter was in fact copied to all MC members includingWoo.  The content therein strongly indicated that follow-up actions by all MC members including Woo on the hand-over of documentswere required.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  At Â§12 of the Re-Amended Reply, Woo pleaded that he did not receive the 30/4/2009 Letter. This starkly contradicts with his oralevidence that he did not dispute he had received the 30/4/2009 Letter. The discrepancy was never explained.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  It is true that the <i>time</i> at which the hand-over of documents would take place was not eminent from the 30/4/2009 Letter. But both Lam and Mak said in theirevidence (which I find to be true) that the MC members were informed of the time orally.  And Mak said that she and the Housing Societydid try to contact Woo but in vain (see Â§75 above). I think Mak was fair and honest to say this, for she could have convenientlyfeigned that she had successfully called and informed Woo of the time of the 30/4/2009 Hand-over. I believe in what Mak has toldme.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  For the same reason, I believe in Mak that the 12/5/2009 Letter was sent to Woo, but Woo showed no response and did not contactMak for hand-over of the accounts documents.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  To conclude this part, I find that Woo did receive the 16/4/2009 Letter. I find that both Mak and the Housing Society did try tocall Woo at his home telephone number to inform him of the time of the hand-over, but in vain. I find that Woo, having received the16/4/2009 Letter and having found that time of the hand-over was not mentioned in the letter, failed to contact any MC member orthe Housing Society to enquire about the time. The fact that he did not do so shows it was more likely than not that he was <i>not</i> prepared to attend the hand-over even if he was informed of the time. Under the circumstances, I find that Woo chose to be absentin the 30/4/2009 Hand-over.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  I also find that the 12/5/2009 was sent to Woo, but he did not follow up with Mak to collect the accounts documents.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>4<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting of 29/6/2009</i></p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  The next MC meeting immediately after the 12/5/2009 Letter was the 4<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting of 29<sup>th</sup> June 2009. The minutes recorded that on the item of âany other businessâ, Lui tried to give the accounts documents to Woo <i>at</i> the meeting, but Woo opined that the documents should be given to him directly by the Housing Society during the meeting<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Lui gave evidence that in this meeting, Mak had to leave early. But before she left, she asked Lui to grasp the opportunity of givingthe accounts documents received by the IO during 30/4/2009 Hand-over to Woo. But when Lui tried to give the accounts documents toWoo, Woo just flipped through a few pages and then refused to take them. Lui said that although Mak had left the meeting by thattime, all other MC members as well as the staff of the Housing Society were still around when he attempted to give the accounts documentsto Woo. Thus, Lui did not regard the attempted hand-over of documents took place <i>after</i> the meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Woo did not dispute that he did not take the accounts documents from Lui on that day. He explained that it was because the formalmeeting was over. He preferred to have formal hand-over <i>at</i> the meeting, not <i>after</i> the meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Lam and Mak, again in my view very fairly, agreed with Wooâs proposition that the documents were given to Woo <i>after</i> the meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  From the oral evidence before me, it is beyond dispute that the attempted hand-over of accounts documents was made by Lui to Woo<i>after</i> Mak had left the meeting. If one was to take the view that a meeting was in subsistence only up to the point when the chairman wasaround, then this part of the minutes of the 4<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting should be regarded as inaccurate. But for reasons which will become obvious below, I do not think such inaccuracy is directlyrelevant on the issues in this action.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Distribution of pamphlets on 10/8/2009</i></p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  Shortly after 12 midnight of 10<sup>th</sup> August 2009, Woo went to Blocks 1 and 4 respectively to insert promotional pamphlets prepared by him into the letter boxes of theresidents. A physical dispute took place between Woo and the security guard of Block 4 (called Tang Shing Yau) <a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> and police was called to attend the scene.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  There is factual dispute as to what Woo said when he was stopped at Block 4 from distributing promotional pamphlets.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  The defence relied on the evidence of Law Fu (â<b>Law</b>â), another security guard present at Block 4 at the material time. Woo also confirmed in his oral evidence that Law was present.Law said that he heard Woo saying to Tang Shing Yau and to the police (when the police arrived) that <i>he was a MC member</i> and so why he could not distribute pamphlets. In cross-examination, Law agreed that he did <i>not</i> hear Woo say that he distributed pamphlets <i>in the name of the IO</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Woo said that when he was trying to distribute pamphlets prepared by him and not in the name of the IO into the letter boxes, TangShing Yau stopped him by putting both arms around Woo. He denied ever identifying himself as an IO member or MC member to any securityguards.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Having considering all evidence, I would prefer the evidence of Law than that of Woo, because in my view Law gave his evidence fairlywithout exaggeration. He was ready to agree that Woo never said he distributed pamphlets <i>in the name of the IO</i>, even if such evidence might be to the advantage of Woo. I have no hesitation to accept his evidence.  I refuse to accept Wooâsbare denial on this point.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  I find as facts that at the material time when Woo was stopped from inserting promotional pamphlets into the letter boxes at Block4, Woo did utter words to the effect that he was a MC member and so why he could not distribute pamphlets.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The alleged assault of 6/9/2009</i></p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Then came the incident on 6<sup>th</sup> September 2009. Due to reason(s) unknown to this Court, Woo tried to take video on the MC member(s) on 6<sup>th</sup> September 2009, which resulted in some form of physical contact between Woo and Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Woo said that he was assaulted by Lam in the alleged assault. It was his case that due to the alleged assault, Lam published orcaused to publish the Motion to revenge or play-back. I will discuss more on this topic later below in my Judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  But before I leave this event, I would like to say a few words on Mr. Chung submission that Mak and Lui were not telling the truthwhen they was asked about what happened in the alleged assault. Both agreed in their evidence that they were present at the scene,but both said that they did not see any âphysical dispute between Woo and Lamâ.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  It is pertinent for me to point out that the main question put by Mr. Chung to Mak was in fact like this: whether she saw <i>Lam hit or assaulted Woo</i> amidst the messy situation. And the main question posed by Mr. Chung to Lui was: whether he saw <i>Lam assaulted Woo</i>. The question was <i>not</i> whether there was physical dispute between Woo and Lam. One must not overlook the fact that although police was called to the scene,no one was arrested for the alleged assault, nor was prosecution ever laid. In this sense, I cannot see how Mak and Luiâs evidencewas not the truth. Their evidence clearly echoed with the result of police investigation.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Internal Meeting of 8<sup>th</sup> September 2009</i></p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  By a notice of meeting dated 3<sup>rd</sup> September 2009, it was said that the 5<sup>th</sup> MC meeting would be held on 10<sup>th</sup> September 2009. According to the notice, agenda item 4.8 was to resolve passing the Motion against Woo and So.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  On 4<sup>th</sup> September 2009, the Housing Society (as manager) drafted the Motion (in draft form) and sent it to Lawyer Tse for comment.  On 7<sup>th</sup> September 2009, Lawyer Tse gave his comment and amendments to the draft motion.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  The following date after Lawyer Tse gave his comment on the draft, the Motion in its amended form was discussed and then signedin the internal meeting (åé¨æè­°) of the MC on 8<sup>th</sup> September 2009 (â<b>Internal Meeting</b>â).</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  According to Mak, the purpose of internal meetings was for the MC members to discuss and express their views on the items to bedecided in the MC meetings and to see if some kind of consensus (å±è­) could be reached before a formal MC meeting. This was toreduce the time spent on formal MC meetings, because experience of the 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting showed that without prior internal meeting, a formal MC meeting could last until very late at night. Many MC members gottheir work or family to take care of and could not spend that much time in one meeting. Mak added that despite the discussion inthe internal meetings, MC members were still free to cast their vote according to their own will in the formal MC meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  It is Wooâs case that he was never informed by anyone of the Internal Meeting and thus his absence.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Lam in his oral evidence (again very fairly) said that he did not know if Woo was informed of the meeting because it was not hisduty to notify other MC members of meetings. But Lam added that Woo had, long before, expressly said that he would <i>not</i> attend any internal meetings, as he took the view that they were not formal MC meetings. Mak gave evidence to the effect that shehad informed Woo and So of the date of the internal meeting; yet she could not force them to come.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  I believe in Lam and Makâs evidence, as I have already concluded that they were honest witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  The Motion was finally passed in the Adjourned 5<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting held on 16<sup>th</sup> October 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  I now turn to the defence of justification.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Justification</u></i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>Applicable Law</i></p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  The defence of justification is available to a defendant if he can prove that the words complained of are true in substance andin fact.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  If the defendant is able to prove the main charge, or <i>gist</i>, of the libel is true, it is <i>not</i> necessary for him to justify each and every statement or comment which does not add to the sting of the charge: see <i>Gatley</i> at Â§11.8 and Â§11.9-11.10; <i>Dr. Paul Ki Ping v Next Magazine Limited &amp; Others</i>, HCA 8071/1994; <i>Lo Ki Chung v Hong Kong Nam Hoi (Sha Tau District) Association Ltd</i>, HCA 39/2003.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  The same principle is codified under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26</a> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a></i> which stipulates:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn an action for libel or slander in respect of words containing 2 or more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence ofjustification shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be true do notmaterially injure the plaintiffâs reputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charges.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  I shall now turn to the three categories of defamatory words.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Category</i> <i>(</i><i>1</i><i>) -- During the meeting, Treasurer Woo confirmed with lawyer, other members of the Committee and the management of the Housing Societythat management fee had been paid for, in fact there was none, tells a lie openly</i></p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  The <i>gist</i> of the defamation here is that Woo told a lie in the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting of 24<sup>th</sup> April 2009. This part of the defamatory words turns on whether Wooâs remaining silence to Lawyer Tseâs remarks/questions in the2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting amounted to a confirmation that he had paid management fees.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  I have already concluded that Lam, Mak and Lui are all truthful witnesses and thus I believe in what they told me about the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting. I have also ruled that the minutes of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting are true records of what happened on that day.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  Woo never denied in his pleadings or in his oral evidence that he owed management fees as at the date of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting. Yet it is his evidence that there was no need to declare to Lawyer Tse or the other MC members that he had not paid managementfees because the MC members all knew about that prior to this meeting. It was thus unnecessary for him to say expressly what wasalready clearly known to all. He further said that remaining silent to Lawyer Tseâs remarks meant <i>admission</i> (é»èª) <i>of</i> <i>non-payment</i> of management fees on his part, rather than <i>admission of payment</i> of the same. He also pointed out that as a member of the MC, he had every right to cast his vote on this topic and since he votedin support of the motion, there was no conflict of interest at all.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  I think it is fair for me to say that silence may or may not mean an admission (é»èª). That said, it follows that silence is likelyto create ambiguity in meaning. Since silence is prone to ambiguity, what silence actually means in the communication between peopleis, in my view to a large extent, receptor-oriented, i.e. how a right-thinking receptor in the communication perceives the silencemeans. In this case, my conclusion is that a right-thinking man will take Wooâs silence to Lawyer Tseâs remarks/questions andthen proceeded to vote on the motion to mean, more likely than not, that he was <i>not</i> among those who owed management fees, and that he did <i>not</i> belong to the units which were still in arrears of management fees.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  When faced with Lawyer Tseâs questions/remarks, Woo, by keeping silent and then proceeding to cast his vote on this motion (whetherhe voted in support or against the motion is irrelevant), knew or must have known that his conduct would be interpreted by thosewho attended the meeting as an admission that he was not in arrears of management fees.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  I would further add that I do not believe in Wooâs evidence that his silence equated to an admission of non-payment of managementfees on his part, nor do I believe he readily meant to so convey to the others present in the meeting. Quite on the contrary, myoverall impression is that Woo did not want to openly disclose, either by himself or by a third party, that he owed outstanding managementfees at all material times. I base my view on the audio recording and transcript of the Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting (disclosed by Woo). I repeat my observation already set out in Â§Â§57 and 58 of my Judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Therefore, I conclude that Woo has by his conduct confirmed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting that he was <i>not</i> in arrears of management fees and that he did <i>not</i> belong to those units which still owed management fees, but in fact the reverse is the truth.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  Whether there was any conflict of interest in Wooâs casting the vote and whether Woo voted in support of the motion or not are,in my Judgment, all irrelevant because these matters did not shed light on the issue, i.e. whether Woo had by conduct confirmed thathe had settled management fees. </p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  I would further add that whether the MC members had already known about Wooâs non-payment of management fees or not is also irrelevant,as it is undeniable that the 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting was also attended by other sit-in residents of Kai Tak Garden. The evidence did not show that they had prior knowledgeon Wooâs non-payment of management fees.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  In conclusion, I find that the defence of justification has made out in relation to Category (1) of the Words.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Category (</i><i>2</i><i>) --</i> <i>Had not fulfilled the work as the Treasurer (refused to accept the relevant documents)</i><i>.</i> <i>This Committee had sent a letter on 12<sup>th</sup> May this year to Treasurer Woo and subsequently at a Committee meeting on 29<sup>th</sup> June served the relevant documents to Treasurer Woo, however, it was refused by Treasurer Woo. Therefore, Treasurer Woo had not yetreceived the relevant documents up to now</i></p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  It is the defence case that the libel is true as a matter of substance and of fact because (1) Woo did not attend the 30/4/2009Hand-over; (2) Woo did not respond to the 12/5/2009 Letter; and (3) Woo refused to accept taking over the accounts documents at the4<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting of 29<sup>th</sup> June 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  I have already ruled that it was Woo who chose not to attend the 30/4/2009 Hand-over and not to respond to the 12/5/2009 to followup on the hand-over of accounts documents from the MC to him (see Â§Â§84 and 85 above).</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  I have also commented on the accuracy of the minutes of the 4<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting which concerned the hand-over of accounts documents (see Â§90 above). I agree with Ms. Wuâs submission that the <i>gist</i> of libel in this Category (3) is Wooâs failure to discharge his duties as the treasurer by refusing to accept the relevant documents.Thus, there is <i>no</i> need for me to bother myself with each and every comment which is <i>not</i> the sting of the charge. That said, it becomes clear that whether the accounts documents were given to Woo <i>at</i> or <i>after</i> the 4<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting is irrelevant to the <i>gist</i> of the libel.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  On discharge of his duty as the treasurer of the MC, I do not believe in Wooâs evidence. His oral evidence contradicts flatlywith his witness statement and other documentary evidence. In the re-examination taken place on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the trial, Woo said that a proper hand-over of documents should be done in a meeting whereby the Housing Society should servethe documents on the <i>MC,</i> not on <i>him</i> personally. This piece of evidence flatly contradicted with his witness statement where he claimed that service of the documentsshould be done by the Housing Society on <i>him</i> <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Ms. Wu for Lam has cross-examined Woo on the hand-over of documents on 29<sup>th</sup> June 2009. She queried why Woo, while admitting that the accounts documents were so vital in the carrying out of his duty as thetreasurer of the IO,  did not take the accounts documents from the IO firstand then wrote to clarify or follow-up on any outstandingmatters that he could identify.

However, this is not the truthof the matter.  The evidence before me clearly shows that the MC, via Lui, did try to hand over the accounts documents to Woo on29<sup>th</sup> June 2009 (I say again that whether hand-over was <i>at</i> or <i>after</i> the MC meeting is irrelevant). It was Woo who refused to receive the accounts documents from Lui. If Woo had the slightest intentionto perform his duty as the treasurer of the IO, he would have realized that it was already two months after the 30/4/2009 Hand-overand no further delay should there be for him to take over the accounts documents. If he had the slightest intention to perform hisduty as the treasurer of the IO, he could have taken the accounts documents and then followed up on any outstanding or insufficientitems when needed.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Wooâs reason for refusal to take the accounts documents is not accepted by me, either. In my view, he did not have any right todemand hand-over between he himself and the Housing Society.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  I find that the defence of justification in respect of Category (2) has been made out.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Category (3) --</i> <i>Treasurer Woo had distributed promotion pamphlets under the name of the IO at the floors and the mail boxes located at the lobby ofall blocks on 9<sup>th</sup> August this year.

By claiming he was a MC member when found distributing promotional pamphlets on 10<sup>th</sup> August 2009, Woo effectively was trying to abuse his capacity as a MC member to gain a freeway.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  Since the <i>sting</i> of the libel is the abuse of power by Woo, the defence does <i>not</i> have to prove that Woo had uttered the exact words âin the name of the IOâ when distributing the promotional leaflets in orderto justify Category (3) of the Words.  </p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  That said, I will conclude that the defence of justification has been made out for Category (3).</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Defence of Qualified Privilege</u></i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>Applicable Law</i></p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  There are circumstances in which, on grounds of public policy and convenience, a person may yet, without incurring liability fordefamation, make statements about another which are defamatory and in fact untrue.

It is not sufficient that the defendant honestly believed that it was his dutyto speak.  Similarly, in deciding whether the recipient had a legitimate interest in the matter, it is not sufficient that the defendantbelieved that to be the case.  If, in fact, the recipient did not have any, there is no privileged occasion: <i>Gatley</i>, Â§Â§14.15 &amp; 14.17.</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  The two particular instances in which it was held that there was a duty:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Those who are appointed or elected to serve on a public body have a duty to express themselves freely and to say what they believeto be true at meetings of that body, and thus what they say in pursuance of that duty will be privileged: see <i>Gatley</i>, Â§14.37.</p>        <p>(2) A duty to give information may arise not from any public interest but merely from the interests of another, with whom the informationhas some close relationship, whether a family relationship, or one of trust and reliance, or friendship. If the information is sufficientlyimportant there may be a duty to give information to someone with whom there is no previous relationship of such a kind, or evento a stranger. Factors that are likely to be considered by the court in this regard include the strength of the information whichthe informant believes himself to have, its relevance to the interests of the person to whom it is to be communicated, the damagewhich it may do to the reputation of the person to whom it relates and the extent to which the person to whom the information iscommunicated is likely to rely on the informant for the information: see <i>Gatley,</i> Â§14.37.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>Discussion</i></p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  Mr. Chung submits to me, if I understand him correctly, that Lam published the Motion not for the purpose of protecting the interestsof the residents of Kai Tak Garden or the IO on two grounds. First, when Woo cast his vote in relation to the motion concerning collectionof outstanding management fees, he in fact voted for the motion. Thus, Woo was not causing any damage to Kai Tak Garden or the IO.Secondly, the Motion was published without due care to clarify the truthfulness of its content.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  Without the greatest respect to Mr. Chung, I fail to see how and why Lam cannot rely on the defence of qualified privilege subjectto proof of malice.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  The Motion was issued by the MC to the residents of Kai Tak Garden. Lam was a member of the MC. Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18</a> of the <i>BMO</i>, the IO shall do all things reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the obligations contained in the <i>DMC</i> for the control, management and administration of Kai Tak Garden: see <i>Building Management in Hong Kong</i>, at pp. 216-217.  The MC, being the executive arm of the IO, acts for and on behalf of the IO under section 29of the <i>BMO</i>. It had a legal duty to publish the Motion because all the items mentioned therein related to the control, management and administrationof Kai Tak Garden.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  For example, on recovery of outstanding management fees, the evidence of Mak and the audio recording produced by Woo showed thateven before the Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> MC Meeting on 30<sup>th</sup> March 2009, some owners had written to Mak expressing concern about Woo and So, as MC members, owed management fees. The issue ofoutstanding management fees had repeatedly appeared in the agenda of the meetings of the MC (including Adjourned 1<sup>st</sup> Meeting on 30<sup>th</sup> March 2009 at item 1.7; 2<sup>nd</sup> MC Meeting on 24<sup>th</sup> April 2009 at item 3.3; Adjourned 5<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting on 16<sup>th</sup> October 2009 at item 1.6).

The trust and confidence betweenLam and the owners of Kai Tak Garden gave rise to his duty to give information to the owners of Kai Tak Garden. And the owners ofKai Tak Garden had a corresponding interest in the matter. In <i>Khan v.

I will simplyreproduce the relevant paragraphs at p. 149 -151 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSo he is entitled to be protected by the privilege unless some otherdominant and improper motiveon his part is proved. <b><i>'Express malice</i></b>' is the term of art descriptive of such a motive. Broadly speaking, it means malice in the popular sense of a desire to injure theperson who is defamed and this is generally the motive which the plaintiff sets out to prove. But to destroy the privilege, <i>the desire to injure must be the dominant motive for the defamatory publication; knowledge that it will have that effect is not enough</i> if the defendant is nevertheless acting in accordance with a sense of duty or in bona fide protection of his own legitimate interests.</p>        <p class="quote">The motive with which a person published defamatory matter can only be inferred from what he did or said or knew. <i>If it be proved that he did not believe that what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence of express malice</i>, for no sense of duty or desire to protect his own legitimate interests can justify a man in telling deliberate and injurious falsehoodsabout another, save in the exceptional case where a person may be under a duty to pass on, without endorsing, defamatory reportsmade by some other person.</p>        <p class="quote">Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the <a name="Document1zzSDUNumber34" id="Document1zzSDUNumber34"></a>defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generallythough tautologously termed, <i>'<b>honest belief</b></i>.' If he publishes untrue defamatory matter <i>recklessly,</i> without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated as if he knew itto be false. But <i>indifference to the truth</i> of what he publishes is <i>not</i> to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true. The freedom ofspeech protected by the law of qualified privilege may be availed of by all sorts and conditions of men. In affording to them immunityfrom suit <i>if they have acted in good faith in compliance with a legal or moral duty or in protection of a legitimate interest the law must takethem as it finds them.</i> In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by arigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree accordingto their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning,leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognize the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity ofthe conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be'honest', that is, a positive belief that the conclusions they have reached are true. The law <a name="Document1zzSDUNumber35" id="Document1zzSDUNumber35"></a>demands no more.</p>        <p class="quote">Even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion - which is presumed unless the contrary is proved- may not be sufficient to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant <i>misused</i> the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by the law. The commonest case is <i>where the dominant motive which actuates the defendant is not a desire to perform the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest,but <b>to give vent to his personal spite or ill will</b> towards the person he defames.</i> If this be proved, then even positive belief in the truth of what is published will not enable the defamer to avail himself of theprotection of the privilege to which he would otherwise have been entitled. There may be instances of improper motives which destroythe privilege apart from personal spite. A defendant's dominant motive may have been to obtain some private advantage unconnectedwith the duty or the interest which constitutes the reason for the privilege. If so, he loses the benefit of the privilege despitehis positive belief that what he said or wrote was true.</p>        <p class="quote"><i>Judges and juries should, however, be very slow to draw the inference that a defendant was so actuated by improper motives as to deprivehim of the protection of the privilege unless they are satisfied that he did not believe that what he said or wrote was true or thathe was indifferent to its truth or falsity</i>. The motives with which human beings act are mixed. They find it difficult to hate the sin but love the sinner. Qualified privilegewould be illusory, and the public interest that it is meant to serve defeated, if the protection which it affords were lost merelybecause a person, although acting in compliance with a duty or in protection of a legitimate interest, disliked the person whom hedefamed or was indignant at what he believed to be that personâs conduct and welcomed the opportunity of exposing it. It is onlywhere his desire to comply with the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest plays no significant part in his motives forpublishing what he believes to be true that âexpress maliceâ can properly be found.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>        <p class="quote">The exception is where what is published incorporates defamatory matter that is <b><i>not</i></b> really <b><i>necessary</i></b> to the fulfillment of the particular duty or the protection of the particular interest upon which the privilege is founded. Logicallyit might be said that such irrelevant matter falls outside the privilege altogether. But if this were so it would involve applicationby the court of an objective test of relevance to every part of the defamatory matter published on the privileged occasion; whereas,as everyone knows, ordinary human beings vary in their ability to distinguish that which is logically relevant from that which isnot and few, apart from lawyers, have had any training which qualifies them to do so. So the protection afforded by the privilegewould be illusory if it were lost in respect of any defamatory matter which upon logical analysis could be shown to be irrelevantto the fulfillment of the duty or the protection of the right upon which the privilege was founded. As Lord Dunedin pointed out in<i>Adam v. Ward</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1917%5d%20AC%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1917] A.C. 309</a>, 326- 327 the proper rule as respects <i>irrelevant</i> defamatory matter incorporated in a statement made on a privileged occasion is to treat it as one of the factors to be taken intoconsideration in deciding whether, in all the circumstances, an inference that the defendant was actuated by express malice can properlybe drawn. As regards irrelevant matter <i>the test is not whether it is logically relevant but whether, in all the circumstances, it can be inferred that the defendant eitherdid not believe it to be true or, though believing it to be <a name="Document1zzSDUNumber38" id="Document1zzSDUNumber38"></a>true, realized that it had nothing to do with the particular duty or interest on which the privilege was based, but nevertheless seizedthe opportunity to drag in irrelevant defamatory matter to vent his personal spite, or for some other improper motive.â</i> (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>The Pleadings</i></p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  Ms. Wu submits that Woo is bound by his pleadings, i.e. Â§Â§16 and 17 in his Re-Amended Reply to Amended Defence. In Â§16, Woo pleadedthat the Motion was endorsed by Lam with knowledge that it was untrue and defamatory.

For convenience, I will name this âlack of honest beliefâargument ;</p>        <p>(2)Lam published the Motion with improper motive (See Â§17 of Re-Amended Reply to Amended Defence). For convenience, I will call thisâimproper motiveâ argument;</p>        <p>(3)The publication of the Motion was not necessary to the fulfillment of Lamâs duty or interest on which the privilege was based,for there was other proper procedure to remove Woo from office (See Â§19 of Re-Amended Reply to Amended Defence). For convenience,I will name this âunnecessaryâ argument.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>Discussion</i></p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  I think it is fair for me to say that in his closing submission, Mr. Chung puts his emphasis on the âimproper motiveâ argument<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a>. He does not say much on the âlack of honest beliefâ argument<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a> (he spends one paragraph only) and is totally silent on the âunnecessaryâ argument.</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  I will simply say that I cannot see how the âunnecessaryâ argument can sustain given the findings set out above in my Judgment.And after all, the Motion was passed in a proper MC meeting held on 16<sup>th</sup> October 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  On the argument of âlack of honest beliefâ, Mr. Chung argues that Lam never made any attempt to clarify if the Words containedin the Motion were true or not; thus, he signed the Motion negligently which constituted malice on his part. I will repeat my analysisand ruling on the defence of justification. I further say that according to Lam, he had personal knowledge of the basic facts leadingup to Categories (1) and (2) of the Words. In respect of Category (3) of the Words, though Lam did not have personal knowledge ofthe same, he was perfectly entitled to rely on the Housing Societyâs (being the manager of the IO) report to the MC of what happenedin the small hours of 10<sup>th</sup> August 2009; and the fact that the Motion was read and advised on and amended by the legal consultant of the IO (i.e. Lawyer Tseand his legal firm). That said, I conclude that Woo failed on the âlack of honest beliefâ argument.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  I now turn to the âimproper motiveâ argument. Mr. Chung is adamant in saying that malice on the part of Lam is obviously reflectedby the <i>timing</i> of the meetings. Despite the notice of 3<sup>rd</sup> September 2009 which announced that the passing of the Motion would be discussed in the MC meeting to be held on 10<sup>th</sup> September 2009, an unnecessary Internal Meeting was held on 7<sup>th</sup> September 2009 to the exclusion of Woo and So. Co-incidentally, the Internal Meeting was held just one day after the alleged assault.Mr. Chung concludes that due to the alleged assault, Lam used the Motion as a revenge or play-back to defame Woo. The Motion wasused by Lam as an excuse to remove Woo from the post of treasurer.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Mr. Chung further submits that Lam agreed during cross examination that the Internal Meeting was a closed-door exercise among theother 8 members of the MC as quoted âåææ¯ééé è»â. This evidence of Lam, Mr. Chung points out to me, is overwhelmingin proving that there was malice on his part.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Despite Mr. Chung has made a tempting argument, I am not persuaded by him that the sole and dominant purpose of Lam was to harmWoo or to vent his personal spite, <i>if any</i>,  towards Woo.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  To begin with, I have listened to the recordings of the trial. I would simply repeat below the relevant parts of the cross-examinationas to show how the answer of âåææ¯ééé è»â came by:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âå:é»è§£å§åæè­°è£¡æåè¡å¾·ä»ååé¿èèçååæ¶ï¹</p>		<p class="quote">ç­:å±ï¼æå°å°±è¦åï¼å³ä¿ä¸ä¿¡ä»»åè­°ï¼ä½ä¿ä½¢ä¿è¢«ä¸ä¿¡ä»»åäººï¼åé»ï¼ä½¢åæåå åï¼</p>		<p class="quote">å:æåä¿¾éç¥è¡å¾·ä»åçæèä¿èèçåçåï¹éå¢åæï¹</p>		<p class="quote">ç­:æå°åéå°±ä¿è¦åå¢æ¨£éâ¦â¦</p>		<p class="quote">å:æåä½ æåéç¥ï¼æå°±æï¼åå°±åï¹æåï¹</p>        <p class="quote">ç­:å¢æ¨£éæå°±åç¥ï¼åç¥ä½¢å°æåéç¥ï¼å çºéç¥åï¼éç¥å°åç¯çåä¿åºæå°ã</p>		<p class="quote">â¦..</p>		<p class="quote">å:ä½ è¦ºåè¦ºå¾<i>å¦æ</i>é¿è¡åçååé¿èåçååºå°ï¼è¬çªä½¢å°è¦è¬åå¢ï¼ä½ åä¿¾æ©æä½¢å°è§£éï¼æåæä¸å²ä¿ï¼æè¬ä½ å°åãééé è»ãåï¹</p>		<p class="quote">ç­:æãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  The last question posed by Mr. Chung on Lam is clearly a hypothetical one. The answer given by Lam is, in all respects, fair andhonest.</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  On the other hand, I take the view that if Lam really possessed a sole and dominant intention to harm Woo, common sense tells thatLam would not afford to miss the chance to vote for the Motion in the adjourned 5<sup>th</sup> MC Meeting of 16<sup>th</sup> October 2009. Yet the plain fact is: Lam was absent in the said meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  On the pleadings, it was Wooâs pleaded case that Lam was the writer/author of the Motion<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a>. The same allegation was repeated in his own witness statement, which was confirmed by him as truth in the Statement of Truth<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a>. Yet, his oral evidence turned out to be: Lam did <i>not</i> participate in the drafting, but he took place in signing the Motion only. The discrepancies between the pleaded case and oral evidenceas well as between the witness statement and oral evidence were never explained by Woo satisfactorily. It is thus clear that thereis no evidence whatsoever before me to show that Lam was the engineer of the Motion. Quite on the contrary, it proves that Woo gavestarkly inconsistent and unfounded allegations against Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  Then, one should not lose sight of the fact that the idea of tabling the Motion against Woo took shape <i>prior to</i> the alleged assault of 6<sup>th</sup> September 2009; and the draft of the Motion was prepared by the Housing Society on 4<sup>th</sup> September 2009, which was also <i>prior to</i> the alleged assault.  It would be inherently implausible and flatly against common sense to say that Lam could foresee the happeningof the alleged assault and thereby engineered the idea of tabling the Motion or the drafting of it on/before 4<sup>th</sup> September 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  I repeat again that I do believe in the evidence of Mak, Lui and Lam.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  In conclusion, I find that Woo has not proved malice on the part of Lam. Therefore, Lamâs defence of qualified privilege was notdefeated by malice. This is a complete defence of Lam.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Defence of Section 29A of the BMO</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  Having found that Lam succeeded in the defence of justification and qualified privilege, I shall be brief on the section 29A  ofthe <i>BMO</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  Section 29A of the <i>BMO</i> reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) No member of a management committee, <i>acting in good faith and in a reasonable manner</i>, shall be personally liable for any act done or default made by or on behalf of the corporation â</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">(a) in the exercise or purported exercise of the powers conferred by this Ordinance on the corporation; or</p>			<p class="quote">(b) in the performance or purported performance of the duties imposed by this Ordinance on the corporation.</p>		</blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) The protection conferred by subsection (1) on a member of a management committee shall not in any way affect the liability ofthe corporation for that act or defaultâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  Mr. Chung does not touch on this defence in his closing submission. Ms. Wu just writes briefly on this point.</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  Due to my findings set out in the earlier parts of my Judgment, I would rule that Lam was acting in good faith and in a reasonablemanner in discharge of his duties as a member of the MC at the material times. He should thus be absolved from any personal liabilityarising out of the Motion, if any.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>Conclusion</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  Given my above conclusion, there is no need for me to deal with the issue of quantum.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  Accordingly, this action is dismissed. I make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that Lam should have the costs of this action, with certificate to Counsel, to be taxed if not agreed. If there is no applicationto vary this costs order <i>nisi</i>, it will become absolute within 14 days from today.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  Lastly, I would like to thank Counsel on both sides for the helpful assistance rendered in this action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>	    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="33%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="33%">Grace Chan<br />            Deputy District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>		<!--sino section representation --><representation>		<p>Mr. Hylas Chung and Mr. Kevin Tang instructed by Messrs.
