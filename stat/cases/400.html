The tribunal is expressly given a discretion to decline jurisdiction, section 10.No such discretion is given to the High Court. Sadly no one seems to have thought that the High Court ought to have such a discretionor that a core might arise in the High Court which, it was manifestly more just and convenient, should be tried there, for exampleby reason of its size or complexity, the conduct of the parties, or the fact that it spanned the dividing line sought to be drawnin the Schedule.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The facts alleged in the pleadings can be summarised simply. The defendant says that he was employed by the plaintiffs initiallyfor 26 months, with provision for automatic continuance for a like period in the absence of prior determination. There was, he says,a detailed written contract containing provision for remuneration and a wide variety of fringe benefits such as accommodation, traveletc. The contract he says was automatically renewed for the further 26 months but he was then dismissed when there was some 14Â½months still to run. During the contractual period the plaintiffs kept a running ledger account in the defendant's name which wasdebited with various payments made to him or on his behalf. At the time of the defendant's dismissal this account showed a balancein the plaintiff's favour of $35,828.02.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> On 14th October 1982 the plaintiffs issued a writ for this sum on "an account stated and acknowledged". No particulars of the statingor acknowledgment were given. The plaintiffs sought summary judgment. The defendant. put in a defence and counter-claim, verifiedon affirmation, which:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(1)</p>            </td>            <td width="89%" valign="top">                Admitted the debit balance in the account.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(2)</p>            </td>            <td width="89%" valign="top">                Asserted a failure to credit the account with a sum of $40,936 and a contractual right of set off.

This order would seem to me to be wrong in form having regard to the defence of set off raised and from my part I wouldhave given leave to defend. But the practical effect was the same so there was no appeal. The plaintiffs then launched the presentsummons which asks principally for:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(1)</p>            </td>            <td width="88%" valign="top">                The striking out of the counterclaim on the basis that the Labour Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to determineit: and                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(2)</p>            </td>            <td width="88%" valign="top">The removal of the stay of execution.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I am quite unable to see any merit in this application. The whole dispute arises out of the contract of employment. The so-calledaccount stated and acknowledged was stated and acknowledged between master and servant, and the obligations in relation to it aroseout of the service agreement.  The plaintiff chose to sue in the High Court and has obtained the benefit of a judgment therein. Thepleadings are nearly complete in this Court. If well founded the counterclaim is potentially large, and is quite different from thesimple, run of the mill, one month's notice type of case. It raises potentially difficult questions on measure of damages and mitigation.The case cries out for legal representation in the interests both of the parties and the Court. But I have found no escape from thisstatutory strait jacket.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The defendant relied principally on the decision of Roberts C.J. in <u>National Ebauch Ltd.</u> v. <u>Rishi Kaumar Bhatnagar</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981%20HKLR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1981 H.K.L.R. 114</a> to the effect that the Tribunal's jurisdiction was limited to claims for liquidated damages and that the High Court had jurisdictionto hear claims for unliquidated damages. The operative words in the Schedule are:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="97%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" rowspan="2">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" rowspan="2" class="quote">1</td>            <td width="84%" colspan="2" valign="top" class="quote">                A claim for a sum of money which arises from -                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td width="79%" valign="top" class="quote">                the breach of a term, whether express or implied, of a contract of employment,.....                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">3</td>            <td width="84%" colspan="2" valign="top" class="quote">Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the tribunal shall not have jurisdiction to hear and determine a claim for a sum of money, orotherwise in respect of a cause of action, founded in tort whether arising from a breach of contract or a breach of duty imposedby a rule of common law or by any enactment."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Liquidated damages arise "where the parties to a contract, as part of the agreement between them, fix the amount which is to be paidby way of damages in the event of breach, ..... as a genuine pre-estimate", per McGregor en Damages 14th edition paragraph 341.  It is wholly exceptional to find such a provision it a service agreement. It is equally wholly exceptional to obtain specific performanceof a. service agreement.   It follows that practically every case involving a <u>breach</u> of a service agreement gives rise to a claim for unliquidated damages, see <u>Yip Wan-chiu</u> v. <u>Magnificent Industrial Ltd</u>. 1974 H.K.L.R. 183. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s8a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 8A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57">Cap. 57</a>) may have added in Hong Kong a special category of statutory liquidated damages in certain circumstances. But this is onlysince 1975 and it cannot affect the. construction of a 1970 Ordinance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> But to say that damages are unliquidated is not to say that they are general in the pleading sense, or at large. With very few exceptions,e.g. loss of reputation, and more recently loss of a holiday, damages for breach of contract are not general but special, and haveto be precisely particularised and quantified. Contracts of service are no exception to this. The claim here was thus properly particularisedand quantified. In an attempt to defeat this application and to bring himself specifically within the <u>National Ebauch</u> decision the defendant applied for leave to amend the counterclaim (inter alia) by deleting the particulars. But when I pointed outthat these particulars were essential to the claim, whether it was pursued in this Court or before the labour Tribunal, the applicationfor leave to amend was abandoned.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In my judgment the phrase "sum of money" must be construed in the light of the fact that practically every claim for "breach of aterm ..... of a contract" will be for damages unliquidated in law but quantified in practice. It follows, I think that the phrasemust cover such claims.  I agree with Roberts C.J. that the legislature anticipated a "quantified" claim and a claim that was "ascertained"or ascertainable. But I regret that I cannot agree that this makes the claim one for liquidated damages, or that it limits m theTribunal's jurisdiction to such claims. This conclusion seems to me to be supported by paragraph 3. No claim "founded in tort" canbe for liquidated damages.  It may contain a calculated or special damages element; but the bulk is likely to be for general damages.I am much comforted to know that the same conclusion was reached by O'Connor J. on 18th December 1979 in <u>Stewart and Others</u> v. <u>The Hong Kong</u> <u>Philharmonic Society Limited</u>. Unfortunately as this decision was not reported, it was not cited to Roberts C.J.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> A further complicating feature arose in <u>National Ebauch</u> because the claim there could be put both in contract and in tort. This raised the further problem as to whether the claim was "founded"in tort: How that concept was to be tested when both claims were equally open: And whether divided jurisdiction was inevitable withthe Tribunal being compelled to hear one part and the High Court the other. Such futile barren arguments would also be avoided bythe granting of discretion to the High Court.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> I am therefore constrained by the rigidity of the Ordinance to make orders quite contrary to the merits of the case. I can only hopethat the Tribunal itself may agree with me and exercise the discretion it alone has to decline jurisdiction, and refer the matterback. I have not been asked to interfere with the judgment on the claim and it would now be futile to do so.I now order:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(1)</p>            </td>            <td width="90%" valign="top">                That all proceedings on the counterclaim be stayed.
