Pang, instructed by Messrs Robert Lee &amp; Fong, for the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:center">---------------------</p>    <p style="text-align:center">JUDGMENT</p>    <p style="text-align:center">---------------------</p>    <p><i>The Relief Claimed</i>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p1" class="pseudopara" id="p1">1.</a> The fifth defendant has issued a summons in each of these actions asking for an order that the plaintiffs' statements of claim bestruck out on the ground that they disclose no reasonable cause of action against it.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><i>The Statements of Claim</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> With one exception, which I will deal with later, the three statements of claim are similar in form. For the purpose of the matterbefore me, I must take the allegations in the statements as true in fact.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiffs say that some houses were constructed at Headland Drive, Discovery Bay and they were completed in or around the periodSeptember to November 1982. The defendants in the actions were concerned in the construction of these houses in various capacities;in particular, the, fifth defendant was the nominated sub-contractor responsible <i>inter alia</i> for the installation and testing of the electrical circuits and related works at the houses. There is no allegation that the fifthdefendant had any contractual relationship with the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The plaintiffs allege that they are the owners or occupiers, or both, of different houses. They allege that, prior to rectificationby them on various dates during 1988, the electrical installations in the houses were 'defective and/or unsafe', as particularised,by reason of the negligence of the developer. One of the particulars of defects alleges that the wiring was dangerous.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> There is no need to go into the particulars of negligence alleged in detail. It is enough to say that the allegations include allegationsthat the installations were dangerous and unsafe.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I should say here that there is some confusion in the grammatical tenses used in the statements of claim, but an overall readingmakes it clear that the allegations are that the installations were defective, unsafe and dangerous, but, after rectification, theyare no longer so.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiffs allege that damage was caused to the houses by work necessarily carried out to render the houses 'safe and/or habitable'.The statement of claim in Action A5958 also alleges that, in consequence of the 'defective and/or unsafe electrical installations',damage was caused to the house concerned in that case, but the particulars of damage alleged make it clear that the damage was causedby the work of rectification. The particulars of damage relate generally to the cost of demolition, repair and restoration, apartfrom, in each case, an amount claimed for alternative accommodation.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Thus far in the statements of claim, there is no allegation regarding the liability of the fifth defendant. However, in Actions A5958and 5965, the statement of claim recites the following -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'Further or in the further alternative, the aforesaid loss and damage suffered by the Plaintiff was caused or contributed to by thenegligence and/or breach of statutory duty on the part of [<i>inter alia</i> the main contractor and the fifth defendant] this servants or agents.'</p>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In Action A5969, however, this allegation is made only against the architects and their servants or agents. There is no allegationthat the fifth defendant was a servant or agent of the architects. This omission, Mr Pang tells me, was accidental, and that theintention is to amend the allegation in Action A5969 so that it reflects the allegation in this regard in the other two actions.For the time being, I will work on the basis that it is necessary to deal with this problem only if the statements of claim, as concernsthere allegations against the fifth defendant, otherwise set up a reasonable cause of action. It is a minor problem easily curableby amendment, and I would not strike out on this basis alone.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> There is an allegation of a breach of statutory duty here, but there is no attempt to identify the breach, the statute or the duty,and the particulars allege nothing but negligence. Mr Scott submits that this allegation of a breach of statutory duty should nottaken seriously because it is otherwise clear that the plaintiffs are relying, as against the fifth defendant, only on negligence.I accept that this is right, and Mr Pang did not attempt to argue to the contrary.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The particulars of negligence alleged against the fifth defendant suggest that the electrical installations were not safe.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The statements of claim conclude by alleging failures by the defendants, despite requests, to remedy the 'defective and/or unsafeelectrical installations' and that the defective and/or unsafe electrical installations are endangering and would have [continued]to endanger the life or lives and property of the Plaintiff and/or other lawful occupiers' of the houses. This latter allegationmust be taken, after reading the statements of claim as a whole, to refer to the time before the rectification work was effected.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><i>The Argument</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Scott submits that, the plaintiffs' claims being founded on the tort of negligence, purely economic loss is not recoverable, andthat any loss suffered by the plaintiffs falls into that category. Consequently, he says, the statements of claim do not set up areasonable cause of action and should be struck out as against the fifth defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr Scott says that this area of the law was a sea dotted with shoals, but a chart through these dangerous waters has now been providedby the speeches in the case of <i>D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd. v. Church Commissioners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20AC%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] AC 177.</a> A chart it may be, but, although it identifies some of the remaining dangers, it does not provide a complete navigational aid onhow to deal with them.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The facts in <i>D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd.</i> were that plaster on ceilings and a wall of a flat became loose and some it fell down. The defective plaster was stripped off andreplaced. The tenant of the flat brought an action based on negligence against, <em>inter alia</em>, the contractor who had appointed a sub-contractor to do the plaster-work, claiming the cost of the remedial work and the cost ofcleaning carpets and other possessions dirtied by the falling plaster. Their Lordships held that the loss sustained by the tenantin stripping and replacing the paster-work in the flat was purely economic loss, which was not recoverable in tort. Under the headof the cost of cleaning the carpet and other possessions, the tenant claimed Â£50 This seems to be the 'trivial sum' by way of damagesthat Lord Bridge (at page 208B) thought would have been recoverable by the tenant, but their Lordships found the contractor not liableon other grounds.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Lord Bridge decided not to review all the authorities bearing, directly or indirectly, on the question whether the cost of makinggood defective plaster in that case was irrecoverable as economic loss. He thought that they gave no clear or conclusive answer,and preferred to deal with the problem in the light of first principles.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> He did, however, deal with the decision of the House of Lords in Junior <i>Books Ltd. v. Veitchi Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20AC%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 A.C. 520.</a> His view was that this decision could not be regarded as laying down any principle of general application in the law of tort becauseof the 'unique' factors involved: But he quoted (at page 202C), with approval, from the speech of Lord Brandon, who referred to theprinciple laid down in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] A.C. 562</a></p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">            ' ... that, when a person can or ought to appreciate that a careless act or omission on his part may result in physicalinjury to other persons or their property, he owes a duty to all such persons to exercise reasonable care to avoid such carelessact or omission. It is, however, of fundamental importance to observe that the duty of care laid down in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> was based on the existence of a danger of physical injury to persons or their property. ... It has further, until the present case,never been doubted, so far as I know, that the relevant property for the purpose of the wider principle on which the decision in<i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> was based, was property other than the very property which gave rise to the danger of physical damage concerned.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Lord Bridge then (at pages 204 and 205) reviewed a 1986 unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and held thatthis decision and the opinion of Lord Brandon in Junior Books were 'entirely in line' with the majority decision of the Supreme Courtof Canada in <i>Rivtow Marine Ltd. v. Washington Iron Works</i> [1973)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=6%20WWR%20692" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">6 W.W.R. 692</a> that the damages recoverable from the manufacturers by the hirers of a crane which was found to have a defect which made it unsafeto use did not include the cost of repairing the defect.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Lord Bridge (at page 206) went on to say -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">             'These principles are easy enough to comprehend and probably not difficult to apply when the defect complained of isin a chattel supplied complete by a single manufacturer. If the hidden defect in the chattel is the cause of personal injury or ofdamage to property other than the chattel itself, the manufacturer is liable. But if the hidden defect is discovered before any suchdamage is caused, there is no longer any room for the application of the <em>Donoghue v. Stevenson</em> principle. The chattel is now defective in quality, but is no longer dangerous. It may be valueless or it may be capable of economicrepair. In either case the economic loss is recoverable in contract by the buyer or hirer of the chattel entitled to the benefitof a relevant warranty of quality, but it is not recoverable in tort by a remote buyer or hirer of the chattel.</p>            <p class="quote">            If the same principle applies in the field of real property to the liability of the builder of a permanent structure whichis dangerously defective, that liability can only arise if the defect remains hidden until the defective structure causes personalinjury or damage to property other than the structure itself. If the defect is discovered before any damage is done, the loss sustainedby the owner of the structure, who has to repair or demolish it to avoid a potential source of danger to third parties, would seemto be purely economic. Thus, if I acquire a property with a dangerously defective garden wall which is attributable to the bad workmanshipof the original builder, it is difficult to see any basis in principle on which I can sustain an action in tort against the builderfor the cost of either repairing or demolishing the wall. No physical damage has been caused. All that has happened is that the defectin the wall has been discovered in time to prevent damage occurring.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> After discussing the problems involved with a structure more complex than a garden wall, such as a dwelling house, and where thehidden defect causes damage to 'other property' - to which I will return later - Lord Bridge goes on (at page 207F) to say -</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">        `It seems to me that the cost of replacing the defective plaster itself ... was not an item of damage for which the builder...could possibly be made liable in negligence under the principle of <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> or any legitimate development of that principle. To make him so liable would be to impose upon him for the benefit of those withwhom he had no contractual relationship the obligation one who warranted the quality of the plaster as regards materials, workmanshipand fitness for purpose. I am glad to reach the conclusion that this is not the law, is only for the reason that a conclusion tothe opposite effect would mean that the courts [have gone much further than the effect of the Defective Premises Act 1972].'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Mr Pang relied greatly on the case of <i>Anns v.

Estates Ltd</i>., he says -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">           '...so far as they [Lord Wilberforce's observations) concern such liability in respect of damage which has actually beencaused by the defective structure other than by direct physical damage to persons or to other property, I am bound to say that, withthe greatest respect to their source, I find them difficult to reconcile with any conventional analysis of the underlying basis ofliability in tort for negligence. A cause of action in negligence at common law which arises only when the sole damage is the mereexistence of the defect giving rise to the possibility of damage in the future, which crystallizes only when the damage is imminent,and the damages for which are measured, not by the full amount of the loss attributable to the defect but by the cost of remedyingit only to the extent necessary to avert a risk of physical injury, is a novel concept. ... For my part, therefore, I think the correctanalysis, in principle, to be simply that, in a case where no question of breach of statutory duty arises, the builder of a houseof other structure is liable at common law for negligence only where actual damage, either to person or to property, results fromcarelessness on his part in the course of construction. [On the footing that individual parts of a building fall to be treated asseparate and distinct items of property] damage caused to other parts of the building ... would ground an action but not for damageto the defective part itself except in so far as that part caused other damage, when the damages would include the cost of repairto that part so far as necessary to remedy damage caused to other parts.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Lord Oliver held (at page 217A) that -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          'In the instant case the defective plaster caused no damage to the remainder of the building and in so far as it presenteda risk of damage to other property or to the person of any occupant that was remediable simply by the process of removal. ... thecost of replacing the defective plaster is not an item for which the builder can be liable in negligence.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Another case to which I was referred was <i>Department of the Environment v. Thomas Bates</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=44%20BLR%2088" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">44 BLR 88</a>, which proceeded to decision on the facts. In that case, the builder constructed pillars that, although sufficient to support theexisting load, were not adequate to support the design load. The trial judge found that at no time did the weakness of the pillarsgive rise to 'imminent danger' to health and safety of employees or the public. Accordingly, it was not necessary for the Court ofAppeal to decide if liability existed in a situation where the weakness of the pillars did present an imminent danger. However, TaylorLJ was clearly doubtful as to whether an action would have arisen even if there had been imminent danger. He describes a statementby Lord Oliver in <i>D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd.</i> that may be read as supporting the proposition that an occupier can recover against a negligent builder in tort the cost of remedialwork undertaken in advance of any physical damage to the building in order to avert imminent risk of physical injury to persons as'at most luke-warm'.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> What Lord Oliver said in this regard in D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd. at page 216G was -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          '... in so far as [<i>Ann</i><em>s</em>] is authority for the proposition that a builder responsible for the construction of a building is liable in tort at common law fordamage occurring through his negligence to the very thing which he has constructed, such liability is limited directly to cases wherethe defect is one which threatens the health and safety of occupants or of third parties and (possibly) other property.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> I agree that this statement, as read with other utterances by Lord Oliver, indicate that he is unhappy with the proposition. In anyevent, the proposition, in so far as it is founded on the dicta of Lord Wilberforce in <i>Anns is obiter</i>, and thus not binding on me.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> It is fair to say that neither Nicholls LJ nor O'Connor LJ, the other two judges sitting in the <i>Thomas Bates</i> case would have been inclined to favour the claim, even if an imminent danger had existed.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> In the more recent case of <i>West Kent Cold Storage Co. Ltd. v. Hemmings &amp; Co. Ltd.</i>, the judgment in which was reported in The Times of 13 November 1989, certain cold storage panels were alleged to be 'unsafe andunsatisfactory and unfit for the purpose for which they were required and were defective'. Judge Prosser sitting in the Queen's BenchDivision found as a fact that there was imminent danger to the safety of occupants and third parties, and relied, in awarding tothe plaintiff the expenses necessary to avert the danger, on the statement by Lord Oliver in <i>D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd</i>. described by Taylor LJ as 'at most luke-support' for the proposition relied upon by the plaintiff Judge Prosser commented -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          'It would be absurd to suggest for the plaintiff to succeed in negligence it was necessary for the plaintiff to wait untildamage or injury was actually caused before he could claim.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Although the plaintiffs' statements of claim in the case before me do not expressly speak of imminent danger, and, indeed, it seemsto have taken some years for anyone to realise the alleged condition of the electrical installation, I am prepared to accept thatthis allegation is sufficiently raised. If it were not so, simple amendments would cure any defect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>The Questions</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> It seems to me that the questions that I have to decide in this matter are -</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td width="12%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">i.</td>            <td width="80%">                There being a sufficient allegation that, due to the negligence of the fifth defendant, there was an imminent dangerthat threatened the health and safety of the plaintiffs, third parties and (possibly) property, do the plaintiffs have a reasonablecause of action to recover the expenses of remedying the defects so that the danger was removed?                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">ii</td>            <td width="80%">Assuming the first question to be answered in the negative, is there a sufficient allegation that the negligence of the fifth defendantcaused damage to property other than the defective property? Certainly, the remedial work caused damage to other parts of the houses,but, assuming those other parts were other property, was it the alleged negligence that, in law, caused that damage?</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The thinking that would give a plaintiff a remedy to recover the money expended on repairing defects to remove an imminent dangerhas a superficial attractiveness. The apparent logic is reflected most succinctly in the statement by Judge Prosser that I have quotedabove from the West Kent Cold Storage case. He suggested that it would be absurd to suggest for the plaintiff to succeed in negligenceit was necessary for the plaintiff to wait until damage or injury was actually caused before he could claim.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> On analysis, however, I do not know why this should be thought absurd. We all know that negligence that causes no damage - negligencein the air - is not actionable. That is elementary. What the Judge Prosser school of thought suggests is that a man who finds thathe owns, or is in possession or control of, a imminently dangerous article or building may sue in negligence to recover the costof rendering that article or building safe because if he did not do so, damage or injury may be caused, and damages in respect ofthat damage or injury could be recovered, although those damages would not, in the ordinary course, include the cost of remedyingthe original defects in the dangerous article or building. There is no authority binding on me to this effect, and I do not acceptthe proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In <i>D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd</i>., at page 211G, Lord Oliver said -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">             'If I buy a secondhand car to which there has been fitted a pneumatic tyre which, as a result of carelessness in manufacture,is dangerously defective and which bursts, no doubt the negligent manufacturer is liable in tort on the ordinary application of Donoghuev. Stevenson. But if the tyre bursts without causing any injury other than to itself or if I discover the defect before the burstoccurs, I know of no principle upon which I can claim to recover from the manufacturer in tort the cost of making good the defectwhich, in practice, could only be the cost of supplying and fitting a new tyre. That would be, in effect, to attach to goods a non-contractualwarranty of fitness which would follow the goods into whosoever's hands they came.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> That analysis, in my respectful view, is impeccable in law and logic. Judge Prosser referred to this statement, but said that, inthe case before him, the plaintiff was claiming, not 'as per the example of the tyre', but the cost of averting the threat of danger.I cannot see any distinction. If I discover the defect in my tyre before an accident occurs and I change or repair that tyre, thecost of doing so is the cost of averting the threat of danger. It is difficult to think of a more obvious example of this. And yet,clearly, as Lord Oliver says, the law does not allow me to recover that cost. Further, I could not recover the cost of a new tyre,or of repairing the existing tyre, if an accident giving rise to damage or injury did occur, whether or not I knew of the danger.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I do not see why this principle illustrated by the example of the defective tyre should not apply with equal force to a building.It is true that the danger being averted may be one that, if it materialised, would be more disastrous than in respect of an article,although not necessarily so, and the cost of averting the danger may be a lot greater, but I cannot accept that this makes any differenceto the principle.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In only distinction in this regard that was mentioned by Lords Bridge and Oliver in the D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd. case was that, witha complicated structure like a building, the other constituent parts can be treated as separate items of property distinct from thatportion of the whole which has given rise to the damage. This, of course, would also apply to complicated things, like machinery,other than buildings, and, as Lord Oliver points out at page 212D, this approach would be no more than the ordinary application ofthe <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> principle.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Perhaps, however, the clearest indication of the binding ratio in the <i>D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd.</i> case is what the House decided to do in that case. The defective plaster concerned in that case created an imminent danger of falling;some of it had already done so. The falling of the plaster could have caused damage to other property or injury to the person. Toavert that danger, it was necessary to repair the plasterwork, and yet the House held that the cost of effecting these repairs werenot recoverable. In the case before me, it may be that the danger was greater, in the sense that the houses could have been burntdown and people might have lost their lives. It may also be that the cost of the averting the danger was a great deal more that replacingsome plaster. But, it seems to me, that there is no legal or logical basis on which I am able to distinguish this case from whatwas decided in <i>D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd.</i></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> The other aspect of this case, that of the problem of complex structures mentioned above, is dealt with by Lord Bridge in the D.&amp; F. Estates Ltd. case at page 206H. After dealing with the simple garden wall situation, Lord Bridge said -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">          'I can see that more difficult questions may arise in relation to a more complex structure like a dwelling house. One viewwould be that such a structure should be treated in law as a single indivisible unit. On this basis, if the unit becomes a potentialsource of danger when a hitherto hidden defect in construction manifests itself, the builder, as in the case of the garden wall,should not in principle be liable for the cost of remedying the defect. ...</p>            <p class="quote">            However, I can see that it may well be arguable that in the case of complex structures, as indeed possibly in the caseof complex chattels, one element of the structure should be regarded for the purpose of the application of the principles under discussionas distinct from another element, so that damage to one part of the structure caused by a hidden defect in another part may qualifyto be treated as damage to "other property" and whether the argument should prevail may depend on the circumstances of the case.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Lord Bridge declined to offer any authoritative solutions, but said that he did not regard the <i>Ann</i> case as settling the matter. In the case before him, Lord Bridge decided that it would be artificial to treat the plaster as distinctfrom the decorative surface placed upon it.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> It may very well be that, if, for example, the houses with which I am concerned were destroyed by a fire caused by the defectiveelectrical installations, the plaintiffs would be able to recover damages in respect of the damage to the houses apart from the pre-existingdefects to the electrical wiring on the basis that the houses, apart from the electrical installations, were 'other property'. Butnothing like that happened in this case. No damage to one part of the structure of the houses has been caused by any hidden defectin another part to make it arguable, within Lord Bridge's analysis, that the damage may qualify to be treated as damage to 'otherproperty'. In this case, any damage to 'other property' was caused, not by the hidden defect - or, more properly, the negligencegiving rise to the hidden defect - but by the exercise undertaken to remedy the discovered defect. I know of no basis in law on whichone could rest a claim to recover, for example, the cost of chipping away another part of the structure to get at the defective discoveredelectrical installation in order to render it safe, and the cost of making good that damage. That would be, in my judgment, to allowrecovery for the cost of remedying the defects in the very thing said to be defective by reason of the fifth defendant's negligence.It would be no different, in principle, from the situation where a plaintiff seeks to recover the cost of purchasing a jack in orderto remove a defective tyre.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><i>The Result</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In the result, I find that the plaintiffs have not alleged any reasonable cause of action against the fifth defendant and the statementsof claim, as against the fifth defendant, are struck out. Mr Pang has not suggested that, in this event, the plaintiffs' problemscould be cured by amendment. It follows that the plaintiffs' actions against the fifth defendant should be dismissed and I so order.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><i>The Costs</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> On the face of it, there seems no reason why the plaintiffs should not pay the fifth defendant's costs of the action and these applications,and I make an order nisi accordingly</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">                J.K.
