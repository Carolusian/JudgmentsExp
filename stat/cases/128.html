Unfortunately, nearly eightyears ago something seems to have gone sadly wrong with the "man-management" side of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Society Limited,("the Society"), the company which runs the Orchestra. Whatever may have been the rights and wrongs of the matter, a number of orchestralplayers felt that they had been badly treated and were clearly left with a burning sense of grievance. which they sought to air throughthe courts. Now that "tenure", as it is called, has been given to the members of the orchestra, Iam glad to say that these unhappyevents are not likely to be repeated.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Some of the musicians first instituted proceedings under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> claiming damages for wrongful dismissal and breach of contract. These proceedings were withdrawn, and on 16 July 1979 an action wasfiled in the High Court by 15 of the players. By this action (No. 3031 of 1979) they claimed damages for wrongful dismissal. On 18December 1979 O'Connor J. struck out the Statement of Claim on the ground that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action,and dismissed the action.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Mr. Eddis, who appears for the players, tells us there was another action instituted by the musicians which was discontinued.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The action from which this appeal arises was instituted, again in the High Court, by the same 15 musicians on 11 April 1980, whichone has to say was a very long time ago. By the time it came on for hearing before Nazareth J., nine of the original Plaintiffs hadwithdrawn their claims for one reason or another and only the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 12th and 15th Plaintiffs were left in the action.As it happens, four of the players were in the wood-wind section of the Orchestra, and one each from the string and percussion sections.Their action was for damages for misrepresentation and I will refer to the nature of the misrepresentations later.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> After a hearing which lasted 18 days, in a reserved judgment given on 7 July this year, Nazareth J. dismissed the claims of fiveof the remaining Plaintiffs.

Early in 1979 some of the members of the Orchestra heard rumours which made themuneasy about their future.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Mr. Robert Stewart, Jr. (the 1st Plaintiff) was a member of the Players' Committee, and the judge found that when he expressed hisdisquiet (on behalf of himself and his colleagues) to Mr. McKenzie, the Chairman of the Society's Executive Committee, he was toldby Mr. McKenzie in effect that neither his, nor the positions of the other players, were in jeopardy.

He addressed the Orchestra after a rehearsal on 30 April and preciselywhat he said was hotly disputed. I note in passing, as did the judge, that in terms of the letter of 12 December 1978 which I havejust read, this was the date by which agreement about any new contract to begin on 1 August 1979 had to be reached. The judge carefullyreviewed and examined the evidence led about what was said on that occasion, given by the Plaintiffs and three other players presenton one side, and by Mr. Duffus and two defence witnesses on the other. He reached the conclusion that while he doubted whether theprecise words used by Mr. Duffus could be recalled, he would accept the evidence of the Plaintiffs and the other musicians who testified,that they were reassured by what Mr. Duffus had to say.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> About the effect of what Mr. Duffus said at the meeting, the judge added:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="91%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="86%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"Regardless of whether that was his original intention, and whatever his motive, whether to soften the blow, to preserve morale orto gloss over a potential problem, I am satisfied on the probabilities that Mr. Duffus in fact reassured the players as the Plaintiffsand their witnesses claim.

I should add that in my view even Mr. Duffus'version of what he said (which I reject on the probabilities) would in the circumstances have been construed by the players as reassurance,and could only have been intended as such."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In the event, five of the Appellants (and other players) received "non-renewal" letters dated 3 June 1979 from Mr. Duffus which began:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="91%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="86%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"It is with regret that I have to inform you that, on the advice of the Music Director of the Hong Kong Philharmonic we are unableto offer you a new contract once your existing contract expires at the end of July."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p align="left"> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The letter addressed to Mr. Yeung (the 15th Plaintiff) said <i>[</i>for the same reason<i>]</i>"...... we are unable to offer you a permanent contract with the Orchestra for the 1979/80 session."</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It was at a meeting of the Executive Committee on 16 March that the decision had been taken to defer consideration of the renewalor otherwise of the musicians' contracts until May, which would be after Mr. Tung's arrival in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Nazareth J. went on to "find as a fact", as he put it, that Mr. Duffus had made statements at the meeting on 30 April 1979 to thefollowing effect:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">"(a)</td>            <td width="70%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">that members of the Orchestra should not worry about their new contracts not being available for sighing despite the date;</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td width="70%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">that the new contracts had been held up because of technicalities and the translation into Chinese;</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td width="70%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">that the new contracts would, be issued shortly and the Committee were waiting for the Musical Director as a matter of courtesy;</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(d)</td>            <td width="70%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">that arrangements had been made with Air France about vacation tickets and he wanted to know everyone's travel plans;

In dealing with the question of damages, he remarked that the Plaintiffs had claimed as damagesthe loss of remuneration they would have received for up to two years under the renewed contracts they had expected. He noted thatit had not been disputed that their claims were founded not in contract but in tort. The judge said that he accepted as a correctstatement of the law, the sentence with which paragraph 1481 of MCGREGOR ON DAMAGES (14th Edition) concludes:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="92%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="86%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"Despite this paucity of authority, however, it is clear that the proper aim of the damages award is to restore the plaintiff, asfar as possible and subject to the usual rules of remoteness and the like, to the position in which he would have been if the negligentmisrepresentation had never been made."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left">The parties conceded that this is a correct statement of the appropriate measure of damages and, therefore, there is no need to gointo the authorities that were referred to us.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The judge concluded that the Plaintiffs' claims for loss of remuneration under the contracts they expected to be renewed were misconceived,for neither the loss of that remuneration nor the non-renewal of the contracts flowed directly or were in consequence of the representations.He pointed out that if the misrepresentations had never been made (or even if the Plaintiffs had been told the true position) theircontracts would nonetheless not have been renewed.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I am sorry to have to say that the Plaintiffs' claim as presented in the Court below was misconceived.

Then came a list of the earningsof the individual Plaintiffs from the employment they were able to obtain after their contracts were not renewed. And indeed evenwhen this appeal was opened before us, there was a submission that the Plaintiffs had acquired a right to expect the renewals andpossibly even a right of renewal, enforceable by action.

While he would accept that his employment prospects were better early in the year, particularlyin the United States, he felt that the probability was that he did not lose any employment opportunity whatever because he wouldnot have secured employment anyway; his failure to obtain employment had resulted not from the misrepresentation but from the non-availabilityof positions for oboists, his demoralization and his decision to go in for free-lancing. Although his demoralization might have beencontributed to or accentuated by the misrepresentations raising expectations of renewal, the judge said, it was primarily the resultof the loss of employment on the non-renewal of his contract. He thought that in any event demoralization would have resulted inloss, not of the renewed contract earnings claimed, but of some other future earnings, the basis of which he had not attempted toestablish. The judge held that his loss of employment and remuneration was not caused by the misrepresentations.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> As regards the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 12th Plaintiffs, the judge observed that, with the exception of the forfeited deposit for whichhe awarded damages to the 2nd Plaintiff, the evidence had not disclosed that any of them had sustained any loss, expenditure or detrimentby reason of the misrepresentations. They had led no evidence to suggest that had the misrepresentation not been made they wouldhave taken earlier action to find other employment still less that they would have obtained such employment earlier. He noted, too,that there had been no evidence that they would have turned to the U.S.A. for employment, or that their prospedts of obtaining otheremployment would have been better in the earlier part of the year.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> About the 15th Plaintiff, the judge said that, as the only local musician of all the Plaintiffs, he had clearly sustained the mostsevere blow from the non-renewal of his contract, both in terms of financial loss and mental distress. He had not been able to findalternative employment and even his private music teaching opportunities had diminished possibly because of the non-renewal of hiscontract. The judge went on to say that although it was to be regretted that he non-renewal of his contract could not have been accomplishedin a manner that occasioned less distress to him, it had to be said that his loss and distress flowed, not from the misrepresentations,but from the non-renewal of his contract. In his view, had the misrepresentations not been made (or even if he had been told on 30April that his contract would not be renewed), it was difficult to see what he could have done to avoid the hardships he subsequentlyhad to endure. There were apparently no jobs for professional cellists in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The Notice of Appeal, in reference to the measure of damages, said this:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="93%">        <tr>            <td width="17%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" colspan="2" class="quote">"4.</td>            <td width="83%" colspan="2" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">On the basis of his own finding that the representations were intended to be relied upon by the Plaintiffs and each of them and wererelied upon by the Plaintiffs and each of them the learned trial Judge ought to have quantified the basis of the demoralisation mentaldistress and financial loss as either</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="17%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="3%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(A)</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">The value of a renewal of their existing contracts for no less than two years as was eventually awarded to all players whose contractswere renewed or</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="17%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" colspan="2" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(B)</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">On the same basis as (A) above less such earnings as the Plaintiffs and each of them were able to obtain during the next followingtwo years or</p>                <p align="justify" class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="17%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" colspan="2" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(C)</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">The value of a renewal of their existing contracts for at least one year being the minimum period awarded to those whose contractswere renewed or</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="17%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" colspan="2" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(D)</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">On the same basis as (C) above less such earnings as the Plaintiffs and each of them were able to obtain during the next followingyear or</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="17%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" colspan="2" class="quote"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(E)</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">(A) or (B), (C) or (D) and/or damages for demoralisation and mental distress."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p> </p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">And so, the misconception continued.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> By their Supplementary Notice of Appeal, the Appellants say that the judge ought to have found that the timing and nature of themisrepresentations during January to March 1979 were such as to have deceived them into believing their contracts would be renewedand to have "disadvantaged" them:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="79%">                <p align="left">from considering any honourable and timely offer of resignation;

The Appellants go on to say that the judge should therefore have found that they,being thus disadvantaged, had suffered loss calculated, still it is said, in the manner set out in paragraph 4 of their Notice ofAppeal which I have just read.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> I think it is common ground that misrepresentation, in any of its forms, is a tort which depends on proof of damage to complete agood cause of action. This is why, of course, the actions of five of the Appellants were dismissed despite the judge's finding intheir favour on the issue whether or not misrepresentations had been made. And in considering whether damage has been proved to forma basis for the assessment of damages, it can make no difference whether the misrepresentations were deliberate or negligent.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> As we have seen, the loss claimed by the Statement of Claim is the deprivation of opportunities of seeking further employment. Noneof the Plaintiffs, except the 1st Plaintiff, gave any evidence on this matter at all. Mr. Stewart certainly did, but I have readand re-read his evidence and it is quite plain that although he mentioned that he hoped that he would have been given earlier noticeif his contract was not to be renewed and that he would have taken steps to go to America or seek new employment (arid thus to avoidhaving the non-renewal letter) much of his evidence was directed towards the loss that he suffered in money terms by the non-renewalof his contract in Hong Kong. Even Mr. Stewart does not say anything about the prospects he might have had of succeeding in any ofthe applications that he might have made for vacant posts for players which appeared in the "International Musician".</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Speaking for myself, I have some doubt whether the loss of an opportunity of seeking further employment can, without more, possiblybe regarded as damage for the purpose of completing the cause of action for misrepresentation. But even if it can, it seems to methat without some evidence of the chances of success in the applications that he might have made, it was quite impossible for a Courtto find damage and to quantify what the loss to Mr. Stewart would be.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> I accept Mr. Eddis' submission, that just because damages are difficult to assess, this is no reason why they should not be awarded.There is ample authority for this. The Court will do the best that it can.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> I would quote here, if I may, paragraph 217 from SPENCER BOWER AND TURNER ON ACTIONABLE MISREPRESENTATION (3rd Edition) for I thinkit is very apt for this case. This is what the paragraph says:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="86%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"217     It not infrequently happens in practice that the court is left to assess damages for fraud on evidence which is less thancompletely satisfactory. Plaintiffs sometimes present their cases on a mistaken view of the principles of quantum, and adduce insufficientevidence of the value of the property acquired by the representee at the date of its acquisition, In such cases defendants, betteraware of the true principles to be used in assessment, have been known to offer no evidence as to damage, and at the end to makea plea that the action should fail altogether for lack of proof of damages. The courts lean against such a result when it can beavoided, and will in such a case endeavour, if there is any evidence at all upon which to act, to make an intelligent estimate ofthe loss sustained. But if there is no evidence at all to assist such an attempt, the plaintiff must fail for lack of proof, 'Theabsence of proper evidence of actual loss is a reason why the jury's verdict cannot be allowed to stand,'  The assessment of damagecannot be left entirely to conjecture,'</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> I think this paragraph is apt for two reasons. It emphasises the point made by Mr. Eddis. And, it seems to me, it was because thiscase was misconceived all along, in that it was presented on a mistaken view of the principles of quantum", that proper evidencewas not led to prove detriment so that a monetary award however small, and however assessed (even by guesswork) could be given forthe Plaintiffs' pleaded loss of opportunity of seeking further employment.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Mr. Eddis suggested that it was difficult after all this time to obtain the sort of evidence that might have made the task of theCourt easier, but this was no fault of the Society.

The six Plaintiffs were employed by the Defendant as orchestral players in the Hong Kong PhilharmonicOrchestra. They all had contracts which were due to expire on 31st March 1979. It was agreed that those contracts should be extendedto 31st July 1979. There was a term of the substantive contract that:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="95%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="87%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"The contract may be renewed for a further period commencing April 1, 1979 upon terms to be agreed between Society and Player providedthat agreement for renewal has been reached on or before December 31, 1978.

The judge found that representationswere made to the players on behalf of the Defendant to the following effect:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="88%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="87%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"that their jobs were not in jeopardy and that they could expect renewal of their contracts ........."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">In the event the contracts of these Plaintiffs, inter alia, were not renewed.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The Plaintiffs initially brought an action for wrongful dismissal in the Labour Tribunal and subsequently an action for damages forbreach of contract, it being their contention that they had a contractual right to renewal. The first action was dismissed and, onadvice, they withdrew the second action and started the present action in which they sued in tort in deceit and, alternatively, forinnocent misrepresentation. The representations alleged in para. 10 of the Statement of Claim were substantially those found by thejudge, but the root of the difficulties experienced by the Plaintiffs in this litigation has been that this case in relation to damageswas argued before the courts as one based upon a right of renewal or at least a right in equity to expect renewal. This can be seenfrom the Notice of Appeal: Ground l of the Grounds of Appeal expressly referred to the right to expect renewal and invited this courtto say that Nazareth J. had misinterpreted the agreement for extension in that there was a material difference in meaning betweenthe term contained in that agreement providing for a possible future contract and the comparable term in the original contract. Mr.Eddis concedes that he can find no material difference between them but urges that his clients thought there was. With respect, Ido not see how a misconstruction of plain words by the Plaintiffs could justify a claim for damages against the Defendant. The Noticeof Appeal has now been amended and, although Ground 1 still makes reference to the difference in the terms of the two contracts,it is conceded that there was no right of renewal and no right to expect renewal. The substance of the complaint can be shortly expressedthus: by representing that the Plaintiffs' contracts would be renewed the Defendant raised the Plaintiffs' hopes, led them to delayseeking other employment to start after 31st July 1979 and caused them greater disappointment when, in the event, their contractswere not renewed.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> It has then been argued on the appeal that the Defendant failed to renew the Plaintiffs contracts in breach of a trade usage or customthat non-renewal for defects of musicianship or conduct would occur only when it had been recommended by the Orchestral Liaison Committee,a body consisting of representatives of the management and of the players of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. This again seeksto introduce an alleged breach, of contract in an action in tort in which no such breach was pleaded in the Statement of Claim. Notunnaturally there was no evidence called to establish the trade custom suggested and it is difficult to believe that any such evidencecould have been adduced.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> The trial judge rightly perceived that the first question to be decided was whether a tort had been committed at all. There can bea technical breach of contract without proof of damage but there can be no liability in tort without proof of damage: <u>McConnell</u> v. <u>Wright</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1930%201%20Ch%20546" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1930 1 Ch. 546.</a> The judge said:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="87%">        <tr>            <td width="15%"></td>            <td width="85%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"Virtually no attempt was made to establish any actual loss or damage"</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p align="justify"> </p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">and he said particularly in relation to the lst Plaintiff:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="87%">        <tr>            <td width="15%"></td>            <td width="85%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"Mr. Stewart did not attempt to establish any loss, expenditure or detriment that he would not have incurred had the representationnot been made."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left">With respect, I am not sure that that was correct for, in the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs had alleged</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="86%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"By reason of the misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 12 and 12A of the Statement of Claim the Plaintiffs and each of them havesuffered damages and loss in that they were deprived of any opportunity of seeking further employment until receipt of the said letterof the 3rd June 1979."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left">The 1st Plaintiff is recorded as having said:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="86%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"If  he <i>[</i>that was Mr. McKenzie<i>]</i> had said true I would have tendered my resignation effective 31st March 1979.

However, I think the real substance of the judge's finding was that that loss was incapableof quantification on the evidence, for he referred to the contention that the 1st Plaintiff was demoralized by the misrepresentationsraising expectation of renewal and continued:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="88%">        <tr>            <td width="15%"></td>            <td width="85%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"But in my view it was primarily the result of loss of employment on non-renewal of his contract."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">Then he said:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There is accordingly in my view no basis upon which I could properly make any award of damages to him and, his claim must accordinglyfail."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left">It is therefore the lack of evidence as to the value of the lost opportunity which forms the true basis of the judges decision.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The argument of Mr. Eddis is epitomized in his statement that:</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="86%">                <p align="left" class="quote">"The disadvantage suffered by the Plaintiffs must have some value."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left">If by that he meant some positive value, I am unable to agree. It was incumbent on the Plaintiffs to adduce evidence upon which someestimate, however general, could properly be made.. All we have here in respect of the 1st Plaintiff is evidence that various jobsas a principal oboist were available in the United States in the months of February to April, jobs which he might have applied forif the misrepresentation had not been made. There was then evidence that when he eventually did arrive back in the United States,after his engagement in Hong Kong was complete, he was still unable to obtain employment as a principal oboist.

One would not expectin a case of this kind that there would be evidence that the Plaintiff would have obtained a job if he had applied ac the materialtime, but one would expect there to be some evidence to assist the court in estimating the possibility of his obtaining a job. Thejudge took the view that the evidence was so deficient that he was unable to make any assessment of the value of the lost opportunity.Mr. Eddis suggested that any evidence which could possibly have been called would have been of very little weight and that therewas no evidence that his client was an incompetent musician. In my view the burden was on the Plaintiffs to prove their loss andthis was not a case where the judge was required to make an assessment however difficult that task might be. He was entitled to saythat there was no evidence that the lost opportunity was worth anything at all. That is a conclusion which I reach with regret, because,even on the judge's finding, the 1st Plaintiff and, indeed, the other Plaintiffs were treated very shabbily.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> The evidence to support the claim of the other Plaintiffs is even weaker than that adduced by the 1st Plaintiff. It follows thatI see no reason to interfere with the judge's conclusion that, except to the extent that the 2nd Plaintiff was awarded the sum of2,000 pesos in respect of the purchase of a house, the tort was not established.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> Other matters were argued, namely that the damage was aggravated by the mental distress or demoralization already referred to andthat that distress in turn is affected by the contention that the misrepresentation was fraudulent rather than innocent. I do notthink the degree of distress could be affected by the existence of fraud, because the Plaintiff would not know whether the misrepresentationwas fraudulent or innocent.
