He was in the happy position of being entitled to build a village-typehouse on land granted by the Government. Apart from building a house for self occupation, it is apparently not uncommon for the valueof the entitlement to be exploited by getting small scale developers to construct village-type houses of which individual floorscan be sold off as separate units. Thus two houses or blocks were constructed by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants who were brought in asdevelopers. In fact, the 1st Defendant having received whatever benefit that was agreed remained only to lend his name to whateverwas needed. The Plaintiffs, who, like the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, were husband and wife, came into the matter as the purchasers of"Block A, 2nd Floor including Roof" under a sale and purchase agreement ("the Agreement") they entered into with the Defendants.The Agreement came to a premature end when the Defendants terminated it and forfeited the first stage payment on the ground thatthe second stage payment was late. The Plaintiffs unsuccessfully took proceedings against the Defendants in the Court of First Instance.On the other hand, the Defendants did not succeed completely on their counterclaim. The Plaintiffs now appeal to this Court. A helpfulstarting point is the Agreement.</p>    <p class="heading">The Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The following provisions of the sale and purchase agreement are relevant:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"2.

During construction, the purchaser is entitled to request a change of some of the (building) materials, but the same must complywith Government regulations (details to be separately written)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Facts</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> At the time of the signing of the Agreement on 31st March 1994 $296,000.00, which included the initial deposit of $30,000.00, waspaid to and received by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> There was a dispute between the parties as to the circumstances the second stage payment of $148,000.00 was made and refused by thePlaintiff. It is now no longer necessary to be concerned about those matters given the factual findings made by the judge, whichhave not been appealed.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Reverting to the facts, the Defendants on 15th January 1996 terminated the Agreement and forfeited the first stage payment of HK$296,000.00(including the initial deposit of $30,000.00). The Defendants then on 25th March 1996 entered into a sale and purchase agreementof the property with one Lai Ka Bik for $2.18 million. This agreement was not registered and was later cancelled. On 19th June 1996they entered into another sale and purchase agreement which was registered with the Land Registry on 8th August 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Before that on 27th June 1997, the Plaintiffs took out their writ of summons and on 15th July 1997 registered it in the Land Registry.In their writ they sought inter alia specific performance of the Agreement or alternatively return of their deposit and damages.On 9th December 1997, the Defendants' application to vacate the registration of the writ of summons was dismissed by Deputy JudgeWhaley in the High Court but, with leave from him, the Plaintiffs amended their Statement of Claim to include a claim for a lienagainst the property in respect of the deposits and a further sum equivalent to the deposit. The Plaintiffs also formally abandonedtheir claim for specific performance. On 25th March 1998 the Plaintiffs registered their Amended Statement of Claim at the Land Registry.On 9th September 1998 the Plaintiffs abandoned their claim for a lien and were accordingly ordered to vacate the <em>lis pendens</em> at the Land Registry by Yeung J. He also granted the Defendants leave to re-amend their defence and counterclaim. In the result,the Defendants counterclaimed:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) a declaration that the Agreement was validly terminated by their letter of 15th January 1996,</p>        <p>(ii) a declaration that they were entitled to "forfeit the deposits in the sum of HK$296,000.00 paid by the Plaintiff and to re-sellthe said property" and</p>        <p>(iii) a declaration that they were entitled to recover from the Plaintiffs such damages for which they might be held liable to payto the final purchaser in respect of the <em>lis pendens</em> being wrongfully registered until 9th September 1998.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The matter came for trial before Suffiad J. in January 1999. He held that the Plaintiffs were in breach of the Agreement and by hisformal order adjudged and declared that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. the Sale and Purchase Agreement between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants dated 31st March 1994 ('the Agreement') was terminatedby the Defendants' letter of 15th January 1996;</p>        <p class="quote">2. there be no damages awarded for the Plaintiffs' breach of the Agreement as the Defendants have suffered none;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3. the Defendants are entitled to forfeit the initial deposit of HK$30,000.00, the balance amount of HK$266,000.00 be returned tothe Plaintiffs;</p>        <p class="quote">4. the Defendants' counterclaim for damages for wrongful registration of the lis pendens by the Plaintiffs be dismissed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Defendants' appeal</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The Defendants appealed to this Court seeking the following orders:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1. a declaration that they are entitled to forfeit the deposit in the sum of $296,000.00 paid by the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs and tore-sell the property;</p>        <p>2. a declaration that the registrations of the writ of summons and subsequently the Amended Statement of Claim in the Land Registryas <em>lis pendens</em> were wrongful;</p>        <p>3. a declaration that the Defendants are entitled to recover from the Plaintiffs such damages for which they might be held liableto pay to the final purchaser in respect of the <em>lis pendens</em> being wrongfully registered and an order that such damages be assessed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Whether $296,000.00 rightly forfeited</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Submissions were made on both sides as to whether the deposit of $296,000.00, i.e. 20% of the purchase price, amounted to a penalty.In the event we have not found it necessary to consider these submissions. The judge dealt with the construction of the relevantprovisions in the Agreement at p. 13R-14H in the following way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"..... Clause 8(i) of the Agreement allows the vendor to forfeit the "initial deposit" paid by the purchaser if the purchaser shouldbe in breach of the Agreement. Secondly I note that the only other reference to "initial deposit" in the Agreement is contained inClause 3 where under Stage 1 the initial deposit refers to $30,000.00. I note also that neither the sum of $296,000.00 nor the sumof $148,000.00 are referred to as deposits in Clause 3 or any other part of the Agreement. Moreover, it is a cardinal principle thatin construing a document, the same word used in different parts of the same document should be given the same meaning.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In all the circumstances of this case, I have come to the conclusion that the parties intended that in the event of a breach of theAgreement by the purchaser (in this case the Plaintiff), the Defendant vendor would be entitled to forfeit the initial deposit of$30,000.00.</p>        <p class="quote">In the circumstances it is not necessary for me to decide whether or not the $296,000.00 was or was not a penalty if it was to beforfeited....."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> We agree. This meaning emerges so clearly that there is no need to consider the matter of penalty. We can find nothing in Mr. Mak'ssubmissions for the Defendants that even begins to dent that conclusion. A further consideration in support of the latter is thatsince forfeiture is only provided in relation to the initial deposit, the inference must be that it does not extend to the balanceof the Stage 1 payment. We have no hesitation whatever in dismissing the Defendants' appeal in that respect.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether Registrations of Lis Pendens were Lawful</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In dismissing the Defendants' counterclaim for damages for wrongful registration of the <em>lis pendens</em> the judge said this at p. 14S-15G:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Lastly, I turn to deal with the Defendants' claim for damages due to the wrongful registration of the <em>lis pendens.</em> Having found the Plaintiffs to be in breach of the Agreement, it appears at first blush that the Defendants must be entitled to damagesfor the wrongful registration of the <em>lis pendens</em> by the Plaintiffs.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">However, on further reflection of the matter, particularly in view of my judgment above that the Defendants are only entitled to forfeitthe initial deposit of $30,000.00 and therefore that the balance of the $266,000.00 has to be returned to the Plaintiffs, and whichhave all this time been held by the Defendants, I am of the view that there has been no wrongful registration of the <em>lis pendens.</em> Accordingly, the Defendants' counterclaim in this respect fails."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> What the judge seems to be saying in the foregoing reasons is that since it has finally emerged that the Defendants were wronglyholding on to the $266,000.00 the Plaintiffs were somehow entitled to register the <em>lis pendens.</em> But plainly, it is necessary to see whether this accords with the law.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr. Sham, for the Plaintiffs, does not adopt the judge's approach. He points to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128/s1a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 1A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128" class="autolink_findacts">Land Registration Ordinance</a>, (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128">Cap. 128</a>), which defines <em>lis pendens</em> as meaning</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Any action or proceeding pending in a court or tribunal that relates to land or any interest in or charge on land."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> He accepts the statement in <strong>Calgary and Edmonton Land Co. Ltd. v. Dobinson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20Ch%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 Ch 102</a>; 107G that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"What is registrable as a pending land action is an action or proceeding which claims some proprietary right in the land, and notan action merely claiming that the owner should be restrained from exercising his powers of disposition."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He submits that from the outset, the Plaintiffs' claim was for specific performance of the Agreement which was thus a claim to a proprietaryinterest in land and was accordingly registrable as a <em>lis pendens.</em> But then, as he says, the Plaintiffs' formally abandoned their claim for specific performance in December 1997. However, with respectto this, he submits that the Plaintiffs at the same time amended their claim to include a claim for a lien against the property inrespect of the "deposit". Clearly here his submission must fail for the claim to the lien in respect of the first stage payment,was not a claim to a proprietary interest in the land; on the contrary it would appear to be a claim merely that the owners shouldbe restrained from exercising their powers of disposition. In any case, the claim to the lien was then also abandoned on 9th September1998 so that the registration of the<em>lis pendens</em> was ordered to be vacated. However, in truth Mr. Sham's submission is simply that because the Plaintiffs were entitled in terms ofsection 1A, read with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 2</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">14</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128" class="autolink_findacts">Land Registration Ordinance</a>, to apply for registration of a <em>lis pendens,</em> the resulting registration must be lawful, or to use the language of the judge, there has been no wrongful registration. This facilesubmission must be rejected on its face.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Sham also seeks to rely on para. 763 of Vol. 28 of the 4th Edition Reissue, <em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em> p. 388 which recognises that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A purchaser who has paid a deposit or money on account of the purchase price to the vendor and has then lawfully repudiated his contracthas an equitable lien on the vendor's interest in the land agreed to be sold."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However, it can be seen from the authorities cited in support of the statements in that paragraph in particular <strong>Whitbread &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Watt</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1902%5d%201%20Ch%20835" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1902] 1 Ch 835</a>, 915, that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The lien is created by the contract under which the money is paid as part of the purchase-money, and on the faith that the contractwill be carried out, and not by the default of the vendor. The default give rise to the necessity for enforcing the lien, but thelien arises from the contract..... the purchaser has a lien, both when the contract goes off for want of title and when the contractis rescinded under a condition enabling the purchaser to rescind. If the purchaser himself makes default the case is entirely different.If the purchaser makes default in such a way as to deprive himself of any debt at all, he cannot have a lien for that which doesnot exist."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The lien is the same in effect as if the vendor had executed a mortgage of the property in the purchaser's favour for the amountcovered by the lien (<strong>Rose v. Watson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1864%5d%2010%20HL%20Cas%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1864] 10 HL Cas 672</a>; <strong>Cabra Estates Plc. and other v. Glendower Investments</strong>, Chancery Division, 11th November 1992, per Roger Kaye Q.C. (unreported).</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> It follows, therefore, that if the purchaser chooses to terminate the contract by repudiation and thereby to dis-entitle himselfto the property, there are no grounds for a lien. That is no injustice to the purchaser, for the lien is created by the contractand exists in support of it, and it is the purchaser who has brought the contract to an end.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It follows, therefore, that the registration of the <em>lis pendens</em> was wrongful.</p>    <p class="heading">Order for Damages to be Assessed</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> There remains the Defendants' claim for a declaration that they are entitled to recover from the Plaintiffs' damages for which theymay be held liable to the subsequent purchasers in respect of the wrongful registration of the <em>lis pendens</em> and for an order that such damages be assessed.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Mak, for the Defendants, has not referred us to any provisions of law or any authority that points to this Court having powerto award damages for wrongful registration. In particular <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128" class="autolink_findacts">Land Registration Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/128">Cap. 128</a>), which confers power on the court to order vacation of the <em>lis pendens</em>, only confers power to direct the party on whose behalf the registration was made to "pay all the costs and expenses occasioned bythe registration or the vacating thereof". The implication of that omission, coupled with the references in some of the authoritiescited to statutory provisions in other jurisdictions enabling such damages to be awarded, occasions us some concern. Moreover, noclaim in tort and no special damages for wrongful registration of <em>lis pendens</em> were ever pleaded. The only proceedings that are pending are between the subsequent purchasers of the property, their solicitors,and the Defendants who have been brought in as third parties by those solicitors. We are not persuaded that a cause of action existson these pleadings and that these facts do entitle the Defendants to damages for wrongful registration. Accordingly, we allow theappeal only to the extent of declaring the registration of the <em>lis pendens</em> as wrongful, reserving the matter of damages for determination in the other proceedings. With reference to the other relief soughtby the Defendants, we dismiss the appeal. As to costs, the Defendants have only succeeded in part. It seems to us having regard tothe entire matter that the appropriate order should be that the Defendants should receive only 50% of their costs.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> We accordingly allow the appeal only to the extent of declaring the registration of the <em>lis pendens</em> to have been wrongful. As to the costs of the appeal, we make an order nisi that the Defendants are to have 50% of their costs, tobe taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(G.P.
