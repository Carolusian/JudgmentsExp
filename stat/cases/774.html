2008, the Applicants (William Andrew Brewer III, James Stephen Renard and Michael JosephCollins), all US attorneys and partners in a US law firm (Bickel &amp; Brewer) applied to be admitted as barristers under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(4)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Practitioners Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap. 159</a> (âthe LPOâ) for the purpose of representing a US client, Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards Corporation, (âBrunswickâ)in proceedings instituted in the Court of First Instance (HCCT 66/2007) under section 34C of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/341">Cap. 341</a> and Article 34 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (contained in the Fifth Schedule to thatOrdinance).  After hearing submissions from Mr Nigel Aiken SC (for the Applicants), Mr Godfrey Lam SC (for the Hong Kong Bar Association)and Ms Leona Cheung (for the Secretary for Justice), I dismissed the application with the Reasons for Judgment to be handed downat a later stage.  It is right to point out that at the hearing, Mr Aiken effectively abandoned the applications for admission ofMr Brewer III and Mr Collins (for reasons which I shall presently identify).</p>    <!--sino section party --><parties>        <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The relevant proceedings for which the Applicants sought admission arose from an arbitration award dated 31 July 2007 in proceedingsthat had been commenced by Brunswick (as Claimant) against two Respondents (Shanghai Zhonglu Industrial Co Ltd and Chen Rong).  Ishall refer to these parties simply as the Claimant and the Respondents.  The arbitration dealt with disputes that had arisen betweenthese parties in relation to a contract (a Supply and Worldwide Distribution Contract dated 12 January 2001, as supplemented) forthe manufacture by the Respondents of certain ten-pin bowling equipment.  The Claimant is a well-known manufacturer, seller and distributorof such bowling equipment and has been in this business since 1900.  The dispute between the parties arose from a termination ofthe SWDC by the Claimant following alleged breaches by the Respondents.</p>        <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The SWDC (which was governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, USA) contained an arbitration agreement whereby all disputesand claims were to be resolved by arbitration in Hong Kong under the UNCITRAL Model Law provisions.  The relevant Notice of Arbitrationwas given on 14 March 2003.  Three arbitrators were appointed.</p>        <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The substantive hearing of the arbitration took place over 34 days between 7 March 2005 and 10 August 2005.  Without doubt, it wasa substantial one.  The following facts were emphasized by Mr Aiken in his written submissions : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â4.  The arbitration proceedings involve substantial issues of fact and law.  The scale of the proceedings is demonstrated by thefollowing :</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">4.1  Discovery involved the production of around 46,000 pages of documents by the Company and of around 39,000 pages of documentsby the Respondents;</p>                <p class="quote">4.2  The proceedings lasted 34 days;</p>                <p class="quote">4.3  The Company submitted 52 factual witness statements and 7 expert witness statements; the Respondents submitted 49 factual witnessstatements and 20 expert reports from 11 expert witness;</p>                <p class="quote">4.4  During the proceedings, the Company called 25 factual witnesses and 6 expert witnesses, while the Respondents called 14 factualwitnesses and 7 expert witnesses; 20 additional witnesses statements were prepared by the parties to rebut and/or supplement oraltestimony;</p>                <p class="quote">4.5  Each side submitted written briefs to address specific issues during the course of the proceedings and there were a total of9 briefs submitted by the parties;</p>                <p class="quote">4.6  Closing submissions of both parties totalled around 600 pages; and</p>                <p class="quote">4.7  The tribunal, consisted of Anthony Dicks QC SC, Anthony Neoh QC SC and Sally Ann Harpole, took almost 2 years to deliberate theaward which ran to almost 200 pages.â</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Mr Aiken informed me at the hearing that Mr Renard was the lead counsel for the Claimant at the arbitration (assisted by Mr Collins). Mr Brewer III did not appear to have any actual involvement (or very little involvement) and this therefore explained why the applicationfor his admission was abandoned by Mr Aiken.  The Respondents were represented by Hong Kong Senior Counsel (Ms Teresa Cheng SC).</p>        <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The arbitrators awarded the Claimant US$3,065,775.52 on its claim and awarded the Respondents US$2,966,520.06 on their counterclaim. The eventual balance found due to the Claimant was assessed at US$89,106.10.</p>        <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Following the publication of the relevant award, the Respondents applied to set aside parts of it.  The Notice of Motion in HCCT66/2007 was taken out on 7 November 2007.  The hearing of this Motion has been fixed for hearing on 13 January 2009 (three days reserved)before Lam J.  The letter to the Hong Kong Bar Association from the Applicantsâ solicitors seeking consent was dated 28 November2008.  It can therefore be seen that the application for admission is a late one.</p>        <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The following issues in the application to set aside the award have helpfully been summarized by Mr Aiken in the Certificate hehas provided supporting the admission of the Applicants : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe main grounds of the application may be summarised as follows, being that the Tribunal :</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(a)  wrongly applied PRC law rather than Illinois law to the assessment of the certain orders entered into by the Respondents beforethe date of the SWDC and attributed pursuant to the SWDC to the Claimant;</p>                <p class="quote">(b)  awarded damages to the Claimant in the form of revenue when only profits had been claimed;</p>                <p class="quote">(c)  failed to address the Respondentsâ defence of cure in relation to the Claimantâs claim for inferior quality goods;</p>                <p class="quote">(d)  wrongly applied PRC law rather than Illinois law to the various tort claims;</p>                <p class="quote">(e)  unfairly allocated more hearing time to the Claimant despite an agreed âchess-clockâ procedure;</p>                <p class="quote">(f)  wrongly applied the Hong Kong double-actionability rule when Hong Kong law did not apply to the arbitration; and</p>                <p class="quote">(g)  refused to arbitrate certain of the Respondentâs counter-claims that predated the SWDC.â</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In dealing with the merits of the present application, I think it would first be helpful to be reminded of the requirements of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(4)</a> of the LPO regarding the admission of overseas counsel.  I do so given the somewhat unusual nature of the application before thecourt â the Applicants are all US attorneys.  Counsel seeking admission have in the past been barristers (usually Queenâs Counsel)from the United Kingdom or, at least in one instance, New Zealand.  This application represents the first occasion in which an admissionhas been sought regarding lawyers from the USA.</p>        <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/609/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 27</a> of the LPO states : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â27.

These Rules set out the requirements regarding examinations and pupillage which have to be fulfilled before a personmay be admitted.</p>        <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Of particular note here are the provisions in relation to the admission of overseas lawyers as barristers.  Apart from the requirementof demonstrating the requisite period of qualifying practice and standing in the relevant overseas jurisdiction, the overseas lawyermust also have passed the Barristers Qualification Examination unless exemptions have been granted : - see section 4(2)(d).  Thisexamination consists of five papers testing the applicantâs knowledge in Contract and Tort (Paper I), Property Law, Conveyancingand Equity (Paper II), Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure and Criminal Evidence (Paper III), Hong Kong Legal System and Constitutionaland Administrative Law, and Company Law (Paper IV) and Civil Procedure and Civil Evidence, Professional Conduct and Advocacy (PaperV).  The subjects dealt with in these examinations reflect those very matters with which non-overseas lawyers would have to be acquaintedbefore admission as a barrister.  I should also point out that for overseas lawyers, there is of course still the requirement toserve the requisite period of pupillage in Hong Kong.</p>        <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  A less usual route for admission has been where the transitional provisions of section 74C of the LPO applied, namely, in relationto those law students who were, at the time of the amending legislation in 2000, enrolled in a course of study in the United Kingdom. This route is now no longer open as any application for admission on this basis had to be made prior to 31 December 2004 : - seesection 74C(iii).  I refer to these provisions to highlight the historical position in Hong Kong whereby the close links with theUnited Kingdom provided a ready means to gain admission as a barrister in Hong Kong.</p>        <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  I now come to admissions under section 27(4).  Admission under this provision is possible notwithstanding that the stringent requirementsregarding examinations and pupillage (which would otherwise be applicable) are not met.  There are three conditions to be fulfilledbefore the court can exercise its discretion in favour of an admission : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)  The court must consider the applicant to be a fit and proper person to be a barrister.</p>            <p class="quote">(2)  The applicantâs qualifications acquired outside Hong Kong to engage in work must be, if such work were undertaken in Hong Kong,be similar to the work undertaken here in the course of ordinary practice as a barrister in the High Court or the Court of FinalAppeal.</p>            <p class="quote">(3)  The applicant must have substantial experience in advocacy in a court.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>The second requirement makes it clear that this provision is in reality restricted to applicants who are practising lawyers overseas.</p>        <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  I have the following general observations in relation to admissions under section 27(4) : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)  The intention behind this provision is to recognize there may be exceptional situations whereby, notwithstanding the stringentrequirements which must normally be satisfied before a person is admitted to practice as a barrister in Hong Kong, nevertheless itwould be desirable to allow such a person to practice in Hong Kong.</p>            <p class="quote">(2)  That this is exceptional is shown by the very fact of what otherwise would be the appropriate requirements regarding qualificationsas a barrister.</p>            <p class="quote">(3)  The desirability of the exception is obvious, that is, broadly put, to enable the public interest to be served in appropriatecases.</p>            <p class="quote">(4)  It is a narrow exception in that there is no power to admit persons generally.  Under this provision, admission is possible onlyfor a specified case or specified cases.</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Underlying the exceptional nature of section 27(4) is, I emphasize, the public interest.  Indeed, it is this aspect that has permeatedthe reasoning of the court when dealing with applications for admission of overseas counsel under this provision.  The public interestis of course a broad and flexible concept but, in the present context, requires the court to take into account the interests of thepublic at large, the parties directly affected by the relevant proceedings, the local Bar and the courts themselves in the dischargeof their responsibilities in the administration of justice.</p>        <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In most applications for admission under section 27(4), the main aspect for the courtâs consideration has usually been whetherthe case or proceedings for which admission is sought, justifies the admission of overseas counsel.</p>        <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Yet, as the present application demonstrates, before there is any consideration of the question whether the case or proceedingsjustifies the admission of overseas counsel, the court must be satisfied of those three facets referred to in paragraph 14 above(these being expressly set out in section 27(4) itself).  In most applications for admission dealt with by this court, there hasbeen little or no dispute over these matters.  The reason, as I shall presently elaborate, is that almost all applications for theadmission of overseas counsel have involved Queenâs Counsel from common law jurisdictions, in particular the United Kingdom, wherethe qualifications and practice of a barrister closely resembles those of barristers in Hong Kong.</p>        <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The three conditions in section 27(4) require the court to be satisfied of the following : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)  The applicant must be âfit and properâ.  These are of course general terms, but on the whole, the term âfitâ refers toqualifications and experience, while âproperâ is mainly a reference to the good standing of the applicant.  In this latter regard,it is important to emphasize the need to provide details of any disciplinary or other proceedings involving an applicant, whetherpast or present.</p>            <p class="quote">(2)  Section 27(4)(a) sets out the requirement of details being provided of the qualifications of the applicant, in particular thoseprofessional qualifications as a lawyer.  The court is here examining the qualifications of the overseas lawyer as against the qualificationsof a Hong Kong barrister with a view to seeing whether the respective qualifications are comparable.</p>            <p class="quote">(3)  Section 27(4)(b) refers to the necessity of demonstrating substantial experience in advocacy in a court.  Full details of anapplicantâs involvement in court cases (a ready reference is often in reported decisions) and the number of years of experienceas an advocate in court proceedings should therefore normally be provided.</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  These three requirements are the minimum requirements that have to be fulfilled before the court even embarks on a considerationas to whether its discretion should be exercised in favour of admission.  If any of the requirements are not satisfied, that is theend of the application.  It is only when these three requirements are satisfied that the court then applies the principles that havebeen derived from the numerous cases on admissions of overseas counsel.  Of the three requirements, the dominant one is the generalrequirement that the applicant is a fit and proper person.  The requirements set out in sections 27(4)(a) and (b) are, on analysis,specific examples of the general requirement.  The emphasis is on suitability to practice <i>as a barrister</i>.  Where an applicant is a barrister from an overseas jurisdiction, it may be that the requisite conditions are easier to demonstrate. Where the applicant is from a jurisdiction which makes no distinction between barristers and solicitors, more information will haveto be provided going to suitability to practice as a barrister in Hong Kong for the specified case or cases.</p>        <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  As I have remarked earlier, there is often little or no dispute on these three requirements.  Where, as has hitherto been by farthe case, only Queenâs Counsel have sought admission under section 27(4), these requirements have been easily satisfied.  Thisis particularly so where the applicant comes from a jurisdiction where the qualifications and practice of counsel there substantiallymirror the position of Hong Kong barristers.  This would explain the fact that in the past, admissions of overseas counsel in HongKong, have all, with one exception, involved counsel from the United Kingdom (a country which, for historical reasons, Hong Konghas always maintained a close connection).  The one exception was the admission of a Queenâs Counsel from New Zealand last year.</p>        <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In the present application, the evidence going to those three requirements consisted of the following (as far as Mr Renard, effectivelythe only Applicant, was concerned) : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)  A letter from the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel of the State Bar of Texas was provided in which it was certified thatthe Applicant was licensed to practice law in Texas.  It was also certified that no disciplinary action involving misconduct wasbeing taken against him.</p>            <p class="quote">(2)  As far as qualifications were concerned, Mr Renardâs academic and legal qualifications were set out in an extract from thewebsite of his firm.  Apart from just setting out what those were, no further details were provided as to what training was involvedin obtaining the qualifications.</p>            <p class="quote">(3)  Details of Mr Renardâs experience in advocacy in a court were also somewhat sparse.  In the firmâs website, no details weregiven save that Mr Renard was apparently voted one of the best lawyers in Texas in a survey of his peers conducted by a magazine. In the letter to the Hong Kong Bar Association seeking consent, the details of his âsubstantial advocacy experience in courtâconsisted only of references to two cases in the Maryland State Court and the Texas Federal Court, and to two arbitrations.</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  I was not satisfied on the evidence it had been demonstrated that Mr Renard had the necessary experience as an advocate in court. No details were provided of the extent of his involvement as counsel in the two cases involving court proceedings.  Although thetwo arbitrations involved hearings lasting weeks, they were arbitration hearings rather than court proceedings (it will be bornein mind that the reference in section 27(4)(b) is to advocacy in court).  Mr Aiken submitted that the relevant arbitration proceedingswhich have led to the court proceedings (for which Mr Renard seeks admission) lasted some 34 days and it was therefore unlikely thata large corporation such as the Claimant would engage any counsel other than one who was experienced in advocacy.  This may or maynot be so, but provides scant evidence as to Mr Renardâs experience as an advocate in court.</p>        <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Nor was I satisfied, again on the evidence before me, of the necessary qualifications for the purposes of section 27(4)(a).  Wherean applicant comes from a jurisdiction where the system of qualifications and practice as a barrister is similar to Hong Kong (asin the case of the United Kingdom), little more than brief details setting out a personâs qualifications and practice is perhapsnecessary.  Where, on the other hand, the system is potentially quite different (as in the case of Texas), the evidence has to gointo substantially more detail in order to satisfy this requirement.  Earlier, I referred to the contents of Paper V of the BarristersQualification Examination for overseas lawyers seeking admission as barristers under section 27(1) (namely, civil procedure and evidence,professional conduct and advocacy).  These subjects provide a good example of the type of qualifications to which a court would payparticular attention when assessing the requirements of section 27(4)(b).  As far as Mr Renard was concerned, there was much morethat was required by the court.</p>        <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  However, on the assumption that the three basic requirements of section 27(4) are satisfied, ought Mr Renard nevertheless have beenadmitted for the purposes of the hearing of the application to set aside the arbitration award?</p>        <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The first inquiry on this aspect is to identify the purpose for which the admission of the Applicant is sought.  Again, in the usualapplication, this is not a controversial matter because the purpose is always to act as an advocate (and invariably as leading counsel)in the relevant proceedings.  Indeed, this is really the only purpose for which a person can be admitted under section 27(4).  Thereferences in that provision to admission as a âbarristerâ and to substantially experienced in âadvocacyâ in court pointto this conclusion.</p>        <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  And yet, this was not the purpose for which Mr Renard was sought at all, certainly not the dominant purpose.  In the affidavit insupport of the application, it was stated by the Applicantsâ solicitor : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âI am instructed by Messrs Brewer, Renard and Collins, and verily believe, that they were involved at every stage of the arbitrationproceedings.  I respectfully submit that given their familiarity with the record and the underlying documents and evidence of manythousands of pages and of what actually happened during the 35 days of substantive hearing, it would be extremely difficult, inefficientand costly for local counsel to become sufficiently acquainted with the record of the proceedings to be able to properly representthe Claimant, particularly where one of the key grounds for the Respondentsâ application to set-aside the Award of the Tribunalis that the Respondents were unable to present their case.  This ground for setting-aside requires the Claimantâs counsel to befully acquainted with every step of the underlying proceedings and not just those which have been recorded in writing.</p>            <p class="quote">In the circumstances, I verily believe that it will be <i>crucial</i> to Nigel Aiken SC, and to assist the Honourable Court, for Messrs Brewer, Renard and Collins <i>to be able to make submissions on the history of the arbitration proceedings and what went on as a matter of fact during the arbitration</i>.  It goes without saying that Messrs Brewer, Renard and Collins will not be required, nor are they qualified, to make submissionson matters of Hong Kong law.â  (Emphasis added)</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr Aiken frankly accepted that the application for admission was an unusual one in that Mr Renardâs admission was sought, notas an advocate who would be presenting the Claimantâs case, but as effectively junior counsel to him.  His role would really beto deal with any point arising as to what occurred in the relevant arbitration proceedings.  The fear was that the Respondents mightseek to introduce arguments that would depend on what transpired in the arbitration proceedings.  This would then put the Claimantat a great disadvantage if it were unable to deal with any factual disputes of this nature.</p>        <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I agree with Mr Lam that this was far fetched.  Any dispute going as to what occurred in the arbitration could easily be resolvedby reference to the transcript.  If there were to be any substantial dispute as to what had occurred, it would in any event be wrongfor counsel to give evidence from the Bar table.  It seems to me bizarre that the admission of overseas counsel should be soughtfor this limited purpose.  I was also reminded of paragraphs 61 of the Code of Conduct of the Hong Kong Bar.  This provides : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â61.  A barrister may not accept instructions in a case in which he has reason to believe that he is likely to be a witness.  If,being engaged in a case, it becomes apparent that he is likely to be a witness on a material question of fact he should not continueto appear as Counsel if he can retire without jeopardizing his clientâs interests.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p>It was for this reason that the admission of Mr Collins was also effectively abandoned by Mr Aiken.  Mr Collins had sworn an affidavitwhich was to be used in the court proceedings.  However, it seems to me that Mr Renard would be potentially in the same positionwere he to be asked to give evidence of what transpired in the arbitration proceedings.</p>        <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Moreover, the need for Mr Renard to give an account of what went on in the arbitration was itself highly speculative.  Mr Aikenpointed to no issue in the relevant papers in the court proceedings at present that might require such an account of what took placein the arbitration to be given by him.  It was more a fear of what the Respondents might do; in other words, a fear of the unknown(borne, I suspect, simply out of distrust between the parties).  It was submitted that if it became necessary to go into what tookplace, the Claimant would be prejudiced in that while the Respondents would have the services of the same counsel who conducted thearbitration on their behalf, the Claimant would not.  Quite apart from the entirely speculative nature of these submissions, if itdid become necessary to inform the court of what transpired at the arbitration, this could still be done without the need for oneof the Applicants to inform the court in his capacity as counsel.  It is simply misconceived to believe that there is any added valueor advantage for such facts to be relayed to the court by counsel from the Bar table, rather than by conventional means.  In theend, Mr Aiken was driven to submit only that it would be more convenient for counsel to provide such information to the court directlyrather than by way of instructions to the counsel who would have the conduct of the proceedings.  I can only repeat the point thatit is really no part of a counselâs role in the court to be giving evidence in this way.</p>        <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Accordingly, even if the three requirements of section 27(4) are satisfied (which, in my view, they are not), my conclusions onwhether Mr Renardâs application for admission should be permitted, are as follows.</p>        <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  First, given that the purpose (and the only purpose) of admission under section 27(4) is as an advocate, I am not even satisfiedin the present case that the provision is, as a matter of jurisdiction, engaged.  It seems to me that the main purpose for whichMr Renard sought admission was really, not so much to act as counsel, but as a witness (and only a potential at that).</p>        <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Secondly, even if it were engaged, the present application for admission must be rejected.  Reliance was placed on what is knownas the arbitration factor : this is the recognition that continuity of counsel is a weighty factor where arbitration proceedingsare involved (see <i>Re White QC</i>, unreported, HCMP 1509/2005, 1 August 2005).  In <i>Re Goddard QC</i>, unreported, HCMP 2589/2007, 11 January 2008, the arbitration factor was explained in the following way : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â4.  Where overseas counsel seeks admission in the present context - that is, proceedings in court which emanate from arbitrationproceedings in which the relevant counsel has appeared in the substantive hearing or otherwise has had a substantial involvement- the court will readily accede to such application.  This factor, which has been for convenience called the arbitration factor,is a powerful one in favour of admission.  It recognizes the uniqueness of arbitration proceedings (in that counsel from overseaswill not need special admission by the court to conduct arbitration proceedings here) and also recognizes the logical (if not, fair)consequence of that.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  However, the arbitration factor has its limitations.  In <i>Re White QC</i>, the court said this (in paragraph 14) : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â14.  However, it must be recognized that there are limits to the operation of the arbitration factor.  While I do not wish to setout exhaustively all relevant principles in this regard, the following points ought to be noted : -</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(1)The arbitration factor applies only to overseas counsel who conducted (or otherwise had substantial involvement in) the relevantarbitration proceedings out of which the court proceedings arise or from which they derive.  By ârelevant arbitration proceedingsâ,I refer to the relevant arbitration hearing that has led to the court proceedings for which counsel is sought to be admitted.  Forexample, the relevant arbitration proceedings in the present application comprise the hearing that led to the Award.  Even thoughthere was no actual hearing leading to the Award, the Applicant, I understand, drafted the written submissions and of course, hewas the counsel who conducted the main arbitration hearing.</p>                <p class="quote">(2)Where a different overseas counsel applies to be admitted under section 27(4) of the Ordinance (that is, counsel other than asidentified in sub-paragraph (1) above), the arbitration factor ceases to be a factor in itself.  As stated above, section 2F(c) drawsa clear distinction between arbitration proceedings and court proceedings which derive from arbitration proceedings.  Where a differentcounsel is sought to be instructed, he is in no better a position than any other counsel in that he shares none of the advantagesof the original counsel and, as far as the relevant client is concerned, there is no continuity of representation.</p>                <p class="quote">(3)The arbitration factor applies on the whole only to leading counsel.  As was emphasized in <i>Re Flesch QC &amp; Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKLRD%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKLRD 506</a>, at 516D-F (paragraphs (7) and (8)), in order to gain admission, counsel must be of sufficiently high quality and standing and itwould be rare for counsel who is not a Queenâs Counsel (or equivalent) to be admitted.  While the arbitration factor is a substantialfactor, it is equally important to bear in mind that admission is being sought for proceedings in court.</p>                <p class="quote">(4)The matter for which counsel seeks to be admitted (even where the arbitration factor exists) must be a substantial one.  Where,for example, counsel is only sought to be admitted for minor hearings (such as for directions), it is unlikely that the court wouldallow the application for admission even if that counsel had appeared in the arbitration proceedings below.</p>                <p class="quote">(5)The principles established by cases like <i>Re Flesch QC</i> do not cease to have effect even where the arbitration factor exists, save perhaps for one aspect.  That aspect is the obligationon solicitors to provide details of local counsel who have been approached and of their availability.  Where the arbitration factorexists, by definition, other leading counsel (whether from Hong Kong or elsewhere) will not have represented the client in the relevantarbitration proceedings and therefore not have his advantages in this respect.â</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The importance of the qualifications and experience of an applicant, even where arbitration proceedings are concerned, is explainedin paragraph 14(3) of <i>Re White QC</i>.  The emphasis here is on the fact that court (not just arbitration) proceedings are involved.</p>        <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The facet referred to in paragraph 14(4) of <i>Re White QC</i> emphasizes the importance of looking closely at the nature of the court proceedings for which admission is sought and the role ofthe applicant in those proceedings.</p>        <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  It will therefore be seen by reference to these two facets that the arbitration factor ultimately carried very little weight inthe present instance.</p>        <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Lastly, I deal with the question of delay in making the present application for admission.  It will be recalled that the Motionseeking to set aside the arbitration award was dated 7 November 2007.  Service out of the jurisdiction on the Claimant was effectedon 1 April 2008.  The relevant affidavit from the Respondents in support of the Motion was dated 15 August 2008.  Yet, the letterseeking consent from the Hong Kong Bar Association was not sent until late November 2008 and the present Motion for admission wasdated 4 December 2008.  The hearing of the setting aside Motion was of course fixed for 13 January 2009.</p>        <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The application for admission was not timeous and the delay was not explained.  I accept that in the past, there have been worsedelays.  The court has on almost countless occasions reminded practitioners of the need to make applications for admission withoutdelay and where there has been delay, to explain it.  Clearly, where an application has been made late, any delay cannot be usedas a reason to support the application (such as where it is sought to be argued that it would be too late to instruct alternativecounsel).  There are, however, three other reasons why delay is a factor that will be taken into account by the court against admission: -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)  Prejudice may be caused to the other party or parties in the relevant proceedings in relation to which the application for admissionis sought.  Where a late application is permitted, such other party or parties may find it too late to instruct overseas counselof their own.  See here : - <i>Re Flesch QC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%202%20HKC%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 2 HKC 333</a>, at 336F-337B (paragraph 10); <i>Re Roger Ter Haar QC</i>, unreported, HCMP 287/2007, 16 February 2007.  Unlike in jurisdictions such as Singapore, applications for admission of overseascounsel are not notified to other parties in the relevant proceedings or matter.</p>            <p class="quote">(2)  The parties who are entitled to be served include the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Law Society and the Secretary for Justice. Where consent is not forthcoming (usually from the Hong Kong Bar Association), a contested hearing takes place (such as in the presentcase), in which counsel for the Bar and for the Secretary for Justice regularly appear to make submissions (the Law Society rarelyappears).  Like any other hearing in court, adequate time must be allowed for parties to prepare their submissions.  All too often,the lateness of applications results in a compressed timetable for all concerned (not to mention difficulties in instructing counsel),with the attached risk therefore of inadequately prepared submissions (this was not, I should point out, what had occurred in thepresent instance).</p>            <p class="quote">(3)  From the courtâs own point of view, there is no reason for applications for admission to be treated almost as urgent ones,with dates having to be given for the hearing of the contested application at short notice.  The courtâs diary is often tight andalthough urgent applications will always be accommodated, there is, I emphasize, no reason at all why applications for the admissionof overseas counsel should be treated in the same way.</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Given the reminder (once again) of the need to make an application for admission in good time, in future, parties should not besurprised if applications are dismissed or not entertained simply on the ground of unexplained delay alone.  This is not anythingnew : the warning was given as long ago as 1998 by Chan CJHC in <i>Re Flesch QC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKLRD%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKLRD 506</a>, at 516I-J : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âAn application for admission should be made as soon as practicable after it has been decided that overseas counsel will be briefedto appear in the Hong Kong courts.  Where a hearing date has already been fixed, that should also be disclosed in the application. In any event, if an application is made less than two weeks before the hearing date, it will not normally be entertained, even ifit is by consent, unless there are exceptional circumstances;â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In <i>Re Flesch QC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%202%20HKC%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 2 HKC 333</a>, at 337A-B (paragraph 10), the court also gave the following warning : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThese considerations apart, where a late application is made, the court is entitled to a full and proper explanation.  In the absenceof one, it is to be assumed there is no proper explanation.  By itself, it may justify the court in refusing an application for admission. It is a matter simply of candour and where it is perceived to be a lack of it, a court may well regard the application as not beingjustified.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  For the above reasons, the application for the admission of the three Applicants (which in the end, as I have said, became an applicationonly for the admission of Mr Renard) was dismissed.  This application was, as I have said, the first occasion which US counsel havesought admission in Hong Kong under section 27(4).
