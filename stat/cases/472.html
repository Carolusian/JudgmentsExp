Mr Thomas is a partner of Herbert Smith. By Summons ("the 1st Summons") dated 2July 2003 the Defendants applied to strike out the SOC on various grounds, including that the SOC was frivolous, vexatious or otherwiseand an abuse of process.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> On 8th September 2003 Mr Wong filed an Amended Statement of Claim ("AMSOC") without leave pursuant to RHC Order 20, Rule 3. By Summons("the 2nd Summons") dated 11 September 2003 the Defendants applied (pursuant to RHC Order 20, Rule 4) to disallow the amendmentsto the SOC.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> By HCA No. 5590 of 2000 ("the 2000 Action") Mr Wong sued Messrs Victor Chu &amp; Co. ("Victor Chu") for libel in respect of certainwords used by Victor Chu in inter-solicitor correspondence in the course of a previous litigation. Victor Chu and Mr Wong were respectivelyacting for the plaintiff and defendant in that previous litigation (which happened in 1994). In the 2000 Action Herbert Smith wereappointed by the Solicitors' Indemnity Scheme to act for Victor Chu.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Following the trial of a preliminary issue, by a Judgment dated 19 September 2001 (upheld by the Court of Appeal on 29 November 2002)Hartmann J dismissed Mr Wong's claim against Victor Chu in the 2000 Action. Hartmann J held that the words complained of by Mr Wonghad been published on an occasion of absolute privilege and were accordingly not actionable.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Following dismissal of the 2000 Action, Victor Chu proceeded to tax its costs. The bill of costs identified a number of fee earnerson the part of Herbert Smith. These included Mr Sammy Fang ("Mr Fang") who was described in the bill as having "qualified in Australiain Time 1996". The bill charged for an aggregate of 93 hours ($289,333.30 at $3,100 per hour) of Mr Thomas' time. It claimed an aggregateamount of $10,400 (representing 4 hours 20 minutes of work at $2,400 per hour) for Mr Fang's time.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> During a taxation hearing before Master Au-yeung on 15 August 2002, Mr Thomas stated that Mr Fang was a Registered Foreign Lawyer.In fact Mr Fang (although qualified in Australia) was not a Registered Foreign Lawyer at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> On 28 August 2002 Mr Wong applied to review Master Au-yeung's decision. A hearing was consequently fixed for 14th November 2002 toreview her taxation.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In written Submissions dated 4th November 2002 for the then forthcoming taxation review, Herbert Smith volunteered the followingcorrection of Mr Thomas' statement regarding Mr Fang:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"3. Mr Fang is not a registered foreign lawyer. Mr Thomas was mistaken as to Mr Fang's position and apologizes to the Master for thismistake. Mr Fang is qualified in Australia, having been admitted as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in December1996 and as a Solicitor of the High Court of Australia in March 2001. He has been employed by Herbert Smith as a paralegal since20th August 2001."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The submissions went on to suggest (relying on Waung J's decision in <em>The</em> <strong>"Magway"</strong> HCAJ 246 of 1999, 1 August 2002) that the erroneous description of Mr Fang should not affect the recoverability of his costs.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> At the taxation hearing on 14 November 2002 Mr Wong submitted that Mr Thomas had deliberately misled the Master and accordingly allthe time charged by Mr Thomas should be disallowed. Master Au-yeung adjourned the review and gave Mr Wong leave to apply out of timefor the review of all costs claimed in respect of Mr Thomas. She further ordered that Mr Thomas file an affidavit explaining hismistake and attend the restored hearing of the review to give personal explanation if necessary.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Mr Thomas filed the requisite Affidavit ("the Affidavit") on 24 December 2002. In the Affidavit Mr Thomas also pointed out severalother errors in Victor Chu's bill of costs which he had only discovered after the original taxation hearing. These errors relatedto the rates charged for Mr Thomas' work and to certain items of work done by other fee earners but mistakenly attributed by thelaw costs draftsman to Mr Thomas in the original bill of costs. As a result of such discovery, Victor Chu issued a Summons dated15 January 2003 to withdraw the original (and substitute an amended) bill of costs. A further summons was issued on 30 January 2003to amend this summons. An amended bill of costs annexed to this further summons claimed a revised aggregate of 42 hours 15 minuteswork (comprising 26 hours 40 minutes ar $2,900 per hour and 15 hours 35 minutes at $3,300 per hour for a total of $128,758.30) forMr Thomas. The amended bill charged 6 hours' work ($14,400 at $2,400 per hour) for Mr Fang.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> On 6 February 2003 Master Au-yeung held that she had no jurisdiction to allow withdrawal of Victor Chu's original bill of costs.But she granted Victor Chu leave to issue an application for review out of time to deal with th errors mentioned in the Affidavit.Victor Chu thus obtained an appointment for a review to be heard on 6 March 2003. This appointment and Mr Wong's own review applicationwere both subsequently adjourned to 10 June 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> At the 10 June 2003 review Mr Wong cross-examined Mr Thomas on the Affidavit, including Mr Thomas' explanation for the mistaken characterisationof Mr Fang's status. Mr Wong challenged Mr Thomas' explanation for the discrepancies between the original and amended bill of costs.Mr Wong submitted that Mr Thomas had deliberately misled the Master as to Mr Fang's status and that the reason for Mr Thomas seekingto review the original bill of costs was "so that the whole idea that whether or not Mr Fang was a registered foreign lawyer couldbe buried underground". Mr Wong described Mr Thomas as "the sort of person to have the propensity to twist [his] way around in orderto suit [his] own purpose". Finally, Mr Wong argued that Mr Thomas' credibility was so much in doubt that the Master "should setaside all Mr Thomas's time in relation to his claim of time that he has sent in his bill of costs in relation to [the 2000 Action]."</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> At the end of the hearing on 10 June 2003 Master Au-yeung rejected Mr Wong's submissions. She held that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There does not appear to be enough material to create a doubt in my mind as to the credibility of Mr Thomas when one views his explanationindependently.</p>        <p class="quote">....</p>        <p class="quote">The explanation given by Mr Thomas was not incredible. The course of events was most unfortunate. Had Mr Thomas or his firm been morecareful in giving instructions to the LCD [law costs draftsman], had they taken more care when approving the bill, the matter wouldnot have ended up in the present state.</p>        <p class="quote">Unfortunate though it may be, there have been instances in the past where solicitors rely on LCDs whom they think are experiencedin taxation matters to draft a bill and then are concerned only with the final figure and whether that final figure contravenes theindemnity principle.</p>        <p class="quote">Whilst this is not to be encouraged, I cannot say that, looking at all the circumstances together, the failure of Mr Thomas to noticethat the bill overcharged his time was a deliberate, misleading act on the part of Mr Thomas.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">....</p>        <p class="quote">Looking at all the circumstances, there is nothing which caused me to find that the misleading statement was made out of a deliberateintention to lie to the court as opposed to carelessness. Indeed it is not an irresistible inference that Mr Thomas had been lyingto the court. There could be logical explanations consistent with innocence which I accept."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Master thereupon granted leave to Victor Chu to amend its appointment for review and adjourned the hearing of the review to adate to be fixed. The review will be heard on 25th September 2003.</p>    <p class="heading">Discussion</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The SOC pleads in substance as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"3. The first Defendant [Mr Thomas] acting in his capacity of partner of the second Defendant [Herbert Smith] had deliberately madea misleading lie to the court on the 15 August 2002 in that he claimed one of the employee Mr Sammy Fang was a registered foreignlawyer in employment of the second Defendant. In fact, Mr Fang was not a registered foreign lawyer in Hong Kong SAR at the materialtime.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">4.

Alternatively,the Master may hold that the mistake was immaterial to the original taxation and (on such hypothesis) Mr Wong could have no complaint.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> I consider each ground.</p>    <p class="heading">Collateral attack</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> It is an abuse of process for an intending plaintiff to initiate legal proceedings for the purpose of mounting a collateral attackupon a final decision against the intending plaintiff which has been made by another court of competent jurisdiction in previousproceedings in which the intending plaintiff had a full opportunity of contesting the decision in the court by which it was made(<strong>Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 529 (HL)</a>, at 541B-C (Lord Diplock)). It would be:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"a scandal to the administration of justice if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be permittedby changing the form of the proceedings to set up the same case again"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(Lord Diplock in <strong>Hunter</strong> at 542C-D quoting Lord Halsbury LC in <strong>Reichel v Macgrath</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20AC%20665" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 14 App Cas 665</a>, at 668). Such abuse may exist where, an issue having been resolved in an earlier action between the intending plaintiff againstone party, the intending plaintiff seeks to raise the same issue in a later action against another party. See, for example, <strong>Cosby v Government of the USA</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%203%20HKC%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 3 HKC 688 (Stock</a> J), at 695I-696G. Where there is such abuse it is the Court's duty (as opposed to discretion) to prevent the same (<strong>Hunter</strong> at 536D; cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <strong>Tsang Chin Keung v Employees Compensation Assistance Fund Board</strong> (No. 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKC%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKC 499</a>, at 510H-I (Rogers VP)).</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Mr Wong raised the issue of fraud in the taxation hearing of the 2000 Action. The issue of fraud was raised for the purpose of enablingMr Wong to persuade the Court to disallow Mr Thomas' costs. The Master squarely rejected Mr Wong's allegations of Mr Thomas' fraudin the 2000 Action.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> It is apparent that the crux of the SOC and AMSOC are the allegations that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Mr Thomas deliberately misled the Master about Mr Fang's status; and,</p>        <p>(2) the presentation by Mr Thomas and Herbert Smith of an amended bill of costs constituted a fraudulent act and a conspiracy to defraud.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Unless Mr Wong can establish these allegations, his claims in SOC and AMSOC stand no prospect of success.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> But these allegations are precisely those which Mr Wong exhaustively canvassed (including in cross-examination of Mr Thomas) beforethe Master and on which the Master conclusively and finally held against Mr Wong. It follows that Mr Wong's attempt to ventilatethe same issues of alleged fraud in this action against Mr Thomas and Herbert Smith is precisely the abuse of collateral attack whichLord Diplock described as "scandalous" in <strong>Hunter</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> On this ground alone, I would strike out the SOC and disallow the AMSOC.</p>    <p class="heading">Want of particularity</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Fraud cannot be lightly alleged. Allegations of fraud must be pleaded distinctly and with the utmost particularity (<strong>ADS v Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20HKC%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 HKC 264</a>, at 270B-C, Bokhary JA).</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Mr Shieh SC for the Defendants complains that no particulars of knowledge are averred in relation to the accusation in SOC Â§3 thatMr Thomas "deliberately made a misleading lie to the Court". The same, Mr Shieh says, applies to the plea of "persistent fraudulenttreatment" in SOC Â§7.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr Shieh acknowledges in his Skeleton Â§9 that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is sometimes an answer to an objection to a pleading that the omission can be cured by supplying Further and Better Particulars,or amending the Statement of Claim."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However, he submits that "no possible amendment or Further and Better Particulars could have been formulated to cure the pleading"here. This is because the claim is "a tissue of improbabilities, which ought not to be sent to proof" (see <strong>OTB v Coopers &amp; Lybrand</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20HKLR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 HKLR 568).</a></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> I accept that logical gaps exist in the SOC.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> For instance, SOC Â§7 purports to infer "a persistent fraudulent practice" by both Defendants from the mere fact that there are obviouslydifferences between the original and amended bill of costs. The supposed conclusion can hardly follow from that bare premise.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> AMSOC, which attempts to make good deficiencies in SOC, likewise displays flaws of logic. It does not remedy the flaws in the SOC.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Consider AMSOC Â§Â§3. The phrase "deliberately made a misleading lie" in SOC Â§3 is revised in AMSOC Â§3 to the expression "madea positive false statement of fact" (which seems to me to mean the same thing). But in new AMSOC Â§4 particulars of Mr Thomas' dishonestbelief are proffered. These invite the Court to infer dishonest knowledge from the fact that Mr Fang worked under Mr Thomas; thefact that Mr Fang was described in the original bill of costs as an Australian lawyer; the fact that <em>The</em> <strong>"Magway"</strong> cited by Mr Thomas to Master Au-yeung concerned someone who was a registered foreign lawyer; and the fact that Mr Fang was not registeredas a foreign lawyer in the Law Society's list and Herbert Smith's letterhead. Such facts are too slim a basis on which to draw sucha momentous conclusion. Even if all the particulars averred in AMSOC Â§4 were made out, it would be a presumptuous Court that inferreddishonesty from such matters. The particulars alleged are insufficient to support the allegation sought to be made.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Consider AMSOC Â§6 where a tort of conspiracy is pleaded and purported particulars given. These particulars invite the Court to infera conspiracy essentially from the mere fact that there are discrepancies between the original and amended bill of costs. Again evenif the particulars were established a Court could not infer the desired conclusion, the existence of a conspiracy, from such mattersalone.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Examine the tort of conspiracy more technically. There are broadly 2 types of conspiracy:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) conspiracy to commit an act which is itself unlawful with an intention (but not necessarily the predominant purpose) to injurethe plaintiff; and,</p>        <p>(2) conspiracy to do an act which is not otherwise unlawful, but with the predominant purpose to injure the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> It is unclear from SOC and AMSOC whether Mr Wong is alleging one or other or both types of conspiracy. If Mr Wong is alleging the1st type, the only unlawful act that could be relevant would be the alleged fraud by Mr Thomas. Master Au-yeung has ruled againstthat. In fact, during submission Mr Wong appeared to suggest that his case was of the 2nd type. If so, he has failed to plead anyparticulars to support the existence of a predominant purpose to injure.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Mr Wong argues that the alleged particulars are the best that he can do on the material available. That may or may not be the case.I agree with Mr Shieh that the Court must judge purported pleadings of fraud as they stand before the Court. If a claim of fraudis not made out to the requisite degree of rigorous particularity, it cannot be allowed to stand in the hope that later developmentswill allow the intending plaintiff to "flesh out" his deficient case.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> I also accept Mr Shieh's contention that in any event no amount of further and better particulars or amendments could improve MrWong's case. No amount of particulars can cure the defects in the SOC and AMSOC because a court of competent jurisdiction has alreadyfound against Mr Wong on the essential premise underlying his allegations of fraud and conspiracy, namely, Mr Thomas' supposed deliberatelymisleading lies in respect of Mr Fang and the time spent by Mr Thomas on the 2000 Action.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Mr Wong argues that because the review has not come to any conclusion, Master Au-yeung's conclusion on the issue of fraud is notfinal. I disagree. The finality of Master Wong's finding is reflected in her sealed Order dated 10th June 2003 which recites: "ANDIT HAVING BEEN FOUND that Mr Gareth Huw Thomas did not deliberately lie to or mislead the Court, in the manner alleged by the Plaintiffor at all". This is not an interlocutory conclusion but a final one on the merits. It is impermissible for Mr Wong to plead as ifMaster Au-yeung had made no finding adverse to the heart of his case in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In summary, I conclude that Mr Shieh's ground of want of particularity is a consequence and refinement upon the collateral attackground discussed above. SOC and AMSOC are deficient as pleading. They cannot be improved given Master Au-yeung's final conclusionon the issue of fraud.</p>    <p class="heading">No loss</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Mr Shieh points out (and I understood Mr Wong to accept) that, to make out a cause of action, Mr Wong must establish that he hassuffered loss. Since Master Au-yeung has not come to any conclusion on the review of her original taxation, it is possible (Mr Shiehsays) that Mr Wong may persuade the Master that, Mr Fang not being a Registered Foreign Lawyer, his work should only be allowed ata significantly lower rate.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> While I acknowledge that there is some force in Mr Shieh's argument, it seems to me that this ground is again simply a refinementof the collateral attack ground.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> AMSOC alleges that to deal Mr Thomas' alleged lies Mr Wong has had to spend long hours of work analysing the bill of costs and hashad to turn away work from clients as a result. Mr Wong's case in AMSOC is thus that he has already incurred loss. But, as Mr Shiehargues elsewhere in his Skeleton, the damages pleaded in AMSOC only have to be considered if the Court does not strike out the pleaof fraud. If the plea of fraud is bad in consequence of Master Au-yeung's finding (as I have concluded), the damages claim (whetheror not canvassed before Master Au-yeung) which is said to flow from the fraud must go as well.</p>    <p class="heading">Miscellaneous contentions</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Mr Wong submitted that pleadings should be struck out and amendments disallowed only in plain and obvious cases. The principle isunobjectionable. But, in my view, for the reasons that I have given, this is a plain and obvious case where SOC and AMSOC are obviouslybad and impossible of cure.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> I note finally that Mr Wong invited me to infer from unrelated cases in which Herbert Smith has been involved that the Defendantshave a "propensity" to act fraudulently so as to injure small solicitors' firms such as his own. In my opinion, Mr Wong's suggestionis unwarranted and unjustified. In particular, I record here that Mr Wong's suggestion of a supposed "propensity" for fraud is inconsistentwith the fact that it was Mr Thomas and Herbert Smith which of their own motion pointed out that there had been errors in the originalbill of costs and in Mr Thomas' description of Mr Fang.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> For the above reasons, I disallow the amendments to the SOC, strike out the SOC and dismiss Mr Wong's action.
