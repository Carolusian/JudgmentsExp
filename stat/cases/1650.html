However, upon production by the purportedagent of a letter purporting to have been written by the respondent approving of the sale and upon guarantees being signed by certainpersons, he paid over the remainder of the purchase money. The letter was also a forgery. The appellant entered into possession andduring the remainder of the Japanese occupation and thereafter he expended substantial sums in repairs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In December 1945, the respondent first heard of the forgery and in January, 1946, he returned to Hong Kong for the first time sincehis departure about October, 1941. He remained in Hong Kong only for a few days before returning to China and during those few dayshe consulted a solicitor and was advised that, as the civil courts had not yet been reinstituted in Hong Kong, there was no effectivelegal step he could take at that time to regain possession of his property. He left instructions that steps were to be taken as soonas possible, and in fact this action was commenced as No.1 of 1946, as soon as the civil administration was restored in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> On the 25th April, 1946, the appellant caused to be sent to the solicitors in the Colony a circular letter of enquiry in the followingterms:</p>    <p align="left" class="quote">          " Dear Sirs,</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="40%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="54%" class="quote">Re I.L. 609 C Sec.

It was held as a fact, however, by the learned ChiefJustice upon the evidence that the respondent did not at any time have knowledge that money was being so expended by the appellant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> During the period January to April, 1946, by virtue of the provisions of the British Military Administration Proclamation No. 6 asmodified by an Order dated the 20th day of December, 1945, the property could not be assigned without a special Order by the ChiefCivil Affairs Officer, but it could have been let for a term not exceeding one year or been made the subject of a lien or equitablemortgage with the approval of the Finance Controller. The existence of this Proclamation was mentioned to the respondent by his solicitorin January, 1946.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> A further fact of some importance was that the appellant had no knowledge that the respondent became aware of the forgery in December,1945, or returned to the Colony for a few days in January, 1946.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Only one ground of appeal was relied upon - namely, that the trial judge was wrong in deciding that the respondent was not estoppedfrom setting up his title to the property by reason of his failure to notify the appellant of the forgery as soon as he became awareof the defect in appellant's title. This allegation though set out in the Pleadings as finally amended was not in fact relied uponby counsel for the appellant at the hearing as he took the view that the learned Chief Justice was bound by the decision in the caseof Chan Fui Hing and others v. Fung Kai Sun, O.J. Action No.92 of 1939, decided in the Supreme Court of Hong Kong in December, 1940.This is clearly a mistaken view as every case of alleged estoppel must be decided upon the particular facts. However, the point hasbeen fully argued before this Court and it is expedient that a decision be given upon the merits.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The submission for the appellant reduced to simple terms is that if B. has a document bearing the purported signature of A. and ifA. knows that fact and further that B. is relying on that document, then it is A.'s duty to inform B. forthwith of his mistake. Ifthe delays and B. is prejudiced an estoppel arises and B. receives the full benefit of the estoppel irrespective of whether the wholeor only a part of the loss is due to A.'s failure to disclose. As to the existence of a duty to speak in such circumstances counselrelied on the following passage in volume 13 of Hailsham on page 496: "A duty to speak arises whenever a person knows that anotheris acting on an erroneous assumption of some authority given or liability undertaken by the former, or is dealing with or acquiringan interest in property in ignorance of his title to it. It is the duty of a man whe knows that another is relying on a documentbearing a counterfeit of his signature to give notice of the forgery without delay."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The authorities quoted for the second part of this proposition include M'Kenzie v.

Objection to thissubmission was taken by counsel for respondent (plaintiff) on the ground that this had not been pleaded which submission was upheldby the learned trial judge. This point was not taken on appeal and no arguments on it were, therefore, addressed to this Court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Regarding the above-mentioned cases in Halsbury on which appellant relies for estoppel, the facts in Greenwood v. Martin's Bank Ltd. <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1933%20AC%2051" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1933 A.C. 51</a> were that a husband and wife who had a joint account with the bankers who undertook to honour cheques signed by both customers. Thataccount was afterwards closed and one was opened in the sole name of the husband, the wife having no authority to draw on it. Duringthe currency of both accounts, the wife repeatedly forged the husband's signature to cheques, and drew out money which she appliedto her own use. During the currency of the sole account, the husband became aware of the forgeries but, being persuaded by his wifeto say nothing about them, he kept silent for eight months. When he finally determined to disclose the forgeries to the bank, thewife committed suicide. In an action by the husband to recover the sums paid out of the sole account on cheques to which his signaturehad been forged, it was held that the plaintiff owed a duty to the bank to disclose the forgeries when he became aware of them andso enable the defendants to take steps towards recovering the money wrongfully paid on the forged cheques: that through his failureto fulfill this duty they were prevented from bringing an action against the plaintiff and his wife for the tort committed by thewife, until after her death, when any action against the husband abated: therefore the plaintiff was estopped from asserting thatthe signature to the cheques were forgeries and was not entitled to recover.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The essential factors giving rise to estoppel were there enumerated as follows:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="2%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">1.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%">A representation or conduct amounting to a representation intended to induct a course of conduct on the part of the person to whomthe representation was made.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="2%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">2.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%">An act or omission resulting from the representation, whether actual or by conduct, by the person to whom the representation was made.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="2%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">3.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="94%">Detriment to such person as a consequence of the act or omission.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Mere silence could only amount to a representation where there was a duty to disclose and such a duty on the part of a customer ofa bank to disclose to the bank his knowledge of the forgery in this case was held to exist.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> This case, clearly differs from the present case in essential features. Firstly, the duty to disclose was a duty arising from theintimate relationship between the customer of a bank and a bank. Green L.J. in the Court of Appeal stated he could not conceive astronger case for saying there was a duty required of the customer by 'the rules of fair dealing between man and man' to inform theBank of the existence of the forged cheques when he knew that the Bank were relying on the validity of the forged cheques. The caseis no authority for the proposition that a duty to disclose arises in cases where there is no close relationship such as existedhere between the customer and the Bank. In the present case, there was no such intimate relationship between appellant and respondent:they were complete strangers to each other. Secondly, in the bank case the omission to speak was intended to induce a course of conducton the part of the Bank, namely to refrain from taking action. Here the omission to speak was not so intended, for respondent wasnever aware that appellant was in fact expending any money on the property: his omission to speak was not, therefore, done with theintention that appellant should spend money on the property. Thirdly, the omission to speak on the part of the plaintiff in the Bankcase resulted in the loss to the bank but in the present case the loss incurred by the appellant in his expenditure was not, at anyrate, initially due to respondent's silence, for appellant had commenced his repairs to the house shortly after the purchase andcontinued to expend money thereon for a considerable period before respondent ever became aware of the forgery.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In the case of Ogilvie v. West Australian Mortgage and Agency Corporation (1896) A.C.257, the customer of the bank was not estoppedfrom complaining of the payment of the forged cheques for the reason that he had kept silence by the request of the accredited agentof the bank. Had he, being in exclusive knowledge of the forgery, withheld that knowledge from the bank until its chances of recoveryfrom the forger had been materially prejudiced, it is clear that he would have been held estopped. In this case again the principlethat the customer of a bank owes a duty to the bank to disclose is clearly admitted.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The case on which perhaps most reliance can be placed by the appellant is <u>McKenzie v. The British Linen Co. 1881 6 A.C.82.</u> There the respondent company were the holders of a bill accepted by one Fraser, and purporting to have been drawn and indorsed tothem by the appellant and another. The appellant's signature, as drawer and indorser, had been forged. The company gave the appellantnotice on the 14th July, 1897, that the bill would fall due on the 17th, on which date it was dishonoured. Notice of that dishonourwas duly given to the appellant on the next day by the company, followed by threats of proceedings on the 21st, and 25th July. Onthe 29th the appellant notified the respondents that his signature had been forged. It was not suggested that the company's positionhad been altered for the worse between the 14th and the 29th July. The House, reversing the Court of Session in Scotland, held thatthe appellant was in no way estopped.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The main ground of the decision was that the respondents had not altered their position to their prejudice by reason of any omissionof duty on the part of the appellant: It is clear, however, that Lord Blackburn at pp.100 &amp; 101, held the view that there wasno legal duty, as distinct from a moral duty, on the part of the appellant to inform the respondents and, therefore, no such representation,by the omission of it. He expressly stated that he was not prepared to accept the following view of Lord Deas (who had held in thelower Court in favour of the respondents) - a proposition not unlike that put forward by counsel for appellant here:</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> 'In cases of this kind where he has peculiar means of knowledge whether his signature is forged or not, he is not entitled by sayingor doing something, or <u>not saying or doing something</u>, to lead his neighbours to think that his signature is genuine to his neighbour's loss.' Lord Blackburn based his decision that therewas an estoppal on the principles laid down in Packard v. Sears (6 Adolphus &amp; Ellis p.474) as explained by Baron Parke in <u>Freeman v. Cook</u> 2 Ex.654. The following words of Baron Parke are relevant :-</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> 'And conduct by negligence or omission where there is a duty cast upon a person, by usage of trade or otherwise, to disclose thetruth, may often have the same effect' (i.e. may have the effect of creating an estoppel). As for instance, a retiring partner omittingto inform his customers of the fact, in the usual mode, that the continuing partners were no longer authorized to act as his agents,is bound by all the contracts made by them with third parties on the faith of their being so authorized.'</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> As to the cases, therefore, on which appellant relies the duty to disclose as between a customer and the Bank is clearly admitted.Nothing is contained in the cases which would justify a Court in extending the duty to such cases, as the present where no relationshiphas previously existed. In the Mokenzie case, though the judgment proceeded on a different basis, yet Lord Blackburn was not preparedto accept the wider proposition of Lord Deas that a duty not to keep silence exists in cases where the facts were similar to thatcase. Lord Blackburn agrees with Baron Parke that the duty must be one existing by usage of trade or otherwise. By the words "orotherwise" it is clear that some limitation must exist. I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that these bank cases are not anauthority for the appellant's contention that there was here any legal duty on the respondent to disclose the forgery.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Even assuming, however, that there was a legal duty and not merely a moral or social duty on the respondent to disclose the forgeryto the appellant, before the appellant can succeed, the other conditions necessary to create a valid estoppel must be present. Ashas already been pointed out, a necessary ingredient is that the person omitting to speak must do so with the intention of inducinga course of conduct on the part of the other person or with knowledge that the other person was pursuing a certain course of action.In the present case, respondent's omission to inform the appellant was not because he desired appellant to continue with the reconstructionof the property for he was unaware that any such work was being carried out, but because he believed that any protest he made toappellant was unlikely to succeed in persuading appellant to give up the property. Respondent had taken all possible legal action.He had consulted his solicitors who would have issued a writ forthwith had it not happened that at the time the civil courts werenot functioning.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Counsel for appellant also placed reliance on the case of <u>Ramsden v. Dyson</u> (1866) 1 English &amp; Irish Reports 129, particularly on the following passage from the judgment of Lord Cranworth (p.140).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> 'If a stranger begins to build on my land supposing it to be his own, and I, perceiving his mistake, abstain from setting him right,and leave him to persevere in his error, a Court of Equity will not allow me afterwards to assert my title to the land on which hehas expended money on the supposition that the land was his own. It considers that, when I saw the mistake into which he had fallen,it was my duty to be active and to state my adverse title: and that it would be dishonest in me to remain wilfully passive on suchan occasion, in order to profit by the mistake which I might have prevented.'</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The difference between that case and the present is however quite clear. In that case the landlord is aware of the expenditure andyet refrains from action in order that he may later profit by the mistake. In the present case, there was no knowledge on respondent'spart that appellant was expending any money on the property in dispute.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I am, therefore, of opinion that the contention of appellant that by reason of respondent's failure to notify him of the forgeryduring the months January to April, 1946, respondent is estopped from denying his title to the property is unsound in law.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The appeal is therefore dismissed and the decision of the learned trial judge upheld, with costs to the respondent.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">Sd.
