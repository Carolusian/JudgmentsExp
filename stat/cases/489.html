Two of the defendants have admitted full liability including taxed costs. What remains to be resolved is the extent to whichthey can look to the other defendants for a contribution to that.</p>    <p class="heading">The Background</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The third defendant is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fourth defendant. In February 1997 the fourth defendant purchased all theunits on the 21st floor of Seapower Tower, Concordia Plaza, 1, Science Museum Road, Kowloon. The purpose was to provide premisesto be occupied by the third defendant. But first the units had to be altered and redecorated. The first step in that process wasto demolish all the internal partitioning. To that end the third defendant invited the second defendant to quote to carry out thedemolition work, including the cost of third party insurance. The quote was accepted. I reproduce the English translation of thatas follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Evertech Company Limited</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Marco Polo Mansion, 10, Cleveland Street, Causeway Bay,</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Hong Kong.

Thewater permeated through the floors below entering the premises occupied by the plaintiff on the 18th floor of the building, therecausing damage to computers and other office machinery, wall coverings and carpets.

It claimed the fourth defendant was in breach of clauses 6 and7 of the DMC, which I reproduce below:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"6. To be responsible for and indemnify the Registered Owner, the Manager and all other Owners and occupiers against all actions,proceedings, claims and demands whatsoever arising out of or in respect of any loss or damage to any person or property caused byor as the result of the act or negligence of any occupier of any part of any floor, Unit, Shop, Office or Garage of which he is theOwner or any person using such premises (excluding passengers and users of the Public Transport Terminus) with his consent expressor implied or by, or through, or in any way owing to the overflow of water therefrom.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">7.

In the case of loss or damage which the Manager is responsible to make good or repair, such costs, charges andexpenses shall be recoverable by the Manager as hereinbefore provided and in the case of loss or damage suffered by other Ownersor occupiers of the Building for which the Manager is not responsible to repair or make good, such costs, charges and expenses togetherwith all other damages recoverable by law shall be recoverable by the person or persons sustaining the loss or damage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It sued the third defendant because it was the party in occupation and responsible for engaging the contractors to carry out thedemolition work thereby making it vicariously liable for the negligence of the contractor.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The second defendant was joined as the contractors engaged by the third defendant to carry out the demolition work.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The first defendant was made a party because the second defendant claimed to have sub-contracted the work to him.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The first defendant took no steps, and judgment by default was entered against him on 10 December 1998. As I understand, no formalsteps have been taken to enforce that judgment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The third and fourth defendants, acting in concert, have admitted full liability to the plaintiff. The third defendant concedes thatit contracted with the second defendant to carry out the demolition work and that the pipe was damaged and burst during the negligentperformance of that work. And the fourth defendant accepts that it is caught by the strict liability imposed by clauses 6 and 7 ofthe DMC. As a result the third and fourth defendants have paid into court a total of $390,133.52 which represents the amount suedfor and interest from the date of the incident. In addition they accept liability for all the plaintiff's taxed costs. The plaintiffhas accepted such payment in full settlement of its claim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Having filed contribution notices against the first and second defendants, the third and fourth defendants now seek to recover thewhole or part of that outlay from them.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> This, then, is the issue I am now required to resolve.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> What is not challenged is that the damage to the pipe and consequent loss caused by its bursting was the result of an act of negligenceon the part of the workman responsible. What is not challenged is the quantum of the plaintiff's loss. What I have to decide is whoor what entity was responsible for the acts of that workman and thus is liable in whole or in part for that loss.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> For the answer to that I look to the evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">The Evidence</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> By all accounts the second defendant purported to arrange public liability insurance in terms of its contract with the third defendant.But the insurer engaged has refused liability and the second defendant has issued proceedings against the insurer and the brokerwhich arranged the cover. I have not been told the current status of those proceedings. But it is pertinent to reproduce clauses10 and 11 of the statement of claim, in which the second defendant herein is referred to as the plaintiff:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"10. On or about 20 April 1997, an accident occurred at the premises whereby a worker carrying out the demolition work negligentlycaused a water pipe to burst ("the accident"), substantial damage was caused to the neighbourhood premises.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">11. Being the main contractor of the demolition work, and according to the contract for the demolition work, the Plaintiff is legallyliable for the damages done."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I should at this point mention that the second defendant filed in these proceedings a statement of defence denying liability; itpleaded that the demolition work was carried out by the first defendant and that it was he, or one of his employees, who was negligentand caused the damage. But before the trial got underway Mr Chan for the second defendant told me that his client did not wish toparticipate in the trial and would abide by any order that I made. He then asked for and was granted leave to withdraw. AccordinglyI have had no evidence from the second defendant to substantiate its pleaded case.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> I turn now to the first defendant. He was unrepresented. Although he had not taken any prior steps and in particular had not fileda defence or a witness statement I gave him leave to give evidence from the witness box. It was to be a revealing account.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> He said that for the last ten years or so he has been a casual construction site worker, engaged by telephone call to undertake labouringwork as and when it becomes available. One of those who hired him from time to time was a Miss Lam of a contractor he knew as YuenYing Company Limited, the Chinese name for the second defendant. When she telephoned it would be to tell him that work was availableat a designated site and he would attend on a daily basis until the work was complete, and for which he would be paid, in commonwith all other casual workers, $800 per day. So it was that in April 1997 he was telephoned by Miss Lam and told to meet her thenext day at the 21st floor of Seapower Tower. There, along with other casual workers, he was hired in the usual way, on this occasionto carry out demolition work and the removal of waste material, under Miss Lam's instruction and supervision. The work proceededuneventfully for about ten days. During that time he was paid every two or three days, at the going daily rate. Then another workman,not being him but similarly employed, carelessly damaged the pipe and caused the flooding. He said he was not then and has neverbeen a sub-contractor. At all times and in particular on this occasion he was working for wages as a casual construction site labourer.He owns no equipment, hires no work force, receives no contract sum.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> When asked why he had taken no steps in the proceedings he said that he had not been served with or known about the plaintiff's writand that was why he had not filed a defence or a witness statement. He did not know that judgment had been entered against him. Hepointed out that his address is different from that recorded in the writ. The first indication he had that there was a suit was asolicitor's letter telling him about the judgment. He took it to the offices of Legal Aid, but was told they could not assist.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings of Fact</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Crucial to the issue of liability is as to whether the second defendant sub-contracted the demolition work to the first defendantthe burden being on it to establish that. In that respect I have no hesitation in finding that it did not. The first defendant satisfiedme that he was a witness of the truth and was no more or less than a worker casually employed to carry out the necessary work inconcert with others similarly engaged. And it was telling that having pleaded a contrary position the second defendant took no stepsto support that in evidence.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Beyond question, I am satisfied that it was the second defendant which as contractor was solely responsible for the demolition work,and that it was its employee who, in the performance of his work, negligently damaged and caused to burst the water pipe which floodedthe premises of the plaintiff below.</p>    <p class="heading">The Outcome</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The second defendant is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of its employee and solely to blame for the damage he caused. AccordinglyI find the second defendant liable to contribute 100% of the payment, including taxed costs, the third and fourth defendants haveagreed to pay the plaintiff in settlement of its claim. The costs of the third and fourth defendants taxed if not agreed shall alsobe met by the second defendant. This order as to costs shall be nisi at first instance.</p>    <p class="heading">Footnote</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I having found the first defendant to be blameless he would be well advised to protect his position by making application to havethe judgment of 10 December 1998 against him set aside.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(D M B Gill)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Deputy High Court Judge</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">The first defendant in person</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Richard Chan, instructed by Messrs Ellen Au &amp; Co., for the second defendant</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Keith Yeung, instructed by Messrs Philip T F Wong &amp; Co., for the third and fourth defendants</p>        <p align="justify"> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2000/1093.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
