It is pleadedin para. 16 of the statement of claim that in or about 1990 without the consent or approval of the plaintiffs, the defendants beganto grow plants and trees in the portion of land coloured pink and depicted as ABCDEFGHI on the plan annexed to the statement of claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The defendants admit that they have been trespassers but their case is that their trespass took place from 1974.  They plead in para.11 of the defence and counterclaim that without the prior consent or approval and intentionally to the exclusion of any person includingthe plaintiffs, they in 1974 began to grow plants and trees in the area coloured pink in the Plan III annexed to the defence andcounterclaim which was extended in or about 1997 to the areas as depicted as ABCKJ on the plan referred to in the statement of claim. The defendants also aver that in 1974 they built certain wire fence and gate around the area coloured pink in the Plan III annexedto the defence and counterclaim which in 1977 was extended to the area as depicted as ABCKJ in the plan referred to in the statementof claim. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> There is no dispute that the only defence relied on by the defendants is that the plaintiffsâ claim is statute-barred by reasonof adverse possession on the part of the defendants and the counterclaim for the declaratory relief is on the same basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> In view of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Chan Tin Shi v. Li Tin Sung &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%201%20HKC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 1 HKC 1</a>, the defence and counterclaim is unsustainable and bound to fail.  It was decided by the Court of Appeal that the effect of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Leases (Extension) Ordinance</a></i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150">Cap. 150</a> was to create a new estate.  That being so, the fact that a squatterâs right may have been acquired would not affectthe new lease which took effect either on the coming into operation of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Leases (Extension) Ordinance</a></i> or upon expiry of the old lease in June 1997.  That decision is really determinative of this action.  Even assuming that the factsas asserted by the defendants are established, the defendants have no sustainable defence and counterclaim on the law as presentlydetermined by the Court of Appeal in <i>Chan Tin Shi</i>. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> However, <i>Chan Tin Shi</i> is a decision that will be determined by the Court of Final Appeal.  I am told that the matter has been set down for hearing in Novemberthis year.  The question to be determined by the Court of Final Appeal is one of great general and public importance. <i> </i>The question formulated by the Court of Appeal in their judgment dated 27 January 2005 in <i>Chan Tin Shi</i> is as follows :</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%">			<tr>				<td align="left" width="95%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="3">âWhether the effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Leases (Extension) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150">Cap. 150</a> was to create a new estate in respect of government leases (save those excepted or excluded under that Ordinance), so thatany person in adverse possession of the land cannot rely under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a> on possession prior to :</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>				<td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">25 April 				1988; or</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>				<td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote">30 June 				1997,</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="5%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="87%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td align="left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="92%" align="left" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">those being alternate dates which might possibly be argued as being relevant.â</td>			</tr>		</table>	</blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Ngai submitted that the court should adjourn the plaintiffsâ summons to strike out the defence and counterclaim pending theoutcome of the Court of Final Appealâs decision in <i>Chan Tin Shi</i>. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Mr. Ngai also relied on the decision in <i>Derby &amp; Co Ltd v. Weldon (No. 3)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%203%20All%20ER%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 3 All ER 118</a> for the proposition that the court in exercising its discretion whether to strike out the claim is not bound to apply the law asso stated by the Court of Appeal and is entitled to take into account the possibility that the decision may be reversed.  That case,however, provides, in my view, no assistance to the defendants and is clearly distinguishable.  It is clear from the judgment ofVinelott J at page 127 that amendments would be made to the statement of claim by adding additional and overlapping claims to theclaim for the tort of conspiracy.  The striking out and deletion of the conspiracy claim would not significantly alter the courseof the trial as the same or substantially the same facts would have to be investigated in relation to the other heads of claims. In those circumstances, it is not surprising that Vinelott J decided not to strike out the claim for conspiracy.  That is of noassistance to the defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I accept that I have discretion in the matter as to whether to adjourn the plaintiffsâ application or to deal with it now.  AsI mentioned at the start, this is the adjourned pre-trial review.  The trial has been set down for hearing in July.  The appeal tothe Court of Final Appeal will not be heard until November.  There is a possibility that the Court of Final Appeal will reverse thedecision of the Court of Appeal.  There is also a possibility that the Court of Final Appeal will uphold the decision of the Courtof Appeal.  In that event, if the matter is adjourned it seems to me that the plaintiffs would be unduly prejudiced.  Not only willthey have to await the outcome of the decision in <i>Chan Tin Shi</i> but if the Court of Final Appeal did uphold the decision of the Court of Appeal, they may have to wait many months thereafter toobtain a hearing of their application.  That delay, in my view, would be unduly prejudicial to the plaintiffs.  They are entitled,in my view, to have the matter determined on the law as it presently stands.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In <i>Hong Kong Ferry (Holdings) Co Ltd v. Chan Kwan Fat &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20HKC%20542" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 HKC 542</a>, the Court of Appeal was dealing with the situation where there was a pending appeal to the Privy Council on the effect of the <i>New Territories (Renewable Crown Leases) Ordinance</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/152">Cap. 152</a>.  The court there held that since there was a pending application for leave to the Privy Council, the correct course wasto dismiss the appeal that they were dealing with but to stay execution of the order made below until after the determination ofthe application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council and further staying such execution, if that application was successful,until after the determination of the appeal to the Privy Council in that case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> That course was also adopted by Le Pichon J (as she then was) in <i>Kung Wong Sau Hin &amp; Anor v. Sze To Chun Keung &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20HKC%20616" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 HKC 616</a> where she was also dealing with the effect of the <i>New Territories (Renewable Crown Leases) Ordinance</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/152">Cap. 152</a>.  She was dealing with an application to strike out the defence which she struck out as the defence was bound to fail onthe law then in force.  However, she also ordered that the execution of the order for possession should be stayed until after thedetermination of the appeal in the Privy Council case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> More recently in <i>Hong Kong Kam Lan Koon Limited v. Realray Investment Limited</i>, HCA 15824 of 1999, by his ruling dated 30 March 2005 Lam J also refused an adjournment pending appeal to the Court of Final Appealin <i>Chan Tin Shi</i> and dealt with the O.14A application before him and ordered a stay of execution. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> As I have said, there is a possibility that the Court of Final Appeal may reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal.  I am satisfiedthat I should not make an order at this stage which may prejudice the position of the defendants should that event occur.  Nevertheless,it seems to me that I ought to deal with the application to strike out and not adjourn the summons because the plaintiffs are entitledto have the matter determined on the law as it presently stands.  It seems to me that the prejudice to the plaintiffs far outweighsthe prejudice to the defendants if the matter were adjourned.  It seems to me that in the interests of justice the matter ought tobe dealt with by my dealing with the application to strike out.  There really is no answer to the summons to strike out, so I willstrike out the defence and counterclaim and give judgment to the plaintiffs but it seems to me to be right to grant a stay of executionto the defendants so that their position is not prejudiced in the event the Court of Final Appeal reverses the decision of the Courtof Appeal.  That is the order I make and I will hear the parties on the formal order that I should make.</p>	<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>	<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Arjan H.
