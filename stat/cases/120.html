For other partitions and decorations materialcan be used from our old factory, but any insufficient material should be borne by the contractor".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The Quotation went into detail as to that which was to be dismantled and reused. Apart from various wooden and glass fixtures thereis specific reference to a "Wire mesh partition" - and it is with the dismantling of this that we are concerned.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The defendant firm employs no workers of its own and therefore engages persons to do the work for it.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Here they employed some person in respect of the dismantling of the wooden and glass fixtures and one Wong Gow (or Kau), tradingas Luen Hing Metal Factory, to dismantle the wire mesh partition and, presumably the wire mesh door also referred to in the contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> A third party notice was issued in respect of Wong Gow but he cannot be traced and, while he appears in the title to the action asa Third Party, he has not been before me.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In the course of the dismantling work done by him he made use of that which has been described as Electrical Welding Equipment ("theequipment") to cut some of the metal. The use of the equipment caused sparks to fly out and some landed on foam rubber lying nearby and caused a fire. The fire spread rapidly to the various combustibles stored in Flat C of the premises and caused the contentsof Flat C to be either distroyed or badly damaged.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiff is now in liquidation and the Official Receivers consent to this action has been exhibited in the Agreed Bundle II.This is a form of surrogate action in so far as the plaintiff has been paid a sum by its insurance company who, through the plaintiff,seek to recover that sum from the defendant firm as a result of that which they say is that firm's negligence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I am not concerned with quantum as it has been agreed, should I fix liability upon the defendants, that the assessment of damages,which necessitates the scrutiny of a large volume of documents, be adjourned to the Registrar.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> It is common case that Wong Gow was an independent contractor. I have before me in the Agreed Bundle II and under the provisionsof the Evidence (Hearsay) Rules, a statement which he made about the 13th September 1977 to Charles Wong Hau of Toplis &amp; Harding(H.K.) Ltd, insurance adjustors, who were preparing a report on the fire on behalf of Commercial Union Assurance Co. Ltd.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> In that he refers to the "pulling down" of the metal works in question: of "pulling down" an iron shelf approximately 30 feet inlength attached to a "metal net" : of there being colour boxes delivered by a paper factory piled seven to eight feet high on theother side of the "iron net" and that in their vicinity were two rolled up sheets of foam rubber at a distance of about 4 feet fromthe "iron net".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> He goes on "while I was cutting the metal shelf with an electrical welding apparatus sparks fell onto the ground of the godown andsplit, some of them bounced onto the foam rubber which were subsequently ignited".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> He then refers to the unavailing efforts to put out the resulting fire before the Fire Brigade arrived. The fire raged for abouttwo hours.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The wire mesh partition consisted of sections of wire mesh spot welded at intervals of six to eight inches to milled steel angleirons. This in sections of about three feet by two feet with the angle irons running from floor to ceiling and across the lengthof the partition. What remained of the metal shelf was stretched across the wire mesh about two thirds of the way up the partitionnear the airconditioning duct. The agreed photo I shows this on the left side of that photograph.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr Leung (2PW), who described himself as the person who runs the plaintiff company, tells me that there were identical partitionin Flat A and Flat C each about thirty-five feet long - the contract described them generally as seventy feet long - and that theupright angle irons were screwed into the concrete cement floor and ceiling of the premises. He thought the retaining screws to bethree fons (or 3/8 of an inch) thick. Both the mesh and the frame were in good condition.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> He describes the metal shelf as being welded to the angle iron comprising the frame of the wire partition. While no specific mentionis made of this shelf in the contract it is clear that in order to dismantle the partition the shelf would have to be removed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> He says that Mr Tsang, of the defendant firm, inspected the premises and was aware of the construction of the wire mesh partitionand of the shelf attached to it. He also says that there was no discussion as to the method to be used in dismantling. He furthersaid that Mr. Tsang visited the premises while work was in progress in Flat A from time to time. It is his evidence that the electricalwelding equipment was used to dismantle the wire mesh partition in Flat A but he does not recall whether or not Mr. Tsang's visitcoincided with its use.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> It will be remembered that other work was being carried out by another contractor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Mr. Tsang (1DW) in his evidence denies any visits to the premises other than one of inspection before the work began. He says hewas concerned with the decoration of the new premises where he did spend time and not the dismantling of the old although he wasaware that material in the old, including the wire mesh partition, was to be reused in the new.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Nothing, in my view, really turns on this, though a good deal of play has made of it, as there is no evidence that Mr Tsang was directlyaware of the use of electrical welding equipment in the premises. It really touches upon credibility rather than anything else.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Professor Leung, Professor of Electrical Engineering in the University of Hong Kong was called by the plaintiff and his descriptionof the electrical welding equipment is not in dispute.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> This consists of an electrical transformer with intermittent current which is plugged into the power supply. It has two cables comingfrom it - one of these ends in a clasp which is attached to the metal to be welded, the other to a welding rod.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The rod is moved towards the object to be welded and at a distance of one half to one quarter of an inch away an electrical sparkjumps between the rod and the metal. This will melt the rod, the metal or both.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> There is an electrical charge in both the rod and the metal. The spark to which he refers manifests itself in a very hot flame -over 1000<sup>o</sup> centigrade - which causes the melting to which I have referred. Effectively there is a completed electrical circuit - the spark formsa conductor : the circuit closes letting the charge run to the metal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> As the rod melts it gets shorter and is moved towards the metal dripping onto the metal. If held too far away the circuit would bebroken.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> He goes on that this equipment can also be used to cut metal. For this purpose a higher temperature is required.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The user increases the power and moves the rod further away from the object to be cut thus, by creating a greater gap, getting abigger flame. The effect would be to melt the metal to be cut which would leave an irregular finish.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The sparks resulting from either welding or cutting are caused by the metal as it melts - the higher the density of the metal thebigger the spark. There is more heat in something when it is dense.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> None of this is really controversial. What is is the Professor's evidence as to the use of such equipment for cutting in Hong Kongand, in particular, its use in this dismantling operation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> He says it is in common use in Hong Kong and here it would have been quicker than using a hacksaw. Metal which is jutting out canbe removed completely by this method, mechanical means such as a hacksaw would take a long time.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> To remove the partition in question he says that normal way would be to use such equipment. In giving those pieces of evidence hepresumes that the angle irons were embedded in concrete.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> It would be unlikely that oxy-acetylene equipment would be used in a job like this as it would require special voltage.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> He agreed in cross-examination that to remove the mesh spot welded at intervals to the angle iron a chisel would be the best method.He further agreed that it was not absolutely necessary to use this equipment for the general removal of the partition but it wouldbe more economic. He thought it would be more expensive to use hacksaw and chisel in terms of time needed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The effect of his evidence is: that to remove the mesh more likely to use a chisel; to remove the upright angle irons from the floorand ceiling more likely to use the equipment; probably use the equipment to remove the shelf running along the mesh and attachedto the angle iron.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The defendants called a Mr Sin Chun Wong (2DW) the sole proprietor of Hop Cheong Chun Kee - which carried on the business of metalworks. He had done some work in the past for the defendant and he gave evidence of the practicalities of the work method of one suchas himself or Wong Gow - engaged in the metal work trade. He has been in business for 15-16 years and, with respect to ProfessorLeung, his knowledge of what actually goes on is much nearer the ground.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> It was his evidence that the equipment is mostly used for welding and seldom for cutting. The side effect of the latter use is that"the piece of thing would be damaged".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Where upright angle irons are attached to a floor - or ceiling - by screws then, even if the screws are frozen into the cement, thebest method of removing the angle iron is to sheer off the head of the screw with a chisel or to saw the angle iron with a hacksaw.There would be no difficulty in this. He suggests that to remove an angle iron embedded in concrete then to dig up the concrete wouldbe the best method.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> It is agreed that the angle irons had to be cut into lengths which would fit in an eight foot lift so as to take them away from thepremises. Again it is his evidence that to do this a hacksaw would be the best instrument to use.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> There was produced to me an angle iron (B) and a piece of wire mesh (C) similar to the ones comprising the wire mesh partition.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> He was asked to and did, in 25 seconds, saw through the angle iron B - in court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> To use, he said, the equipment would not leave a clear cut finish and that a cutting finish out of shape could not be reused again.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Further he had dismantled partitions such as the one here on many occasions - and he had done this work for the defendants also.On no occasion did he use the equipment. But he could only cut with a hacksaw an angle iron which is upright not one lying alongand attached to the floor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> For material to be reused he would work with a hacksaw and chisel. If not for reuse then the equipment could be used.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> He accepted that amongst the tools of his trade would be the equipment, an electrical saw and oxy-acetylene equipment. Of this lasthe says that a form of licence from the supplier of cylinder is needed, also permission from the person upon whose premises it isto be used.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The tools would also include a chisel, hacksaw and a hammer. Using these implements, he estimated that the work needed in Flat Cwould take about one day. The use of the equipment would not speed this up. It would be slower he says because it would be necessaryto use the hacksaw to clean up the damaged metal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The effect of his evidence is (1) that the equipment is seldom used for cutting in Hong Kong; (2) that it is unlikely to be usedfor the dismantling of this partition the materials of which are to be reused; (3) that its use could slow down the job; (4) thata hacksaw and chisel would be the tools to use to do the work adequately.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> I accept his evidence on these points.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> I would find the evidence to show that the mesh was spot welded to the angle iron at intervals of six inches to eight inches apart;</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> : that the upright angle irons were fixed to the floor and ceiling with 3/8" screws - and that there is no evidence to show themto have 'frozen' in the concrete on that the angle irons were embedded in the concrete;</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> : that the shelf was welded to the upright angle irons at intervals where they formed the frame for the mesh.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> I note that, while both counsel canvassed widely the method used to dismantle the whole of the partition the plaintiff's pleadingsspecifically refers to the removal of the shelf - as does the statement of Wong Gow.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> I would accept that the equipment was used in Flat A.

The passage relied on reads</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There is another category when the work done is so inherently dangerous or, as it is sometimes termed, 'extra hazardous' in relationeither to those on a highway or to negligence generally, that the public interest demands absolute responsibility.

(at page 551)</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"..... the appellant (the employer) knew, and, if he did not know, should have known, what was necessary in order to do the work tohis satisfaction, and it was his business to see that the contractor knew what was required of him.

On the other hand, I thinkthat the defendant (the employer) knew - and if he did not know he should have contemplated - that there was a possibility of McLeaysetting fire to the bracken if he was required (as under the term of the contract he might be) to do the work effectively, and wasthen left to do it in his own way."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> McTiernan J. then went on to quote with approval what he terms the "Statements" of Lord Watson and Lord Fitzgerald in Hughes v.

Percival<sup>(2)</sup> was a party wall case the cutting of which had disastrous effects on an adjoining house. Lord Fitzgerald in his speech at p.452 referredto the undertaking as being perilous to the neighbours on both sides so as to render "care and precaution necessary at every stepuntil the whole of the new structure was substantially completed: or so far as least, that nothing remained to be done which couldeffect the stability of either of the party walls".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> I was also referred to one decision in these courts : Yu Yuk Fung v.

To use the electric welding equipment was unnecessary and highly dangerousin a place where combustibles were stored. In the normal course of events the task - and the method - was not extra hazardous orinherently dangerous.
