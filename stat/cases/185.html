The 1st plaintiff is a Middle School in Guangzhou and is a legal entity incorporated in the Mainland. The 2nd plaintiff is a Hong Kong entity and was incorporated in 1951.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiffs are seeking to enjoin the defendants from passing off as institutions of or associated with the plaintiffs by usingthe name âå¹æ­£â or the red and blue insignia of âå¹æ­£â.  The action has reached the stage where the parties are aboutto exchange their witness statements and expert reports.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 1st, 2nd and 4th defendants (âthe defendantsâ) have, however, issued a summons seeking to stay all further proceedings ofthe 1st plaintiffâs claim.  The application is made on the ground that the courts in Hong Kong are not the proper forum for adjudicationof the disputes between the 1st plaintiff and the defendants, and that the defendants are willing to submit the disputes with the1st plaintiff to a court of law in the Mainland, which is the proper forum.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  There is a further summons requiring the plaintiffsâ solicitors to prove authority to sue on behalf of the 1st plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">History of âå¹æ­£â (Pui Ching or Pei Zheng)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  I briefly recount below the history of a few well-known schools which have the words âå¹æ­£â (Pui Ching or Pei Zheng) as partof their names. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Chinese Baptist Academy of Canton (âå¹æ­£æ¸é¢â) (âthe Schoolâ) was founded in Guangzhou by five Chinese Christiansin 1889.  The school moved to its premises in Dongshan of Guangzhou (âthe Dongshan Premisesâ) in 1908 and remained there untilit was nationalised in 1953.  Also in 1908, the Guangdong and Guangxi Baptist Association (âå©å»£æµ¸ä¿¡ç¸½æâ) became the ownerof the School.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In 1928, the School changed its name to Guangzhou Pei Zheng Private Middle School (âç§ç«å»£å·å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸æ ¡â) in accordancewith the then legal requirement.  In 1933, the School established a branch in Hong Kong called Guangzhou Pei Zheng Private MiddleSchool Hong Kong Branch (âç§ç«å»£å·å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸é¦æ¸¯åæ ¡â).  In 1938, the School established a branch in Macau called GuangzhouPei Zheng Private Middle School Macau Branch (âç§ç«å»£å·å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸æ¾³éåæ ¡â)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In 1950, the two branch schools changed their names to Hong Kong Pui Ching Middle School (âé¦æ¸¯å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸â) and Macau PuiChing Middle School (âæ¾³éå¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸â) respectively, and were managed by their respective school boards.  In 1953, the Schoolin the Dongshan Premises with its assets was nationalised and changed its name to the 7th Middle School of Guangzhou Municipality(âå»£å·å¸ç¬¬ä¸ä¸­å­¸â).  By this time, the Guangdong and Guangxi Baptist Association with its assets had also been nationalised.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In 1958, the 2nd plaintiff took over the administration of the Hong Kong Pui Ching Middle School and Macau Pui Ching Middle Schoolfrom their school boards.  Also in 1958, the 7th Middle School of the Guangzhou Municipality moved out of the Dongshan premises andmerged with another middle school.  A new education institute called the Teachers Training College of Guangzhou Municipality, (âå»£å·å¸«ç¯å­¸é¢â)started operating at the Dongshan Premises.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In 1962, this Teachers Training College merged with the Guangdong Teachers Training College and vacated from part of the DongshanPremises.  A middle school called Guangzhou Kiu Kwong Middle School (âå»£å·ååä¸­å­¸â) then moved into the vacant part ofthe Dongshan premises.  Kiu Kwong Middle School was, in fact, founded in 1957 by the Working Committee of the Guangzhou Municipalityof the Returned Overseas Chinese Union (âä¸­åè´å¬é»¨å»£å·å¸å·¥ä½å§å¡æâ).

Under Chinese law, the 1st Plaintiff has no locus standi tosue for infringement of the rights of and in the trade name âPei Zhengâ (å¹æ­£) and/or any of the insignia set out in the ScheduleA of the re-re-amended statement of claim and/or the said Trade Mark.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  If these averments in the defence are true, I do not know how the alumni and friends of Pui Ching would feel, as they might havethought that they had made donations to and supported the School and were not aware that they had only supported a school that isâå¹æ­£â in name but Kiu Kwong (âååâ) in fact.  But it is not a matter that I have to decide in this application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Regarding the case of the 2nd plaintiff, the defendants plead that the 2nd plaintiff was only the operator of the Hong Kong andMacau Pui Ching Schools and had not obtained any right in the trade name and/or design insignia of the Guangzhou Pei Zheng PrivateMiddle School Hong Kong Branch (âç§ç«å»£å·å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸é¦æ¸¯åæ ¡â) or its successor, Hong Kong Pui Ching Middle School (âé¦æ¸¯å¹æ­£ä¸­å­¸â). Thus, they say the 2nd plaintiff has no locus standi to sue for infringement of the trade name Pei Zheng (âå¹æ­£â) or its insignia.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On the subsidiary issue of breach of fiduciary duty by the 2nd defendant, his case is that according to the law of the Mainlandand Hong Kong he did not owe any such duty to the 1st plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  These are the main issues between the parties.  As I have said, this action has reached the stage for the parties to exchange theirwitness statements.  The defendants in fact have filed their only witness statement, which was made by the 2nd defendant, becausethe plaintiff did not want to exchange their witness statements with them pending the resolution of this summons.  The defendantsare also ready to exchange their expert reports as well.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>The application to stay the 1st plaintiffâs case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Despite the defendantsâ readiness for the trial, they say that the case brought by the 1st plaintiff should be stayed in favourof the courts in the Mainland, which is the more appropriate forum.  On the law applicable for this application, both sides agreethat I should follow the principle formulated in <i>The Spiliada</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20AC%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 AC 460</a> and summarised by Hunter J into a three-stage process in the <i>Adhiguna Meranti</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 904.</a> <i> </i>The first stage is for the defendants to show that the courts in the Hong Kong SAR are not the appropriate forum and that the courtsin the Mainland are clearly and distinctly more appropriate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>The defendantsâ grounds</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The 2nd defendant has made an affirmation to support the application.  He purportedly identified a number of questions relatingto his alleged breach of fiduciary duty and the granting of licence by the 1st defendant to the Guangzhou subsidiary of HendersonLand to use âå¹æ­£â as part of the name of a primary school in Guangzhou.  As I have observed, the alleged breach of fiduciaryduty is a relatively minor issue in this action, as the main thrust is the passing-off claim.  On the granting of the licence, thetort was completed upon the grant being made.  On the state of the pleadings and evidence before me, the reasonable inference I candraw is that the grant was made in Hong Kong.  I will further discuss this below.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The 2nd defendant further dealt with the history of the School and its nationalisation after 1949.  He identified the question ofwhether the 1st plaintiff is the School, and said that the resolution of this issue depended upon the contemporaneous documents concerningthe School which are kept by the Mainland Government since 1889, the contemporaneous documents concerning the 1st plaintiff and directoral testimony concerning the School and the 1st plaintiff, if any.  He however accepted that it is unlikely for direct oral evidenceconcerning the School to be available.  He also did not elaborate on what direct oral evidence concerning the 1st plaintiff he canadduce in the Mainland and why is such evidence relevant to the issues in this case.  He did not even identify or describe the witnesseswho can give the evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  On the documents, he said he believed the Mainland Government is in possession of documents showing whether the 1st plaintiff isthe School, but he did not say what sort of documents they are and where they are kept.  He also did not explain why the documentsalready produced by the parties, including those I have referred to above, are insufficient for resolving the issues in this case,or how these unknown documents can provide a better understanding.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  He also said that there are some confidential and secret documents kept by the Mainland Government which relate to the nationalisationof schools formerly run by religious bodies.  He believed that without sight of these confidential or secret documents, the HongKong courts would not have a complete picture of what happened since the nationalisation of the School, which he said is centralto the issue of fact on whether the 1st plaintiff had originated from the School or from Kiu Kwong (âååâ).  He said if the1st plaintiffâs case should be tried in the Mainland, the Mainland judge could have access to these documents.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  This supposition is a little bit startling.  What the 2nd defendant has said tantamount to saying that the status of the 1st plaintiffcan only be ascertained by perusing confidential documents kept by the Mainland Government and not by looking at the official documentsand certificates issued by the Government to the 1st plaintiff and other relevant parties.  But he has not explained why the MainlandGovernment has seen it necessary to keep the status of the 1st plaintiff a confidential matter and not to state it in the open documentsand certificates.  I find this assertion unconvincing.  This is particularly so when his description of these documents is very roughand general. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  He then referred to the central question of whether the 1st plaintiff could be considered as the School or its successor, and thisissue has to be resolved by reference to the law of the Mainland.  Mr Pao, counsel for the plaintiffs, accepts that whether the officialapproval by the Mainland Government for the 1st plaintiff to resume or revive the use of the name âå¹æ­£â had thereby bestowedthe goodwill of âå¹æ­£â upon the 1st plaintiff is a question of the law of the Mainland.  This is very similar to the questionreferred to by the 2nd defendant.  The 2nd defendant further said that there were already proceedings brought by the 1st plaintiffin the Mainland courts against Pui Ching Commercial College for removal of the registration of the trademark âå¹æ­£â on theground of irregular or illegal registration and three-year non-use, but these are not parallel proceedings as the parties and causesare different.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Finally, the 2nd defendant said that the defendants were willing to submit to the jurisdiction of the Mainland courts. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>The 1st plaintiffâs opposition</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The plaintiffsâ solicitor Miss Hester Chan has made an affidavit in reply.  She pointed out that the 1st and 4th defendants (andalso the 3rd defendant-though it has not taken part in this application) are companies domiciled in Hong Kong and the 2nd defendantis a resident of Hong Kong.  This action is based on passing-off, which is a common law cause of action.  If the action should bestayed in favour of the Mainland forum, this cause of action would not be available.  Miss Chan also said that even if some witnesseshave to come from the Mainland, arrangements could be made for them to come easily.  Finally, she pointed out that this applicationmerely sought to stay the part of the action brought by the 1st plaintiff and not the part brought by the 2nd plaintiff.  It is thereforenot in the interests of justice to allow the application, as the case of the 2nd plaintiff will still have to continue in this forum.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The defendants replied to these matters by the 4th affidavit of their solicitor Mr Yeung, but Mr Yeungâs affidavit does not addanything more to the affirmation of the 2nd defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>The defendantsâ attacks on the merits</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr Neoh initially argued that the 1st plaintiffâs case is impossible to succeed as a matter of law.  He said the 1st plaintiffonly came into being in 1985 and it had not acquired the goodwill of âå¹æ­£â by assignment or transfer.  The School (or theGuangdong and Guangxi Baptist Association) which owned the goodwill had been nationalised in 1953.  He also submitted that the 2ndplaintiffâs case is also hopeless as it is and was merely the administrator of the Hong Kong and Macau Pui Ching Middle Schools. He therefore said that both plaintiffs have no case and this action is a futile exercise.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  However, I am not asked to strike out this action on the ground of no reasonable cause action or on any other ground, and I do notthink I should stay the case of the 1st plaintiff in favour of the Mainland forum simply because its case and/or the 2nd plaintiffâscase is weak or hopeless.  As I will point out below, I also do not think the case of the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd plaintiff isunsustainable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Neoh refined his arguments in the skeleton in reply.  He argued that the 1st plaintiff has not obtained the goodwill in the genericname âå¹æ­£â and its insignia.  The goodwill in the School, as owned by the Guangdong and Guangxi Baptist Association, had beennationalised.  The Pui Ching schools in Hong Kong and Macau, as administered by the 2nd plaintiff, had severed their links with theMainland in the early 1950s to avoid nationalisation.  So all the goodwill in the generic name of âå¹æ­£â in the Mainland, HongKong and Macau had vested in the Mainland Government by virtue of the nationalisation.  Thus, any goodwill owned by the 2nd plaintiffmust have been created since the 1950s and it must be goodwill localised in Hong Kong and Macau and not the goodwill attached tothe generic name.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Regarding the 1st plaintiff, he submitted that there is no averment in the pleadings that the Mainland Government, in whom the goodwillof the School vested, had assigned or transferred it to the 1st plaintiff.  The goodwill of âå¹æ­£â as owned by the 1st plaintiffmust have started at the earliest in 1985 and is restricted to the locality of Dongshan.  He further submitted that there is no pleadingthat the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs share a goodwill that was obtained as a result of a pool of common nexus.  Mr Neoh thus argued thatthe goodwill of âå¹æ­£â of the 1st plaintiff is different from that of the 2nd plaintiff both in terms of locality as well asdate of germination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In relation to the tort allegedly committed against the 1st plaintiff, he therefore argued that the 1st plaintiff has no goodwillin Hong Kong and thus no right to be infringed here.  Hence, the use of âå¹æ­£â as corporate names in Hong Kong and the advertisementby the 1st defendant, which were acts done in Hong Kong, have nothing to do with the 1st plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Regarding the grant of a licence for the primary school to use the name âå¹æ­£â in Guangzhou, the defendants said that it wasan act done in the Mainland.  For an act done in the Mainland, it is only actionable in Hong Kong if it is a tort according to thelaw of the Mainland as well as a tort in Hong Kong.  This is the double actionability principle in <i>Phillips v Eyre</i> [1870] LR 6 QB1 at 28 to 30.  Since the 1st plaintiffâs goodwill only exists in the Mainland and not in Hong Kong, the allegedinfringement of the 1st plaintiffâs goodwill by this grant can only be actionable in the Mainland and not in Hong Kong.  Thus,Mr Neoh argued, the 1st plaintiff has no cause of action in Hong Kong in relation to this grant.  He therefore further argued thatsince the rights of the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs are completely different, and the 1st plaintiffâs claim has no connection with HongKong, the court should stay the 1st plaintiffâs claim in favour of the Mainland courts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Mr Neoh further submitted that even if it under the Mainlandâs law, the 1st plaintiff has goodwill in Hong Kong, the questionof whether the 1st plaintiff has a claim against the granting of licence, which was done in the Mainland, and what remedies are availablefor the grant, are matters for the law of the Mainland.  He thus suggested that the 1st plaintiff can firstly have its rights determinedin the Mainland and then come back to Hong Kong to deal with the names of the 1st, 3rd and 4th defendants.  He further buttressedhis case by relying on the assertions by the 2nd defendant that the oral evidence and documents are only available in the Mainland.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The plaintiffs disagree that they have goodwill in different localities and hence different rights.  They maintain that there isjust one goodwill in the name âå¹æ­£â which exists in the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, and this goodwill is shared by the1st and 2nd plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>The plaintiffs have a case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I am of the view that the parts of the re-re-amended statement of claim, as quoted above, have stated a case that the goodwill ofâå¹æ­£â was created sometime in 1889 and had become annexed to the Dongshan Premises from 1908 onwards.  After the assets ofthe Guangdong and Guangxi Baptist Association and the School at the Dongshan Premises were nationalised and the School became the7th Middle School of the Guangzhou Municipality, the school boards of the Hong Kong and Macau Pui Ching schools then carried thetorch of âå¹æ­£â.  They continued with the cultivation and development of its goodwill in Hong Kong and Macau.  This task andthe torch of âå¹æ­£â was then passed over to the 2nd plaintiff in 1958 and the 2nd plaintiff continued with this virtuous task.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The re-re-amended statement of claim also pleads that when the 1st plaintiff resumed the name of âå¹æ­£â at the Dongshan Premisesin 1985, it was not just a mere change of name from âååâ to âå¹æ­£â but a resumption of the operation of the Schooltogether with its goodwill as vested in it by the Mainland Government.  Furthermore, once the 1st plaintiff resumed the operationof the School at the Dongshan Premises, the 2nd plaintiff, as well as the alumni and students of the Pui Ching Middle Schools inHong Kong and Macau, recognised the 1st plaintiff as the mother school of the Pui Ching schools in Hong Kong and Macau.  Hence, thegoodwill in âå¹æ­£â, and the associated insignia have been recognised by the public in the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau asassociated with the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs and they share this goodwill together.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Whether the plaintiffs can prove their case as pleaded is not for me to decide now, but I can surely say that their case of sharedgoodwill is not hopeless either on the pleadings or on the evidence.  It is the defendantsâ case that the goodwill of âå¹æ­£âhad become nationalised and vested in the Mainland Government.  If that is right, the Mainland Government might well have vestedthe goodwill in the 1st plaintiff.  This is in line with paragraph 2(e) of the re-re-amended statement of claim, which pleads thatthe Mainland Government has granted the approval for the resumption of use of the name by the 1st plaintiff.  The certificate ofregistration issued by the government dated 11 October 2000 also stated that the 1st plaintiff had been established on 1 December1889.  It appears that the Mainland Government intended the 1st plaintiff to be the continuation of the School established on thatdate by the five Chinese Baptists.  The letter dated 20 August 1981, as quoted above, also shows the understanding of the MainlandGovernment on resumption of name.  It is not a new entity to be established, but resumption or revival of the previous entity whichis to take over the assets owned by that entity but frozen upon nationalisation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><u>Should the 1st plaintiffâs case be stayed?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Since I take the view that the plaintiffs share a common cause in this action, I should dismiss this application, as the stayingof the 1st plaintiffâs action will produce no saving in time or resources.  The 2nd plaintiffâs claim, which relies on the samegoodwill coming from the same source, still has to be disposed of in Hong Kong.  Furthermore, there is no authority that suggeststhat the court can just stay part of an action in favour of another forum and allow the remaining part to go on.  However, in deferenceto counselâs thorough arguments, I will deal with the other arguments as well.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  On whether the 1st plaintiff has succeeded to the goodwill of the School, there is no dispute that it is a matter for the law ofthe Mainland.  However, that does not mean that this matter is not appropriate for the Hong Kong courts.  Deputy Judge Lam (as hethen was) has said in <i>First Laser Ltd. v Fujian Enterprises (Holdings) Co. Ltd. v Anor</i> HCA4414/2001:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="2%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">â</td>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">35.</td>                <td width="93%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">After all, evidence as to foreign law can be adduced if the court shall eventually conclude, after proper arguments on the matter,that a particular issue is to be decided by reference to foreign law.  It has not been suggested before me that there are complicatedissues of PRC law which this court will find it too difficult to grapple with.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The defendants herein have not suggested that the question of whether the 1st plaintiff has succeeded to the goodwill of the Schoolis a very difficult question of law of the Mainland. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  On the availability of witnesses and documents in the Mainland, the defendants have not intimated who are these witnesses, whatcan they testify to and why is it difficult for them to come here to give evidence.  I note that the through-train takes less than3 hours to come from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.  The travel formalities which used to be a cause of inconvenience have become much simplifiedsince the relaxation of the ban for Mainland residents to frequent Hong Kong as tourists.  On the documents, save an allegation thatthey are confidential or secret, there is no clue as to what and where they are.  I also repeat my query of why the Mainland Governmentshould state the status of the 1st plaintiff only in confidential or secret documents rather than in the documents and certificatesthat have been issued openly.  I am not convinced that there is any need to hear evidence from any unknown witness residing in theMainland, or to peruse any unknown documents kept somewhere in the Mainland so as to resolve the issue of the 1st plaintiffâs ownershipof the goodwill.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The other matter which merits consideration is the grant of licence.  The plaintiffs say that it was granted in Hong Kong.  The1st defendant is domiciled in Hong Kong.  Though the plaintiffs have not expressly pleaded that the licence was granted in Hong Kong,I can infer that to be so by reason of the 1st defendantâs domicile.  I also note that the defendants have not pleaded in theirre-re-amended defence that the licence was granted in the Mainland.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Though the 2nd defendant has said in paragraph 28 of his affirmation that all alleged acts of conversion and breach of duty occurredin China and all are subject to findings of Chinese law, he did not specifically refer to the grant of the licence.  If the grantwas indeed made in the Mainland, he would have no difficulty in particularising the date, place and circumstances of the grant. The defendantsâ solicitor, Mr Yeung, in paragraph 17 of his 4th affidavit said that the material act took place in the Mainland. He said so from his own personal knowledge as he had not indicated otherwise, but he gave no clue as to how he had acquired suchknowledge.  There is therefore insufficient evidence to show that the licence was granted in the Mainland rather than in Hong Kong. I therefore accept Mr Paoâs submission that once the grant, which was an instrument of deception, was made in Hong Kong, the tortwas also completed in Hong Kong. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Even if I should be wrong on this and that the grant was indeed made in the Mainland, that would simply mean that there is the questionof whether the grant of licence amounted to a tort under the law of the Mainland.  The principle of double actionability will apply. If the plaintiffs cannot prove the grant as an actionable tort in the Mainland, they will fail in this part of their claims, butit still does not mean that this extra question under the Mainlandâs law can turn the tide.  The defendants have not suggestedthat this is a difficult question under the law of the Mainland.  This court is accustomed to resolving issues of foreign law withthe help of experts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  I also mention that there is the question of alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the 2nd defendant.  Though this may be a questionfor the law of the Mainland, there is no suggestion that this is a difficult question of law and I also repeat that this is a subsidiaryissue in this action.  I do not think that this issue, when added to the considerations discussed above, would persuade me to staythe claim of the 1st plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The plaintiffs have a common cause of action of passing-off, and passing-off is a common law cause of action.  The 1st and 4th defendantsare corporations domiciled in Hong Kong and the 2nd defendant is a resident of Hong Kong.  The plaintiffs share a common cause andthe stay of the 1st plaintiffâs claim will not obviate the need to try the 2nd plaintiffâs claim in Hong Kong.  It will insteadproduce the need for more time and resources for the parties because they have to deal with an extra set of proceedings in anotherforum.  All in all, I find that the defendants have failed to prove that Hong Kong is not the natural or appropriate forum, or thatthe courts in the Mainland are clearly or distinctly more appropriate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  If I should be wrong on this, I should go on to the second stage of the consideration (<i>The Adhiguna</i>).  The plaintiffs have said that there is no passing-off action known to the law of the Mainland.  The defendants do not disputethis but say that this is a matter to be resolved according to the Mainlandâs law.  In the light of my finding of a shared causein the plaintiffs, they have a vested advantage to proceed in Hong Kong because they have a known cause of action in the common lawand they can seek remedy here for passing-off against them.  There is no evidence that the passing-off cause of action is availablein the Mainland.  The existence of such cause of action here amounts to a juridical advantage for the plaintiffs which they may loseupon a stay.  For this reason, I would also dismiss the application for stay.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Dismissal of summons to stay</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I therefore dismiss the application by the defendants for stay of the 1st plaintiffâs case and I also make an order nisi thatthe defendants do pay the 1st plaintiff the costs of this application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Summons to show authority to act</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I now deal with the next application which is for production by the plaintiffsâ solicitors of proof of authority to conduct thisaction for the 1st plaintiff. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  There is evidence showing that the 1st plaintiff is a legal person and can carry on its business or undertaking legitimately.  MrNeoh says that the 1st plaintiff is a Mainland Government school and its objects or purposes are in undertaking and developing educationas stipulated in the certificate issued by the government.  Its funding is from the Mainland Government.  He therefore challengedthe 1st plaintiff to produce evidence of approval by the Mainland Government for it to institute this action and also to disbursefunds for it.  I do not think the 1st plaintiff needs to show such approval.  I think any lawful business or undertaking should havethe power to institute legal action to protect its rights and interests.  On the use of funding, I think this is merely a questionfor the plaintiffsâ own lawyers.  They may wish to be assured that they will be paid their costs, but I do not think that the defendantscan compel the 1st plaintiff to produce evidence of such approval.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I also note that the defendants have produced a Chinese legal opinion by a Mainland lawyer.  The opinion was on the establishmentand conduct of entities like the 1st plaintiff.  The opinion has not said a word about the need for permission or approval from theMainland Government for the 1st plaintiff to engage in litigation or to incur and pay legal costs.  If there should be such need,I am sure the Chinese lawyer would have said so in his opinion.  What he said was that the assets of the 1st plaintiff could notbe seized by its creditors and the bankruptcy law of the Mainland did not apply to the 1st plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I think the issues in the second summons eventually boiled down just to one matter, that is the production by the plaintiffsâsolicitors of the document of authority given to them by the 1st plaintiff authorising them to institute this action.  The defendantsrely on <i>Shanghai Land Holdings Limited (in receivership) v Chow Ching-ngai v Another</i> [2004] 3HKC 573, where the solicitors for the 1st defendant, Mr Chow, were required to produce the authority to act.  In that case,Mr Chow was incarcerated in Shanghai pending investigation into his alleged criminal acts.  Only very few people could establishcontact with him so that he was almost incommunicado.  The solicitors in Hong Kong were instructed to act for him through a Shanghailaw firm.  That law firm was instructed by Mr Chowâs elder brother to assist him.  The letters of authorisation as produced bythe Hong Kong solicitors, which were purportedly signed by Mr Chow, had signatures different from Mr Chowâs usual signatures askept by Shanghai Land.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  However, the facts in the present case are very much different from those in the <i>Shanghai Land</i> case.  The defendants here have proved nothing to cast doubt on the authority of the plaintiffsâ solicitors to act for the 1stplaintiff.  They have merely made a demand for production of proof of authority and the demand was rightly rejected.  The demandalone is not enough to create a prima facie case of doubt of authority.  The document of authority is a privileged document and thedefendants have not shown any cause to warrant an order for its production. </p>    <p style="text-align:left">Dismissal of summons</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In the premises, I also dismiss the second summons and make an order nisi that the defendants do pay the 1st plaintiffâs costsfor this summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(L Chan)<br />            Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Felix H Pao, instructed by Messrs Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Anthony Neoh, SC, leading Mr K M Chong, instructed by Messrs Peter Mo &amp; Co., for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align: left"> </p>    <appeal>On appeal by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Defendants to Court of Appeal.
