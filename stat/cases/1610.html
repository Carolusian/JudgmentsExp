Oneof the many publications published by the plaintiff is âHAIRDRESSERS JOURNAL INTERNATIONALâ(âHJIâ).  HJI was first publishedin the United Kingdom in 1882 and has been published continuously since then.  It was originally called âHAIRDRESSERSâ WEEKLYJOURNALâ.  The magazine changed its name to HJ and has been published by the plaintiff under the name HJI since at least July 1984. HJI is a weekly magazine for professionals in the hair care and beauty industry.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On the undisputed evidence the plaintiff has acquired a substantial reputation and goodwill in the names HJ and HJI not only inthe United Kingdom but in many countries including Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In September 2003 the plaintiff was approached by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant of the Rever Group of companies in Hong Kong expressing an interest in publishing an Asian version of HJI.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant is a director of both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants.  Her approach to the plaintiff led to discussions and negotiations between the parties with a view to obtaining a licencefrom the plaintiff to publish HJI in Asia.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In an e-mail sent on 13 September 2003 by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant as the Executive Director of Rever Corporation to Michael Hancock, the Vice-President of Global Business Development forthe plaintiff, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant stated, inter alia:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âI firmly believe that Rever, with a solid background in hair and beauty industry, in addition to our teamâs experience and connectionin media and publication, would be a qualified distributor and licensee for Hairdresserâs Journal in Asiaâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The fact that the defendants approached the plaintiff for a licence to use HJ demonstrates that the defendants knew full well thatthe plaintiff has a reputation and goodwill in Hong Kong in the name and mark. In the various e-mails from the defendants to theplaintiff which Mr Yan has helpfully identified at para 6 of his skeleton submissions the defendants have acknowledged the plaintiffâsreputation and goodwill in HJ and HJI.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In the course of the negotiations between the parties the plaintiff provided the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with a letter of intent.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the proposed licensee but a licence agreement was never entered into as negotiations broke down in or about February2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The evidence also shows that the defendants have made misrepresentations which were likely to lead the public to believe that theirmagazine was associated with the plaintiffâs HJI magazine.  There is no dispute that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has published and distributed the magazine under the name âHAIRDRESSERS JOURNAL ASIAâ (âHJAâ) in April 2005 withoutthe plaintiffâs licence or consent.  The name and mark HJ was used in the front cover in the identical and distinctive way in whichthe name and mark is represented in the front cover of the plaintiffâs HJI magazine.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The defendants have also without the plaintiffâs licence or consent placed advertisements for HJA where they have used the frontcovers of 4 past issues of the plaintiffâs HJI.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr Yau accepted that there was a serious question to be tried on the evidence before me.  However, he submitted that by the timethe plaintiffâs summons dated 21 June 2005 was issued there was no threat of any further publication by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant of any magazine bearing the name HJA.  He submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had indicated that it had no intention to use the name HJA.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  However, as Mr Yan has submitted, rightly in my view, the evidence does not bear this out.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantâs e-mails sent on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the proposed licensee of the plaintiff, on 2May 2005 made it plain that the defendantsâ position was that the plaintiffhad no rights in the name HJ in Hong Kong and that the defendants could use it with impunity.  This was contrary to their previouslyacknowledged position that they required a licence from the plaintiffs to use the name and mark HJ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant also made it plain that the defendants would continue to use the name HJA even though they had changed the type face ofthe title for the time being.  In an e-mail sent to the plaintiff on 2 May 2005 the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant stated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âWe have changed the type face of the title for the time being and disconnected everything in relation to UK journal, we are startingto tell the industry that we no longer relate to the UK version, but to save embarrassment for [the plaintiff] and HJI, I would seekto make joint public announcement with [the plaintiff] and HJI at an appropriate time and possibly we would change the title as soonas time fit.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">She was there saying that they would continue to use the name HJA until such time as they saw fit not to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The evidence also shows that on 1 June 2005 the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant had a conversation with the investigator engaged by the plaintiff where the investigator asked the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant about HJAâs relationship with HJI.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was asked whether HJA and HJI were partners.  The effect of what the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant said was :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âYes, we are partners, but we are not the same company and we have relation. International is only sold in England.  On the otherhand, Asia is sold even in Italy and Germany.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The evidence of Michael Hancock of the plaintiff is that on 15 June  2005 the plaintiffâs solicitors brought to his attentionthat the contents of the defendantsâ website at www.hairdressersjournalasia.com had changed in that when entering the website usersare directed to a website at www.expression-online.com (âthe Expression Front pageâ).  The Expression Front page consisted ofwording indicating that HJA had changed its name.  The wording was as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="2%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">â</td>				<td width="98%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">Breaking News</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="2%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="98%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">Media Controversy</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="2%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="98%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">Why a Change of Title</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="2%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="98%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">Enter EXPRESSION- A Media Of A Different Kind</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="2%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="98%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">Formerly known as Hairdressers Journal Asia</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="2%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="98%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">International Branding &amp; Global Trading For Hair, Beauty &amp; Trend Industryâ</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The announcement that was made contained the following statement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThis news is released with great relief to report that [the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant] had finally rectified the misstep of entering into an agreement in 2003 with Hairdressers Journal International to producean Asia-focused hairstyling magazineâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The link to the website of the Expression magazine also showed that the even with the cessation of the use of the name HJA for thename of their magazine the defendants continued to use the name HJA to promote the new magazine by publishing the front cover ofthe issue of HJA.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The announcement contained a misrepresentation as there was never any agreement reached between the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to produce HJA.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The evidence clearly shows that despite the announcement, the defendants were still trading on the plaintiffâs name and goodwillin HJ and HJI by misrepresenting that HJI and HJA were partners and that the defendantsâ magazine was formerly known as HJA.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr Yau submitted that the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant as a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants should not be held personally liable for the torts of the corporate defendants.  He also submitted that there was no evidencethat the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was in any way involved in the publication of HJA.  There is no merit in the submissions.  As Mr Yan rightly pointed out,the e-mails that he referred me to were sent by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  This is not disputed by Mr Yau.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant is sued personally in this action.  It seems to me that on the undisputed evidence a serious question to be tried has beenshown as to whether the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant as a director had authorized, directed and procured the acts complained of so as to be liable as a joint tortfeasor.  The2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was also the proposed licensee of the plaintiff.  It seems to me that a serious question to be tried has also been shownagainst the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr Yau offered an undertaking on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the publisher of the April issue of HJA, ânot to publish, offer for sale or distribute a magazine bearing the name âHairdressersJournal Asiaâ or any other name confusingly similar theretoâ.  However, that is a narrow and limited undertaking and does notgo far enough.  It does not give the plaintiff the protection that it is entitled to.  There is actual evidence of confusion by membersof the public between HJA and HJI as shown in the undisputed evidence of Michael Hancock at para 88 of his affidavit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  I am satisfied that damages would not be an adequate remedy for the plaintiff.  The evidence shows that the plaintiff has plansto have a magazine in Asia.  It seems to me that unless the defendants are restrained in the terms of para 1 of the summons the exclusivityof the plaintiffâs HJ and HJI name and mark will be lost or seriously diluted.  Damages would not, in my view, be an adequate remedyfor the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I also bear in mind that an interim injunction has been in place against the defendantsâ since 24 June 2005.  There is no evidencethat this has caused the defendants any loss or damage.  It seems to me that if an interlocutory injunction were granted to the plaintiffuntil after judgment it is highly unlikely that the defendants will suffer any damage as a result of the interlocutory injunction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In the circumstances I made an order in the terms of para 1 of the plaintiffâs summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Paras 2 and 3 of the plaintiffâs summons were in relation to an order for delivery up of all items in the possession, power, custodyor control of the defendants the continued use of which would offend the injunction.  It was, in my view, appropriate to grant therelief sought to the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Paras 4 and 6 of the plaintiffâs summons sought discovery from the defendants as set out therein.  In view of the undisputed evidencethat the defendants continued to trade on the reputation and goodwill of HJ and HJI even after the announcement of the change ofname of their magazine it was, in my view, appropriate to grant the plaintiff the relief sought.  The plaintiff sought the disclosureso as to pursue other tortfeasors and to communicate with recipients of the magazines which bore the HJA name and masthead and towhom the defendants had made misrepresentations so as to disabuse them of any false impression that the defendants were connectedor associated with the plaintiff.  The plaintiff wishes to set the record straight and this is a legitimate purpose in respect ofwhich discovery should be ordered.  I therefore made an order for discovery against the defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  It was also appropriate, in my view, to make an order that the costs of the application be the plaintiffâs costs in the cause.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  For the above reasons, I made the order as set out in para 1 above.</p>	<p style="text-align:left"> </p>	<p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Arjan H.
