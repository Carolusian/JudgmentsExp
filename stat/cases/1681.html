class="pseudopara" id="p1">1.</a> This is an appeal by the five defendants in the court below against a judgment of Penlington, J. who awarded $1,295,000 plus compoundinterest, to the plaintiff against them. He also ruled that the five defendants were entitled to be indemnified by the third party(also D.5) a firm of solicitors, Johnson, Stokes and Master, against his award.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> It is not necessary, for the purposes of this appeal, to deal with the previous transactions which had affected the property concerned,the ground floor of a factory building at 76 Hung To Road, Kwun Tong ('the premises').</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> It is sufficient to say that Mr. Shum Ka Ching (D.3) had agreed in January 1976 to purchase the ground floor of this building fromits previous owners, Lucky Time, on behalf of Po Fung, a company of which he was a director. The ground floor was to be transferredto a new company of which Mr. Shum, Mr. David Ma Pok Shun (D.2) and Mr. TSANG Hing Wan (D.4) were to be directors.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> This new company, which was a shelf company formed by Miss Leung, an assistant solicitor in the firm of Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master(J.S.M.) (D.5) was called Bovill Investments Limited (Bovill), though its name was later changed to Pomay Investments Limited (D.1).</p>    <p align="left"><u>FINANCING OF PURCHASE</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> D.3 paid deposits of $185,000 on behalf of Po Fung towards the purchase price of $1,850,000, leaving a balance due from Bovill of$1,665,000. To raise this money, D.3 approached the plaintiff, Mr. Edward Wong, a licensed moneylender, who carried on business asEdward Wong Finance Company Limited.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Wong agreed to finance the purchase. He and Mr. Shum (D.3) went to see Miss Leung on 21st January, 1976. At this meeting, MissLeung was told that D.3 had agreed to purchase the premises and that arrangements had been made between D.3 and the plaintiff forthe mortgage of the property to the plaintiff, who would lend sufficient money to D.3's new company to finance its purchase of thepremises. Miss Leung was asked to complete the legal formalities for them, being informed that the solicitor acting for the vendorswas Danny Yiu and Company, a one-man firm.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Miss Leung was told, at that meeting, that security for the loan should be effected by a legal mortgage of the property, securedby a debenture charged on the assets of the new company and by personal guarantees to be given by D.2, D.3 and D.4. Miss Leung lateradvised the plaintiff that the debenture should be charged on the premises to be purchased, rather than on all the assets of Bovill,and her advice was accepted. She was told that the amount to be lent would be about $1.3 Million, but that she would be advised laterof the exact sum.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Miss Leung wrote to Danny Yiu, the vendor's solicitor, asking for the necessary deeds to be sent to her so that the mortgage couldbe prepared. In reply, she received a letter from him enclosing copies of various documents. It was arranged between her and DannyYiu that completion should take place on the 27th January, 1976, in what is generally known as the "Hong Kong style".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In a letter dated 27th January, addressed to Danny Yiu, Miss Leung stated that she would ask the plaintiff, her client, to put herin funds to the amount of $1,355,000 and would forward a cheque for that amount to Danny Yiu, on his undertaking to send to her within10 days all the relevant documents duly executed, including the assignment of the premises to D.1, and to arrange for the registrationof other documents, including the reassignment of the premises to the vendor by the Hang Seng Bank, the previous mortgagees, so thatshe could register the assignment to Bovill (D.1) and the debenture to be drawn in favour of Mr. Wong (plaintiff). She added that,if Danny Yiu was not in a position to send the documents within that time, he was not to release the money to his clients.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On the same day, Miss Leung drafted a letter, which was to be signed by D.1 and sent to the plaintiff, asking the plaintiff, on theexecution of the necessary debenture, to forward $1,355,000 to Danny Yiu. D.1 signed the letter which was sent to the plaintiff.She also wrote to the latter herself, reporting that the mortgage of the premises had been duly secured (D.2, D.3 and D.4 havingcome to her office and executed the debenture and guarantee) and asked the plaintiff to let her have a cheque for $1,355,000, payableto Danny Yiu, to be used in payment of the purchase price.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Miss Leung, after telephoning Danny Yiu to confirm the amount due, sent another letter to him, enclosing $1,665,000 in the form ofthree cashier's orders payable to Danny Yiu, on the same day. This larger sum was sent, because Mr. Wong had given last minute informationto Miss Leung to the effect that he had agreed with Mr. Shum (D.3) to lend the latter a further $310,000 on the security of somepost-dated cheques and had brought the cashier orders for the enhanced total to her office.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It is not in dispute that, a few days' later, Danny Yiu fled from Hong Kong, without honouring the undertaking which he had givenand taking with him a large amount of money, among which was the sum which he had received from the plaintiff, in respect of thepurchase of the premises.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiff claimed that D.1-D.4 were liable to repay the outstanding amount of the loan ($1,295,000) and that D.5 as the solicitorfor the plaintiff, was liable for negligence. D.1-D.4 resisted the claim, on the ground that they did not owe the plaintiff anythingbecause he had not paid the purchase price of the premises on their behalf to the vendor.</p>    <p align="left"><u>HONG KONG STYLE OF COMPLETION</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> There were two main points argued in the appeal before us. The first was concerned with the duty which a solicitor owes to his client;this has involved a scrutiny of the methods by which conveyances of property take place in Hong Kong. The second was whether or notD.5 was acting as solicitor for D.1-D.4 in the purchase and mortgage of the premises.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> According to the evidence of Mr. Edmund Cheung, who was at that time President of the Hong Kong Law Society and was called by theplaintiff as an expert witness, and of Mr. McElney, the senior partner in D.5, virtually every conveyance and mortgage completedin Hong Kong within living memory has been effected by what has become known as the "Hong Kong style" of completion; I shall referto it as such.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The essence of the Hong Kong style is that the solicitor who is acting for the purchaser/mortgagor forwards the purchase price tothe vendor's solicitors (whether by cash, cashier's order, certified cheque or ordinary cheque) in return for an undertaking by thelatter to forward the necessary documents of title, duly executed, to the purchaser's solicitor within a stated period.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The evidence, which was not disputed, was that this was the first occasion on which the use of the Hong Kong style had ever resultedin loss to a purchaser, by reason of the dishonesty of a solicitor acting for the vendor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> In England, by contrast, the customary method of completion of a conveyance has required a simultaneous handing over by the purchaser'ssolicitors of the purchase price, in return for the receipt from the vendor's solicitors of the necessary documents of title. (Thoughthis practice has itself recently been modified by the recognition by the English Law Society of the propriety of a system of postalcompletion).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The existence of a Hong Kong style and its widespread use are not challenged. The substance of it and the degree of risk involvedin it are.

A solicitor cannot excuse a failure to take an obvious precaution, or to avoid a substantial risk,merely by showing that other solicitors would act, and almost always did act, in the same way.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> To take a simple example, it may be the general practice to treat a disease with a certain drug. If, however, it is known that apatient suffers an acute reaction to it, it would be unwise to administer it to him. If a solicitor, to whom another solicitor proposesto hand cash, is known by the latter to be heavily in debt and about to leave Hong Kong, this would amount to warning bells, to whicha prudent man must listen.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Thus, as a matter of law and of common-sense, it remains open to a court to hold that a general practice is imprudent, or makes inadequateprovision for a known risk, and that a prudent solicitor should not have followed it, even if all solicitors have done so for a longtime.</p>    <p align="left"><u>WOULD A PRUDENT SOLICITOR HAVE FOLLOWED THE HONG KONG STYLE IN 1976</u> ?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It is important to remind ourselves that we must not judge the reasonableness of the use of the Hong Kong style in 1976 with knowledgeof Danny Yiu's defalcations. We must consider whether a prudent solicitor would have followed such a practice in 1976.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Miss Leung did what virtually every Hong Kong solicitor then did and had done within living memory. Her action was unquestionablysupported by common practice and by what was, at the very least, the implicit approval of the Law Society, contained in a circulardated 30th March, 1966.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> This circular draws the attention of the members of the Hong Kong Law Society to the practice of sending a cheque, or executed deed,to another solicitor, against the latter's undertaking, and informs them that it is unethical to refuse to complete in the Englishmanner if another solicitor requires this "for reasons of greater security".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> It reminds members that "the present practice of sending the consideration money against an undertaking is a practice of courtesyand convenience only."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The terms of this circular appear to me to imply that the Law Society takes no objection to "the present practice" (which was theHong Kong style) though it draws attention to the fact that the English practice is safer.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It should be noted, in passing, that it was the 1966 circular which is relevant. The 1965 Law Society circular was no more than aworking paper circulated for comment. The 1966 circular contains the considered views of the Society.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> It is to be expected that a professional man will normally follow the directions or advice of his governing professional body. Indeed,a failure to comply will often involve the risk of disciplinary proceedings being launched against him.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I have no doubt that a prudent Hong Kong solicitor would, in 1976, have regarded the circular as authorising him to use the HongKong style; that he knew it to be in general use; and that he would have adopted it unless there were warning bells.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> There were no warning bells here. Miss Leung knew of nothing to Danny Yiu's detriment and had conducted similar transactions withhim before, without mishap. I thus see no factors which should have warned Miss Leung that such degree of risk as was always presentin the Hong Kong style was enhanced in this instance.</p>    <p align="left"><u>SHOULD A PRUDENT SOLICITOR HAVE FOLLOWED THE HONG KONG STYLE IN JANUARY 1976</u> ?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> As I have already said, it is strong evidence that a solicitor has acted with prudence if he is able to show that he followed a generalpractice; all the more so if this practice had received the seal of approval of the governing body of his profession.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> But this is not sufficient to relieve him of liability for negligence, if that practice involves a substantial risk and ought notto have been adopted by a prudent solicitor in 1976. This involves an assessment of the foreseeability at that time of disaster flowingfrom the adopting of the practice.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Many procedures adopted by solicitors, and members of other professions, depend to some degree on mutual trust between them and theircolleagues and are capable of fraudulent manipulation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Under the Hong Kong style, the vendor's solicitor can pocket the purchase price and disappear. Under the English style of completion,involving the simultaneous exchange of cash for documents, there remains a risk (lesser though it may be) of forgery of documentsby the vendor's solicitor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> So I do not regard the possibility of abuse of a practice as showing that it is improvident of a solicitor to follow it, unless thepractice involves a substantial degree of risk in theory or has been shown to be dangerous in practice.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Although the Hong Kong style depends upon the honesty of the solicitor for the vendor, and of his willingness to honour an undertaking,I do not find it unreasonable, in general terms, for a solicitor to assume that a fellow solicitor will honour his promise, bearingin mind the certainty that the latter's failure to do so will mean the end of his professional career.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> If a prudent solicitor had been asked, in 1976, whether he thought that it was unwise to adopt the Hong Kong style, he would surelyhave replied that its adoption carried more of a risk than the English style, that the risk was of negligible size, that it had neverbeen known to go wrong and that he, and all his colleagues, had no hesitation in following it. I take the same view and find thatthere was no reason why a prudent solicitor should not have adopted the Hong Kong style in 1976.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> With the benefit of hindsight, however, the risks appear more real than they did before Danny Yiu left Hong Kong in a hurry.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> While I have concluded that D.5 was not negligent in 1976, this does not mean that I would reach the same result if a similar misfortunebefell another purchaser today.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> I suggest that the Law Society should readress itself to the possibility of surrounding the Hong Kong style, if it is thought advisableto continue to use it, with precautions which will reduce or negative the chances of misappropriation by a dishonest solicitor actingfor a vendor, rare though such a man will, I hope, always be.</p>    <p align="left"><u>WHAT IS THE TRUE HONG KONG STYLE? DOES IT CONTAIN PRECONDITIONS?</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The trial judge did not in terms rule as to whether or not it is a sufficient defence to a claim against him for negligence, fora solicitor to show merely that he adopted a general practice. However, the implication that this was his view must be derived fromhis ruling that, although it was a general practice to follow the Hong Kong style, Miss Leung did not do so; and that because shefailed to do so, and damage to the plaintiff ensued, D.5, her employers, should be held liable in negligence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> His conclusion that Miss Leung failed to apply the true Hong Kong style is based on his conclusion that that style requires morethan blind adherence to a system under which there is an exchange of cash in return for an undertaking. In his opinion, the purchaser'ssolicitor must show, before he follows the system, that he has taken certain precautions, which are part of the Hong Kong style anda precondition to the adoption of the cash for undertaking procedure.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> As the judge puts it, while in the great majority of cases an undertaking could be accepted, a solicitor "should be aware of thedangers and must give thought to the factors involved". He decides that Miss Leung failed to be so aware or to give such thoughtand that she was therefore guilty of negligence by virtue of the breach of the duty of care which she owed to D.1-D.4.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The judge bases his conclusion that the Hong Kong style contains its own built-in preconditions mainly on the evidence of Mr. EdmundCheung, who testified that he would have taken special precautions in this instance, because the sum involved was large, the mortgagewas considerable in relation to the purchase price and the purchaser was a shelf company. Mr. Cheung also said that he kept a listof some solicitors with whom he thought it prudent to take special precautions.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> The respondents have argued that the Hong Kong style requires that a prudent purchaser's solicitor must ask himself a number of questions.For example "How many partners are there in the vendor's solicitor's firm?" "How much money is involved?" "Can my clients affordto lose what is involved?", "Have I heard anything to suggest that the vendor's solicitor is dishonest?", "Does my client agree tothe Hong Kong style being adopted?" (This last question will be considered separately).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Mr. Cheung said, in 1980, that he would have adopted some such procedure even in 1976, though he was unable to give any instancein which he had himself not adopted the English style. Even if Mr. Cheung was not affected by hindsight, there is no evidence thatthe precautions which he thought desirable were adopted by any other solicitors in 1976. They were not by D.5, one of the largestfirms in Hong Kong, as might have been expected if they were then a matter of general practice.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> The Law Society circular of 1966 refers to the possibility that the adoption of the Hong Kong style may leave solicitors more vulnerablethan the English practice. Nowhere does it suggest that it would not be prudent for the local form to be followed, nor that, beforeit is adopted, the solicitor for the purchaser should take steps to enquire as to the honesty and reliability of the vendor's solicitor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Accepting that Mr. Cheung would have asked himself the questions which the judge finds D.5 should have posed, I can find no evidencethat Mr. Cheung was typical of the prudent Hong Kong solicitor of 1976. I think he was more careful than the latter would have beenand that the latter would have followed the guidance of his own society, which did not superimpose on the Hong Kong style the preconditionswhich Mr. Cheung says he then required of himself.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> It was further argued by the respondents, though not so found by the judge, that, as one of the preconditions to the adoption ofthe Hong Kong style, it was incumbent upon a solicitor to explain to his client the risks which were involved in the Hong Kong style.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> If a client asks for an explanation of the procedure to be followed and of the risks which may be involved in it, a duty lies uponthe solicitor to give it; but unless the client so asks, I do not think that any such duty arises. To impose a positive duty of thisnature, would in most cases serve no useful purpose, since the client would generally follow whatever advice his solicitor gave him.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In the circumstances under review, I have no doubt that, if the plaintiff had sought an explanation from Miss Leung, he would havebeen told that the practice which she proposed to follow had been adopted in virtually every Hong Kong conveyance within living memory;that no purchaser had ever lost as a result of it; and that she had had similar dealings with Danny Yiu without mishap.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> In the face of such an explanation, it is highly improbable that the plaintiff would nevertheless have insisted on an alternativeform of procedure being adopted.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> I am satisfied that the Hong Kong style of completion does not contain any automatic general precondition though, as I have alreadysaid, if there are warning bells a prudent solicitor must listen to them and take special precautions before adopting it. In thiscase, there were no warning bells, and consequently no obligation upon Miss Leung to take such precautions.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> It is worth observing, to avoid misunderstanding, that if there is no general practice, in relation to some aspect of a solicitor'swork, different considerations arise. It is then incumbent upon a solicitor to consider all the factors and to decide what is theprudent course to take in the circumstances before him.</p>    <p align="left"><u>CONCLUSION</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> I therefore reach the conclusion that -</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%">a prudent solicitor would have followed the Hong Kong style in 1976, as Miss Leung did;</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%">that the Hong Kong style did not oblige the prudent solicitor to take any precautions, unless there were "warning bells";</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">(c)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%">that there were no warning bells in this instance;</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">(d)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%">the plaintiff has failed to establish negligence on the part of D.5.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> These findings make it unnecessary to rule on the question of whether or not the judge was correct in finding that, although therewas no contractual relationship of solicitor and client between D.1-D.4 and D.5, D.5 was nevertheless liable in tort to them.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> Counsel for D.1, D.2, D.3 and D.4 abandoned their appeals against that part of the judgment which ordered those defendants to paythe sum of $1,295,000.

It is contended on behalf of D5 that once Miss Leung followed the general practice inHong Kong she had a complete answer, (or clear feet) from negligent provided that this practice had no special features to call forcaution: <u>Bolam</u> v. <u>Friern Hospital Management Committee</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%201%20WLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 1 W.L.R. 582</a>; <u>Vancouver General Hospital</u> v. <u>McDaniel and another</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%20152%20LT%2056" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 152 L.T. 56</a> and <u>Simmons</u> v. <u>Pennington</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%201%20WLR%20183" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 1 W.L.R. 183.</a> Counsel for the plaintiff and the other defendants, however, contend that the test goes much further. They argue that the test isthat of a reasonable, diligent and competent solicitor namely, an objective test - 28 Halsbury's 3rd edition para. 9 p.12. They suggestthat a mechanical following of the general practice is not a conclusive answer.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> Having considered the authorities cited, I am of the opinion that the test is an objective test namely that of a reasonable, diligentand competent solicitor. In <u>Bolam's case</u> the question was whether a doctor giving what was called the ECT treatment in unmodified form to a mental patient was negligent.The evidence before the Court was that there were at least two schools of thought. However, whatever forms of modification appliedwould in themselves attract certain risks to the patient albeit in different ways. Unmodified forms of treatment entailed certainrisks. Such risks were no higher than any other modified treatment. Directing the jury McNair, J. said at p.586:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the ordinary case which does not involve any special skill, negligence in law means a failure to do some act which a reasonableman in the circumstances would do, or the doing of some act which a reasonable man in the circumstances would not do; and if thatfailure or the doing of that act results in injury, then there is a cause of action. How do you test whether this act or failureis negligent? In an ordinary case it is generally said you judge it by the action of the man in the street. He is the ordinary man.In one case it has been said you judge it by the conduct of the man on the top of a Clapham omnibus. He is the ordinary man."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The consideration in that case was whether the doctor discharge his duty with a reasonable skill of his profession. There were twoschools of thought. He followed one of them.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> In <u>Vancouver General Hospital's case</u> the question was whether the appellant hospital, acting on advice of medical experts in maintaining a mixed ward for infectious diseases,was negligent when one of its patients admitted for diphtheria contracted smallpox. Personal negligence of the doctor and nursesattending to this patient was not in issue. That again was a question of professional technique. The old school of thought was oneof isolation wards for smallpox patients. The new school was that of sterilisation in substitution for isolation. In his judgmentLord Alness said at p.57:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"That being the state of the evidence, it seems to their Lordships difficult to affirm that, in a matter relating solely to medicaltechnique, the appellants were proved to be guilty of negligence."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Later he said:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"That, however, is not all. Not only do these medical men approve in terms of the appellants' technique, but they affirm, as willbe observed from the passages cited sup., that the technique challenged by the respondent is in accord with general if not with universalpractice to-day in Canada and the United States. If that be so, it is, in their Lordships' opinion, again difficult to affirm thatnegligence on the part of the appellants is proved.

Again it was a question of professional technique or skillwhich was put to test rather than the conduct of a reasonable person. Even if human prudence indicated that one form of the safetyfactor was isolation the same safety factor, in medical opinion, could be achieved by sterilisation.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> In <u>Simmons</u> v. <u>Pennington &amp; Son</u> where a solicitor's clerk was absolved from negligence when he gave a "stock form" answer to a "stock requisition" the foreseeabilitytest was applied - not the compliance with the general practice test. At p.186 Denning, L.J. as he then was, said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"but by ill luck the courts have held that the words which the solicitors used, instead of protecting their client, amounted to arepudiation of the contract. That was, in my view, not their fault: it was not a thing which could reasonably have been anticipatedto flow from the answer to the requisition. The solicitors acted in accordance with the general practice of conveyances. No ill consequenceshad ever been known to flow from an answer in this form."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> The emphasis was in the phrase "could reasonably have been anticipated to flow from the answer to the requisition". What made iteven clearer is in the judgment of Hodson, L.J., who said at p.188:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Both the counsel referred to, Mr. Milner Holland and Mr. Dunbar gave evidence in this case and they thought the opinion expressedby Romer, J. that this inconsistency defeated the plaintiff, was wrong. They advised an appeal and a division of this court tooka different view. In those circumstances, it would be a remarkable thing if a solicitor's managing clerk who had produced that result,which was ultimately found to be wrong, should be held to be negligent within the ordinary principles of the law of negligence."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> If two prominent counsel of the Chancery Bar could not foresee the ill result of the "stock answer" until judgment of the Court ofAppeal had been delivered it was indeed too much to expect a solicitor's clerk, however experienced, to foresee the same.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> On the other hand in Charlesworth on Negligence para. 202 at p.137 the author wrote:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">Compliance with common practice is evidence that reasonable care has been used, but is not conclusive since 'no one can claim to beexcused for want of care because others are as careless as himself' ..............</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">Accordingly there are cases where the general practice may not conform at all to the standard of care required, in which event thedefence would fail that the defendant had acted in accordance with the general practice.

What, then, is a reasonable, diligent and competentsolicitor in the present case? The answer, in my opinion, is that he is a reasonable man of ordinary prudence coupled with the basicskill and knowledge in the law of conveyancing. It is the same as a reasonable, competent and diligent doctor. He is a man of ordinaryprudence coupled with knowledge and skill in medicine or surgery. But possession of legal knowledge and exercise of legal skill alonewould not absolve a solicitor from the requirement of acting with prudence of an ordinary man.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> Applying this test to the present case I find Miss Leung, as a solicitor when adopting the Hong Kong practice for completion in January,1976, she complied with the general practice which had been practised for years without ill result of the form of damage as in thiscase flowing from it. That goes a long way to show that she was not negligent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> However, that is not conclusive. The further question to be asked is: could she foresee the risk or ill result at the material timeas an ordinary, reasonable prudent person? I am afraid the answer must be in the affirmative.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> As a solicitor, even in January, 1976 she should know that her client, the plaintiff would not obtain what it lent its money forunless and until the vendor had executed the assignment and delivered the title deeds. If she part with the money without such deliveryshe did not receive what her client had paid for apart from an undertaking or a promise by a fellow member of her profession. Asa reasonable person of ordinary prudence she should or ought to have foreseen the risk of parting with the money before obtainingthe property one bought in any ordinary transaction. It was not her skill that was put to test. It was her common sense, her prudenceof any ordinary person that is put to test. The so called Hong Kong practice has an inherent risk in the ordinary sense. The factthat practically all her fellow solicitors adopted this practice is not conclusive evidence that it is prudent. If two wrongs donot make one right then a million similar practice of imprudence adopted for a long time without ill result do not make such practicean act or prudence. Parting with money before obtaining what one pays for has an inherent risk. Acting in accordance with the generalpractice she took a foreseeable risk for her client while there was no necessity to do so. The fact that other solicitor did thesame did not make the risk less apparent or unreal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> What she did, in effect, was to put her trust on a fellow member of her profession by taking a risk for which no professional skillcould find a remedy. This is different from sterilisation being substituted for isolation or impossibility of foreseeing that illresult flowing from a "stock answer".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> The risk taken involved not only that of a dishonest solicitor. The solicitor might have a dishonest accounting clerk who defraudedhim and he might not have the means to compensate for failing to honour his undertaking.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> Furthermore dishonest solicitors, fortunately very few in Hong Kong, did come to the surface from time to time even before 1976 albeitin a different form. It is true that up to the Danny Yiu episode dishonesty of solicitors manifested in the form of defrauding theirown clients only. Danny Yiu simply took advantage of the Hong Kong practice by inducing a fellow solicitor to part with the purchasemoney against his own undertaking without having to induce his own client to execute any document. Whatever form of dishonesty practisedthe risk of a dishonest solicitor was there prior to 1976 or after. To foresee that is not beyond the ordinary prudence of an ordinaryperson. That is not being wise after the events.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> Miss Leung should know or ought to have known the contents of the Circular issued by the Law Society in 1966. That Circular toldher that the so called Hong Kong practice was for the convenience and courtesy of lawyers. It might incidentally be convenient forthe banks. This Circular told her that for greater security if she requested for an English completion on behalf of her client itwould be unethical for another solicitor to refuse her. But what baffles me is that one poassage in this Circular which read:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Committee also observe that in recent months a number of local firms have adopted among themselves the practice of completionon the basis of delivery of executed deeds against payment in cash or by banker's draft or certified cheque. The Committee watchwith interest the progress of such a 'pilot scheme', and as soon as its practical results can be ascertained, the Committee willissue further directive on the practice to be adopted for completion of conveyancing transactions."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> I would think that when the English legal system was applied to the Colony in the 1840's all the solicitors in Hong Kong had beentrained, qualified and practised in England where the English practice of completion was then the universal practice as it is stillpractised today. Why the English practice should be labelled with the term 'pilot scheme' is quite beyond my comprehension. Afterall, an English oak even planted in Hong Kong is not called a new species of "China fir".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> For these reasons I am of the opinion that, despite the general practice in Hong Kong, the adoption of such practice entails an inherentrisk. To adopt such practice amounts to failing to exercixe due care and the ordinary prudence of a reasonable man. It means givinga fellow solicitor more trust than is necessary with the money of one's own client.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> Mr. Edmond Cheung who gave evidence said that mentally he would have a white list. He would trust those whom he thought he couldtrust not because he was a solicitor but because by previous experience he found a particular solicitor to be trustworthy. In anyevent he gave the impression that he would accept the risk as one of his own rather than that he could pass on to his client. Oncehe is prepared to accept the risk no question need be asked. If the risk is to be passed on to his client I feel that a solicitormust assume a higher duty of care and be less trusting. For these reasons I find that D5, in their particular conduct in this case,were negligent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> What then is the extent of D5's liability to the plaintiff. It is argued for D5 that this was a technical breach. It is contendedthat even if Miss Leung were to warn herself she would have proceeded the same way because she had previous dealings with Danny Yiuwithout ill result. It is further contended that even if Mr. Edward Wong of the plaintiff were told of the Hong Kong practice tobe adopted he would have authorised Miss Leung to proceed the same way. As such the plaintiff is not entitled to more than nominaldamage - <u>Sykes</u> v. <u>Midland Bank Executor Co</u>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%201%20QB%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 1 Q.B. 113.</a> That was the case where the trial judge, despite a very good try, never obtained from the plaintiff an answer that he (the plaintiff)would instruct his solicitor to act otherwise had he known the full details. In the present case, after a lengthy cross-examinationby counsel for D5 and a few questions from the Bench, the gist of Edward Wong's evidence can be summarised as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="92%">He knew that when money was paid over to the vendor's solicitor he had not received his full entitlement;</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="92%">There had been previous transactions conducted in the same way without ill result or loss to him.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%">(c)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="92%">Prior to February, 1976 he knew nothing adverse to Danny Yiu.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> It is however interesting to repeat his answers to certain questions in cross-examination as follows:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">Q.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">So that isn't it being wise after the event but looking at the position only with information that was available on the 27th of Januaryonly, only that information, isn't it highly probable that if the picture had been fully painted to you on the 27th of January, 1976,you would have said, 'Proceed with this transaction in accordance with the ordinary procedure.'</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">A.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">If she had told me that she had some doubts concerning Danny Yiu, then I would not have proceeded.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">Q.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">No, but the picture that I am painting is without the benefit of the knowledge of February that Danny Yiu was, in fact, dishonest,without that information.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">A.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">If she told me that there is nothing special, then I would have proceeded with the matter."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">To this he later add:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">A.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">I would like to add that I would proceed on the trust that if there is anything improper on the other side, then my money would bereturned to me."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> At no time did Mr. Wong say that he knew of a safer method of completion - the English practice. What happened if he knew of thispractice is a matter of conjecture. To impute such knowledge to him would mean putting him in the position of being in possessionof legal knowledge as his solicitor. He accepted the Hong Kong practice as a matter of course. He did not know he had a choice. Inshort he took a risk without knowing that there was any other procedure whereby he could avoid it or at least minimise it. For thesereasons I am of the opinion that he is entitled to a full measure of compensatory damage as awarded by the trial judge and not nominaldamage.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> I now come to the other defendants namely: D1 - D4. In this connection I assume that there was no contractual relationship betweenD5 and these other defendants apart from that of purchasing a shelf company. According to Miss Leung, D5 did not act for these otherdefendants in respect of the mortgage between them and the plaintiff or for the purchase of the property. However, in the courseof her acting in respect of the mortgage for the plaintiff, Miss Leung drafted a series of documents. One of these was a letter shedrafted for Mr. Shum (the 3rd defendant) and his fellow directors to sign on behalf of D1 and addressed to the plaintiff. Anotherwas her own letter addressed to Danny Yiu. In the letter she drafted on behalf of the 1st defendant to be signed by its directorsshe used the following terms:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          "We would inform you that the Mortgage of the above premises securing Credit Facilities to be granted to Bovill InvestmentsLimited has been duly executed and will be forwarded to you for your retention together with all the relevant title deeds and documentswhen the stamping and registration thereof have been completed.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          Please let us have your cheque in favour of Danny Yiu &amp; Co. for the sum of $1,355,000.00 towards payment of the purchaseprice of these premises and we enclose herewith the Authorisation dated 27th January 1976.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          Please attend to the necessary insurance cover of these premises in due course."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> This meant a direction and authorisation that the plaintiff should forward the money to Danny Yiu on their behalf. In another letterwhich Miss Leung addressed to Danny Yiu she adopted the following terms:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          "Referring to our letter of to-day's date, we enclose herewith our clients' 3 cheques in your favour for the total sum of$1,665,000.00 towards payment of the balance of the purchase price of the above premises.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          Please note that the said sum of $1,665,000.00 is sent to you subject to the terms referred to in the second paragraph ofour letter referred to above."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="2%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> Having regard to the terms of these documents I am of the opinion that in the course of discharging her duty to the plaintiff (thenew mortgagee) she adopted an advisory role vis-vis D1 - D4 in the purchase of the property. D2 - D4 would be justified to rely onher advice. She knew that D1 - D4 had to act in accordance with her suggestions in signing that letter to the plaintiff in orderto obtain the loan from the plaintiff. She had not ascertained that Danny Yiu was acting as solicitor of the D1 - D4 in respect ofthe purchase. The other defendants acted in accordance with her advice to their detriment. Miss Leung knew and ought to have knownthat by suggesting such a course of action to the other defendants they (the other defendants) would be involved in a similar riskthat was taken by the plaintiff. That is sufficient, in my opinion, to attract to her the tortious liability towards D1 - D4. Ifone adopts the proximity test as applied in <u>Hedley Byrne</u> v. <u>Heller</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) A.C. 465</a> D1 - D4 must be regarded as persons to whom Miss Leung owed a duty of care in her practice as a solicitor. As I am of the opinionthat D5 is liable to the plaintiff, D5 is similarly liable to D1 - D4 for negligence. For these reasons I am of the opinion thatthe appeal ought to be dismissed and the judgment of the Court below confirmed.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Simon F.S.

A large number of conveyancesrelate to multi-story buildings or involve a number of confirmors intervening as between the original vendor and the ultimate purchaser.The gathering together of all the parties general to the English style completion is difficult; though I note that the advanced styleof completion used here is being introduced, though the post box so to speak, in England today.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> In 1975 and early 1976 whatever risk there may have been in the use of the "Hong Kong Style" was so remote as to be virtually non-existent.It was a practice sanctioned by usage, and by the governing body of the profession, over a considerable period of time. It had beenused by the appellants in completions with Danny Yiu &amp; Co. on prior occasion. It had never miscarried through default upon anundertaking.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> It was not shown to be an imprudent practice and, on the evidence there were no "warning bells" - <u>G + K Ladenbau Ltd.</u> v. <u>Crawley &amp; DeReya</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20WLR%20266" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 W.L.R. 266</a> - sounding their toscin generally to the profession in respect of further similar dealings with Danny Yiu. For a solicitor to dishonourhis undertaking would mean the end of his professional life. It is difficult in the extreme to erect two, or even three, classesof solicitor within the profession, wherein its members are Officers of the Court, and one member is, in the absence of any warningbell, entitled in my view to rely on the integrity of another.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> However the "Hong Kong Style" basically remains a matter of "courtesy and convenience" - that is courtesy as between brother solicitorsand convenience as between those solicitors, the banks who are frequently prior mortgagees and the public. Solicitors in the postYiu Era are and should be aware that the unthinkable has happened and can happen again. Solicitors in practice today in Hong Kongare no longer known each to the other and the real interests of clients should not be allowed to be overridden by other factors.I would agree with My Lord President that the time has come for the Law Society to reassess the practice with somewhat greater emphasisupon the possibility, rare though it may be, of risk to the client's money. No one, in my view, can be said to afford to lose partof his assets however large those assets may be.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> As these dealings are solicitor to solicitor, and a dishonest solicitor is a fellow member of the profession and it is he who causesthe loss, I would have thought it highly desirable that all solicitors as between themselves should create a fund of ample proportionsto absorb any loss created by default of one of their own. And it is to be hoped that consideration of the issues raised here willtake a somewhat shorter time than did the Circular issued in 1966 on the Hong Kong style, the matter first being raised in 1959.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> It was argued that Johnson Stokes &amp; Master, in failing to ascertain the amount of the prior mortgage before it arranged the mortgagehere by Mr. Wong to the other defendants in order to facilitate the purchase of the premises and before they paid over the moneythus raised to Danny Yiu, were negligent and that their negligence resulted in the loss which gives rise to this claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> While it is the duty of the vendor to give good title I would have thought it prudent for the new mortgagees solicitor, in the interestof seeing that his client would get good title, to ascertain the amount due under that prior mortgage and whether or not, as in thisinstance, the prior mortgagee would be prepared to discharge its interest on the ground floor portion of the building whatever itsview might have as to the remaining portions. But, be that as it may, I do not think such enquiry or any action arising from it would,other than by a side wind, have guarded against the dishonesty of Danny Yiu.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> While I agree with My Lord President that the issue as to whether or not Johnson Stokes &amp; Master were acting for Mr. Shum andhis group of defendants including Pomay, on the mortgage and the actual purchase does not now fall for decision in the light of theconclusions reached, for my part I would incline to uphold of the judgment of the judge on this point. I accept that there was nocontractual relationship - no retainer no direct instructions received - but nevertheless I have no doubt that Mr. Shum, and throughhim the other defendants in that group, was under the firm impression engendered in his mind by the instructions given to him byMiss Leung that Johnson Stokes &amp; Master were so acting. And that, acting upon that impression, he placed such reliance upon JohnsonStokes &amp; Master so to give rise to the possibility of tortious liability.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> But that having been said I too would allow the appeal.</p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Mr. Price Q.C. &amp; Mr. Mills Owens Q.C.
