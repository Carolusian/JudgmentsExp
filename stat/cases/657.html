He isalso making the claims in the statement of claim on behalf of his colleagues who find themselves in a similar predicament.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Put very simply the Plaintiff's claim is that when he was employed by the Hong Kong Government it was represented to him that hisremuneration would be equated with the remuneration payable to a Superintendent of Police. In this connection, the terms of employmentprovided for an incremental scale. At the lower end of the scale the salary was the same as the salary payable to a Chief Inspectorof Police and the scale increased to the same level as is payable to a Superintendent of Police.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Initially, the Plaintiff's salary was the same as above described. However, as a result of a survey which was undertaken, a decisionwas made to provide for a separate pay scale for members of the Disciplined Services. This was brought into effect on the 1st April1988. Unfortunately, the Plaintiff and his colleagues were deemed to be holding civil jobs in the R.H.K.P.F. and were not includedon the new pay scale. The salary payable under the new scale was higher than the salary he received under the old scale - hence thepresent action.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. McCoy for the Plaintiff advised me that although Master O'Donnell did not give written reasons for his decision, one of his reasonsallowing the Defendant's application was that he considered that the Plaintiff should have sought relief by way of judicial reviewrather than by way of a writ of summons.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> To ascertain the answer to this question it is necessary to establish whether the right being pursued is of a private or a publicnature.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. McCoy was able to refer me to a case which was almost entirely relevant to this question which had recently been decided by theCourt of Appeal. It was the case of McLaren v. Home Office  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1990%20COD%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990 COD 257).</a> Lord Justice Dillon had this to say at p. 257:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"A statutory corporation, such as a nationalised industry or a health authority or for that matter a local authority, has ... powerto enter into a contractual relationship by a contract of service with an officer or staff whom it may engage, and in relation toprison officers the Home Office must be in the same position; the exercise of a statutory power to appoint staff is free from restrictioninherent in an exercise of the Prerogative ...[T]he question  whether a public body having power to enter into a contract of servicewith a particular individual has or has not done so in a particular case must necessarily be a question of private, and not of publiclaw. The function discharged by prison officers is of great importance to the public, but so is that of doctors and nursing staffunder the National Health Service, and their appointments are a matter of private law - R. v. East Berkshire Health Authority, exp.Walsh."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>I have no doubt that this is a correct statement of the law and that the Plaintiff was right in commencing this action by writ ratherthan seeking a judicial review</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> This then leads to the next question which is whether the Plaintiff is able to demonstrate that he and his colleagues do have contractsof employment with the Hong Kong Government.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> This question was considered by Roberts C.J. in Lam Yuk Ming and Ors v.

We suppose that it is seeking the advantages of a contract without the drawbacks. Thatis to say that it regards the public officer as bound by G.Rs. but does not want this to give rise to any contractual relationshipof a kind which would enable the officer to enforce G.Rs. against the Crown.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">                C.S.R.2 states that G.Rs. are made by the Governor, that authority for their interpretation is vested in him andthat "they have no force in law", save in so far as they are set out in an Ordinance or Act.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">                To say that the Governor is the authority for their interpretation can be said to mean, in theory, that the Governorcan construe a Regulation in any way which he thinks fit, though in practice he would be unlikely to do this in a wholly unreasonableway. Such a provision may weaken the reliance which a public officer can place on G.Rs., but does not strike at their nature. Thereference to having "no force in law" appears to be no more than an indication, to persons unfamiliar with the niceties of legislation,in its many disguises, that these regulations are not legislative in effect.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">                We conclude that there is an intention on both sides to enter a binding contract. The public officer does so withoutreservation. The Crown also intends to enter a contract by which the officer shall be bound but not itself, though the appointeeis not warned of the lop-sided nature of the contract, as seen by the Crown. There is no hint that he must keep his promises, butthat the Crown need not.                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">We decide that there is a contract between the Crown and its servants and that its terms should be, and are, mutually enforceable,even though this contract contains one anomalous provision (the power of dismissal at pleasure) which overrides the contract and,if used, effectively negates the usual relationship of employer and employee. Col. Regs. do not form part of that contract."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> For the Plaintiff to succeed in the litigation he will need to demonstrate that it is not open to the Hong Kong Government to unilaterallychance the terms of the contract of employment.  There seems to be little doubt that there is nothing to prevent the Government fromeffecting changes and modifications to the various regulations relating to the employment. However, it is doubtful whether a basicalteration could be made by the Government unilaterally such as changing the basis upon which the employee is remunerated. RobertsC.J. deals with this problem at p. 830 of his judgment:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"It is not unusual for contracts to contain some terms which can be altered at the option of one party only for example, many leasesallow for an increase of rent at the option of the landlord alone. There is thus no objection in principle to a provision in a contractwhereby one party can alter some of its conditions without agreement, so long as this overriding provision was within the terms ofthe main contract which he entered. With hesitation, we conclude that that principle is applicable also when any term is capableof unilateral variation; and that such a clause does not destroy the contractual relationship between the Crown and public officers;however vulnerable the latter may be as a result. At least public officers can enforce the terms of the contract; so long as theyare in force."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> For the Defendant to succeed in a strike out application he must show that the Plaintiff has no prospect whatever of success in thelitigation. I have only dealt in the briefest outline with the issues which will arise in this case. It is, however, evident to methat it is by no means certain that the Plaintiff will not succeed in his claim. Certainly a case has not been made out to justifythe action being dismissed as an abuse of the process of the court.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The final matter I have to deal with is the application under Order 15 rule 12.  Miss Cheng for the Defendant contended that thePlaintiff should not be entitled to proceed by way of class action and represent his colleagues interests. She placed heavy relianceupon Markt &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Knight Steamship Co. Ltd. 1910 2KB 1021 in support of her submission. with respect I do not think thatshe was right. The relevant principals have been helpfully set out by Vinelott J. in Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Newman IndustriesLtd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981%201%20Ch%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1981 1 Ch. 229.</a> The headnote to the case conveniently encapsulates the circumstances where a Plaintiff may represent the interests of other parties.It reads: -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Held, (1) that the court had jurisdiction to entertain a representative action brought by a plaintiff suing on behalf of himselfand all other members of a class where each member had a separate cause of action in tort provided (i) that the relief claimed inthe representative action could not have the effect that it might confer a right of action on a member of the class which the membercould not have asserted in a separate action or to bar a defence which might otherwise have been available to the defendant in aseparate action, (ii) that there was an "interest" shared by all members of the class represented, and (iii) that it was for thebenefit of the class that the plaintiff be permitted to sue in a representative capacity and, for the purpose of condition (iii),the court had to be satisfied that the issues common to every member of the class would be decided after full discovery and in thelight of all the evidence capable of being adduced in favour of the claim (post, pp. 251H-252B, 254F-255E).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Although Vinelott, J. was dealing with a case involving a tort I can see no reason why the principles being propounded should notbe equally applicable to a contractual situation.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I accept that on the material which is presently available the Plaintiff should not encounter any difficulty in meeting the requirementswhich are referred to by Vinelott, J.

I am not aware of any disparity in their situation, such as to render a classaction to be impracticable.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> For the reasons I have given I am satisfied that Master O'Donnell should have dismissed the Defendant's application.
