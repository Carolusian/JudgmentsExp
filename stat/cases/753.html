On 15 October 2009, P filed Notice to Act in Personand applied for legal aid. At the hearing on 19 October 2009, I declined to lift the legal aid stay and further adjourned the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Summonses to a date to be fixed for substantive argument.  On 4 December 2009, Pâs former solicitors once again filed Notice toAct for P in these proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 23 February 2010, pending the hearing for substantive argument in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Summonses, P amended his pleadings without leave and filed/served <i>inter alia</i> (a) his Amended Writ of Summons indorsed with the Amended SOC (âASOCâ), (b) his Answer to Dsâ request for FBP of the SOC and(c) his Voluntary Particulars of the ASOC (âVPâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 26 February 2010, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Summonses came before me again for substantive argument.  Although Ds merely objected to a few paragraphs in the ASOC, the allegedoffending paragraphs must be understood in the context of the whole pleading that spread over 97 pages. I therefore directed theparties to first proceed with the hearing of the striking out application.  Eventually the hearing ran out of time, and I adjournedDsâ application for FBP of the ASOC for future disposal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In respect of Dsâ striking out application, Mr Lam leading Ms Ho, counsel for the P, conceded that (a) Â§Â§121-124 of the ASOC(1<sup>st</sup> Summons) and (b) Pâs claim against D1 and D3 under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284">Cap.284</a> in Â§148 of the SOC (2<sup>nd</sup> Summons) should be deleted from the pleading.  In fact, the plea in (b) above has been deleted in the ASOC.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  By amendment of the SOC without leave, Plaintiff added further prayers of relief against D1 and D3 in the ASOC.  Mr Chang, counselfor Ds, therefore conceded that notwithstanding suggestion to contrary in the 1<sup>st</sup> Summons, Pâs claim against D1 and D3 in this action could not be struck out in their entirety even if the alleged offending paragraphsin the ASOC as identified in the 1<sup>st</sup> Summons were struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Ds filed the affidavit of their solicitor Sousa Richard Alvaro dated 20July 2009 in support of the 1<sup>st</sup> Summons.  He asserted that Â§111 (and first part of Â§148), Â§119 (and consequentially Â§120), Â§142 and Â§147, and consequentiallyrelief 3(a)-(d) of the SOC (now ASOC)failed to contain the necessary particulars for a claim based on fraud, deceit or conspiracy,andsuch failure offended the fundamental rule that the fullest particulars must be given in the body of the pleading (rather than byway of FBP) for such serious matters. Dsâ solicitors wrote to Pâs solicitors on 15 July 2009 to intimate possible issuance ofa striking out application unless P voluntarily amended the SOC to delete the offending paragraphs.  There was no reply, so Ds issuedthe 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Summonses.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">II.  <i>Overview of ASOC</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In order to appreciate the partiesâ respective stance over the alleged offending paragraphs as identified in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Summonses, it is necessary to give an overview of the pleaded averments in the ASOC, which are very wide-ranging and which I shallattempt to summarise below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  D1 and D2 were husband and wife and together with D3 operated businesses through limited companies owned, controlled and/or managedby them including Lead Asia Pacific Limited (âLead Asiaâ) and D7.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  By 2 Memoranda of Sale both dated 15 April 2007, Mancas Investment Limited (âMancasâ) sold House 65 and House 84 of The Givernyin Sai Kung (âHouse 65â and âHouse 84â) to Lead Asia and D7 for HK$35,500,000.00 and HK$23,480,000.00 respectively.

Induced by and in reliance of such representation, P agreed in principle to pay D2 a sum of HK$3,522,000.00 for the purchase ofthe loan capital of D7.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  D2 then engaged D4 to prepare the necessary legal documents. On 5 October 2007, D1, D2, D3 and P attended a meeting at D4âs offices. During the meeting, D5 (a) confirmed he would be the solicitor in charge of the matter on their behalf, (b) gave a copy of the FASPfor House 84 to P, (c) referred P to the provisions in Schedule 4 thereof (which set out the payment terms), and (d) verbally representedthat D2 had advanced and D7 had in turn paid 3 sums of HK$1,174,000.00 each (totalling HK$3,522,000.00) to Mancas as deposits (âD5Deposit Payment Representationâ).  D5 also showed P a draft agreement to be entered between P and D2 for the sale and purchaseof the share capital and loan capital of D7, which agreement D2 executed (âPrincipal Agreementâ). Induced by and in relianceof (a) the D1, D2 and D3 Deposit Payment Representation, (b) the D5 Deposit Payment Representation, and (c) the D2 âNo MaterialLiabilityâ Representation referred to in paragraph 18 below, P also executed the Principal Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  P claimed that the D1, D2 and D3 Deposit Payment Representation was evidenced by Recital (3) and the First Schedule of the PrincipalAgreement which stated in effect that D2 had advanced to D7 a loan of HK$3,522,000.00 being the entire loan capital of D7.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Paragraph 13.1 of the Third Schedule of the Principal Agreement also provided that   â[there] are no material outstanding contracts,engagements or liabilities whether ascertained or contingent and whether quantified or disputed by [D7]â (âD2 âNo MaterialLiabilityâ Representationâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Under the Principal Agreement, the total consideration payable by P was HK$6,522,000.00 comprising (a) the share capital of D7 inthe sum of HK$3,000,000.00 payable by 2 promissory notes (âPNsâ) to D1 in the sums of HK$1,000,000.00 and HK$2,000,000.00 andmaturing on 1 December 2007 and 30 March 2008 respectively (âPN1â and âPN2â), and (b) the loan capital of D7 in the sum ofHK$3,522,000.00 payable by cashier order or solicitor firmâs cheque upon completion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 5 October 2007, P gave PN1 and PN2 to D1 pursuant to the Principal Agreement.  About 2 weeks later, P decided to reduce his riskexposure and sent a letter backdated to 5 October 2007 to D2. Such letter was intended to be a shareholdersâ agreement betweenP and D2 for treating the transaction as a 50/50 joint venture between them and for proposing that P would only be entitled to a<i>pro rata</i> share of the profit if House 84 were sold before cash participation from him (ie his profit share would be calculated according tothe ratio between the respective actual cash contributions by P and D2).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Upon receipt of such letter, D2 instructed D4 to prepare a supplemental agreement. In mid-October 2007, P and D2 attended D4âsoffices to execute such supplemental agreement amongst P, D2 and D7, which was backdated to 5 October 2007 and supplemental to thePrincipal Agreement (âSupplemental Agreementâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Clause 1 of the Supplemental Agreement provided <i>inter alia</i> that P and D7 agreed that if within 365 days from the completion of the sale and purchase of the share capital and loan capital ofD7, House 84 was sold for more than HK$23,480,000.00, P and/or D7 shall pay 50% of the excess sum over and above HK$23,480,000.00as <i>ex gratia</i> payment to D2 within 3 days of the completion of such sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  However, the Supplemental Agreement did not deal with any necessary changes to the rights and obligations of P and D2.  After negotiations,P and D2 executed a shareholdersâ agreement and a profit-sharing agreement (âShareholdersâ Agreementâ and âProfit SharingAgreementâ) which were prepared by D3.  Under such agreements, P and D2 agreed to share the profit (if any) on the intended sub-saleof House 84 in accordance with the ratio of their respective actual cash contributions made before the completion of such sub-sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The Shareholdersâ Agreement provided that (a) in addition to PN1 and PN2 P shall on the date of completion have the right to issue2 further PNs for the respective sums of HK$3,261,000.00 and HK$261,000.00 (âPN3â and âPN4â) as settlement for the purchaseof the loan capital of D7, (b) both P and D2 shall use their best endeavours to sell House 84 but at a resale price to be agreedbetween them if any of the 4 PNs were outstanding, (c) if the resale price exceeded HK$23,480,000.00 both parties would share theprofit as separately agreed, and (d) if P did not redeem PN3 D2 would have the right to convert the value of PN3 into new sharesto be issued by D7 so that D2 would become a shareholder of D7 once again and P and D2 shall jointly own D7 on 50/50 basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  By entering into the above agreements with P, D2 by conduct impliedly represented that she intended to fully perform such agreements(ie to transfer the share capital and loan capital in D7 to P and to allow P to have a share in the profit to be made on the sub-saleof House 84) (âPerformance Intention Representationâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  P and D2 agreed to postpone the completion under the Principal Agreement which eventually took place on 2 November 2007.  Pursuantto the Principal and Supplemental Agreements, P gave PN3 and PN4 (which PNs were prepared by D3) to D2 and completed his part undersuch agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Since 2 November 2007, each of D1, D2 and D3 repeatedly represented to P that the share transaction had been completed on that dayand P had become the owner of the shareholdings in D7 (âShare/Loan Ownership Representationâ), and P was under the belief that(a) D4 would deal with all necessary steps to complete the transfer of the share capital and loan capital of D7 to P, (b) he hadbecome the sole owner of the shareholdings in D7, and (c) the only outstanding matter was for him to redeem the 4 PNs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On 22 and 23 November 2007, D1 though a third party reminded P to redeem PN1 on time if he wanted to have a share in the profitto be made on the sub-sale of House 84. By such conduct, D1 and D2 repeated the Performance Intention Representation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  On/about 23 November 2007, D3 requested P to remit HK$1,000,000.00 to D6âs bank account.  On 29 November 2007, induced by andin reliance of (a) the D1, D2, D3 Deposit Payment Representation, (b) the D5 Deposit Payment Representation, (c) the PerformanceIntention Representation, and (d) the Share/Loan Ownership Representation, and at the requests of D1 and D3, P remitted the sumsof HK$930,000.00 and HK$66,000.00 (totalling HK$996,000.00) (âSumâ) to D6âs bank account in order to redeem PN1.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  At a meeting amongst D1, D2 and P on 3 December 2007, D1 and D2 represented to P that given his frequent absence from Hong Kong(which made it inconvenient for D4 to arrange for him to execute legal documents for the sub-sale of House 84) and D2âs inabilityto execute such legal documents (in view of the agreements between P and D2), D5 advised that P and D2 should cancel the transactionso that the shareholdings in D7 would revert back from P to D2 who could then execute such legal documents (âCancellation NeedRepresentationâ), and in return D1 and D2 promised P they would pay him the Sum together with his profit share upon completionof the sub-sale of House 84.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  P agreed to the suggestion, and on the same day P and D2 attended D4âs offices to execute a written cancellation agreement. D5showed them an engrossment copy of such agreement between P and D2 which provided <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âNOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">1.       The Vendor and the Purchaser hereby cancel [the Principal Agreement] and the Supplemental Agreement to the intent that [thePrincipal Agreement] and the Supplemental Agreement shall hereafter in all aspects be null and void and the Vendor hereby releasesthe Purchaser and the Purchaser hereby releases the Vendor from the respective obligation contained in the [Principal] Agreementand the Supplemental Agreement.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">2.       The Vendor shall on the signing hereof repay to the Purchaser the sum of [HK$3,000,000.00] paid by the Purchaser under thesaid Agreement by way of return of promissory notes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">3.       Upon signing this Cancellation Agreement, the parties shall have no further claims or actions whatsoever against each other.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">4.       Each party shall bear its own costs for and incidental to the preparation, completion and registration of this CancellationAgreement.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  P wanted to amend Clause 3 above, but D2 said D5 would require time to revise the agreement if P insisted on the amendment, andin any event there was truly no need to worry or to amend.  She promised to refund the Sum to P and pay him his profit share uponcompletion of the sub-sale of House 84 on 15 January 2008.  Notwithstanding any cancellation agreement, D2 would give P a PN (âSumPNâ) in the amount of the Sum with maturity date on 15 January 2008 after the meeting (â1<sup>st</sup> Payment Promiseâ).  But upon enquiry from P, D2 refused to disclose the details of whether there was a sub-sale of House 84 andif so what the sub-sale price was.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Induced by and in reliance of the 1<sup>st</sup> Payment Promise, P executed the cancellation agreement (âCancellation Agreementâ) which he would not have done so but for suchpromise by D2.  Notwithstanding Clause 3 of the Cancellation Agreement, P never intended to forfeit any part of the Sum. In any event,D2âs failure or refusal to tell P about the sub-sale price of House 84 amounted to a breach of the Shareholdersâ Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  After the meeting on 3 December 2007, P asked D2 for the Sum PN, but D2 asked him to return the following week to collect the same. D2 still failed to give P the Sum PN when he returned the following week. P doubted whether D2 would honour the 1<sup>st</sup> Payment Promise, so on 28 December 2007 and 14 January 2008 respectively he demanded D2 to refund the Sum and instructed D4 to earmarkthe Sum for remittance to his bank account, but D4 replied they had no instructions to deduct the Sum from the sub-sale proceedspayable to D7 and asked P to settle the issue of the Sum with D2 directly.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  On 15 January 2008, the sub-sale of House 84 was completed, but D2 failed to fulfill the 1<sup>st</sup> Payment Promise by not paying P the Sum or any profit share.  In late March 2008, D2 told P his profit share was between HK$200,000.00and HK$300,000.00.  On 3 April 2008, P demanded D2 to refund the Sum and to pay his profit share in the sum of about HK$200,000.00together with other expenses by 9 April 2008.  On 21 April and 19 August 2008, Pâs solicitors wrote to D2 to demand refund of theSum, but D2 still failed or refused to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On 2 September 2008, during a meeting with P at the new offices of D1âs group of companies in Sheung Wan (âHang Fat Officeâ),D1 and D2 represented to P that (a) P was a shareholder of D7 (thereby repeating the Share/Loan Ownership Representation) and (b)they could not repay the Sum to P because it was necessary for P to sign and execute some documents for transferring his shareholdingsin D7 back to D2 (â1<sup>st</sup> Non-Payment Reason (Transfer) Representationâ).  They also promised P that they would refund the Sum in 2 instalments by 30 September2008 upon signing and executing such documents (â2<sup>nd</sup> Payment Promiseâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  On 3 September 2008, P demanded D2 to pay HK$500,000.00 (âPart Sumâ) in the following week to fulfill the 2<sup>nd</sup> Payment Promise.  At another meeting at the Hang Fat Office attended by P, D1, D2 and D3, D1 and D2 told P that D2 could not refundthe Sum to him by 30 September 2008 because it was necessary for P as shareholder of D7 to sign and execute some documents in orderto transfer his shareholdings in D7 back to D2 (ie repeating the Share/Loan Ownership Representation and the 1<sup>st</sup> Non-Payment Reason (Transfer) Representation).  D1 and D2 further represented to P that also because of the need to resolve the profittax issue in respect of D7âs sub-sale of House 84 (âTax Issueâ), they could not refund the Sum to P (â2<sup>nd</sup> Non-Payment Reason (Tax) Representationâ).  Each of D1, D2 and D3 represented to P that they would require 3 months to settle theTax Issue and to transfer Pâs shareholdings in D7 back to D2 before refunding the Sum to P, but they promised to pay P his profitshare and as much as possible of the remaining balance of the Sum within the 3 months.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  At the same meeting, D1 offered to pay P a sum of HK$200,000.00 as ânon-repayable loanâ in return for Pâs promise to withholdlegal action for a period of 6 months from 16 September 2008 to 16 March 2009 (âNon-Repayable Loanâ).  Since it was better thannothing and there was no viable alternative, P accepted D1âs cheque for HK$200,000.00 and agreed to withhold legal action for 6months as requested in the belief that D1 and D2 would be able to resolve the outstanding issue of the transfer of the share capitaland loan capital of D7 back to D2 as well as the Tax Issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  D1 gave P a cheque for HK$200,000.00 at the same meeting and requested P to write some words on the photocopy of the cheque (â1<sup>st</sup> Noteâ).  In fact, D1 dictated the following words to P who wrote them down on the 1<sup>st</sup> Note: âThis is to confirm [D1] lend me the above sum and will be repaid from the resolution of [D7], owner of [House 84] &amp;after transfer company back to [D2]â. At the request of D1, D2 and D3, P signed the 1<sup>st</sup> Note to acknowledge the matters stated therein. By using the words âafter transfer company back to [D2]â in the 1<sup>st</sup> Note, D1, D2 and D3 in effect repeated the Share/Loan Ownership Representation and tried to reinforce Pâs belief that he and notD2 still owned the shareholdings in D7.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  At a lunch meeting on 17 September 2008 attended by P, D1, D2, D3 and 2 other persons, D1 dictated some words to D3 who wrote themdown on a piece of paper (â2<sup>nd</sup> Noteâ) and P wrote the words âwithin 6 monthsâ at the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âI, [P] has received HK$200,000.00 from [D1] as a loan and that serves as the initial settlement of my planned investment in [D7].</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">I hereby declare that I shall not take any legal action in respect of my shareholding in the company until the tax issues of thatcompany has been resolved within 6 months.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">At the time when settlement arises in respect of my planned investment in [D7], the HK$200,000.00 loan extended by [D1] shall be appliedtowards the settlement proceeds without being required to be repaid.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">D1, D2, D3 and P agreed that the contents of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Note represented the terms of their agreement to resolve the problem of the failure by D1, D2 and D3 to refund money to P and topay him his profit share.  At the request of D1, D2 and D3, P signed the 2<sup>nd</sup> Note to acknowledge the matters stated therein.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  By using the words âmy shareholding in the companyâ, âuntil the tax issues of that company has been resolvedâ and âI shallnot take any action â¦â¦ within 6 monthsâ in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Note, D1, D2 and D3 in effect repeated the Share/Loan Ownership Representation and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Non-Payment Reason (Tax) Representation, and acknowledged that P had a right to take legal action against them which he promisedto withhold for 6 months from 16 September 2008 to 16 March 2009 as the condition for D1âs offer to pay P the Non-Repayable Loan. They tried to reinforce Pâs belief that he and not D2 still owned the shareholdings in D7 and that the Tax Issue was a genuineissue that had to be resolved before D1, D2 and D3 could refund money to P and pay him his profit share.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  On 5 November and 4 and 16 December 2008, P demanded D2 to repay HK$300,000.00 (being the Part Sum less the Non-Repayable Loan receivedon 16 September 2008) before 21 December 2008. On 22 and 25 December 2008 and 17 January 2009, P demanded D1, D2 and D3 for fullrepayment of the sum of HK$796,000.00 (being the Sum less the Non-Repayable Loan) and his profit share. D1 and D2 admitted the debtof HK$800,000.00, but D1, D2 and D3 refused to pay any further sum to P.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  P did withhold legal action for a period of 6 months from 16 September 2008 to 16 March 2009, but upon expiry of such period D1,D2 and D3 still failed to fulfill the 3<sup>rd</sup> Payment Promise.  They did not (a) request P to sign or execute any documents for the transfer of Pâs shareholdings in D7 backto D2 or (b) give P any further update on the current status of the Tax Issue or any explanation for non-payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  P has since about 15 January 2008 chased D1, D2 and D3 for the return of the 4 PNs, but they failed or refused to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Since 30 March 2009, P discovered the following facts and matters:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)  On 14 December 2007, Lead Asia completed the purchase of House 65 for use as the residence of D1, D2 and their family.

Clause 3 of theCancellation Agreement was extremely unfair to P, absurd in all the circumstances, and inexplicable other than fraud having beenpractised on P by D2.  Hence, the Cancellation Agreement was not binding on P. Further, there was no mention of Pâs payment ofthe Sum to D6 or how the Sum received by D6 should be accounted for by D2 or D6.

Such orders are not made in the exercise of discretion but in compliance with therules.

The court therefore has to scrutinise such voluntary particulars tosee whether they sufficiently support the pleaded averment that D1, D2 and D3 had knowledge of falsity of the 4 Reps or were recklessin not caring whether they were true or false.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Paragraph 5 of the VP first asserts that the state of knowledge of falsity and/or recklessness on the part of D1, D2 and D3 is self-evident. In my view, such assertion is unhelpful and insufficient. D1, D2 and D3 are entitled to require P to provide particulars of thespecific facts and/or overt acts that show knowledge of falsity or recklessness on their part.  To say that such facts and mattersare self-evident is no answer, especially when Â§111 of the ASOC does not refer to or incorporate any other paragraphs in the pleading.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Paragraph 5 of the VP then goes on to aver that alternatively the state of knowledge of falsity and/or recklessness on the partof D1, D2 and D3 can be inferred from the whole circumstances as pleaded in the ASOC.  This is again unhelpful and insufficient. General references to all matters pleaded elsewhere in the ASOC do not suffice for the burden falls on the pleader to specify hiscase and it is not for the other party to work out (or worse still, to infer) what his case may be.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  P then goes on in paragraph 5 of the VP to refer to certain facts and matters but makes clear that his reliance on them is inclusiveand not exhaustive.  This opens the possibility that P will call evidence or rely upon other matters not specifically identified. In such circumstances, such particulars do not suffice for they fail to let D1, D2 and D3 know the precise case they have to meetor the precise scope of the matters upon which they must prepare their evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  What then are the facts or matters referred to in paragraph 5 of the VP?  They cover 2 aspects. On the first aspect, P asserts thatD1, D2 and D3 well knew and ought to know whether in fact the 4 Reps were true or not.  It is unclear from such averment whetherP is alleging actual and direct knowledge on the part of each of D1, D2 and D3 in respect of each of the 4 Reps or whether he isclaiming that some or all of D1, D2 and D3 merely ought to know the falsity of the 4 Reps.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In <i>ADS v Wheelock Marden &amp; Company Limited &amp; ors</i> CACV88/1992 (unreported, 15 March 1993), Mortimer J said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â 19.

Wood (Harrow) Ltd.</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%202%20QB%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 2 Q.B. 601.â</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">(see also paragraph 64 above).  In light of the above, I am of the view that the roll-up allegation that D1, D2 and D3 well knew andought to know if made without particulars are defective, confusing and cannot be allowed.  In the course of the hearing before me,Mr Lam submitted that P mainly relied on actual and direct knowledge of falsity on the part of D1, D2 and D3, and P âwould notinsistâ on reliance of any duty of knowledge by the words âought to knowâ.  However, such submission is extraneous to and doesnot reflect the state of Pâs particularised pleading which relies on both aspects, and which pleading is therefore confusing andimpossible for D1, D2 and D3 to plead.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  But in paragraph 5 of the VP P goes further to say that D1, D2 and D3 well knew and ought to know the falsity of the 4 Reps âbyreason of their positions in [D7], their involvement in the affairs of [D7] and their close relationship with one anotherâ.  Doesthis amount to sufficient particularity to save Â§111 of the ASOC from being struck out?  In my view, the language of such avermentis general and imprecise, and such general particulars neither limit Pâs case nor inform D1, D2 and D3 clearly the case they haveto meet.  For example, what precisely are âtheir positionsâ in D7 when the whole ASOC does not refer to any position in D7 heldby D1? As further example, paragraph 5 of the VP does not spell out the overt acts of the alleged âinvolvementâ by each of D1,D2 and D3 in D7 even though it is trite that the pleader has to specify his case. As regards the alleged close relationship amongstD1, D2 and D3, it is unclear from paragraph 5 of the VP what the nature of the alleged close relationship is.  After all, Mr Lamconfirmed that P would not rely on D1âs marriage relationship with D2 to establish any knowledge or duty of knowledge as to thefalsity of the 4 Reps on the part of D1.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In short, paragraph 5 of the VP fails to lend sufficient particularity to Pâs primary pleaded case as to knowledge of falsityor recklessness. In a further attempt to make good Â§111 of the ASOC, Mr Lam put forward certain particulars in paragraph 14(1)-(4)of his written skeleton arguments (see paragraph 60 above) drawn from various specific paragraphs in the ASOC.  Mr Lam has been carefulin not relying on any fact or matter that is extraneous to the ASOC and/or the VP in mounting resistance to the striking out application. After all, the VP that purports to give particulars of knowledge of falsity and recklessness in Â§111 of the ASOC was filed only3 days prior to the substantive hearing before me, and P did not issue any summons for leave to re-amend the ASOC or present anydraft re-amendment of the ASOC for consideration by the court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  As an initial observation, whilst the facts stated in the specific paragraphs of the ASOC cited in paragraph 14(1)-(4) of Mr Lamâswritten skeleton arguments are part of Pâs pleadings, neither Â§111 of the ASOC nor paragraph 5 of the VP makes specific referenceto these particular facts and/or matters apart from a general reference to the positions held by D1, D2 and D3 in D7, their involvementin the affairs of D7 and their close relationship with one another.  Thus, I find it impossible for D1, D2 and D3 to work out fromthe ASOC which exceeds 150 paragraphs and comprises 97 pages that these specific paragraphs are the relevant particulars which Prelies.  In my view, it is impermissible for a proper pleading to require D1, D2 and D3 to speculate what facts P relies for allegingor drawing inference of knowledge of falsity and/or recklessness, or tohave them appreciate such facts onlywith the aid of extraneousguidance by way of counselâs written submissions which are neither pleading nor particulars.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Even so, I still turn to the facts and matters mentioned in paragraph 14(1)-(4) of Mr Lamâs written skeleton arguments to seeif Â§111 of the ASOC can be salvaged by re-amendment of the pleading.  Having considered Mr Lamâs and Mr Changâs submissionsdescribed in paragraph 60 above in respect of D2âs alleged knowledge of falsity or recklessness, it appears that P relies on thefact that D2 was the sole shareholder and sole director of D7 to say that it must be well within her knowledge that the 4 Reps arefalse and untrue.  In my view, given the nature of the 4 Reps (which relate to payments for a property transaction by D7 and transferof shares of D7 from D2 to P), an averment that D2 was the sole shareholder and sole director of D7 at all material times (whichfact is specifically raised only in paragraph 14 of Mr Lamâs written skeleton arguments and not in Â§111 of the ASOC or paragraph5 of the VP) may well be sufficient to survive an application to strike out Â§111 of the ASOC vis-Ã -vis D2. I therefore considerit proper to afford P the opportunity to re-amend, and to order that Â§111 of the ASOC insofar as the same relates to D2 be struckout only in default of proper re-amendment by pleading such averment in support of D2âs knowledge of falsity or recklessness.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In respect of D1 and D3, the matters specified in paragraph 14 of Mr Lamâs written skeleton arguments on which P intends to relyin support of the averment of knowledge of falsity or recklessness on the part of D1 and D3 are essentially: (a) D1 and D3 actedas agents of D2 during negotiations, (b) D1 and D3 <i>inter alia</i> owned, controlled and/or managed <i>inter alia</i> D7 (which end conclusion in the pleading is unsupported by any overt act or fact, especially when it is emphasised that D2 was thesole shareholder and sole director of D7 at the material time), and (c) D3 was secretary of D7.  At the hearing before me, Mr Lamrelied on further facts or matters pleaded in Â§92(b) and Â§104A of the ASOC, ie that D1 signed the PASP for the sub-sale of House84 on behalf of D7 without Pâs knowledge, and that D3 signed the 2008 annual return of D7.  It has been argued that the necessaryinference to be drawn from these facts and matters is that D1 and D3 were intimately involved in the management of D7 and in relatedtransactions arising from various agreements between P and D2, and it therefore follows that D1 and D3 had knowledge of falsity orrecklessness at the time when the 4 Reps were made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  I agree with Mr Lam that the position of D1 and D3 is different from that of D2.  But in respect of D1 and D3, I am not persuadedthat it can be reasonably or arguably inferred from the assertions of primary facts and matters described in the above paragraphthat D1 and D3 were involved in the overall management of D7 from which it can be further inferred that they had knowledge of falsityof the 4 Reps or that D1 and D3 were reckless in not caring whether they were true or false at the time when the 4 Reps were made.Such piling of one layer of inference upon another in order to obtain the end conclusion must be viewed with caution. Upon carefulconsideration, I am not persuaded that the above two-tiered inference reasonably flows from any or all of the following acts by D1and/or D3, ie signing annual return of D7, acting as company secretary of D7, signing documents in a related transaction and/or actingas agents for D2 during negotiations. Rather, I find such alleged inference speculative.  Conjecture has no place in a proper pleading,so the plea in Â§111 of the ASOC insofar as it relates to D1 and D3 is accordingly struck out. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">VI.  <i>Conspiracy : Â§Â§119 and</i> <i>120(a)-(e)</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Ds sought to strike out Â§119 of the ASOC which provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â[D1, D2, D3 and D5] (or any two or more together) wrongfully and within intent to injure [P] and/or to cause loss to [P] by unlawfulmeans conspired and combined together to defraud [P] and to conceal such fraud and the proceeds of such fraud from [P].

conspiracy to injure by lawful means and conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. There is no dispute that by Â§119 of the ASOC P purports to raise a case of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means in which theparticipants combine together to perform acts which were by themselves unlawful.  According to <i>Total Lubricants Hong Kong Limited</i>, the claimant must plead and prove the following necessary elements: (a) a combination or agreement between two or more individuals,(b) an intent to injure, (c) pursuant to which combination or agreement and with that intention certain acts were carried out, and(d) resulting loss and damage (see paragraph 81 of the judgment).  For the purpose of the present striking out application, Mr Changwas prepared to concede that the elements in (b), (c) and (d) above had been sufficiently pleaded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  It is apparent from the above that the essence of the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means is injury to the claimant asa result of unlawful act or acts where 2 or more people have combined to cause the injury.  It is not necessary for all the conspiratorsto join the conspiracy at the same time or for every overt act to be done by every conspirator, but the conspirators must be sufficientlyaware of the relevant circumstances and share the same common purpose at the time when they acted in concert pursuant to the conspiracy,and the relevant overt act(s) must be done pursuant to the conspiracy, scheme or combination. Acting in concert requires agreementbut not necessarily an express agreement (see element (a) in the paragraph 81 above).  It is sufficient if 2 or more persons deliberatelycombine with a common intention whether expressly or tacitly to achieve a common end.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Conspiracies by their nature are often concealed, and hence the conspiratorial combination or agreement can be inferred from overtacts if it is proved that the conspirators knew what was going on.  So in most cases where conspiracy is averred, it will be necessaryto look at the overt acts as pleaded to see what inferences can be drawn as to the existence or otherwise of the alleged conspiratorialcombination or agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Barker JA in <i>Marquis Trading Co &amp; ors v Associated Bankers Insurance Co Ltd &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20HKLR%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] HKLR 434</a>, 440 cited with approval the earlier edition of <i>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacobs on Precedents of Pleadings</i> in which it was stated that a statement of claim on conspiracy to defraud should describe the parties to such conspiracy and theirrelationship with each other, and also allege the agreement between the defendants to conspire as well as state precisely what wasthe purpose/object of the alleged conspiracy.

And the overt act or overt acts pleaded must be suchas to show: (i) that the conspiratorial agreement alleged against the defendants had been entered into by each and every one of them;(ii) that the agreement, and not merely the intention of one person alone, was implemented; and (iii) that such implementation causedthe damage complained of.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">If the pleader fails to do that, then, depending on whether the failure is in respect of all the defendants or only some or one ofthem, then either the plea is liable to be struck out altogether or it is liable to be struck out as against some or one of the defendants.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Reverting to what ADS pleads as overt acts, one sees that the only acts pleaded are the alleged express misrepresentations and, ifsuch a thing is an act, the fact that none of them were corrected.

He argued that the only relevant averment was â[D1, D2, D3 and D5] (or any two or more together) wrongfully â¦â¦ conspired andcombined togetherâ in Â§119 of the ASOC, but such averment was unclear as to whether there was 1 conspiratorial combination oragreement amongst all of D1, D2, D3 and D5 or a number of combinations or agreements between 2 or more of them.  Mr Chang asked rhetoricallywho exactly were the participants of the conspiratorial combination(s) or agreement(s), when did such combination(s) or agreement(s)come into existence, and what the combination(s) or agreement(s) were about.  He also suggested that the overt acts pleaded in Â§120of the ASOC and specified in paragraph 6 of the VP at most constituted the unlawful acts and means allegedly carried out pursuantto the conspiracy and are not the material facts in respect of the conspiratorial combination(s) or agreement(s).  Mr Chang arguedthat P should not hope to muddy the waters by requiring Ds to combine Â§1 to Â§119 of the ASOC, paragraph 6 of the VP and paragraph15 of Mr Lamâs written skeleton arguments in order to second-guess the underlying facts and matters that identify the conspiratorialcombination(s) or agreement(s).  He claimed that this would be an onerous and impossible task, and hence Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) ofthe ASOC ought to be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Mr Lam in his oral submissions conceded that Â§119 of the ASOC could have been made clearer by spelling out the precise facts andmatters that went to show D1, D2, D3, D3 and D5 could not have acted independently but must have acted in a concerted manner thatinvolved conspiratorial combination(s) or agreement(s).  But he argued that the essence of Pâs plea of such conspiratorial combination(s),agreement(s) or scheme(s) could be gleaned from Â§119 and Â§120 of the ASOC, so there would be no difficulty for Ds to give instructionson Pâs averments in the ASOC in respect of the conspiracy claim and/or to plead to such claim. In short, Mr Lam submitted thatDs must know what was alleged against them so they could not have been embarrassed in meeting the relevant plea in the ASOC.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  It is trite that fraud and/or conspiracy must be distinctly pleaded with utmost particularity and distinctly proved, and it is notallowable to leave such pleas to be inferred from the facts (see <i>Davy v Garratt</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1877%5d%207%20Ch%20D%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1877] 7 Ch D 473</a>, 489).  But one must also consider the practical reality of modern commercial life.  As submitted by Mr Lam, fraud and/or conspiracyby their very nature are clandestine and difficult to uncover, so quite often proof is not readily obtained.  Hence, the avermentsof fraud and/or conspiracy cannot be too precise. In an application to strike out a fraud and/or conspiracy claim, the court willlook upon such application with care to the above considerations, but at the same time will bear in mind that loose allegations thatare not properly particularised will be oppressive as regards the defendants when the action goes to trial. The broad question forthe court is whether from the facts as pleaded it can be argued that Ds sufficiently know Pâs case on the conspiratorial combination(s)or agreement(s) that they have to meet.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Looking at Â§119 of the ASOC, it is in my view plainly undesirable and insufficient for P to ask Ds to infer the conspiratorialcombination or agreement from âthe facts and matters pleaded in the foregoing paragraphsâ when there are 118 paragraphs thatpreceded the end product or conclusion averred in Â§119 of the ASOC.  I am also mindful of Poon Jâs observation in paragraphs 18-19of his judgment in <i>Total Lubricants Hong Kong Limited</i> that inferences are pleas of evidence (not of material facts) and liable to be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  The same observation applies to the averment in paragraph 6 of the VP that the alleged conspiracy in Â§119 of the ASOC has beenfully pleaded and is self-evident or alternatively it can be inferred from the whole circumstances as pleaded in the ASOC.  Ds shouldnot be left to the impossible task of second guessing which particular averments in the whole ASOC that P relies to establish theconspiratorial combination(s) or agreement(s).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  But Mr Lam submitted that it could be inferred from Dsâ overt conduct in carrying out certain acts as particularised in Â§120(a)-(e)of the ASOC (see paragraph 78 above) that they have acted in concert under overall conspiratorial scheme(s), combination(s) or agreement(s).In my view, what one sees in Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC are the alleged overt acts <i>carried out by each of D1, D2, D3 and D5</i> âpursuant to and in furtherance of the conspiracyâ as pleaded in Â§119 of the ASOC (ie after the conspiratorial combination(s)or agreement(s) have been made) without any clear and cogent averment that establishes how these acts must have been <i>carried out by D1, D2, D3 and D5 in concert</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Paragraph 6 of the VP in saying that the conspiracy pleaded in Â§119 of the ASOC can be inferred from the whole circumstances aspleaded in the ASOC which âincluded (but not limited to)â the facts and matters set out therein is embarrassing in that it suffersfrom the defects as discussed in paragraphs 67-68 above. In making general references to all matters pleaded elsewhere in the ASOC,P has failed to specify his case with particularity and has left Ds to speculate what his case may be. Further, by adopting an inclusiveapproach to his pleading, it opens the possibility for P to call evidence or rely upon other matters not specifically identified. In short, the facts and matters given by P fail to let Ds know the case they have to meet or the scope of the matters upon whichthey must prepare their evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Turning to paragraph 15 of Mr Lamâs written skeleton arguments, it again suffers from the same problem in that the facts and mattersspecified therein said to give rise to Pâs claim for conspiracy and/or deceit are merely âinclusiveâ and not exhaustive. Dsare left to wonder what other underlying facts and matters P will rely on to raise a claim for conspiracy.  Mr Chang is right inpointing out that paragraph 15 of Mr Lamâs written arguments makes no mention of D5, and hence Ds are left to wonder whether Pis maintaining the allegation that D5 was a co-conspirator, and if so when and with whom D5 participated in any alleged conspiracy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Thus, the so-called plea of conspiratorial combination(s) or agreement(s) in Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC and in paragraph6 of the VP are insufficient to support the serious claim of conspiracy which requires utmost particularity.  Even so, I must gofurther to ask myself whether the defects in respect of Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC and paragraph 6 of the VP identified abovewhen viewed in the context of the extraordinarily complex web of pleading in the ASOC and of the facts and matters identified inparagraph 15 of Mr Lamâs written skeleton arguments are likely to be curable by re-amendment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  As explained above, in resisting the striking out application on behalf of P Mr Lam does not rely on any facts or matters extraneousto those pleaded in the ASOC. Indeed, no summons to re-amend the ASOC and no draft re-amendments have been placed before me for consideration. Even so, I am unable to say that distinct inference of participation by D1, D2, D3 and D5 in various parts of the alleged conspiratorialscheme(s), combination(s) or agreement(s) cannot be spelled out by drawing from the alleged conduct and acts of D1, D2 and D3 (otherthan the plea of fraudulent misrepresentation against D1 and D3 in respect of the 4 Reps which has been struck out â see paragraph76 above)in respect of the transactions concerning House 84, which P claims is fraudulent, and D5âs involvement in advising onand drafting documents for such transactions, especially when some of the overt acts as pleaded in Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC havebeen carried out by 2 or more of D1, D2, D3 and D5.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  I therefore consider it proper to afford P the opportunity to re-amend and to order Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC be struckout only in default of proper re-amendment that avers (a) the overt act(s) and fact(s)/particular(s) drawn from those acts, factsand/or matters already pleaded in the ASOC and in paragraph 6 of the VP (other than the plea of fraudulent misrepresentation by D1and D3 which has been struck out) which constitute the act(s) by all identified conspirators or alternatively the act(s) on behalfof each identified conspirator that necessarily show that they have been carried out by each and every one of them in concert pursuantto the conspiracy, and (b) the object of the alleged conspiracy or intention to injure.  In respect of (b), if the essence of theoverall conspiratorial scheme was to cause injury to P by making him part with the Sum or by failing to pay him his profit shareor for some other purpose, it should be expressly pleaded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">VII.  <i>Fraud : Â§142 of ASOC</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Ds sought to strike out Â§142 of the ASOC which provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAs [P] paid [the Sum] to [D6] by reason of fraud practised on him by [D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5], [D6] is not entitled to retain [theSum] received from [P].â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Paragraph 7 of the VP avers as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe frauds practised on [P] by [D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5] have been full pleaded in the [ASOC] and are self-evident or alternativelycan be inferred from the whole circumstances as pleaded in the [ASOC] which include (but are not limited to) the facts and mattersstated in paragraph 6 (a) to (s) above.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Mr Chang complained that without any cross-reference to other paragraph(s) in the ASOC, the alleged fraud pleaded in Â§142 of theASOC remained a bare allegation unsupported by any material facts and particulars.  In response, Mr Lamâs written skeleton argumentsrelied on the matters set out in paragraph 14 therein.  But I agree with Mr Chang that the issue here does not concern the sufficiencyof the plea of knowledge of falsity or recklessness addressed in paragraph 14 of Mr Lamâs written skeleton arguments, but ratherwith the factual particulars of the fraud itself.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  However, since the plea of fraudulent misrepresentation by D2 in Â§111 of the ASOCand the plea of conspiracy in respect of D1, D2,D3 and D5 in Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC are struck out only in default of proper re-amendment (see paragraphs 74 and 96 above),consequentially Â§142 of the ASOC insofar as the same relates to D2 is struck out only in default of proper re-amendment of Â§111of the ASOC and of Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC as aforesaid, and Â§142 of the ASOC insofar as the same relates to D1, D3,D4 and D5 is to be struck outonly in default of proper re-amendment of Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC as aforesaid.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">VIII.

Mr Chang argued that the claims for deceit and conspiracy werenot properly pleaded, so that the relief based on deceit and conspiracy (insofar as the same relates to D1, D2 and D3) must thereforebe struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  However, in respect of the plea relating to conspiracy in Â§147 of the ASOC, Mr Chang conceded that if I am not prepared to strikeout the conspiracy claim in Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC, then Â§147 of the ASOC insofar as it relates to conspiracy shouldstand.  On the other hand, I agree that if Â§119 of the ASOC is to be struck out, the foundation in support of the claim for damagesfor conspiracy in Â§147 of the ASOC falls away and must also be struck out.  Hence, it consequentially follows that the claim fordamages for conspiracy in Â§147 and in relief 3(a) of the ASOCinsofar as the same relates to D1, D2 and D3 be struck out only indefault of proper re-amendment of Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC as aforesaid.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  In respect of the claim for damages for deceit in Â§147 of ASOC, Mr Lam confirmed that such âdeceitâ referred to the plea offraudulent misrepresentations in Â§111 of the ASOC. So for the purpose of the striking out application, Â§147 of the ASOC insofaras it refers to âdeceitâ stands and falls together with Â§111 of the ASOC.  Thus, the claim for damages for deceit in Â§147 andin relief 3(a) of the ASOC insofar as the same relates to D1 and D3 are to be struck out, and insofar as the same relates to D2 areto be struck out only in default of proper re-amendment of Â§111 of the ASOC as aforesaid.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">IX.  <i>Order and consequential directions</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  In light of the above rulings on the striking out application,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)  the cause of action on fraudulent misrepresentation by D1 and D3 in Â§111 of the ASOC be struck out;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)  the cause of action on fraudulent misrepresentation by D2 in Â§111 of the ASOC be struck out only in default of proper re-amendmentas aforesaid;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)  the cause of action on conspiracy in Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC be struck out only in default of proper re-amendmentas aforesaid;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)  the whole of Â§Â§121-124 of the ASOC be struck out;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e)  Â§142 of the ASOC insofar as the same relates to D2 be struck out only in default of proper re-amendment of Â§111 of the ASOCand of Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC as aforesaid;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(f)  Â§142 of the ASOC insofar as the same relates to D1, D3, D4 and D5 be struck outonly in default of proper re-amendment of Â§119and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC as aforesaid;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(g)  the claim for damages for conspiracy as pleaded in Â§147 and in relief 3(a) of the ASOC insofar as the same relates to D1, D2and D3 be struck out only in default of proper re-amendment of Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC as aforesaid;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(h)  the claim for damages for deceit in Â§147 and in relief 3(a) of the ASOC insofar as the same relates to D1 and D3 be struck out,andinsofar as the same relates to D2 be struck out only in default of proper re-amendment of Â§111 of the ASOC as aforesaid;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(i)   the striking out application in respect of relief 3(c)-(d) of the ASOC is dismissed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  In respect of the re-amendment of Â§111, Â§119 and Â§120(a)-(e) of the ASOC to save the same from being struck out, the proposedre-amendment should be properly and exactly formulated (see paragraph 55 above).  I therefore direct P to take out an <i>inter partes</i> summons for such purpose (with draft re-amended SOC annexed thereto) (âNew Summonsâ) within 21 days from the date hereof to beheard before me in chambers (open to the public) on a date not before 35 days from the date hereof with 1 hour reserved.  For theavoidance of doubt, notwithstanding Mr Lamâs intimation at the substantive hearing that P may in due course apply to substantiallyoverhaul the ASOC and seek leave to further amend his pleading generally, no leave is granted for general re-amendments at this stage. The draft re-amendments to the ASOC to be annexed to the New Summons are restricted to the matters outlined above.  Unless the courtgrants leave otherwise, any application by P for leave to further amend his pleading generally shall be deferred for considerationuntil after the disposal of the New Summons. It goes without saying that since P has not yet formulated the proposed re-amendmentsto his pleading on the matters outlined above, Ds are obviously not precluded from taking proper objection in respect of any draftre-amended SOC to be annexed to the New Summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  However, in light of Mr Lamâs intimation that P may in due course apply for leave to substantially overhaul and further amendhis pleading generally, which in turn may obviate the need for FBP of the SOC, I direct that paragraph 1 of the 1<sup>st</sup> Summons (ie the application for FBP of the SOC) be adjourned, but within 63 days from the date hereof P and Ds are to jointly submitin writing to the court a set of agreed proposed directions on the future conduct of such application, or failing which P and Dsdo submit their respective proposals in writing on the above matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Ds have substantially succeeded in the striking out application. There is no reason why costs should not follow event.
