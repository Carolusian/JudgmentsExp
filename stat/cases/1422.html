libel actions are commenced by two different plaintiffs against the same defendants in respect of an undated circular letter(âthe Circularâ) sent or circulated to members of the Hong Kong Chung Shan Lung Chan Clan Association (é¦æ¸¯ä¸­å±±éé®åéæ)(âthe Associationâ) in about November 2004.  On 6 February 2006, Master de Souza ordered the two actions to be tried together. Due to his poor health, the trial between the plaintiffs and the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was by consent adjourned <i>sine die</i>.  The present trial therefore only concerns the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> defendants.  The central issue in the trial is whether the defendants had taken part in the publication of the Circular.</p>    <p class="heading">The Association</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Association is a company incorporated in Hong Kong in 1968 and limited by guarantee.  It was established for the objects of,<i>inter alia</i>, fostering the fraternity and unity of the clansman of Chung Shan (ä¸­å±±) who are in Hong Kong and overseas, and of engaging incharitable undertakings.  At the relevant time in November 2004, there were about 6,000 members in the Association. Its board ofdirectors consisted of 60 directors elected by its members.</p>    <p class="heading">The parties</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The two plaintiffs and the defendants are all members of the Association. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Mr Chan Iu Sing, the plaintiff in HCA2901/2004 (âMr Chanâ), was at all material times and is still the Honorary Chairman ofthe Association.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Between 2003 and 2004, the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board of Directors (â23<sup>rd</sup> Boardâ) was in office.  Mr Fong Yock Yee (æ¹è¥æ) (âChairman Fongâ) was the chairman of the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board.  Mr Lam Kit Sing, the plaintiff in HCA2935/2004 (âMr Lamâ), and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant were the vice-chairmen.  The other directors included the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  By the order of Barma J made on 15 October 2004 (âBarma Jâs Orderâ), to which I shall deal with in details below, Mr DarachE Haughey and Mr Derek K Y Lai (âthe Receiversâ) of Messrs Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (âDeloitteâ) were appointed interim receiversof the Association to convene an annual general meeting of the Association and to conduct the election of the 24<sup>th</sup> Board of Directors (â24<sup>th</sup> Boardâ).</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Both plaintiffs and all the defendants as well as Chairman Fong were nominated to be the candidates for the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.  In the end, the two plaintiffs were elected, but not the defendants.   Mr Lam further became the chairman of the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.</p>    <p class="heading">The litigations preceding Barma Jâs Order</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Before looking at the Circular and the dispute between the parties, it is necessary to refer to a number of events and litigationsinvolving the Association, Chairman Fong and the parties herein that took place in 2003 and 2004 and led to Barma Jâs Order.  Theyprovide the essential background to these actions and also shed light on the central issue in this trial.  For the present purpose,it is not necessary to dwell into the details of these events and litigations. A brief summary of them will suffice.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In an open letter dated 14 July 2003 addressed to all members of the Association, Mr Chan made complaints against Chairman Fongin respect of the expenditure for the inauguration ceremony for the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board and also the use of Association fund for securing directorship at the Yan Chai Hospital.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  As a result of Mr Chanâs open letter, an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) was held on 18 July 2003, at which resolutions werepassed removing Chairman Fong as the chairman and director of the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board and also as member of the Association.  This led to disagreements between members and directors who supported Chairman Fongon the one hand and those who supported Mr Chan and Mr Lam on the other.  The incident also sparked off a series of litigations,culminating in Barma Jâs Order.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The first piece of litigation was commenced by Chairman Fong against the Association on 4 August 2003 under High Court Action No.2883of 2003 (âHCA2883/2003â).  In the action, he sought a declaration that the resolutions passed at the EGM on 18 July 2003 (includingthose removing him from the board and the Association) were null and void and also an injunction to restrain the Association fromimplementing the resolutions.  Chairman Fong applied for and was granted an interim injunction, restraining the Association fromremoving him from the board and the Association.  By Sakhrani Jâs order dated 15 June 2004, the injunction was continued untiltrial or until further order with costs of the <i>inter-partes</i> application to be paid by the Association to Chairman Fong.  Despite an order for early trial, no further step has been taken inthe action. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In the meantime on 12 February 2004, Chairman Fong, and the 6<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> defendants issued a second piece of litigation against the Association in High Court Miscellaneous Proceedings No. 429 of 2004 (âHCMP429/2004â).  In the Originating Summons, they sought an order that the Association should convene and hold its annual general meetingfor the purpose of, <i>inter alia</i>, electing a new board of directors (i.e. the 24<sup>th</sup> Board).  At the first hearing on 12 March 2004, Mr Lam appeared, acting in person, on behalf of the Association.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Zeall Kwok Hing Shamson (è­åè) (âMr Zeallâ), who is a solicitor, is a member of the Association and the AssociationâsHonorary Legal Adviser.  In HCA 2883/2003, he acted as the solicitor for the Association through his firm, Shamson Zeall &amp; Co(âSZCâ).  On 31 March 2004, SZC commenced District Court Civil Action No. 1767 of 2004 (âDCCJ1767/2004â) against the Associationfor unpaid costs and disbursements incurred in defending HCA2883/2003, in the sum of $619,089.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Messrs P H Chin &amp; Co (âPHCCâ) was appointed as the Associationâs solicitors to defend DCJ 1767/2004 by a retainer dated6 April 2004 and signed by the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants and another director, purporting to be acting on behalf of the Association.  The attendance notes of PHCC were in evidenceat the trial.  They reveal the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)   The 2<sup>nd</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> defendants had taken part in giving instructions to PHCC at conference held on 9 April 2004.  The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant was also present at three other conferences on 16 and 22 April and 17 May 2004 together with the 6<sup>th</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants respectively.  The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant also had conference with counsel on 25 May 2004. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)   The instructions given at these conferences were that Mr Zeall acted without authority of the Association, that his legal feeswere excessive and he acted for his own interest and benefit. PHCC and counsel were also instructed that Mr Lam had asked Mr TsuiKwong of the Association to take $500,000 from the Association but was refused, that Mr Chan had through Mr Lam paid $500,000 toMr Zeall and that Mr Lam convened an EGM to pass resolution to settle the bill of $619,000.  </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Subsequently, PHCC applied to cease to act for the Association.  In the affirmation of Chin Pak Hing dated 14 June 2004, leadingthe application, the following matters were stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)   There were two rivalry factions in the board of directors of the Association.  One of them comprised Chairman Fong and ninedirectors of the Association, by whom PHCC was instructed.  The other rivalry faction, to which Mr Zeall belonged, was at the timein control of the board.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)   Chairman Fong and the nine directors gave instructions that Mr Zeall, assisted by Mr Lam and others, had already obtained fromthe Associationâs bank account $300,000, the legality of which was seriously in question. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)   Many members and directors of the Association took the view that the fraction of directors in control of the board was committingfraud on the Association by dissipating its assets.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  About two weeks later on 29 June 2004, Chairman Fong and the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants started another piece of litigation against the Association, Mr Lam and Mr Zeall in High Court Miscellaneous ProceedingsNo. 1642 of 2004 (âHCMP1642/2004â).  In the Originating Summons, they sought an order that the Association should convene andhold an annual general meeting for the purpose of passing resolutions to elect a new board of directors and to remove Mr Lam andMr Zeall as directors of the Association.  Chairman Fong and the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants were represented by PHCC. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant made two affirmations on behalf of all the plaintiffs in support of the Originating Summons on 30 June and 2 October 2004. The first affirmation is a lengthy one running into 64 pages (excluding the exhibits) and went into considerable details of thedisputes and rivalries between the parties.  Among other matters, the affirmation contained the following allegations that are relevantfor the present purpose:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)   There were two rival factions in the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board.  One of them was loyal to Mr Lam and Mr Zeall.  The other faction, to which the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and his co-plaintiffs belonged to, was loyal to Chairman Fong.  The former faction was referred to as the âLam-ZeallFactionâ whereas the latter was called âthe Fong Factionâ. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)   The accusations that Mr Chan made against Chairman Fong in his open letter dated 14 July 2003 did not appear to be well foundedin facts.  Mr Zeall on his own volition on 18 July 2003 delivered a legal advice to the Association to support the accusations againstChairman Fong.  The advice was fundamentally erroneous, but it stirred up feelings against Chairman Fong, âpaving the way for theLam-Zeall Faction plot to remove Fongâs chairmanship and expel Fongâs membership of the Associationâ: paragraph 50 of the affirmation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)   The resolutions passed at the EGM on 18 July 2003 removing Chairman Fong as Chairman and as member âwere a successful coupdâÃ©tat by the Lam-Zeall Faction against Fong.â  The Lam-Zeall Faction became in control of the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board and acted on numerous occasions against the Associationâs interest, most notably in, <i>inter alia</i>, âgiving a carte blanche to Zeall for exorbitant legal fees purported incurred for and on behalf of the Associationâ: paragraph57 of the affirmation.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)   Mr Zeallâs advice given on 18 July 2003 had successfully provoked litigation between Chairman Fong and the Association, asa result of which his firm was able to make profit from the Association through acting as its solicitors in HCA2883/2003. The fearthat the Lam-Zeall Faction might give Mr Zeallâs firm a carte blanche in charging legal fees for acting for the Association inlitigation turned out to be well founded.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)   Despite the fees charged were dubious, the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board resolved to pay SZC the bill for $619,089 in full and failed to protect the interest of the Association and âacted like ablank cheque for Zeall and his firmâ. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(6)   At a Board meeting on 31 may 2004, a long-term supporter of Chairman Fong called Siu Kam Dok collapsed and was declared deadupon arrival at the hospital.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(7)   Mr Zeall acted dishonestly in that Mr Chan and a Mr Wong Lap Man had each given him a cheque of $500,000, totalling $1,000,000,as costs on account for HCA 2883/2003.  But he made no mention of this in his claim.  Further, members of the Lam-Zeall Faction hadstolen the cheque book of the Association and acted in combination to enable SZC to take $300,000 from the Associationâs account.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Then on 11 August 2004, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> defendants issued a petition in High Court Miscellaneous Proceedings No. 1989 of 2004 (âHCMP1989/2004â) against Mr Lam, Mr Zeall,SZC, the Association and two other parties.  By the Petition, as amended on 2 September 2004, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> defendants sought a number of reliefs, including an order regulating the conduct of the Election Committee responsible for the electionof the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.  By summons filed on 30 August 2004, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> defendants applied for the appointment of interim receivers over the assets of the Association together with injunctive relief againstthe respondents. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Amended Petition again referred to the Association having two factions, the Lam-Zeall Faction and the Fong Faction.  The respondentswere said to belong to the Lam-Zeall Faction.  The Amended Petition further repeated some of the matters raised in the previous litigationsbrought by Chairman Fong and others as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)   The Lam-Zeall Faction had benefited themselves at the expense of the Association, including recklessly and improperly procuringthe Association to become embroiled in expensive and needless litigation by the expulsion of Chairman Fong.  Further, instead ofdefending SZCâs unwarranted claim in DCCJ 1767/2004, they procured the Association to be unrepresented and undefended.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)   Mr Zeall or his firm had secretly received $400,000 (previously said to be $500,000) and $500,000 from Mr Chan and Mr Wong LapMan respectively as legal fees for HCA2883/2003.  Mr Lam, who was instrumental to Mr Zeall receiving these payments, had kept theAssociation in the dark about it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)   Mr Lam also assisted Mr Zeall to obtain $300,000 from the Association by means of a cashier order.  He further gave Mr Zeall$100,000 from the Associationâs account to pay for the legal fees of himself and the Association in defending HCMP1642/2004, whenthe Association was only a nominal defendant and there was conflict of interest between him and the Association.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, on behalf of the other petitioners, made the affirmation verifying the Amended Petition and in support of the applicationfor appointment of interim receivers.  He had made further elaborations of the complaints in the Amended Petition.  He also madea second affirmation on 7 October 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 15 October 2004, Barma J heard HCMP429/2004, HCMP1642/2004 and HCMP1989/2004 and made the following orders:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)   In HCMP429/2004, the Association was ordered to pay the plaintiffs their costs of the action.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)   In HCMP1989/2004, the Receivers were appointed and Mr Lam and two other respondents were ordered to pay the costs of the applicationin any event.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)   In HCMP1642/2004, the Receivers were directed to hold an annual general meeting to, <i>inter alia</i>, elect a new board of directors and the Association was ordered to pay the costs of the plaintiffs.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Circular</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  As a result of Barma Jâs Order, the Receivers took over the day-to-day management of the Association and the conduct of the electionof the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.  Some time in November 2004, which was in the heat of the election, the Circular was sent or circulated to members of theAssociation.  The original text of the Circular and its certified English translation are set out in Annexure A and B to this Judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The first paragraph of the Circular referred to a letter on pink paper from âä¸ç¾¤æ­£ç¾©çæè£ãæå¡â (a group of righteousdirectors and members of the Association).  This letter was dated 11 November 2004 and addressed to all the members of the Association. It was printed on both sides of the paper.  A copy of the front page of the letter in reduced size was reproduced at the lower rightside of the Circular.  The front page of the letter stated that a group of reputable members of the Association supported the candidateswhose names appeared at the back page in the election of the 24<sup>th</sup> Board. The present plaintiffs were among the group of reputable members and their names appeared on the front page.  At the backpage of the letter was a list of 20 names and another list of 40 names of candidates.  Both the present plaintiffs were on the firstlist of 20 candidates.  </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The part of the Circular that the plaintiffs complain of is the three paragraphs under the respective headings of  âè¬è²¡å®³å½â(Stratagem for obtaining wealth and endangering life), âæè¨´å¡«è£å è²»â (Defeat in lawsuits and compensation for costs ofhearing) and âææ¹¯ä¸æè¥â (Same old stuff with a different label). The plaintiffs say, and there is no doubt about it, thatthey were expressly referred to in these paragraphs. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It is the plaintiffsâ case that the words used in these paragraphs, in their natural and ordinary meaning, were understood tomean:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(A)    Under the paragraph âè¬è²¡å®³å½â (Stratagem for obtaining wealth and endangering life):</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)   Mr Chan had made a libellous statement against Chairman Fong that led to the latterâs expulsion from the Association.</p>            <p class="quote">(2)   Amongst other, Mr Lam dominated and controlled the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board.  Just on the pretext of Mr Chanâs libellous statement, and without any factual of legal basis, Mr Lam, amongst others, wrongfullyexpelled Chairman Fong from the Association.</p>            <p class="quote">(3)   Mr Lam, Mr Siu, Mr Fong and some others conspired with the bankrupt solicitor Mr Zeall to claim double solicitorâs fees fromthe Association in respect of HCA2883/2003.</p>            <p class="quote">(4)   As part of the conspiracy and by collaboration between Mr Chan, Mr Lam, Mr Wong, Mr Siu, Mr Fong and some others, Mr Chan andMr Wong advanced $900,000 to the Association to pay the solicitorâs fees of Mr Zeall. </p>            <p class="quote">(5)   Mr Lam, Mr Siu, Mr Fong and some others then connived with Mr Zeall in commencing litigation against the Association to claima huge sum of close to $3,000,000.</p>            <p class="quote">(6)   Siu Kam Dok (è­éé¸ ), an elderly director of the Association, was contemptuous of what Mr Chan, Mr Lam, Mr Siu, Mr Fong,Mr Zeall, Mr Wong and some others had done.  At a board of directorâs meeting, he strenuously argued for the Association and forChairman Fong.  In the heat of the argument, he died.  His death was caused by, amongst others, Mr Chan and Mr Lam who had subjecthim to burring satires and freezing ironies and accused him of confounding black and white.   </p>            <p class="quote">(7)   Amongst others, Mr Chan and Mr Lam were evildoers in power.  They conspired with Mr Siu, Mr Fong, Mr Zeall, Mr Wong and othersto rip off the Association. </p>            <p class="quote">(8)   Amongst others, Mr Chan and Mr Lam caused the death of Siu Kam Dok, but remained out of lawâs reach comfortably.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(B) Under the paragraph âæè¨´å¡«è£å è²»â (Defeat in lawsuits and compensation for costs of hearing):</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(9)   Although Mr Lam remained out of lawâs reach in respect of the death of Siu Kam Dok, he was so bad and was eventually punishedby being defeated in HCMP429/2004 and HCMP1989/2004.  He was interested in being elected as a director of the Association and wouldmake use of the position to serve his personal interest, to dominate and control the Association and to do whatever he wished, andto use the Associationâs money to pay costs that he was liable for in HCMP429/2004 and HCMP1989/2004.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(C) Under the paragraph âææ¹¯ä¸æè¥â (Same old stuff with a different label):</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(10)  When canvassing support for the election, Mr Lam deceived the members of the Association by concealing what they had evillydone, what in fact happened and the defeat in HCMP429/2004 and HCMP1989/2004.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Although the defendants denied the words were defamatory of the plaintiffs, no arguments were advanced on this at the trial.  Theplaintiffs contend and I agree that the Circular is plainly defamatory.  In a nutshell, the plaintiffs were accused of: (1) removingChairman Fong by a libellous statement, (2) conspiring with Mr Zeall to claim double and unjustified legal fees from the Associationand (3) causing the death of Siu Kam Dok.  In the case of Mr Lam, the Circular further accused him of using the letter dated 11 November2004 to deceive members and to cover up his bad deeds and the truth, so that he could take control of the Association again and embezzlefunds of the Association to make up for the legal costs of the lost litigations.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The defendants put the plaintiffs to strict proof that the Circular had been published.  The evidence before the Court shows clearlythat the Circular had been circulated among members of the Association.  Mr Chanâs evidence is that he received a copy of it throughthe mail.  In the case of Mr Lam, he was given a copy of it by Chan Siu Yuen (é³å°å) (âSY Chanâ), who was a director of the23<sup>rd</sup> Board and a candidate for the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.  Lee Dai Chung (ææ££æ¾) (âDC Leeâ), another director, also received a copy through the post.  The 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants admitted that they had received copies of the Circular while the 8<sup>th</sup> defendant said she was informed by another member that the Circular was sent to the members of the Association.</p>    <p class="heading">The witnesses</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I now turn to the core issue on the question of liability, namely, whether the defendants or any of them had taken part in the publicationof the Circular.  This involves a consideration of the evidence of the plaintiffs and more importantly their witnesses, the testimonyof the defendants and their witness as well as other evidence available.  I shall begin with the evidence of the parties and theirwitnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The evidence of Mr Chan does not touch on the core issue and is uncontroversial.  It is his evidence that he received a copy ofthe Circular through the mail and he was very unhappy with the contents of it.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Similarly, Mr Lamâs evidence is not controversial.  He stated that on an occasion when he was in Lung Chiu Restaurant having ameeting with other members of the Association, SY Chan came and passed him a copy of the Circular.  It was folded up and placed insidea white envelope with no address label on it.  After reading the Circular, he was very unhappy. </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  SY Chanâs evidence is that one afternoon in the end of November 2004, after meeting with other members at Lung Chiu Restaurant,he went to the premises of the Association.  This he said was his routine in the several weeks leading to the election of the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.  When he arrived at the premises of the Association, he saw 10 odd people sitting around two long tables.  They were foldingcopies of the Circular and putting them into envelopes.  Among these people were the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> defendants and also another member called Yeung Po Luk.  The 6<sup>th</sup> defendant was also present on the premises and making comments or suggestions from time to time (ææé»é»).  SY Chan spoke toYeung and when the latter was not noticing, he took a copy of the Circular and slipped it into his trousers pocket.  The copy hetook was not in an envelope.  He immediately returned to Lung Chiu Restaurant, where he saw Mr Lam and passed the copy to him. </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The last of the plaintiffsâ witness is DC Lee.  He said he was a long-time member of the Association and was well acquainted withmany other members who did not belong to either of the two rivalry factions.  He mentioned there were two occasions in mid-November2004 when the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant alone and jointly with the 4<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants, asked him to vote for Chairman Fong and his supporters.  He also said that some time around the end of November 2004,he received from the post a copy of the Circular.  He found the contents rather alarming, so he asked the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants about it when he later saw them at the premises of the Association.  None of them denied that the Circular was issuedby them.  As far as he knew, none of the defendants had told other members that the Circular was not issued by them. </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  All the defendants gave evidence at the trial.  Their witness statements, which were adopted as their evidence, are nearly identical. They are elderly people with the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants in their 70s and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant being 80 years old.  Some of them say they do not enjoy good health and have problems with eyesight, hearing and memory. While the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants said they had received a copy of the Circular from the post, the 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> defendants said they only came to read the Circular when they received the letter before action from the plaintiffsâ solicitors. All the defendants accepted they did nothing about the Circular.  They did not find it necessary to deny their involvement, to clarifythe position or to find out who was responsible for it because they did not issue the Circular.  It was only after receiving theletter from the plaintiffsâ solicitors that they got together and consulted lawyer, who then on their behalf wrote to the plaintiffsâsolicitors to deny any involvement in the publication of the Circular. </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> defendants denied taking part in folding copies of the Circular and putting them into envelopes.  The 6<sup>th</sup> defendant also denied being present when this was done.  In fact, all the defendants, except the 7<sup>th</sup> defendant, said they did not go to the premises of the Association after the appointment of the Receivers.  As for the 7<sup>th</sup> defendant, he said he only went to see Mr Tsui Kwong (also known as Tsui Pak Hin), the general executive or manager of the Association. The 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants further denied canvassing votes from DC Lee on behalf of Chairman Fong and his supporters.  They also denied the occasionin the end of November 2004 when DC Lee said he asked them about the Circular.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The defence witness, Ms Fung Chi Hoi (é¦®å¿é), was an employee of the Association between 1995 and July 2005.  Her evidence isthat after the appointment of the Receivers, very few members returned to the premises of the Association.  She said before the electionof the 24<sup>th</sup> Board was held, there were two occasions when a group of people came to the premises to fold documents and put them into envelopes. These people worked for about four hours and had lunch boxes on the premises.  She did not know any of these people; they were notmembers of the Association and none of the defendants was among this group of people.  As instructed by Mr Tsui, she had helped topile up the envelopes, but she did not look at the contents of the documents, which was in A4 size. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In my view, the plaintiffs, SY Chan and DC Lee are truthful witnesses and their evidence is to be preferred to that of the defendantsand Ms Fung.  The defendantsâ evidence is that there was no animosity between them and SY Chan and DC Lee.  For some of the defendants,it was only after the election of the 24<sup>th</sup> Board that they did not exchange words with SY Chan and that it was after DC Lee gave his witness statement that they were unhappyabout him.  There is therefore no reason why SY Chan or DC Lee would make up their evidence against the defendants.  As matter offact, as Mr Pow SC observed, they did not bend-over-backwards to incriminate all the defendants.  On the contrary, to the extentthat the defendants all said they had taken no step to clarify that they had nothing to do with the Circular, that is in line withDC Leeâs evidence that the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> defendants did not deny involvement in the Circular or sought to clarify their position. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  I accept there is a discrepancy between the evidence of Mr Lam and that of SY Chan in respect of whether the copy of the Circularthat SY Chan passed to Mr Lam was contained in an envelope.  Considering that the event took place some five years ago, I agree thatit is probable that either Mr Lam or SY Chan had made an honest mistake.  This is a minor aspect of the events and I am not convincedthat this alone shows SY Chan or Mr Lam to be lying.  The plaintiffs and their witnesses had not been shaken under cross-examinations.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In the case of Ms Fung, her evidence about the two occasions when a group of people went to the premises of the Association to folddocuments and put them into envelopes does not assist the defendants on the core issue.  It is not her evidence that the documentsin question were copies of the Circular.  On the contrary, it is unlikely to be the case because the documents she saw were in A4size whereas the Circular is not in A4 size.  While the defendants have been anxious to emphasize that after the appointment of theReceivers, nobody went to the Association premises and there was no activity on the premises, Ms Fungâs evidence suggests thatactivity such as folding documents dissemination could have taken place and in fact did take place on the Association premises. Indeed, Ms Fung accepted that it was possible that such activity could have taken place when she was not present on the Associationpremises. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  More importantly, I find this aspect of Ms Fungâs evidence rather peculiar.  If, as she said, the people folding documents andputting them into envelopes were strangers and not members of the Association, it is difficult to understand why they were permittedto enter and stay on the premises of the Association.  On the other hand, Mr Tsui Kwong must know these people; otherwise he wouldnot have told Ms Fung to help them.  It is inconceivable that Ms Fung would not find out from Mr Tsui who these people were, if notwhat they were doing.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Another puzzling aspect of Ms Fungâs evidence is that she said she was first approached by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant to be a witness for the defendants in April 2009.  By then she had left the employment of the Association for some fouryears during which none of the defendants had ever contacted her.  The evidence before the Court does not explain what made the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant think she was in a position to give relevant and useful evidence for the defendants.  Admittedly, however, Ms Fung wasmoved by what the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant told her and she is obviously sympathetic to him and the other defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Although it was almost five years afterwards, Ms Fung apparently was able to recall and describe in some details the occasions whenpeople came to the Association to fold documents and put them into envelopes.  However, she was not able to name any other memberor director of the Association apart from the parties and the plaintiffsâ witnesses and Yeung Po Luk, whom SY Chan had mentionedin his witness statement.  In my view, there must be doubts whether her evidence is entirely based on her independent recollection. I have reservations about the reliability of her evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  As for the defendants, the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is very convoluted.  He was not able to recall making any witness statement for these actions or being explained the contentsof them, despite the supplemental witness statement was made less than two months ago.  He disputed he was a candidate for the 24<sup>th</sup> Board, saying he was in bad health and that he was not qualified to do so.  This pleaded fact was however admitted in the Defence. Although he stated in his supplemental witness statement that he received a copy of the Circular, he said in cross-examination thathe was unclear whether he had ever seen a copy of the Circular.  He even went so far as saying that he could not recognize the documentand did not know that his name had appeared on it.  He also denied in cross-examination that he was involved in any of the litigationsinvolving Chairman Fong and the Association when he was indisputably a plaintiff in HCMP1642/2004 and HCMP1989/2004.  It was onlyin re-examination that he accepted his involvement.  To say the least, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs evidence is demonstrably unreliable. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs evidence is equally unreliable.  He is also one of the plaintiffs in HCMP1642/2004 and HCMP1989/2004.  However, hedenied having authorized the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to make the affirmations on his behalf.  In the early part of his cross-examination, he claimed he did not know who tookthe lead in these litigations, saying also that he would join in and sign documents that were for the good of the Association.  Lateron when he was confronted with the documents in the litigations, he changed to say that it was the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant who took a leading role.  He then admitted he had been explained the 4<sup>th</sup> defendantâs affirmations and that he agreed to them.   He further admitted having taken part in conferences to give instructionsto PHCC to defend SZCâs claim for unpaid legal fees.  In contradiction to his evidence in the beginning of the cross-examination,he said he was of the view that someone had conspired with Mr Zeall to take money from the Association under the pretext of legalcosts.   In fact, his answers in cross-examination show that a number of the views and accusations expressed in the Circular wereshared by him.  Notably, he used the same expression as that appeared in the Circular, namely, âå·å²ç±è«·ãç²åé»ç½â(burringsatires and freezing ironies, confounding black and white), when describing how Siu Kam Dok died.  While he claimed he only agreedto part of the Circular, he was reluctant to be specific and to tell which part of it that he agreed or disagreed.  He dodged thequestions by saying that this should be left to the court and lawyers.  </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  As for the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, he is undoubtedly a protagonist in the so-called Fongâs Faction.  He was also admittedly a good friend of Siu Kam Dok. There is overwhelming evidence that he took active and leading role in the several pieces of litigations leading to Barma JâsOrder.  He accepted in cross-examination that the affirmations he made in the various litigations were prepared on his instructionsand he had been explained the contents of them.  It is worth noting that the allegations in his affirmations bore striking resemblanceto those in the Circular.  His oral testimony also confirms that he indeed holds the views expressed in the Circular.  However, hisevidence is that he had not shown his affirmations to other people and he had only communicated his views to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, but not to the only defendants.  Not only this, the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant said he was surprised to see that the Circular had set out all his views and feelings, as if the author could read hismind.  Notwithstanding all these, he only called the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant and did nothing else.  Despite his evidence that he believed someone was playing a trick on him and he did not want theopposing camp to think he was using dirty tricks by publishing the Circular; he made no attempt to clarify the matter or his position. In my view, the 4<sup>th</sup> defendantâs behaviour after receiving the Circular is most unnatural and is hardly compatible with his claim of innocence. </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In the case of the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant, because of his hearing problems, his evidence was short and Mr Pow SC fairly did not subject him to much cross-examinations. In essence, he stated that he would listen to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and followed his deeds if those were for the good of the Association.  He did not really deny when it was put to him thatthe Circular was published by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant with his authorization.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  As for the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant, his evidence shows that he was very keen to distance himself from the rivalries between the two so-called factions.  Hedenied taking part in defending the claim by SZC for unpaid legal fees, despite he had signed the retainer letter of PHCC.  He evenclaimed to be ignorant of Chairman Fongâs expulsion, when he was at the material time a vice-chairman of the 23<sup>rd</sup> Board.  He also denied being a candidate for the 24<sup>th</sup> Board, which is contrary to the admission in the Defence.  He further said he did not in 2004 think that Mr Lam had conspired withMr Zeall to embezzle funds of the Association.  This is in sharp contrast to the instructions PHCC received in DCCJ1767/2004.  Thereis no credibility in these denials and assertions, which are directly at odds with the contemporaneous documents and objective evidencebefore the Court.  His explanation as to why he did not try to find out more about the Circular and about how his name came to beon it, namely, he was in the habit of tearing up and discarding letters before reading them, is most extraordinary.  In my view,the evidence of the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant is evasive and incredible.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The evidence of the 7<sup>th</sup> defendant is also surprising in a number of ways.  First, he said he could not tell which of the two opposing camps published theCircular, when it must be obvious to a reasonable reader that it would not have been published by the so-called Lam-Zeall Faction. It is also not to be forgotten that at the material time, he had been a director for over 10 years.  It is difficult to believethat he would be as ignorant as not being able to sense and tell from which camp the Circular had come.  When he was pressed aboutthe point, he even said there might have been a third camp, a suggestion that he later retracted.  This shows he was quite preparedto give any answer that came to his mind, irrespective of whether it was well founded.  Second, he said when he received the Circular,he simply shuffled it into the drawer because there were a lot of circulars flowing around and he decided he should quietly observethe situation.  But he agreed at the same time that the Circular contained serious allegations and his name had appeared on it. It is also his evidence that he did not subscribe to the use of improper means to campaign for votes, and he regarded publishingdocument such as the Circular to be improper.  Like the other defendants, his reaction and behaviour is out of line with that ofa reasonable person, if indeed he had no part to play in the publication of the Circular.  There is additionally one peculiar aspectabout the 7<sup>th</sup> defendantâs supplemental witness statement.  While he had specifically refuted the part of DC Leeâs witness statement about him,he did not dispute SY Chanâs statement that he had taken part in folding copies of the Circular and putting them into envelopes. There is no satisfactory explanation to this omission.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Coming finally to the 8<sup>th</sup> defendant, she claimed she did not know SY Chan and she did not take part in handling copies of the Circular as related by SY Chan. However, similar to the 7<sup>th</sup> defendant, she was not able to explain satisfactorily why she did not specifically refute SY Chanâs statement in her supplementalwitness statement.  The 8<sup>th</sup> defendant also claimed to have no idea that she was a plaintiff in HCMP429/2004 and stated that she did not authorize the 7<sup>th</sup> defendant or Chairman Fong to institute the proceedings against the Association.  She further said she did not know she was a candidatefor the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.  All these suggest that the 8<sup>th</sup> defendant is consciously trying to play down her involvement in the events in 2004 and in turn the disputes between the two opposingcamps.  Indeed, she was at pain to give the impression that she was entirely neutral and took both camps as her friends.  She deploredthe use of the Circular to campaign for votes and she was emphatic about her name appearing on the Circular.  Surprisingly, she hadtaken no step to clarify the matter or her innocence after receiving the letter of demand from the plaintiffsâ solicitors, otherthan going with the other defendants to see the lawyer.  This reaction does not sit well with her assertion of neutrality.</p>    <p class="heading">Other evidence</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The plaintiffs also rely on other circumstantial evidence to show that the defendants were involved in the publishing of the Circularand that their denial is incredible.  The first is the striking similarities between the allegations against the plaintiffs and theso-called Lam-Zeall Faction in the affirmations and originating documents filed in the various litigations preceding Barma JâsOrder and the attacks levelledagainst them in the Circular.  In this regard, it is a telling feature of the defendants who took partin the previous litigations that they tried to deny or play down their participation in the litigations.  They are no doubt awarethat the similarities are too much of a coincidence. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The second is an undated circular to members bearing the heading â é®æææ³å®«å§ä»»è¨ææ¥ç®¡äººâ (Barma J appointedinterim receivers), âææ½è²è­å¹¹ææ¹ä¿ é²æè¨´é«é¢â (Lam Kit Sing, Siu Kon Lam, Fong Hup Wan lost the High Court cases). Apart from reporting Barma Jâs Order, this circular also referred to the misbehaviour of the Lam-Zeall Faction, which is the sameas the attacks contained in the Circular.  It concluded by urging the members to support Chairman Fong at the coming annual generalmeeting.  Although it was undated, it must have been issued after Barma Jâs Order, which was made on 15 October 2004.  The signaturesof the 1st to 6<sup>th</sup> defendants appeared at the top of the first page of this circular.  </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is that he only signed on a blank paper. This is rather improbable having regard to the position of his signature.  Indirect contradiction to his evidence, the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants said they signed this circular together.  They claimed that they signed at the request and instruction of Mr Tsui andsuggested that it was prepared entirely on Mr Tsuiâs volition and it was all his idea.  Even the 7<sup>th</sup> defendant, who received a copy of this circular from the post, said that this was Mr Tsuiâs idea.  According to Ms Fung, Mr Tsuihad died in 2007.  It would appear that the defendants are trying to shift the responsibility to Mr Tsui.  However, it is inherentlyimprobable that an employee of the Association would on his own volition come up with such a document and was further able to directand instruct the directors of the Association, including the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant who was a vice-chairman of the board, to append their signatures on it.  The further suggestion by some of the defendantsthat they signed without knowing the contents or who was the drafter is even more implausible.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In my view, the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendantsâ evidence on how their signatures came to be on this circular highlights the incredibility and unreliability of theirevidence.  At the same time, this circular shows that the 1<sup>st</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> defendants were actively involved in canvassing support for Chairman Fong in the election of the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.  This, together with the similarities in contents between this circular and the Circular, lends support to the plaintiffsâcase that these defendants had participated in the publication of the Circular.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  There is thirdly another undated circular bearing the heading âæåæèªè­çæ¹è¥æâ (The Fong Yock Yee that we know)purported to be from the present eight defendants.  The order and arrangement in which the names of the eight defendants appearedat the end of this circular is exactly the same as that in the Circular.  This circular set out a number of good deeds of ChairmanFong and contributions he made to the native town and the Association.  It concluded by stating they supported him to serve as thechairman of the 24<sup>th</sup> Board.  The evidence of the majority of the defendants is that they only came to be aware of this document on 29 June 2009 when theyattended their solicitorsâ office.  But as pointed out by Mr Pow SC, this document was disclosed by the plaintiffs at a much earliertime.  The defendants also said they did not know how their names came to be on the document.  I do not accept the defendantsâclaim that they knew nothing about this circular and had not seen it before 29 June 2009.  This circular again shows that the defendantswere supportive of Chairman Fong and were actively assisting him in his election campaign.  It also shows that it is more probablethan not that these defendants published the Circular as part of their efforts to Chairman Fong and his camp in their election campaign.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Lastly, there is a third undated circular bearing the heading âæåææ½è²! è¸¢èµ°ææ°éå!â (Strike down Lam Kit Sing!Kick out the Lamâs Faction!) issued in the name of âä¸å¤§ç¾¤å¿ å¯¦çæå¡â  (a big group of faithful members).  It containedattacks against the plaintiffs and their supporters.  This circular shows that there was no need for other people to use the defendantsânames to issue the Circular in order to conceal their identities. </p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In short, having regard to the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have established on balance of probabilities that eachof the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> defendants had taken part in publishing the Circular. </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Ms Tsui argued that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that the defendants acted in concert to write and/or publish the Circular. The plaintiffsâ pleaded case is that the 1<sup>st</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> defendants falsely and maliciously published the defamatory words in the Circular.  As a matter of general principle, all personswho participate in the publication of a libel are jointly and severally liable for the whole damage suffered by the plaintiff: <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> (10<sup>th</sup> edition, 2004) para.6.4.  It is not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants were acting in concert.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The plaintiffs only claim general damages against the defendants.  In <i>Hung Yuen Chan Robert v. Hong Kong standard Newspapers Ltd &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%204%20HKC%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 4 HKC 519</a> at 533C, le Pichon J (as she then was) observed that the objective of an award of damages is to restore the plaintiff, as far asmoney can do so, to the position he would have been if the tort had not been committed.  </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Further, in <strong><i>Cheung Ng Sheong Steven v. Eastweek Publisher Ltd</i></strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20HKC%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 HKC 601</a> at p.613D-F, the Court of Appeal accepted that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ damages for libel must provide for several disparate elements, not only damage to esteem and reputation. They also 'must besufficient to publicly and demonstratively and absolutely vindicate the Plaintiff and to compensate for seriously injured feelings(<strong><i>Yu Kwong Chu v. Consolidated Newspapers</i></strong><strong><i>Ltd</i></strong> <strong>HC</strong>A258/86, unreported at p.30) not only caused by the original libel but all the subsequent aggravation thereof down to the verdict,which would restore the Plaintiff's âpride and confidenceâ (<strong><i>McCarey v.

They must enable the Plaintiff to convince a bystander the baselessness of the charge if âthe libel driven underground,emerges from its lurking place at some future dateâ (<strong><i>Cassell v.

Hong Kong standard Newspapers Ltd &amp; Ors</i> at 534D-E that the relevant considerations include: the seriousness of the libel having regard to the plaintiffâs position andstanding; the prominence of the article and the circumstances of its publication; conduct of the defendants including conduct subsequentto the plaintiffâs complaint; and the absence of any retraction or apology.  Ultimately, each case depends on its facts and âitis difficult to extrapolate from previous awards unless there are significant similaritiesâ: at 536G-H.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In the present case, the considerations that are relevant to assessing the award of damages include:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)   Both plaintiffs enjoy substantial standing and reputation both within the Association and in the community.  Although they werenot liked by the members who supported Chairman Fong, the fact that they were elected to the 24<sup>th</sup> Board is demonstrative of the support and respect they had from a majority of the members.  Further, the evidence adduced shows thatat the material time, they held a number of public offices in Hong Kong and also held responsible positions in various consultative,advisory and voluntary organizations in Hong Kong and Zhongshan.  Mr Chan was also awarded the Bronze Bauhinia Star Medal in 2003.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)   The libel involved very unpleasant and serious attacks against the plaintiffsâ integrity, honesty and propriety in conduct,including conduct in the affairs of the Association. They were accused of dishonesty, corruption, abusing their power and positionin the Association and even causing the death of a fellow director.  </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)   The Circular was apparently sent or circulated to all members of the Association.  The Association had a membership of some6,000 members.  This is quite a wide publication.  There will be serious adverse effect on the plaintiffsâ reputation within theAssociation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)   The defendants had not retracted from the Circular.  There was also no offer of apology.  Their evidence also shows that theycould not be bothered to do anything about the Circular. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)   On the other hand, it is to be noted that the defendants have run a restrictive defence against the claims.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The plaintiffs referred to and drew comparison from the award made in <i>Lee Ching v. Lau May Ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%203%20HKLRD%20623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 3 HKLRD 623.</a>  In that case, the plaintiffs were experienced and dedicated volunteer members of a charitable organization that had a membershipof about 200 members.  The defendant, who was the chairman of the board of governors, issued a letter to all members accusing theplaintiffs of failure to perform their duties as governors, spreading rumours and malicious slander and wrongful accusations againstthe defendant that threatened the organizationâs coherence and quality of service and affected the defendantâs personal health,and also engaging in inappropriate and illegal tricks to seize power.  After a full trial that raised defences of justification andqualified privilege, Poon J awarded each of the plaintiffs $200,000 in general damages and $200,000 in aggravated damages.  The plaintiffscontend that an appropriate award to each of them should be $500,000, taking into account that they enjoyed a higher standing andsocial position and that the libel was more serious and published to more people.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  While I agree that for the reasons given by the present plaintiffs, a higher award of general damages to them is justified, I donot accept that an award of $500,000 each is called for. </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  On the other hand, I do not agree with the defendantsâ argument that the amount of damages should be affected by the fact theplaintiffs did not appear to suffer any actual loss and that similar circulars or accusations had been made against the plaintiffsat around the same time.  They are irrelevant considerations.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Having considered all the circumstances of this case, noting in particular the factors indicated above, I am of the view that anaward of $300,000 for each of the plaintiff in general damages is appropriate.

By relying on alibellousstatement written by Chan Iu Seng and under the circumstance where there was no factual and legal basis, they forcefully expelledthe elderly Chairman of the Association Fong Yock Yee from being the Associationâs member. In addition, they conspired with thebankrupt solicitor Zeall Kwok Hing to claim double legal fees from the Clan Association. They collaborated with Chan Iu Seng andWong Lap Man to advance solicitorâs fees in a sum of $900,000 for the Association. They then connived Zeall Kwok Hing in commencinglitigation in court against the Clan Association for claiming legal fees in a huge sum of close to $3,000,000! The late elderly directorSiu Kam Dok was contemptuous of what such people had done. At a Board of Directorsâ meeting, he argued strenuously upon reasonsfor the Clan Association and for Mr. Chairman Fong. He was subject to burring satires and freezing ironies and was accused of confoundingblack and white by Lam Kit Sing, Fong Hup Wan, etc. and he died as a result of these. Alas! Evildoers are in power and at large afterstratagem for obtaining wealth and endangering life. Where is the divine justice?</p>    <p class="quote"><u>Defeat in lawsuits and compensation for costs of hearings</u></p>    <p class="quote">The net of heaven has large meshes, but it lets nothing through! Lam Kit Sing, Siu Kon Lam, Fong Hup Wan, etc. were eventually <b>defeated</b> in HCA429/2004 and HCMP1989/2004. As a consequence, they are liable for a huge sum of solicitorâs fees and costs of hearings. Thecourt has now appointed a receiver to take over the Clan Association entirely from Lam Kit Sing and others. But Lam Kit Sing andothers are not reconciled to their defeat and are trying to stage a comeback by using the pink letter to cheat each of you and tocover up their evil doings, the facts and the truth with a wish to obtain more votes so as to allow them to wrest our Clan Associationfrom us once again, to achieve their purpose of manipulating our association and doing whatever they like, and make use of the hard-earnedmoney of the Clan Association to make up for their losses of huge costs of hearings.</p>    <p class="quote"><u>Same old stuff with a different label</u></p>    <p class="quote">In the letter, they continue to use shameless way of handling to cover up, blowing their own trumpet without mentioning the fact oftheir defeat in the lawsuits. Not only are they shameless, but they harbour ulterior motives as well.</p>    <p class="quote">I trust that you can make a clear distinction between right and wrong and that you will give Mr. Fong Yock Yee an opportunity to serveyou again.
