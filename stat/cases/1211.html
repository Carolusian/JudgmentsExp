The writ with the Statement of Claim dated 30 August 2004 indorsed was served on the defendant on 2 September 2004. In his Defence dated 18 October 2004, the defendant admitted liability (negligence) but disputed the quantum of the damages.  Ona checklist review on 28 January 2005, a judge entered judgment against the defendant for damages to be assessed.  The assessmentof damages took place on 6 June 2005 before Deputy Judge W Lam who handed down judgment on 9 June 2005, giving judgment for the plaintiffin the sum of $27,260 with interest.  The judge also made an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff have his costs, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The defendant applied to the judge to vary the costs order <i>nisi</i>, as a result of which the judge made the following orders on 29 June 2005, namely, costs to the plaintiff up to and including 5 June2005 on the District Court scale, to be taxed if not agreed, and there be no order as to costs as from 6 June 2005 (the trial itself). On 1 August 2005, the judge refused to grant leave to appeal against his costs orders of 29 June 2005.  As a result, the defendantapplied to a single judge of this Court, and I granted leave on 15 August 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Calderbank letters</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> One of the bases for the defendant to apply to the judge to vary his order <i>nisi</i> as to costs was that offers had been made by solicitors acting on behalf of the defendant to settle the plaintiff claim, principallyby two Calderbank letters respectively of 21 September 2004 and 13 October 2004 making offers<del>,</del> which were not accepted by the plaintiff.

The defendant seeks to have the judgeâs orderset aside and substituted by an order that the plaintiff be entitled to costs up to 21 September 2004 on a scale similar to the SmallClaims Tribunal scale (as advised in the judgment of this Court in <i>M Beraha &amp; Co Ltd v Ng Wai Lun</i>, CACV 256/2003 (18 June 2004, unreported), paras 32 and 33) and that costs thereafter be to the defendant on the District Court scale.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The grounds contend that the judge was wrong, acting against principle, or not exercising his discretion judicially, to have madethe order for costs on 29 June 2005.  Apart from the Calderbank letters, the plaintiff relies on the evidence relating to the quantumof the damages that was available when the plaintiff commenced this action to contend that it was unreasonable for the plaintiffto have commenced proceedings in the District Court.  It is contended that the judge was wrong in failing to take into account theevidence in the exercise of his discretion on costs, and that even if the Calderbank letters are disregarded, the judge in the properexercise of his discretion on costs should have ordered costs to the plaintiff to be taxed on a scale similar to that of the Tribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The respondentâs notice</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> On the other hand, the plaintiff has filed a respondentâs notice to seek an order that the plaintiff have his costs of the action,up to the judgment, on the District Court scale, to be taxed if not agreed.  This is in effect a cross-appeal.  The grounds in supportare that the plaintiff was entitled as of right to his costs up to judgment as there had been no payment into court, pursuant to<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>, and Order 62, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rules 5</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a>(2) and (5) of the Rules of the District Court (âRDCâ).  It is contended that the Calderbank offers were not appropriate as paymentinto court could have been made and should have been made, but in fact not made.  Moreover, the Calderbank offers did not deal withthe plaintiffâs costs and did not take into account the plaintiffâs right to instituting the action.

I will dividethis question into 2 stages, i.e. pre-trial and the trial itself.  <b>I should immediately say that this was not a liquidated claim so that the quantum was obvious</b>.  As to the pre-trial stages, I refer to <i>Hopkins v Rees &amp; Kirby Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%202%20All%20ER%20352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] 2 All ER 352</a>, and <b>I am unable to say that âit had been quite clear to the Plaintiffâ his award would not be more than $50,000 especially when thewatershed figure was only $5,001 or 11% more than what the Defendant himself had seen fit to offer on the 13<sup>th</sup> October 2004</b>.  In my view it is only appropriate to award costs to the Plaintiff, on the District Court scale, for up to and including the daybefore trial, i.e. 5<sup>th</sup> June 2005.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">3.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">As to the trial itself, it is correct to say that if a plaintiff refuses an offer which is higher than his ultimate award, he shouldpay a âpenaltyâ for insisting on going to trial.  I note <b>the offers made in this matter were Calderbank offers and not a âpayment into courtâ</b>.  But in any event, <b>if I do not take the Calderbank offers into account I would be making a mockery of the existence of such offers as well as of DCRO. 62 r. 5</b>.  As to the extent a plaintiff should pay this âpenaltyâ, I note that some overseas jurisdiction can be harsher than Hong Kong. For example, in the South Australian District Court Act (1991) s. 42 and as illustrated by cases like <i>Necia Joy Moccatta v Joachim Dehousa Leal</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1994/4537.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] SASC 4537 (South</a> Australia), courts pronouncing âorder as to costsâ is common, i.e. if the plaintiff obtains an award under the offer, he doesnot obtain his costs <i>for any stage of the action</i> although the courts have a discretion, and in this latter aspect they are similar to here.  Of course the term âno order as tocostsâ also means the Defendant will not be awarded his costs.  I therefore take the view that to order our present Plaintiff topay costs of the trial to the Defendant would be too harsh, and would also go against the practice that the âwinning partyâ shouldbe awarded his costs.  We must not lose sight of the fact that, although in the end the Plaintiff was awarded less than what hadbeen offered to him before trial, he nevertheless âwon the actionâ, hence to make him pay the âlosing sideâ is unjust andinappropriate in our case.  In all the circumstances, for the trial itself, I will make no order as to costs.  The Plaintiffâsâpenaltyâ is that he must now pay his own legal costs of the trial out of the judgment award.â  (Emphasis added)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Analysis</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiffâs contention is that the defendant should have made a payment into court, instead of making a Calderbank offer, inorder to obtain the benefit of O 62, r 5(b) of the RDC (wrongly cited as r 5(c) in the Ruling) that all the costs before the properdate for acceptance of the payment-in be to the plaintiff and all the costs thereafter be to the defendant, if the payment exceededthe sum awarded by the judgment to the plaintiff.  However, the defendant did not make a payment into court, and therefore he shouldnot have the benefit of O 62, r 5(b).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On the other hand, the defendant contends that he could not have made any payment into court, because he took the stance, which hehas steadfastly taken since 21 September 2004, the date of the first Calderbank offer, that the plaintiff acted wrongly to have takenout a writ in the District Court, instead of bringing his claim in the Small Claims Tribunal. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The defendant relies on what was said by Keith JA in <i>Cho Ho Kuen v Yu Kwok Wah &amp; Ors</i>, CACV 480/2000 (29 May 2001, unreported), to justify the Calderbank offers instead of paying a sum into court.  The reasoning isthat the defendant was and had steadfastly been of the view that the claim should not have been brought in the District Court, andthat he should not justly pay the plaintiffâs costs on the District Court scale.  In <i>Cho Ho Kuen</i>, Keith JA said<ins>:</ins></p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">7.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">I do not think that a plaintiffâs entitlement to taxed costs on the acceptance of a payment into court necessarily results in injusticeto a defendant.  I appreciate that there may be cases, of which this is one, in which the defendant may not want to make a paymentinto court if the acceptance of the payment will automatically result in the plaintiff being entitled to his taxed costs.  But theway to avoid that is by the defendant making his offer to settle the case in the form of a <b>Calderbank</b> letter, i.e. a letter marked âwithout prejudiceâ save as to costsâ.  I appreciate that a <b>Calderbank</b> letter will not usually be appropriate when the claim is simply for a sum of money: see Ord. 62 r. 5(d).  But I do not see how thelimitation on the circumstances in which a <b>Calderbank</b> letter may be used can apply to a case in which the defendant wishes to dispute what would automatically follow in terms of costsfrom the acceptance of money paid into court.

In the case of the simple money claim, a defendant who wishes to avail himself of the protection affordedby an offer must, in the ordinary way, back his offer with cash by making a payment in and, speaking for myself, I should not, asat present advised, be disposed in such a case to treat a <i>Calderbank</i> offer as carrying the same consequencesas payment in.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In <i>Singh v Parkfield Group PLC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20PIQR%20Q110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) PIQR Q110</a>, Stuart-Smith LJ said:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âIn the ordinary way where a defendant was facing a monetary claim, he should make a payment into court in sufficient time for theplaintiff to consider it.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The above passages in <i>Cutts v Head</i> and <i>Singh v Parkfield</i> were followed by this Court in <i>The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels Ltd v Choi Bing Wing</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKLR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKLR 472</a>, where it was held that the defendant could have protected his position as to costs by payment into court.  As a result, the defendantâsCalderbank letter should be disregarded in the courtâs exercise of its discretion on costs.  Godfrey JA put the point succinctlyat p 479I:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">ââ¦  As it seems to me, the only way in which a defendant in the position of the defendant here can protect his position is bymeans of an open as distinct from a without prejudice offer.  The machinery provided by O.22 r.4 is simply not available where theparty making a without prejudice offer can protect his position by means of a payment into court as the defendant could have donehere.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In the case before us, the defendant did not adopt the solution provided by Godfrey JA but made the Calderbank offers pursuant tothe avenue suggested by Keith JA in <i>Cho Ho Kuen</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> As I see it, this method does not fully consider the plaintiffâs position vis-Ã -vis the offer, and may subject the defendant tothe risk of the court subsequently holding that it is reasonable for the plaintiff to have rejected the offer.  To put it simpler,the method may work an injustice to the plaintiff if effect is given to the Calderbank letter.  In order to avoid the injustice,it may result in a disadvantage to the defendant.  The present case is a clear demonstration of such a situation.  Here the Calderbankoffers, even the highest one of $45,000 all inclusive, did not allude to the reasonable disbursements, let alone costs, that theplaintiff had already incurred.  According to what the plaintiffâs solicitor told the judge, which is not denied by Mr Sakhrani(for the defendant), the plaintiff had by 21 September 2004 incurred costs and disbursements of not less than $40,000.  The disbursementsalone came to $14,361.50, including the fee of $11,400 for the medical report of Dr Lee Po Chin, a specialist in orthopaedics andtraumatology, police fee of $16.50, transcript (of the proceedings relating to the charge of driving offence against the defendant)of $97, fees for company searches (of the owners of the involved vehicles) of $355, hospital report fees of $1,863 and court feesof $630.  Such disbursements appear reasonable and even if the case had been brought before the Small Claims Tribunal, I have littledoubt that they would be allowed as reasonable expenses under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 24</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338">Cap 338</a>.  The plaintiff was put into an invidious position in deciding whether to accept the offer, without knowing what part ofthe offer of $45,000 was for his damages and how much was for his disbursements and costs.  Had the offer been separated to includea specific sum for his damages and another sum for his costs and disbursements, albeit on the Tribunal scale, the plaintiff wouldreasonably be required to consider, and the court having to deal with the matter would be in a better position to decide if it wasunreasonable or otherwise for the plaintiff to reject the offer.    </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The judge took into account that the plaintiffâs claim was not a liquidated claim such that the quantum was obvious.  That is correctand lends support to the reasonableness on the part of the plaintiff to reject the Calderbank offer.  Considering all the circumstancesof this case, especially the disbursements already incurred having amounted to over $14,000, I am of the view that the plaintiffdid not act unreasonably to reject the Calderbank offer of $45,000 all inclusive. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> As the claim is one for a sum of money, the usual and normal course is for the defendant to make a payment into court, although withthe consequence of his having to bear the costs up to the time of acceptance automatically on the District Court scale: see <i>Cho Ho Kuen</i>.  The only obstacle to a payment in was the defendantâs insistence that the action should have been brought in the Tribunal.  AsI find that the plaintiff was acting reasonably to reject the Calderbank offer, this obstacle should not be considered as a reasonableexcuse for the defendantâs not making a payment into court.  In the circumstances, I consider that the obstacle to a payment intocourt was unreasonably self-created and that defendant âcould have protected his position as to costs by means of a payment intocourt under Order 22â which he failed to do.  In my judgment, therefore, in the exercise of hisdiscretion on costs, the judge wasacting contrary to the decision of this Court in <i>The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels Ltd v Choi Bing Wing</i> and was wrong in taking into account the Calderbank letters, which he expressly stated in the first few sentences of paragraph 3of his Ruling to have done.  He should have acted in compliance with the proviso to O 22, r 14 and to O 62, r 5(b) of the RDC, payingno regard to the Calderbank offers when exercising his discretion on costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The judge made no order as to costs of the trial before him on 6 June 2005, and that was clearly based on his giving partial effectto the Calderbank letters which, by the reasons I have given above, must be disregarded.  This order should therefore be set aside.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The costs of the action</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Even though I consider that the judge should not take into account the Calderbank letters, it does not necessarily follow that hemust award the costs of the proceedings to the plaintiff, on the District Court scale.

One wonders whether a claim in the Small Claims Tribunal which perhaps carries less gravitas or clout, if I may use that expression,would have been taken as seriously by the insurers.

The letters before action addressed to the defendant as the driverof the taxi that caused the accident and the owner of the taxi were both dated 27 June 2003, while the plaintiff had already obtainedmedical reports from the Queen Mary Hospital and Dr Lee.  The letters before action attracted no response.  The<del>is</del> writ of the action was issued in late August 2004 and the medical report fees as well as the disbursements totalling about $14,000had already been incurred.  While Mr Pirie heavily relied on the fact that there was no response to the letters before action tojustify the plaintiff in bringing his claim in the District Court, I do not consider that this fact by itself has that effect. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Mr Sakhrani drew our attention to a number of salient facts in support of his submission that the plaintiff did not act reasonablyto commence this action in the District Court.  The medical reports, including that by Dr Lee, indicated that the injuries sufferedby the plaintiff were minor.  The plaintiff did not attend hospital straightaway after the accident; he returned to his office towork.  He suffered no loss of earnings and there was no prospect of any loss of future earnings.  He did not require any furthertreatment and was advised to do exercise to help recover from his residual back pain, but he had not acted on the advice even atthe time of the trial on 6 June 2005.  The recovery time was described by Dr Lee as between 2 weeks and 2 months.  A reasonable assessmentof the pain and suffering and loss of amenities would not be anything near the ceiling of the monetary jurisdiction of the SmallClaims Tribunal.  All these were accepted by the judge and evidenced by his award of $27,260 in favour of the plaintiff. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> While appreciating that a certain leeway must be given to the assessment of the quantum of the damages, the award made by the judgeclearly demonstrates that had an assessment been reasonably or properly made, the plaintiff would not recover anything close to $50,000. In the circumstances, I consider that it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to have commenced this action in the District Court,which would unjustifiably put the burden of footing the legal costs bill on to the defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> In view of <del>this</del> the conclusion I have come to that the plaintiff did not act reasonably in having his claim brought in the District Court, I considerthat the judge was wrong in awarding costs to the plaintiff on the District Court scale. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> In my judgment, the proper scale of costs of the action including the hearing for assessing the quantum of damages should be thatsimilar to that of the Tribunal, which will fairly reflect the amount of damages awarded and have the desirable effect of discouraginglitigants from unreasonably selecting the District Court as the forum for a claim of damages that are well under the Tribunalâsjurisdictional limit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.

Hence in considering costs, the Calderbankoffer was not a factor that would invariably require the judge to order costs in a manner similar to those made in the Small ClaimsTribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Small Claims Tribunal jurisdiction</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> However, even if the Calderbank offer was to be ignored, that was still not the end of the matter because the plaintiff eventuallyobtained a judgment the amount of which was within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal.  In the absence of special considerationsthe plaintiff must be, first of all, entitled to the costs of his action up to and including the judgment on damages.  The real issueis whether costs on District Court scale should be awarded.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The question</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Ultimately the question is whether it was reasonable to commence the action in the District Court.  I fully recognize the expertiseof District Court judges in dealing with personal injury cases but I do not agree that these claims should only be initiated in theDistrict Court on account of this expertise even if the monetary claim comes within the Small Claims Tribunal jurisdiction.  To doso will be contrary to the provision of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(1)</a> and the schedule of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/338" class="autolink_findacts">Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance</a></i> which expressly confer jurisdiction on the Small Claims Tribunal on claims in tort of not more than $50,000.  This type of casesare in fact heard there as shown in the case of <i>Ho Wai Leung v. Wan Chi Kuen</i>, DCPI No. 11 of 2001.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The only relevant consideration</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The only relevant consideration is whether at the commencement of the action, in view of the nature of the injury of the plaintiff,it was reasonable to say that he would recover more than $50,000.  I recognize fully that assessment of damages is not an easy taskbut at the same time any lawyer who practises in this area must be able to tell whether the plaintiff has a serious injury or notand whether his injury has any impact on his earning.  In this case from the available evidence one can see that the plaintiffâsinjury was extremely minor in nature and could not possibly have affected his earning.  He could not possibly have recovered morethan $50,000.  The sum of $27,260 assessed by the judge was the best indication of the value of the claim.  The lawyer was duty boundto advise the plaintiff of the costs implications of suing in the District Court. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> In the circumstances, it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to persist in pursuing the matter in the District Court, particularly,when the defendant had drawn his attention to the fact that the matter should be dealt with in the Small Claims Tribunal.  The onlyproper way of exercising the discretion was to award costs to be assessed in a manner similar to the costs allowed in the Small ClaimsTribunal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> I will also allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.
