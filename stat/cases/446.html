Introduction</p><p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  In this action, the plaintiffs claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for the outstanding sum of HK$3,600,000 due under an agreement dated 27 June 2008, alternatively under a Supplemental Supplyand Logistic Services Agreement dated 23 April 2008.  The plaintiffs also claim the same amount against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under two guarantees.</p><p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  For their part, the defendants deny liability to the plaintiffs under the agreement dated 27 June 2008 and the Supplemental Supplyand Logistic Services Agreement and raise allegations of duress and fraudulent misrepresentation by way of defence to the plaintiffsâclaims.</p><p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In order to put the issues in this action in their proper context, it is necessary to set out at some length the background factsout of which the plaintiffsâ claims, and the various defences, arise.</p><p class="heading">B.   The parties and relevant associated companies</p><p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, Profit Step Development Limited, is a company incorporated in Hong Kong for the purpose of carrying out the business oftrading fresh fruit and products sourced from overseas and sold through Hong Kong to the PRC.</p><p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, Jin Tao (Zhongshan) Fresh Products Logistics Co. Ltd, is a company incorporated in the PRC, whose principal activity isthe provision of logistics services for fresh fruit and products through its logistics hub in Zhongshan, PRC.</p><p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Both plaintiffs are subsidiaries of Heng Tai Consumables Group Limited (âHeng Taiâ), which is a company incorporated in theCayman Islands and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Heng Tai and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the distributionof consumable goods, cosmetics and cold chain products, the provision of cold chain and logistics services, and the cultivation anddistribution of agro-products.  The chairman of Heng Tai is Mr Lam Kwok Hing (âMr Lamâ) and Mr Chu Ki is one of its executivedirectors.</p><p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Golden Harvest (Macao Commercial Offshore) Limited is another subsidiary of Heng Tai, whose principal activity is the import ofoverseas fruit for direct shipment into the PRC.</p><p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Sun Rising Development (Agriculture) Limited, is a company incorporated in Hong Kong.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Mr Chan Yiu Cheung, is a shareholder and director of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  He is also the father of Mr Daniel Chan Ho Tak (âMr Daniel Chanâ), who in turn is also a shareholder and directorof the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p><p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Cheong Lee International Trading Company Limited (âCheong Leeâ) is a company incorporated in Hong Kong, of which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and his son, Mr Daniel Chan, are both shareholders and directors.</p><p class="heading">C.   The background facts</p><p class="heading">C.1   The context of the partiesâ dealings</p><p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In early December 2007, upon the introduction of Mr Lo Lik Sang, a consultant of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, his son Mr Daniel Chan and Mr Lee Yuk Hoi, a consultant of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, met Mr Ong Hong Hoon (âMr Ongâ), the general manager of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, and Mr Benson Ong Chew Sheng, the sales manager of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, at the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs offices in Zhongshan, PRC.  The purpose of this meeting appears to have been to explore the possibility of some formof business co-operation.</p><p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  It would appear that Mr Ong then introduced the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Daniel Chan to Mr Lam, the chairman of Heng Tai, and Mr Horris Wong Siu Hong (âMr Horris Wongâ), its chief financialofficer.  One particular project discussed between the parties was a red kiwi project being pursued by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in the PRC.</p><p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Sometime in January 2008, discussions took place between the parties in respect of two possible business ventures.  One possibilitywas an investment by Heng Tai in the red kiwi project, another was a fruit trading joint-venture enterprise between Heng Tai andCheong Lee.  The documents disclosed show that Mr Daniel Chan sent financial information about the kiwi fruit project, Cheong Leeand the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p><p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The discussions proceeded to the point at which Mr Daniel Chan sent a draft joint-venture agreement to Mr Horris Wong on 1 February2008.  This was entitled âHeng Tai Cheong Lee Joint Ventureâ and related to a joint-venture business to import worldwide fruitcommodities into the PRC market.  The proposal included the provision of a credit line by Heng Tai in the sum of HK$80 million. On 19 February 2008, Mr Daniel Chan sent a revised version of the proposed joint-venture agreement with a cash flow plan attachedto Mr Ong.  He also sent Mr Ong a proposal for the acquisition of 50% of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant by Heng Tai.  Neither of these proposals was pursued by Heng Tai.</p><p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 4 March 2008, Mr Ong sent a business proposal concerning the sale and purchase of durian to Mr Daniel Chan.  The proposed modeof operation was that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant should incorporate a new company in Hong Kong to procure imports of durian to the PRC using the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff as the logistics hub.  It was also proposed that the new company should provide security to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff in the sum of HK$20 million and over certain land in the PRC.</p><p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 18 March 2008, Mr Daniel Chan reverted to Mr Ong by e-mail indicating that Mr Ongâs business proposal for cooperation betweenthe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Heng Tai would not work since the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was not agreeable to providing security to the extent required.  On the other hand, the e-mail indicated that a pure buyingand selling relationship might work if Heng Tai simply needed fruit.</p><p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr Ong replied to Mr Daniel Chan by e-mail of the same date stating that the proposal he had forwarded on 4 March 2008 was onlya draft and had lapsed.  The e-mail includes the statement :</p><blockquote><p class="quote">âPeter and your Dad agreed to start with the Durian trading effective April 1.â</p></blockquote><p>Mr Ong also indicated that a simple agreement would be forwarded to Cheong Lee in due course.</p><p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  By a later e-mail also of 18 March 2008, Mr Freddy Lai Chi Hang (âMr Freddy Laiâ), the global sourcing manager of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, sent a draft purchase agreement in respect of the durian trading to Mr Daniel Chan.</p><p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The defendants have asserted that an oral joint venture agreement came into existence on 18 March 2008, so it will be necessaryto consider this assertion in due course.</p><p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On 19 March 2008, Mr Daniel Chan responded to Mr Freddy Laiâs draft with amendments and expressed the hope to âget into actioninstead of paper work status all the timeâ.</p><p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 21 March 2008, following a telephone conversation the day before, Mr Freddy Lai e-mailed Mr Daniel Chan with an amended agreement. He referred to the fact that in a discussion with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant Heng Tai had indicated it would use its subsidiary Golden Harvest for the fruit trading business.  He summarised the proposedoperation in an accompanying diagram as being that the Thai supplier would issue invoices on a CNF Hong Kong basis to Golden Harvest,who would pay the sums invoiced to Cheong Lee for the Thai supplierâs benefit within 7 days of the invoices; for its part, GoldenHarvest would then sell the shipments to Sun Rising (China) and issue invoices including a 2% commission and other handling chargespayable 30 days after the delivery order.  A seasonal deposit (of HK$1.25 million) was to be paid by Golden Harvest to Cheong Lee.</p><p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr Daniel Chan replied to Mr Freddy Lai by e-mail dated 24 March 2008 indicating that he accepted the proposed arrangement.</p><p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On 25 March 2008, Mr Freddy Lai e-mailed Mr Daniel Chan to say that Heng Taiâs board of directors had reviewed the draft agreementand wished to amend two terms, one of which was to require a personal guarantee for HK$2.5 million from the 2nd defendant and/orMr Daniel Chan, or from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p><p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  On 26 March 2008, Mr Daniel Chan e-mailed Mr Freddy Lai to indicate acceptance of the two new amended terms, with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant being agreeable to provide the guarantee for HK$2.5 million.  He asked that the date for the payment of the seasonal depositbe specified.</p><p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On 26 March 2008, Mr Freddy Lai sent a revised purchase agreement, described as version 3.0, to Mr Daniel Chan.  On 27 March 2008,Mr Freddy Lai e-mailed the final version of the purchase agreement to Mr Daniel Chan, stating that the deposit would be paid to CheongLeeâs account on or before 1 April 2008.</p><p class="heading">C2.   The Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet</p><p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It was in these circumstances, and this context, in which the document entitled âPurchase Agreement and Term Sheetâ was signedon 28 March 2008.  This records an agreement between Golden Harvest and Cheong Lee and outlines the terms and conditions of tradeagreed.  It includes a term that the agreement supersedes any verbal or written agreement entered into by Golden Harvest and CheongLee or any associate companies on or before 28 March 2008.</p><p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The purpose of the agreement is recorded as being to establish a fair and profitable trade for both parties.  Cheong Lee covenantedto source fresh durian from growers, suppliers and exporters in Thailand with a target volume of around 28 containers per month. Cheong Lee was to arrange shipments by sea from Thailand to Hong Kong and arrange for the collection of shipments in Hong Kong,with at least 40% of the shipments being diverted to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs logistic centre in the PRC.</p><p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  For its part, Golden Harvest was to pay for the total shipment quantity 7 days after the goods were laden on board.  It would theninvoice Cheong Leeâs sales agent in the PRC for the agreed procurement commission, which was to be 2% of the CNF Hong Kong price,and the handling charges of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, also to be 2% of the CNF Hong Kong price.  This invoice was to be payable 30 days after the signing of the delivery order.</p><p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Cheong Lee was to provide a personal guarantee of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in the sum of HK$2.5 million.  Golden Harvest was to pay a seasonal deposit of HK$1.25 million to Cheong Lee on or before1 April 2008, which Cheong Lee was to repay to Golden Harvest at the end of the season.</p><p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet was signed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on behalf of Cheong Lee and by Mr James Ding Ooi Leong, business development manager of Golden Harvest, on behalf of GoldenHarvest.</p><p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Despite the signing of the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet, it would appear that Heng Tai, as the parent of Golden Harvest, hadcertain concerns about that agreement.  One of the issues concerned an alleged lack of authority on the part of Mr Ding to sign thePurchase Agreement and Term Sheet on behalf of Golden Harvest.  Another issue was said to be the fact that Heng Tai wished, for taxreasons, to use a Hong Kong incorporated entity as the counterparty in the fruit trading business.</p><p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Whatever the reasons for Heng Taiâs concerns about the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet, the executed copy of that agreementwas supplemented by an endorsement at the end of the document signed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and by Mr Chu Ki, an executive director of Heng Tai.  That endorsement, which is dated 2 April 2008, reads as follows :</p><blockquote><p class="quote">âThe terms of this Purchase Agreement to be amended further.â</p></blockquote><p class="heading">C3.  The Loan Agreement</p><p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  As noted above, under the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet, Golden Harvest was to pay a seasonal deposit of HK$1.25 million toCheong Lee on or before 1 April 2008.  Due to the concerns of Heng Tai as to the validity of the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet,this seasonal deposit was not so paid.</p><p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  After the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet was signed, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant asked Mr Ong of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff when the seasonal deposit would be paid.  The plaintiffâs case is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was anxious for this to be paid as he was in need of money, apparently to repay a debt owed by him to his New Zealand partnersin the kiwi enterprise.  Mr Horris Wong indicated to Mr Ong that a proper formal agreement would be necessary to replace the PurchaseAgreement and Term Sheet and that the seasonal deposit would not be paid to Cheong Lee until that replacement agreement had beensigned and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had given a personal guarantee for the return of the seasonal deposit.  Mr Horris Wong informed Mr Ong that, instead ofthe payment of the seasonal deposit, a personal loan might be made to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p><p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Be that as it may, on 2 April 2008, a letter bearing the reference âLoan of HK$1,250,000.00â was issued by Heng Tai FinanceLimited to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  This letter recorded that Golden Harvest as lender agreed to lend the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as borrower the sum of HK$1.25 million subject to and on the terms and conditions set out in the letter.  The loan wasto be made, on the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs instructions, directly to Cheong Lee but the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was to be fully liable for the loan.  Unless in default, the loan was to be interest free and the loan was to be repayablewithin 14 days of written demand by the lender.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant signed a separate confirmation of acceptance addressed to Heng Tai Finance Limited in which he acknowledged that he accepted,and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions for the grant of the loan.</p><p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The circumstances in which the loan agreement was executed are controversial and it will be necessary to return to them later inthis Judgment.</p><p class="heading">C4.   Shipments of durian</p><p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Notwithstanding the endorsement on the executed Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet that its terms would be amended further, it wouldappear that Cheong Lee did proceed to procure shipments of durian from a Thai supplier, namely Farcharoen Porn Enterprise Co. Ltd(âFPEâ).</p><p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  By e-mails dated 31 March 2008, Ms Fannie Kwok, the assistant to the general manager of Cheong Lee, sent shipment schedules to MrFreddy Lai in respect of a number of shipments of durian from Thailand.  On the same date, she also e-mailed to Mr Freddy Lai invoicesissued by FPE to Golden Harvest in respect of the first four shipments of durian from Bangkok to Hong Kong.  By reference to thecontainer numbers identified in those invoices, the corresponding bills of lading for those first four shipments [C3/574-577] wereissued on 21 March 2008, 22 March 2008, 25 March 2008 and 29 March 2008.  This would appear to indicate that at least some shipmentswere ordered before the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet was signed on 28 March 2008.</p><p class="heading">C5.   The revised supply agreement</p><p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Following the loan agreement on 2 April 2008, it would appear that Heng Tai sought the assistance of solicitors to prepare a revisedagreement.  On 9 April 2008, Mr Horris Wong sent an e-mail to Mr Freddy Lai to inform him that he had liaised with Heng Taiâs legalcounsel to redraft the agreement.  He summarised the major terms to be incorporated in the revised agreement and stated that it wasexpected to be ready by Friday (which would have been 11 April 2008) so that the proposed cooperation scheme could then commenceafter the agreement was agreed and signed by both parties.</p><p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In the event, the draft supply agreement was not ready until 12 April 2008.  By e-mail of that date, Mr Horris Wong sent a copyof this to Mr Freddy Lai for him to liaise with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with a view to execution early the following week.  Mr Horris Wong noted that the letter of guarantee would also be sentfor review on Monday (which would have been 14 April 2008) once the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant agreed the terms of the supply agreement.</p><p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The draft supply agreement was sent by Mr Freddy Lai to Mr Daniel Chan by e-mail dated 14 April 2008.  The draft agreement was tobe between the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff as importer, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as purchaser and the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff as logistics centre.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is referred to in the draft supply agreement in respect of the personal guarantee which he was to provide as a conditionprecedent to the agreement.</p><p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  On 14 April 2008, Mr Horris Wong sent to Mr Freddy Lai drafts of the guarantees to be executed with the supply agreement for himto forward to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for his review.  The first guarantee was the guarantee required as a condition precedent to the supply agreement and tobe given by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff for the sum of HK$2.5 million.  The second guarantee was the guarantee to be given by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff in respect of the seasonal deposit under the supply agreement.</p><p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Mr Freddy Lai then forwarded the draft supply agreement and guarantees to Ms Meeling Law of Cheong Lee by two e-mails both dated15 April 2008.</p><p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  On 16 April 2008, Mr Freddy Lai sent an e-mail to Mr Horris Wong noting that he had contacted the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, who had received the draft supply agreement and guarantees and had passed them to his legal adviser for review.  The e-mailnoted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would revert by the coming weekend (which would have been 19/20 April) if there was any comment.</p><p class="heading">C6.   A change in the name of the party invoiced for the durian</p><p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  On 19 April 2008, Ms Fannie Kwok sent an e-mail to Mr Freddy Lai in which she referred to the change of company on the part of HengTai from Golden Harvest to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and attaching revised invoices.  An example of one of those invoices, namely invoice No.FD001-08 dated 31 March 2008, isincluded with this e-mail and is an invoice of FPE in respect of a shipment of durian for the account and risk of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, instead of Golden Harvest as before.</p><p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The change of name from Golden Harvest to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff is also reflected in the commercial invoice and delivery order issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant dated 20 April 2008 in respect of a quantity of 960 cartons of durian.  The commercial invoice is addressed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the contact person for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, as is the delivery order.  The latter document is signed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as buyer.</p><p class="heading">C7.   The signing of the Supply Agreement and Logistic Services Agreement and the Guarantees dated 2 April 2008</p><p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  On 21 April 2008, Mr Daniel Chan replied to Mr Freddy Laiâs e-mail dated 14 April 2008 enclosing the draft supply agreement andguarantees, indicating that his lawyer had come back to him and made some comments.  He attached the amendments proposed.  He suggestedthat it was not necessary for there to be a guarantee from the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for the seasonal deposit.</p><p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In response, on the instructions of Mr Horris Wong, Mr Freddy Lai replied to Mr Daniel Chan by e-mail on the same date to advisethat the guarantee of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was required also to cover the return of the seasonal deposit of HK$1.25 million and as well as the receivables of HK$2.5million.</p><p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The reply from Mr Daniel Chan to this advice, also by e-mail of 21 April 2008, was âI see.â  He also asked for comments on theproposed amendments to the draft supply agreement.</p><p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In response to this query, Mr Horris Wong replied to Mr Daniel Chan indicating that Heng Tai âwould prefer to stick to our versionand again [the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] must give guarantee for return of the seasonal deposit.â</p><p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  It would appear that a telephone conversation then ensued between Mr Freddy Lai and Mr Daniel Chan and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  This is referred to in an e-mail dated 21 April 2008 from Mr Freddy Lai to Mr Horris Wong, copied to Mr Daniel Chan. One of the points suggested by Mr Daniel Chan and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was that it should be stated clearly âthat the loan agreement made to [the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] on 2 April 2008 in respect of the loan of a sum of HK$1,250,000.00 should be set off after signing the supply agreementand the guarantee deposit for seasonal depositâ.</p><p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  By an e-mail in response to that referred to in the preceding paragraph, Mr Daniel Chan reverted to Mr Horris Wong and Mr FreddyLai, to indicate âwe accepted to amend based on your agreement although this is not truly reflect the true transactionâ.</p><p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  On 22 April 2008, in response to a reminder from Mr Freddy Lai, Ms Fannie Kwok sent an authorisation letter on the letterhead ofFPE addressed to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and dated 18 April 2008 authorising payment by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in settlement of its outstanding account with FPE to Cheong Lee.  This authorisation letter was endorsed by Cheong Lee,for whom the 2nd defendant signed as authorised signatory.</p><p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Also on 22 April 2008, Mr Horris Wong sent to Mr Freddy Lai the revised supply agreement and guarantees as agreed between the parties. On the following day, 23 April 2008, Mr Ong e-mailed Mr Horris Wong stating that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had spoken to him the previous night and was agreeable to sign the documents that day.  Mr Ong added that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would appreciate payment upon his signing of the documents.</p><p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  These are the circumstances disclosed in the contemporaneous documents in which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant attended at the offices of Heng Tai on 23 April 2008.  It is not in dispute that he signed the Supply and Logistic ServicesAgreement dated 2 April 2008 (âthe Supply Agreementâ), the guarantee to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff dated 2 April 2008 (âthe First Personal Guaranteeâ) and the guarantee to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff dated 2 April 2008 (âthe Second Personal Guaranteeâ) on that occasion.  There is an issue as to whether he also signedthe Supplemental Supply and Logistic Services Agreement dated 23 April 2008 (âthe Supplemental Agreementâ), the guarantee tothe 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff dated 23 April 2008 (âthe Additional First Personal Guaranteeâ) and the guarantee to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff dated 23 April 2008 (âthe Additional Second Personal Guaranteeâ) on that occasion, to which it will be necessary toreturn below.  More importantly, it is the defendantsâ case that these documents were all executed under duress and/or by reasonof fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiffs and it will be necessary to address this issue below.</p><p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  At the same time as signing the Supply Agreement and the First Personal Guarantee and the Second Personal Guarantee, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, for and on behalf of Cheong Lee, also signed a letter dated 23 April 2008 addressed to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff acknowledging receipt of a cheque payment in the sum of HK$2,376,072 received on behalf of FPE for the settlement of accountspayable for purchase orders set out in an attached schedule.  The letter confirmed that the receipt was in accordance with the authorisationletter signed by FPE dated 18 April 2008.</p><p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Also on 23 April 2008, Heng Tai Finance Limited issued a letter to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant stating that it agreed to set off the debt owed pursuant to the loan agreement signed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 2 April 2008 in respect of the loan of a sum of HK$1.25 million against the seasonal deposit of the same amount payableby the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff in accordance with the Supply Agreement.  The letter noted that the loan agreement would be terminated with immediate effectand any past, present and future liability of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under or arising from that agreement extinguished with immediate effect.</p><p class="heading">C8.   The terms of the Supply and Logistic Services Agreement and the Guarantees dated 2 April 2008</p><p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Under the Supply Agreement, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was described as the Importer, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the Purchaser and the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff as the Logistics Centre.  The recitals to the agreement recorded, amongst other things, that the Importer had agreed toimport a variety of fresh fruit from Thailand subject to the terms of the agreement and the Purchaser had agreed to purchase freshfruit and provide procurement services to the Logistics Centre.  The recitals also recorded that it was a condition precedent thatthe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant should provide two personal guarantees in favour of the Importer and the Logistics Centre.</p><p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The agreement defined its Effective Date as 2 April 2008 and the Supply Period as the period from 2 April 2008 to 31 October 2008. By clause 2.1, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant agreed to purchase from the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff at the price specified in clause 2.5 fresh fruit from suppliers in Thailand as specified in purchase orders placed by the1<sup>st</sup> defendant with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  The target purchase volume was to be around 28 containers per month, subject to the final consent of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  By clause 2.3, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff undertook to settle payment for each shipment of fresh fruit from Thailand seven business days after the date of loadingthose products in Thailand, provided it received invoices for such products from the suppliers within two days after the loadingdate.  The specified price was the purchase cost (in CNF Hong Kong terms) plus a 2% mark-up of the purchase price from the suppliers.</p><p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  By clause 2.6, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff agreed to issue invoices to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for the fresh fruits from Thailand on the arrival date of each shipment in Hong Kong or seven days after the loading date,whichever was the earliest.  Payment for such invoices was to be made by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant within 30 days from the date of such invoices.</p><p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  By clause 2.7, the parties agreed and acknowledged that it was a condition precedent that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant should provide a first personal guarantee to the extent of HK$2.5 million in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to guarantee the obligations of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant under the agreement and all monies payable by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.</p><p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  By clause 3, the 1st defendant agreed to deliver not less than 40% of the fresh fruit from Thailand purchased from the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff each calendar month unless requested otherwise by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  All logistics arrangements costs and all costs and expenses incurred in relation to the delivery of the fruit to the2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff were to be borne by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p><p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  By clause 4.1, it was agreed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff would charge the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at the prevailing rates charged to its clients for handling and processing the fresh fruit from Thailand delivered to the2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff if logistics services were required in accordance with clause 3.1.</p><p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  By clause 4.2, it was agreed that, on the signing of the agreement, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff would pay a seasonal deposit in the sum of HK$1.25 million to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant or its nominee :</p><blockquote><p class="quote">ââ¦ by way of a set-off for a debt owed, pursuant to a loan agreement signed by [the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] on 2 April 2008 in favour of Heng Tai Finance Limited in respect of the loan of a sum of HK$1,250,000.00 made to [the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] (âthe Loan Agreementâ), by [the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] to Heng Tai Finance Limited or any of its related group company under common control, and the Loan Agreement shall beterminated with immediate effect and any past, present and future liability of [the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] under or arising from the Loan Agreement shall be extinguished with immediate effect.â</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, under clause 4.2, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant agreed to return the seasonal deposit to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff within seven days of the expiry or termination of the agreement, whichever was the earliest.</p><p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  By clause 4.4, the parties agreed and acknowledged that it was a condition precedent that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant should provide a second personal guarantee to the extent of HK$1.25 million in favour of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff to guarantee the return of the seasonal deposit upon the expiry or termination of the agreement.</p><p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  By clause 9, the parties acknowledged that the agreement constituted the entire agreement between them and that it superseded anyprevious oral or written agreements or understandings between them with respect to its subject matter.</p><p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The agreement was signed by Mr Chu Ki on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and by Mr Lam on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff.  Mr Horris Wongâs name was inserted as the witness to their respective signatures.  For the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs part, the agreement was signed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on its behalf.  The name of a Mr Wong Chun, one of Heng Taiâs accounting staff, was inserted as the witness to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs signature.</p><p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The First Personal Guarantee was given by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as Guarantor to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff as Importer.  By clause 2.1, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff the due and punctual performance and compliance with the guaranteed obligations (being the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs respective obligations under the Supply Agreement).  In particular, if for any reason the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not pay any sum payable by it to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff by the time and on the dates specified in the Supply Agreement or any invoice issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant under that agreement for payment, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant agreed immediately on demand by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to pay that sum to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.</p><p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Under clause 3.1 of the First Personal Guarantee, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant agreed that he should be liable as if he were the sole principal debtor and not merely a surety.  By clause 4.1, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs obligations under the guarantee were to remain in full force and effect by way of continuing security until all theguaranteed obligations had been duly complied with in full.  Furthermore, the obligations of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as guarantor were additional to and not instead of any security or other guarantee or indemnity in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.</p><p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The Second Personal Guarantee was given by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as Guarantor to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff as Logistics Centre.  By clause (1), the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff the due and punctual return of the whole sum of the deposit defined in the Supply Agreement by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff or its nominee within seven days upon expiry or termination of the Supply Agreement, whichever was the earliest.</p><p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  By clause (2), the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant further unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff that if for any reason the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in breach of clause (1), the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would forthwith on demand by the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff pay such sum to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff.</p><p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant signed both of the guarantees and Mr Horris Wongâs name was inserted as the witness to his signature on both.  Both guaranteeswere stated in fact to be signed, sealed and delivered by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as guarantor, although no seal was affixed under the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs signature.</p><p class="heading">C9.   The Supplemental Supply and Logistic Services Agreement and the Guarantees dated 23 April 2008</p><p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  As noted above, the Supply Agreement and the two guarantees dated 2 April 2008 were in fact signed by the parties on 23 April 2008in Heng Taiâs offices in Hong Kong.</p><p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  According to the evidence of Mr Horris Wong, Heng Tai thought that it would be preferable if the Supply Agreement and the two guaranteeswere made as deeds under seal.  For this reason, apparently, a Supplemental Supply and Logistic Services Agreement (âthe SupplementalAgreementâ) and two further guarantees were prepared for execution by the parties.</p><p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The Supplemental Agreement is stated to be made on 23 April 2008 and is in substantially the same terms as the Supply Agreement. However, the recitals to the Supplemental Agreement record that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs agreement to import fresh fruit from Thailand and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs agreement to purchase fresh fruit and provide procurement services to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff were on the terms of the Supply Agreement, which was defined as the First Agreement.  The recitals also recorded that theSupplemental Agreement was supplemental to the First Agreement and that the parties had agreed to amend the First Agreement in accordancewith the terms and conditions set out in the Supplemental Agreement.</p><p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The entire agreement clause, clause 8, provided that save and except for clause 7 of the First Agreement (the clause dealing withthe duration and termination of the Supply Agreement), the parties acknowledged and agreed that the Supplemental Agreement shouldsupersede any previous agreements or understandings between them and all the other provisions of the First Agreement with respectto its subject matter.</p><p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The parties executed the Supplemental Agreement by way of deed, intended to be delivered on 23 April 2008.  For both the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, the Supplemental Agreement was signed by Mr Lam and sealed with the common seal of each company.  For the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the Supplemental Agreement was signed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and sealed with its common seal.  Mr Lamâs signature was witnessed by Mr Horris Wong and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs by Mr Daniel Chan.</p><p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The Additional First Personal Guarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee, which accompanied the Supplemental Agreement,were in the same terms as the First Personal Guarantee and the Second Personal Guarantee, save that they were dated 23 April 2008and a seal was attached under the respective signatures of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on each.  Again, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs signature on each of the guarantees was witnessed by Mr Horris Wong.</p><p class="heading">C10.  Events subsequent to the execution of the Supply Agreement and the Guarantees dated 2 April 2008</p><p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Following the execution of the Supply Agreement, the First Personal Guarantee and the Second Personal Guarantee, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff provided a cheque in the sum of HK$2,376,072 payable to Cheong Lee on behalf of FPE for settlement of accounts payablefor purchase orders in respect of 14 containers of durian that had been shipped from Thailand.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant signed as a director of Cheong Lee on an acknowledgement of receipt to confirm receipt of the sum in question in accordancewith the authorisation letter issued by FPE to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff dated 18 April 2008.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant also signed, on behalf of Cheong Lee, the attached schedule showing the account payable by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to FPE.</p><p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  On 25 April 2008, Mr Freddy Lai sent an e-mail to Mr Horris Wong to relay an instruction from Mr Ong to inquire whether the collectionof payment for the 14 containers from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would be 30 days from 23 April 2008 rather than from the corresponding invoice date and to note that payment would be madeto FPE for an extra container of durian in the amount of HK$149,760.</p><p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  On the same day, Mr Horris Wong replied to Mr Freddy Lai by e-mail to confirm that the 30 daysâ credit terms for the 14 containershad been agreed between Mr Lam and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to run from 23 April 2008.  Mr Horris Wong went on to note that the credit limit for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had been set at HK$2.5 million and that since the 15<sup>th</sup> container had arrived in Hong Kong prior to the finalisation of the arrangement, payment would exceptionally be made for this containersubject to Mr Lamâs confirmation.  Mr Horris Wong reminded Mr Freddy Lai that no more purchases from FPE should be made unlessinvoice amounts had been collected from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to reduce the outstanding balance below HK$2.5 million.</p><p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  On 15 May 2008, a cheque was issued to Cheong Lee in the sum of HK$149,760 in respect of the 15<sup>th</sup> container of durian.</p><p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  On 22 May 2008, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff issued a statement to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in respect of its invoices for the first 14 containers of durian in the total amount of HK$2,423,593.40, falling due on23 May 2008.</p><p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  The defendantsâ evidence is that, on 26 May 2008, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Daniel Chan went to Heng Taiâs offices to speak to Mr Lam.  He was unavailable so instead they met with Mr HorrisWong and explained that the late payment was the result of Golden Harvestâs breach of agreement resulting in Cheong Leeâs cashflow difficulties.  It is the defendantsâ case that Mr Horris Wong demanded payment by way of post-dated cheques, failing whichthe plaintiffs would issue a writ which would have an adverse effect on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs red kiwi project and also on Mr Daniel Chanâs future ability to work in a managerial position in a listed company.</p><p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs outstanding invoices were not paid either on 23 May 2008 or thereafter.  Accordingly, on 4 June 2008, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffsâ solicitors wrote to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to state that the plaintiffs regarded the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs failure to pay the outstanding 14 invoices as evincing of an intention to repudiate the Supplemental Agreement.  The1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs thereby accepted the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs repudiation of the Supplemental Agreement and, in addition to the overdue invoices, demanded repayment of the seasonaldeposit in the sum of HK$1.25 million pursuant to clause 4.2 of the Supplemental Agreement within seven days, failing which legalproceedings would be commenced.</p><p class="heading">C11.  The repayment schedule and post-dated cheques</p><p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  By an e-mail dated Friday, 13 June 2008, Mr Daniel Chan wrote on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to Mr Horris Wong to state that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was facing financial difficulty due to previous heavy investment and the recent delayed payment record of its bank.  Hestated that the bank had suspended the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs credit line.  As a result, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant could not make payment on schedule at that stage but it was confident it could settle the outstanding balance once itscredit line was reinstated by the bank.  Mr Daniel Chan stated that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would not want to ignore the payment and damage its reputation.  He stressed this was a short-term difficulty and askedMr Horris Wong to believe that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would try its very best to make the payment.  He asked for time and, in the meantime, Mr Daniel Chan wished to make a settlementproposal to Mr Horris Wong for his consideration.  He indicated he could prepare this in the next few days and present it to Mr HorrisWong and Mr Lam âon Fridayâ (which, if a reference to the following Friday, would have been 20 June 2008).</p><p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  On 16 June 2008, Mr Ong sent an e-mail to Mr Horris Wong indicating that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Daniel Chan requested a meeting with him and Mr Lam on Friday (presumably 20 June 2008).  Mr Ong sent a furthere-mail on 16 June 2008 to Mr Daniel Chan indicating that he had conveyed the request for a meeting to Mr Lam but regretted to informMr Daniel Chan that the Board of Directors insisted that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant should make payment by 18 June 2008 for the amount owing, failing which legal proceedings would be commenced without furtherreference.  This demand was accompanied by a strong recommendation that payment was made âotherwise once the Court Judgment isobtained from the Court it will seriously affect your entire business operationâ.</p><p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  On 19 June 2008, Mr Daniel Chan sent an e-mail to Mr Horris Wong referring to a telephone conversation of the preceding day in whichMr Horris Wong indicated Mr Lam was reluctant to meet Mr Daniel Chan and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant even though they had a settlement proposal ready to discuss with him.  The e-mail records that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Daniel Chan attended at the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs offices the previous day but Mr Lam and Mr Horris Wong were not there.  Mr Daniel Chan asked if he and his father couldmeet Mr Lam the next day to discuss a settlement proposal.</p><p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  On 25 June 2008, Mr Daniel Chan again sent an e-mail to Mr Horris Wong in which he noted he had still not heard from Mr Horris Wongregarding a meeting for a settlement proposal.  The e-mail continued as follows :</p><blockquote><p class="quote">âAccording to your statement, outstanding is HK$3,673,593.40.

A document entitled Payment Scheduleunder the name of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant setting out 10 payments by post-dated cheques to extinguish a total indebtedness of HK$3,826,348.60, including the HK$1.25million seasonal deposit had been prepared.  This was signed by Mr Horris Wong on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to acknowledge receipt of the 10 post-dated cheques, which had been issued by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, in the total sum of HK$3,826,348.60.  At the foot of the document, Mr Horris Wong wrote :</p><blockquote><p class="quote">âThe remaining balance of the total debts shall become immediately due and payable if any one of the above post-dated cheques isin default.â</p><p class="quote">The manuscript note was countersigned by him and Mr Daniel Chan.  There is a dispute as to whether this Payment Schedule was preparedby the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant or by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff but it is not in dispute that the document was signed and that Mr Daniel Chan provided the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff with 10 post-dated cheques of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for the total indebtedness in the amount of HK$3,826,348.60.  The first such cheque in the sum of HK$226,348.60 was dated15 July 2008.  The other cheques were each in the sum of HK$400,000.  The second was dated 15 August 2008, and the third 30 August2008.  Thereafter, the cheques were dated the 15<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> day of each successive month, ending with the 10<sup>th</sup> payment on 15 December 2008.</p></blockquote><p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  On 4 July 2008, Mr Daniel Chan sent an e-mail to Mr Horris Wong referring to the submission of post-dated cheques on the precedingFriday.  His e-mail noted that, as discussed and agreed, Mr Horris Wong would accept cheques of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for payment, whereupon the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs personal post-dated cheques would be returned and not used.  The e-mail also records that each payment dated the 30<sup>th</sup> of each month would be deferred until the beginning of the following year.</p><p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  A cheque of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant dated 15 July 2008 was provided to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in the sum of HK$226,348.60, which was duly honoured on presentation.  However, no further cheques of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant were provided to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in substitution for the post-dated cheques of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  Accordingly, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs second post-dated cheque, dated 15 August 2008, was presented for payment but the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was advised by its bank on 25 August 2008 that that cheque had been dishonoured on presentation.</p><p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  In these circumstances, the plaintiffsâ solicitors issued letters before action to each of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant dated 27 August 2008 demanding the total outstanding amount due under the 27 June 2008 Payment Schedule.

Prior to the Supplemental Agreement, was there an oral Joint Venture Agreement between Cheong Lee and Heng Tai on or about 18March 2008 incorporating an agreement for the purchase of 28 containers of durian per month from Thailand for six months?</p><p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  The basis of the defendantsâ contention that such an oral agreement was concluded on or about 18 March 2008 appears to be thecontents of the e-mail dated 18 March 2008 from Mr Ong to Mr Daniel Chan in which it is stated âPeter and your Dad agreed to startwith the Durian trading effective April 1.â</p><p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  There was some dispute as to the identity of the person referred to in the e-mail as Peter.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs assistant general manager was Mr Peter Wong Kam Wing and it was suggested that the reference was to him.  Whilst Ithink this may be likely, it does not follow that the e-mail records a concluded oral contract.  As noted in the e-mail, an agreementwas to be forwarded to Cheong Lee in due course and a draft of the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet was in fact provided to Mr DanielChan by e-mail on 18 March 2008.  That draft agreement included a term that the agreement superseded any verbal or written agreemententered into by the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and Cheong Lee or any associate companies on or before the date of its execution.</p><p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  In circumstances in which the parties clearly contemplated a written agreement to supersede any oral agreement, and in which theyeventually came to sign the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet dated 28 March 2008, I do not consider that it would be reasonableto conclude that any verbal arrangement recorded in the e-mail dated 18 March 2008 constituted a binding joint venture agreementbetween the parties as alleged.</p><p class="heading">D.2   Was that agreement to purchase durian supplemented by the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet between Cheong Lee and Golden Harveston or about 28 March 2008?</p><p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  As I have found, in relation to issue (1) above, that there was no oral agreement to purchase durian, there is no question of thePurchase Agreement and Term Sheet dated 28 March 2008 supplementing such an agreement.  The question remains, however, whether thePurchase Agreement and Term Sheet dated 28 March 2008 constituted a binding and concluded contract.</p><p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  I have referred above to certain concerns of Heng Tai concerning the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet.  Although it was Mr HorrisWongâs evidence that Mr Ding was not authorised to sign on behalf of Golden Harvest, the lack of authority was not pleaded by theplaintiffs.  Although it is pleaded that the Purchase Agreement and Term  Sheet dated 28 March 2008 was agreed to be replaced bya proper and legally binding agreement, I do not find that the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet when executed was not valid.  Iaccept, however, the evidence of Mr Horris Wong that he informed Mr Ong about Heng Taiâs concerns regarding the Purchase Agreementand Term Sheet and that, from Heng Taiâs perspective, a new agreement would need to be signed by the parties.  I also accept theevidence of Mr Ong that he informed the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that a new agreement would need to be signed by the parties.</p><p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  This is reflected by the endorsement dated 2 April 2008 on the foot of the executed Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet dated 28 March2008 : âThe terms of this Purchase Agreement to be amended furtherâ.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs evidence was that the endorsement was written on the document when he was asked to sign against it on 2 April 2008. He said he was told by Mr Horris Wong that there was to be some amendment to the document and that if the 2nd defendant agreed heshould sign.</p><p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  There is no plea by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that he was subject to duress in signing the endorsement to the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet.  However, the endorsementto the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet was executed at the same time at which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant says he was under pressure to sign the Loan Agreement dated 2 April 2008, which I shall address below.</p><p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Therefore, whilst I find that the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet dated 28 March 2008 did constitute a binding contractual arrangementbetween Golden Harvest and Cheong Lee when it was executed on 28 March 2008, I also find that on 2 April 2008 the parties agreedto amend that contract by replacing it with other contractual arrangements.</p><p class="heading">D3.   Did Golden Harvest and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff wrongfully fail to pay Cheong Lee the deposit under the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet on or before 1 April 2008?</p><p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  So far as the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff is concerned, the answer to this question must be in the negative.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was never a party to the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet dated 28 March 2008 and so never engaged in any contractualpromise to pay a deposit to Cheong Lee.</p><p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Clause 2.1 of the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet required Golden Harvest to pay a seasonal deposit of HK$1.25 million to CheongLee on or before 1 April 2008.  It is common ground that this sum was not paid by Golden Harvest to Cheong Lee on or before thatdate.  However, as I have noted above, it is clear that by 2 April 2008, the parties to the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet agreedthat it was to be amended.  On 31 March 2008, Ms Meeling Law of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant provided information relating to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and a copy of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs identity card to Heng Tai.  The natural inference is that this information was sought with a view to amending the existingcontractual arrangements.  On 1 April 2008, a draft letter of guarantee was provided by Mr Freddy Lai to Mr Daniel Chan to be executedby the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in relation to the purchase of durian.  All this points, in my judgment, to the fact that the Purchase Agreement and TermSheet would be amended and replaced by other contractual arrangements.</p><p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  On 2 April 2008, the Loan Agreement was made under which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant received the same sum as would have been paid by Golden Harvest by way of seasonal deposit under clause 2.1 of the PurchaseAgreement and Term Sheet.  I will address below the question of whether the Loan Agreement was procured by reason of duress or fraudulentmisrepresentation.  Subject to that issue, the fact of the agreement constituted by the Loan Agreement provides an indication that,even if Golden Harvest is to be regarded as having been in breach of the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet after 1 April 2008 byfailing to pay the seasonal deposit, any such breach was either waived or otherwise excused by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs agreement to the Loan Agreement and the subsequent contractual arrangements which replaced the Purchase Agreement andTerm Sheet.</p><p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  I therefore conclude that the failure by Golden Harvest to pay Cheong Lee the seasonal deposit under the Purchase Agreement andTerm Sheet by 1 April 2008 was not wrongful.</p><p class="heading">D4.   Did Mr Horris Wong procure the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs agreement to the 2 April 2008 Loan Agreement by means of duress or fraudulent misrepresentation?</p><p class="heading">D4.1  Economic duress</p><p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  It was the defendantsâ case that the Loan Agreement was procured by duress.  Although it had initially been alleged that the duresswas constituted by physical duress in that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was âforcibly detained in a roomâ and was refused to be allowed to leave the room unless and until he signed the relevantagreements (Amended Defence Â§24.1), this allegation was abandoned by the time of the trial.  Instead, it was the defendantsâ casethat the act of Mr Horris Wong in refusing to pay the seasonal deposit and leaving the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with only the option of getting money in the form of a personal loan was illegitimate pressure in view of the PurchaseAgreement and Term Sheet dated 28 March 2008 and therefore a significant cause inducing the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to sign the Loan Agreement.</p><p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Counsel for the defendants relied in this context on <i><u>Chitty on Contracts</u></i> (30<sup>th</sup> Ed.) Vol.1 7-029 which provides :</p><blockquote><p class="quote">ââ¦ there may be duress where âthe economic pressure may be characterised as illegitimate and has constituted a significant causeinducing the plaintiff to enter the relevant contractâ.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  A helpful summary of the essential features of economic duress is to be found in <i><u>Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution</u></i> (2006) at p.198 :</p><blockquote><p class="quote">âEssentially economic duress arises where the defendant resorts to illegitimate commercial pressure, whether express or impliedfrom circumstances, in support of his or her demands, whether these demands are for payment from the claimant or that the claimantis to enter into a contract or to vary an existing one.</p><p class="quote">The key issue relates to the determination of what constitutes illegitimate commercial pressure for these purposes, since it is clearthat commercial pressure alone cannot constitute economic duress.  What is needed are threats which are unlawful, typically threatsto break a contract or to commit a tort.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  The question of whether illegitimate pressure can be constituted by a lawful act as opposed to an unlawful act is an interestingquestion of law as yet unresolved in Hong Kong law.  Similarly, the question of whether the appropriate test of causation for economicduress is a âbut forâ test as opposed to a less exacting test of âpredominant causeâ or âsignificant causeâ is likewisean interesting and unresolved question of law.  These questions were canvassed in the course of argument in the Court of Appeal in<i>Esquire (Electronics) Ltd v Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%203%20HKLRD%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 3 HKLRD 439</a> but the Court did not consider it necessary to answer them given the facts of that case : see <i>per</i> Stock JA (as he then was) at Â§Â§153-156 and 157.</p><p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  In the same way, I do not consider that these questions need to be resolved in the present case since the issue of whether the LoanAgreement and the later documents said to be procured by duress were in fact so procured can be answered without resolving thoseissues.  For that reason, and also because those issues were not fully argued by counsel before me, I do not propose to address themin this Judgment.</p><p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  In addressing the question of economic duress, it is helpful, in my view, to keep in mind what was said by Lord Scarman in <i>Pao On v Lau Yiu Long</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 614</a> at 636A-B :</p><blockquote><p class="quote">âThe commercial pressure alleged to constitute such duress must, however, be such that the victim must have entered the contractagainst his will, must have had no alternative course open to him, and must have been confronted with the worst of acts by the partyexerting pressure.â</p><p class="quote">Lord Scarman emphasised the matters to which American judges attach great evidential attention, such as : (a) the effectiveness ofthe alternative remedy available, (b) the fact or absence of protest, (c) the availability of independent advice, (d) the benefitreceived, and (e) the speed with which the victim has sought to avoid the contract.</p></blockquote><p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Putting the defendantsâ case at its highest, the pressure brought to bear on the defendants by Heng Tai was constituted by therefusal by Golden Harvest to pay the seasonal deposit which was due to be paid on or before 1 April 2008 pursuant to clause 2.1 ofthe Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet.  As I have found above, the parties agreed to amend the terms of the Purchase Agreement andTerm Sheet and the failure of Golden Harvest to pay the seasonal deposit was not a wrongful breach of contract.  There does not appearto be any written complaint emanating from Cheong Lee or the defendants asserting that Golden Harvest was in breach of contract infailing to pay the seasonal deposit.  I am prepared to accept that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did chase for payment of the seasonal deposit by telephone but, if he considered Golden Harvest to have been in breachof contract, it is very surprising that there is nothing in writing to this effect.</p><p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  More significantly, the Loan Agreement which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant entered into gave him the equivalent sum that would have been received if Golden Harvest had paid the seasonal depositto Cheong Lee, and at no apparent disadvantage.  It was agreed that the loan would be made by a payment by âchatsâ directly toCheong Lee as nominee for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  So long as there was no default, the loan was interest-free.  If and insofar as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was facing demands from his Thai suppliers in respect of any fruit that he had already ordered in anticipation of the PurchaseAgreement and Term Sheet, as to which demands there is no documentary evidence, the loan of HK$1.25 million on 2 April 2008 put himin the same position as if the seasonal deposit had been paid as originally envisaged under the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet.</p><p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Furthermore, if the Loan Agreement was procured by pressure constituting sufficient economic duress to entitle the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to avoid the contract, the steps taken by him following the exercise of that pressure demonstrate that, far from seekingto avoid the Loan Agreement, he affirmed it.  In this regard, I refer to the history of the matter reflected in the contemporaneousdocumentation between 2 April 2008 and 23 April 2008 which I have summarised above.  Instead of raising any complaint as to the conductof Heng Tai, Mr Horris Wong or the plaintiffs, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Daniel Chan participated in a process of finalising the Supply Agreement and the First Personal Guarantee and theSecond Personal Guarantee.  For the defendantsâ part, this was apparently done with the assistance of legal advice.</p><p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  On the facts, therefore, I have no hesitation in concluding that the Loan Agreement dated 2 April 2008 was not procured by duresson the part of Mr Horris Wong or anyone else on behalf of the plaintiffs.</p><p class="heading">D4.2  Fraudulent misrepresentation</p><p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  If the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was induced to enter into the Loan Agreement by reason of a fraudulent misrepresentation made by Mr Horris Wong, this wouldgive the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant a legitimate basis for rescinding the Loan Agreement and, in addition, claiming damages for the tort of deceit.</p><p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  However, a claim for deceit must be properly pleaded and proved by cogent evidence.  In the present case, there is no proper pleadingof the tort of deceit.  The particulars under paragraph 24 of the Amended Defence which relate to the Loan Agreement do not set out(i) the representation relied upon, (ii) the manner in which that representation is said to be false, (iii) the knowledge on thepart of the representor that it was untrue and (iv) reliance on the representation by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  For this reason alone, in my judgment, this defence must be rejected.</p><p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Counsel for the defendants sought, however, to suggest that the relevant fraudulent misrepresentation in the present case was constitutedby the statement of Mr Horris Wong to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that the seasonal deposit would not be paid to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant until a proper formal agreement had been signed by the parties and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had given Heng Tai a personal guarantee for the return of the deposit (see Â§Â§13 and 15 of Mr Horris Wongâs witnessstatement).  It was suggested that this representation was false because, although new agreements were signed on 23 April 2008 andguarantees were given by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on that date, Cheong Lee was never paid any seasonal deposit in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement andTerm Sheet dated 28 March 2008.</p><p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  I have no hesitation in rejecting this contention.  Leaving aside the fact that this case was never pleaded by the defendants, itis, in my judgment, a wholly unrealistic contention.  Although not described as a seasonal deposit, the payment made to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under the Loan Agreement was precisely the same amount as was originally to have been paid by Golden Harvest to CheongLee by way of seasonal deposit pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet.  In due course, the loan to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was extinguished and replaced by the crediting of that sum of HK$1.25 million to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant described as a seasonal deposit and an obligation on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to repay that amount upon the expiry or termination of the Supply Agreement.  In short, the arrangements entered into inApril 2008 did result in a seasonal deposit being paid.  Although it was paid to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant rather than to Cheong Lee, it was nevertheless paid to a company of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs and was for the purpose of assisting in the importation and purchase of fresh fruits by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p><p class="heading">D5.   Did Mr Horris Wong procure the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs agreement to the Supplemental Agreement and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs agreement to the Additional First Personal Guarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee all dated 23 April2008 by means of duress or fraudulent misrepresentation?</p><p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  As noted above, there was an issue between the parties as to whether the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional First Personal Guaranteeand the Additional Second Personal Guarantee were signed on 23 April 2008, as the defendants maintained, or one or two days thereafter,as the plaintiffs maintained.  I do not think the outcome of that issue is material to the outcome of the action.  Nevertheless,since the issue arose on the evidence, I shall address it briefly.</p><p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  The background I have related above, based on the contemporaneous documentation, shows that for some time before 23 April 2008,Mr Daniel Chan had been involved in settling the terms of the Supply Agreement, the First Personal Guarantee and the Second PersonalGuarantee.  The evidence discloses that legal advice was apparently obtained by the defendants in relation to these documents.  Themanner of execution of the Supply Agreement, the First Personal Guarantee and the Second Personal Guarantee, which it was commonground were executed on 23 April 2008, make it unlikely that they were executed at the same time as the Supplemental Agreement, theAdditional First Personal Guarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee.  This is because it is highly unlikely, in my opinion,that Mr Daniel Chan would not have been asked to sign his name as a witness to his fatherâs signature on the Supply Agreement ifhe had truly been present at the time that document was executed.</p><p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  Furthermore, although the contents of the two sets of agreements were substantially the same, as was common ground, it is self-evidentthat the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional First Personal Guarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee had minor amendmentsmade to them to reflect the fact that they were subsequent to the Supply Agreement, the First Personal Guarantee and the Second PersonalGuarantee.  The explanation of Mr Horris Wong that the reason for the preparation of the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional FirstPersonal Guarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee was that the plaintiffsâ legal advisors considered that it wouldbe preferable for the documents to be executed as deeds is entirely plausible and one which I accept.  That being the case, therewould have been no purpose in asking the defendants to execute the Supply Agreement, the First Personal Guarantee and the SecondPersonal Guarantee on 23 April 2008 if the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional First Personal Guarantee and the Additional SecondPersonal Guarantee had already been prepared and were ready for execution on that same date.  As a matter of logic and common sense,I find that the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional First Personal Guarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee musthave been executed subsequent to the Supply Agreement, the First Personal Guarantee and the Second Personal Guarantee.  I acceptthe evidence of Mr Horris Wong that this was one or two days after 23 April 2008 and I reject the evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Daniel Chan that those documents were all signed together on 23 April 2008.</p><p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  Be that as it may, the allegations of duress and fraudulent misrepresentation in regard to the documents executed on 23 April 2008remain to be considered.</p><p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  It was the defendantsâ case that, by 23 April 2008, more than 15 containers of durian had been shipped from Thailand and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was under tremendous pressure to settle Cheong Leeâs indebtedness to its Thai supplier.  It was submitted that GoldenHarvest was obliged to pay Cheong Lee for goods sold and delivered on its behalf by Cheong Lee, so that the act of withholding paymentuntil new agreements were signed constituted illegitimate financial pressure which was significant in inducing or pressurising the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Mr Daniel Chan to sign the documents on 23 April 2008.</p><p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  I have a number of difficulties in accepting the validity of this argument on behalf of the defendants.</p><blockquote><p class="quote">(1)  In the first place, there is no documentary evidence demonstrating that Cheong Lee or the defendants were being pursued by theThai supplier for payment of the invoices in respect of the shipments of durian that had already been made by 23 April 2008.</p><p class="quote">(2)  Secondly, during the period in which the Supply Agreement, the First Personal Guarantee and the Second Personal Guarantee werebeing settled between 2 April 2008 and 23 April 2008, there is no evidence in writing of any protest on the part of the defendantsconcerning any adverse consequences to them from the delay in the execution of these documents.</p><p class="quote">(3)  Thirdly, insofar as there was any pressure arising from the outstanding invoices from the Thai suppliers, upon the executionof the documents on 23 April 2008, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff issued a cheque payment in the sum of HK$2,376,072 to Cheong Lee on behalf of FPE to pay for at least 14 of the shipmentsthat had been made.  Once that payment was made, any pressure from the Thai suppliers ought to have receded and the parties wouldhave proceeded with the Supply Agreement on the basis that the plaintiffs would settle the suppliersâ invoices within seven daysbut then in turn giving the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant 30 daysâ credit to settle the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs invoices.</p><p class="quote">(4)  Fourthly, in the course of his cross-examination, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant agreed that, notwithstanding that he thought they were unfair to him, he signed certain documents with the plaintiffs toplease them in the hope that the red kiwi project which had been suspended in January 2008 might come alive again at some later stage. Mr Daniel Chan gave similar evidence in cross-examination to the effect that the defendants wished to cooperate with Heng Tai becausethey wanted to engage in the red kiwi project with them and establish a good working relationship.  On the basis of that evidence,I am less ready to accept how any alleged duress could be said to have constituted a significant cause of the defendantsâ agreementto the documents executed on 23 April 2008.</p><p class="quote">(5)  Fifthly, as I have found, the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional First Personal Guarantee and the Additional Second PersonalGuarantee were executed one or two days after 23 April 2008.  If there had been duress or any form of misrepresentation leading tothe execution of the documents on 23 April 2008, the defendants would have had an opportunity to seek to avoid those contracts bythe time of the subsequent execution of the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional First Personal Guarantee and the Additional SecondPersonal Guarantee.  Yet, the defendants did not do so.  On the contrary, they executed the Supplemental Agreement, the AdditionalFirst Personal Guarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee.</p><p class="quote">(6)  Sixthly, the subsequent course of events between the plaintiffsâ solicitorsâ letter dated 4 June 2008 and the signing ofthe Payment Schedule on 27 June 2008 is consistent, in my judgment, with the defendants affirming the 23 April 2008 documents ratherthan seeking to avoid them.</p></blockquote><p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  For the above reasons, I reject the contention that the defendantsâ agreement to the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional FirstPersonal Guarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee was procured by duress on the part of Mr Horris Wong or the plaintiffs.</p><p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  As for the allegation of fraudulent misrepresentation, I reject this defence for the same reasons I rejected it in respect of theLoan Agreement dated 2 April 2008 (see Section D4.2 above).</p><p class="heading">D6.   Did the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant repudiate the Supplemental Agreement so that the sums of $2,423,593.40 and $1,250,000 became due and owing by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff respectively under the Supplemental Agreement as at 11 June 2008?</p><p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  The answer to the question posed by this issue is, in my opinion, clearly in the affirmative.  Under clause 2.6 of the SupplementalAgreement, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was obliged to pay the invoices issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff within 30 days from the dates of the invoices.  The outstanding invoices as at 4 June 2008, when the plaintiffsâ solicitorsmade demand for payment, were in some cases dated considerably longer than 30 days before that date.</p><p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Counsel for the defendants appeared to raise an argument in closing submissions to the effect that the Supplemental Agreement shouldbe held to have failed for want of intent.  The basis of this argument appears to have been that after the execution of the SupplementalAgreement a credit hold was put on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  The contention appears to be that, on the footing the Supplement Agreement was not in fact executed until one or twodays after 23 April 2008, the act of the plaintiffs immediately putting a credit hold on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, as evidenced by Mr Horris Wongâs e-mail of 25 April 2008, had the effect that the Supplemental Agreement was never effectivesince its only purpose would have been to create a liability on the part of the defendants for what should have been a liabilityof Cheong Lee under the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet dated 28 March 2008.  It was submitted that this meant the SupplementalAgreement failed for want of intent or common intent, alternatively that it was latent and un-performed.</p><p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  In my opinion, this argument is misconceived.  The Supplemental Agreement was still operative notwithstanding the credit hold thatwas imposed on 25 April 2008.  The effect of the credit hold was that no further credit limit would be made available to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant until the outstanding balance was reduced below HK$2.5 million.  If that had happened, there is nothing to suggest thatfresh shipments of durian could not have been entered into on the terms of the Supplemental Agreement.</p><p class="heading">D7.   Did Mr Horris Wong procure the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs agreement to a repayment schedule for $3,826,348.60 by 10 instalments on the terms of a Payment Schedule dated 27 June2008 by means of duress or fraudulent misrepresentation?</p><p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Although this issue was raised on the pleadings, counsel for the defendants did not seek to argue that the defendants were entitledto avoid the agreement constituted by the Payment Schedule on the grounds of duress.  On that basis, the answer to the question posedis in the negative.  This obviates the need to consider whether the statements alleged to have been made by Mr Horris Wong to the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 26 May 2008 were sufficient to constitute illegitimate pressure amounting to duress.  For my part, I doubt that a threatto issue proceedings or a statement as to the adverse consequences of such proceedings, in the circumstances of this case, wouldbe sufficient to constitute such pressure.</p><p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  However, counsel for the defendants sought to argue a different point in relation to the agreement constituted by the Payment Schedule. It was said that the settlement reached on 27 June 2008 was misconceived.  The basis of this contention appears to be an allegationthat the settlement agreement was vitiated by mistake.  The mistake in question was said to be that the underlying claim of the plaintiffswas enforceable or that the seasonal deposit had been paid and that durian had been delivered and sold to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant but not paid for.</p><p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  I will deal with the factual premises on which these arguments advanced by the defendants were based, although I would preface whatI say by observing that, since none of these matters were pleaded by the defendants by way of defence, it is questionable whetherthese arguments are open to the defendants.</p><p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  As to the allegation that no seasonal deposit was ever paid by the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the argument appears to proceed on the basis that the set-off in clause 4.2 of the Supplemental Agreement did not amountto an effective assignment of any debt by the lender under the Loan Agreement dated 2 April 2008.  Counsel for the defendants alsosuggested that the sum credited to Cheong Lee was not in fact a payment under the Loan Agreement so that there was no loan made. Finally reference was made to the fact that Golden Harvest appears to have been identified as the lender in the Loan Agreement. On the basis of these various contentions, it was submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was not paid the seasonal deposit in law or in fact so that it had no obligation to return that seasonal deposit to the2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff.</p><p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  In my opinion, this argument is untenable.  By the Loan Agreement, a sum of HK$1.25 million was advanced to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant by way of loan.  There is some question as to whether it was intended by Heng Tai that Heng Tai Finance Limited ratherthan Golden Harvest was intended to be the lender of that loan but, in the event, it is Golden Harvest that is identified as thelender.  It was in any event expressly agreed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as borrower instructed the lender to make the loan by chats directly to its nominee, Cheong Lee, and that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would be fully liable for the loan.</p><p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  At the same time the Loan Agreement was entered into, the parties had agreed to amend the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet dated28 March 2008.  Something different, therefore, was anticipated to replace the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet.  It is unrealistictherefore to regard the parties as having proceeded on the basis of the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet, since it was acknowledgedon 2 April 2008 that its terms would have to be amended.  Eventually, the Supply Agreement, and then the Supplemental Agreement,were concluded between the parties.  Clause 4.2 of the Supply Agreement (which was in the same terms as clause 4.2 of the SupplementalAgreement) replaced the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet and provided for the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff to pay a seasonal deposit in the sum of HK$1.25 million to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  This was to be achieved by way of what was described as a set-off of the debt owed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under the Loan Agreement.  Heng Tai Finance Limited, the signatory of the Loan Agreement signed a letter addressed to the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant dated 23 April 2008, agreeing to set-off the debt owed pursuant to the Loan Agreement against the seasonal deposit payableby the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff under the Supply Agreement.</p><p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  The clear effect of the arrangements referred to in the preceding paragraph is that the loan obligation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under the Loan Agreement was discharged and in its place clause 4.2 of the Supply Agreement created a new obligation onthe part of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to repay the sum of HK$1.25 million within seven days of the expiry or termination of the Supply Agreement.  The benefitof receipt of the HK$1.25 million had been enjoyed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as from Cheong Leeâs receipt of that sum by way of chats transfer on 3 April 2008.</p><p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  In the circumstances, there is nothing, in my view, in the contention of the defendants that the seasonal deposit was not paid tothe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p><p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  As to the defendantsâ argument that the durian sold and delivered before 23 April 2008 constituted completed transactions so thatthese transactions were not covered by the Supply Agreement, the answer to that argument is that the Supply Agreement covered a definedSupply Period commencing on 2 April 2008.  It was clearly intended to cover the shipments already arranged and covered by the variousinvoices that had been submitted by FPE, initially to Golden Harvest, and subsequently to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  Even if the commencement of the Supply Period on 2 April 2008 was subsequent to the earliest shipments, the documentationpassing between the parties shows clearly, in my opinion, that they were all intended to be subject to the terms of the Supply Agreement. Given the entire agreement clause in the Supply Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet was superseded and no longer hadany effect.  Any shipments and invoices to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff would fall to be dealt with under the Supply Agreement instead.</p><p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Finally, in this regard, I reject the argument that the settlement agreement constituted by the Payment Schedule dated 27 June 2008was misconceived by virtue of a mistaken belief that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was under a liability to pay back the seasonal deposit and for the durian under the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs invoices.  Even if there was some technical reason for suggesting that this was not the case, it is trite law thatthe compromise of a claim which is doubtful in law is binding as a contract : see <i><u>Chitty on Contracts</u></i> (30<sup>th</sup> Ed.) Vol.1 at Â§3-051.  It was never suggested that the plaintiffs did not in good faith believe that the sums shown in the PaymentSchedule dated 27 June 2008 were not properly due and owing by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  In those circumstances, I see no reason why the agreement evidenced by the Payment Schedule dated 27 June 2008 and thepost-dated cheques tendered by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is in any way misconceived or not supported by consideration.</p><p class="heading">D8.   By reason of the dishonour of the 2<sup>nd</sup> post-dated cheque on 15 August 2008, did the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant breach the repayment agreement of 27 June 2008 so that the balance sum of $3,600,000 became immediately due and payableto the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff?</p><p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  In my judgment, the dishonour of the second post-dated cheque dated 15 August 2008 had the effect that the remaining balance ofthe total debts would become immediately due and payable.  This was the express consequence stipulated in the manuscript amendmentat the foot of the Payment Schedule dated 27 June 2008, countersigned by Mr Daniel Chan.  The purpose of the agreement reflectedin the Payment Schedule was to settle the outstanding sum which the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was claiming was due from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, payment of which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had guaranteed.  In the circumstances, I hold that the intention of the agreement evidenced by the Payment Schedule dated27 June 2008 and the tendering of the post-dated cheques by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was that the defendants should be jointly and severally liable for the entire outstanding sum in the event any of the post-datedcheques was dishonoured on presentation.  The answer to the question posed in this issue is therefore in the affirmative.</p><p class="heading">D9.   Did the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff breach the oral Joint Venture Agreement or Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet so that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant are entitled to damages?</p><p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I find that there was no oral joint venture agreement as alleged by the defendants.</p><p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Similarly, for the reasons set out above, I have concluded that the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet was superseded by the SupplyAgreement and then the Supplemental Agreement so that no liability on the part of the plaintiffs could arise thereunder.  In anyevent, the parties to the Purchase Agreement and Term Sheet were Golden Harvest, and not the plaintiffs, on the one part and CheongLee, and not the defendants, on the other part.</p><p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  There is therefore no question of any liability on the part of the plaintiffs to the defendants on either of these bases.</p><p class="heading">D10.  The appropriate relief to which either the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff or the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and/or the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant are entitled?</p><p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  As I have held in respect of issue (9) above, there is no liability on the part of the plaintiffs to the defendants.</p><p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  So far as the defendantsâ liability to the plaintiffs is concerned, I have concluded above that the dishonour of the second post-datedcheque had the consequence of making the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant jointly and severally liable for the remaining balance of the total debt reflected in the Payment Schedule dated 27 June2008.</p><p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  In the circumstances the plaintiffs are respectively entitled to judgment against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant jointly and severally as to HK$2,350,000 to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and as to HK$1,250,000 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff.</p><p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  It was argued by counsel for the defendants that, by maintaining a claim under the settlement agreement evidenced by Payment Scheduledated 27 June 2008, the plaintiffs were estopped from maintaining claims under the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional First PersonalGuarantee and the Additional Second Personal Guarantee.  Since I have concluded that the plaintiffs are entitled to succeed underthe settlement agreement, this argument is academic and need not be considered further.  However, the plaintiffs were entitled, inmy opinion, to maintain claims in the alternative under the Supplemental Agreement, the Additional First Personal Guarantee and theAdditional Second Personal Guarantee, in case its claims under the settlement agreement were not upheld.</p><p class="heading">E.   Disposition and costs</p><p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I would enter judgment in favour of the plaintiffs, as to HK$2,350,000 to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and as to HK$1,250,000 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, jointly and severally against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p><p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  Interest on the above sums should run as from 25 August 2008, the date on which the second post-dated cheque was dishonoured, atprime plus 1%, being the usual commercial rate of interest awarded.</p><p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  The defendantsâ counterclaim is dismissed.</p><p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  I see no reason why costs should not follow the event and I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the defendants pay the plaintiffsâ costs of the action, to be taxed if not agreed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>    <td style="text-align:center;upper; width: 40%;"> </td>    <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">(Joseph Fok)<br />    Judge of the Court of First Instance<br/>High Court</td>  </tr></table><!--sino section representation --><representation><p> </p><p>Mr William Chan and Ms Sylvia Lee, instructed by Messrs Fred Kan &amp; Co., for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs</p><p>Mr Kam K.
