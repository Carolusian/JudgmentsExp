Introduction</i></u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The Plaintiff is 15 years old. On 3<sup>rd</sup> March 2003, he was a 10 year-old Primary Five student of St Josephâs Anglo-Chinese Primary School (â<u>St Josephâs</u>â) afternoon class.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  O King Road (â<u>Road</u>â) was a two-lane two-way road leading to and from Ocean Shores with a speed limit of 50kph. The Lam Tin bound lane ran uphill beforea downhill stretch (â<u>Down Slope</u>â) ending in a big right bend (â<u>Right Bend</u>â) near to lamppost TK023 (â<u>Lamppost</u>â). On 3<sup>rd</sup> March 2003 at about 11:50am, the Plaintiff together with five other St Josephâs (afternoon class) students were on board a schoolprivate light bus bearing registration no.DK8577 (â<u>Nanny Van</u>â) driven by Mr Tsang Hin Kau (â<u>Deceased</u>â) along the Road towards Lam Tin. When the Nanny Van reached the vicinity of the Lamppost, it ran out of control and mounted ontothe nearside pavement. Its offside front rammed into the Lamppost and its body swung back to hit the wall on the nearside pavement(â<u>Accident</u>â). The Plaintiff suffered personal injuries and the Deceased was fatally injured.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>II.  Plaintiffâs case</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed the Accident was caused by the Deceasedâs negligence and breach of statutory duty, and relied on the doctrineof <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed the Deceasedâs driving fell below the standard of a reasonable or prudent driver in that he <i>inter alia</i> drove too fast in the circumstances and without due care and attention, failed to keep proper/adequate lookout or heed the Road conditions,failed to control the Nanny Van and negotiate the Right Bend properly and/or failed to take action to avoid the collision or stopthe Nanny Van before such collision. The Plaintiff also claimed the Accident was caused by the Deceasedâs breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/374F/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 7A(3)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/374F" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic (Safety Equipment) Regulations</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/374F">Cap.374F</a> (â<u>Regulations</u>â).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Plaintiff no longer relied on any breach by the Deceased of (a) the common duty of care in failing to provide suitable seatbelt for the Plaintiff and/or to ensure he wore seat belt whilst on board the Nanny Van, or (b) the statutory duty under regulation7A(1) of the Regulations.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>III.  Defendantâs defence</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Defendant (the Deceasedâs son) claimed the Deceased was disabled by a sudden heart attack and/or loss of consciousness immediatelybefore the Accident, which was the result of an involuntary act or act of God. The Defendant abandoned reliance on the defence ofautomatism.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>IV.  Quantum</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On the first day of trial, I approved the agreed quantum of damages (inclusive of interest) of HK$348,000.00 subject to the conteston liability.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>V.  Witnesses</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiff, the Defendant and the Deceasedâs son-in-law and business partner Mr Shek Chi Hung (â<u>Mr Shek</u>â) gave evidence. They all gave statements to the police in March 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In his final submissions, Mr Wong, counsel for the Plaintiff, emphasised that various aspects of the Plaintiffâs direct evidencewas not contradicted or challenged by countervailing evidence from the Defendant. But witnessesâ credibility does not turn on thefortuity of having eyewitnesses at the trial. In assessing witnessesâ credibility, the court should consider the totality of theirevidence against the documentary evidence, inferences based on inherent improbabilities and/or undisputed facts (see the principlesset out by Chung J at paragraph 12 of <i>Star</i> <i>Glory Investment Ltd v Kai Tua (H.K.) Technology Ltd &amp; ors</i> HCA3523/2002 (unreported, 13<sup>th</sup> August 2005)).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Notwithstanding their close familial relationship with the Deceased, I find the Defendant and Mr Shek transparently honest and reliable.There is no reason to doubt the Defendantâs evidence about the Deceasedâs daily life. Mr Shekâs evidence was spontaneous, straightforwardand cogent. He was also honest about the Nanny Van not having any licence for carrying kindergarten students at the material time(see paragraph 25 below).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I remind myself the Plaintiff is 15 years old at the trial and only 10 at the time of the Accident. Even so, he appears to be asmart young man quick on the uptake as to the purport of questions put to him at trial. As seen below, I am not persuaded certainaspects of his evidence are reliable.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>VI.  Alleged breach of statutory duty</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Section 7A(3)(b) of the Regulations provides <i>inter alia</i> that :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">âno person shall drive a private light bus â¦â¦ when there is <i>in the specified passengerâs seat or middle front seat</i> of the private light bus â¦â¦ a passenger over 2 years of age but under the age of 15 years who is not securely fastened to hisseat by means of a seat belt, if any, provided for his seat â¦â¦â (my emphasis)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  There is no dispute that (a) the Nanny Van was a light bus within the meaning of the Regulations, (b) there was no specified passengerâsseat or middle front seat on the Nanny Van, and (c) the Plaintiff did not fasten any seat belt whilst on board the Nanny Van on theday of the Accident. Since the Plaintiff did not sit <i>in</i> any specified passengerâs seat or middle front seat, the situation was outside the remit of section 7A(3)(b) of the Regulations.There was no breach of statutory duty on the part of the Deceased.</p>    <p class="heading"><u><i>VII.  Res ipsa loquitur</i></u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  For the maxim <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> to apply there must be reasonable evidence of negligence. But where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendantand the accident is such that in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care,it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care (see <i>Scott v The London and St Katherine Docks Company</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281865%29%203%20H%20%26%20C%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1865) 3 H&amp;C 596</a>, 667).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Ms Lee, counsel for the Defendant, conceded the maxim was applicable here. In the normal course of things, a vehicle driven withproper care and attention would not have mounted onto the pavement, rammed into a lamppost and hit a wall.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  But the convenient label of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> represents a rule of evidence and states no principle of law. In <i>Ng Chun-pui &amp; ors v Lee Chuen-tat &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 425</a>, 427, the Privy Council held as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">ââ¦â¦ If the defendant adduces no evidence there is nothing to rebut the inference of negligence and the plaintiff will have provedhis case. But if the defendant does adduce evidence that evidence must be evaluated to see if it is reasonable to draw the inferenceof negligence from the mere fact of the accident. Loosely speaking this may be referred to as a burden on the defendant to show hewas not negligent, but that only means that faced with a <i>prima facie</i> case of negligence the defendant will be found negligent unless he produces evidence that is capable of rebutting the <i>prima facie</i> case. â¦â¦ it is the duty of the judge to examine all the evidence at the end of the case and decide whether on the facts he findsto have been proved and on the inferences he is prepared to draw he is satisfied that negligence has been established. â¦â¦â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  <i>Cler</i><i>k &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 19<sup>th</sup> ed (2006) para.8-155 at pp.499 and <i>Ng Chun-pui</i>âs case (supra) emphasise that the burden of proof does not shift to the defendant and remains at the end of the case as it wasat the beginning upon the plaintiff to prove that his injury was caused by the negligence of the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  So if the defendant proves an equally plausible explanation for the accident or shows a way in which the accident may have occurredwithout negligence, the cogency of the fact of the accident itself disappears and the claimant will have to establish his case bypositive evidence which he is unlikely to be able to do. As to what amounts to a plausible explanation, Brooke LJ in <i>Widdowson v Newgate Meat Corporation &amp; ors</i> The Times 4<sup>th</sup> December 1997 (Lexis-Nexis electronic transcript) said as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">ââ¦â¦ <i>a plausible explanation is what the law requires if a defendant is to escape liability in such circumstances</i> (â¦â¦ In Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts (17 edition) para 7-180, the editor observes that <i>the defendant cannot hope to redress the balance merely by putting up theoretical possibilities: âhis assertion must have some colourof probability about itâ</i>)â (my emphasis)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In summary, the relevance of the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> is as follows (see also <i>John Ratcliffe v Plymouth &amp; Torbay Health Authority &amp; anor</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/2000.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] EWCA Civ 2000)</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">The maxim applies where the plaintiff relies on the âresâ (ie the thing itself) to raise the inference of negligence.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(b)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">The position at the close of the plaintiffâs case may be that the judge will be entitled to infer negligence on the defendantâspart unless the defendant adduces evidence which discharges this inference.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(c)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">This evidence may be to the effect that there is a plausible explanation (not a theoretically or remotely possible one) of what mayhave happened which does not connote any negligence on the defendantâs part, but the defendant does not have to prove that hisexplanation is more likely to be correct than any other.

He together with Mr Shek and Mr Fong Ho teamed up to provide school private light bus servicefor students studying at St Josephâs, Chun Tok Primary School (â<u>Chun Kok</u>â), Man Kiu Association Primary School (â<u>Man Kiu</u>â) and Kwun Tong Community Centre Kindergarten (â<u>KT</u> <u>Kindergarten</u>â). Each of them drove a school private light bus.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Defendant was about 59 years old when he started to drive the Nanny Van in/about August 2000. He worked 5Â½ days a week andabout 6Â½ hours per day. I accept Mr Shekâs evidence that the Deceased did not complain the work was too heavy. I find the Deceaseddid not have work pressure.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Deceased also had no financial pressure. He lent HK$100,000.00 to Mr Shek to purchase the Nanny Van. He earned about HK$3,000.00a month for his own personal use.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(b)  School private light bus service</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr Shek managed the school private light bus service. The three school buses including the Nanny Van were registered in his name.He applied for the relevant licences and was responsible for vehicle repair and maintenance. He planned the school bus routes andmade pick-up and drop-off arrangements with the parents of student passengers. He was responsible for telephoning the parents ifstudent passengers refused to wear seat belts. On the other hand, the Deceased was essentially a school private light bus driver.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The passenger service licence for the Nanny Van issued on 24<sup>th</sup> March 2003 did not authorise Mr Shek to operate a school private light bus service for carriage ofstudents to and from KT Kindergarten,but I accept the Deceased was unaware of such restriction since Mr Shek made the arrangements. Such breach of licence had no bearingon the Accident.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(c)  Bus nanny</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr Shek employed Madam Shek Siu Fong (â<u>Madam Shek</u>â) as bus nanny for the Nanny Van. But he would not employ any substitute bus nanny on her off days. Kindergarten student passengershad to be accompanied by an adult, so the Deceasedâs wife (â<u>Widow</u>â) would act as bus nanny on such occasions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The Plaintiff said quite often there was no bus nanny on board the Nanny Van. But this was not mentioned in his witness statement,supplemental witness statement or statement to the police, and was contradicted by Tsang Chun Yipâs (a fellow student passenger)statement to the police that a bus nanny would normally accompany them. I do not accept the Plaintiffâs evidence. In any event,it was not mandatory to have a bus nanny to accompany primary school student passengers, so her absence at the time of the Accidentwas immaterial to the question of liability.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(d)  Deceasedâs usual work schedule</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The Deceased lived with the Widow and the Defendant at Kai Yip Estate. At about 6:00am he would walk 10 minutes to Ping Shek tocollect the Nanny Van. He would pick up two students at 6:35am and let them off at Chun Tok. Then he would pick up eight studentsin Lam Tin and Yau Tong and let them off at St Josephâs (morning class) before 7:15am. At 7:45am he would collect six studentsin Sau Mau Ping and Ngau Tau Kok and arrive at Man Kiu (whole-day class) at 8:05am. After that, he would pick up four to five kindergartenstudents in Kwun Tong and then meet Mr Shek at the carpark outside Kwun Tong Community Centre at about 8:30am. Mr Shek would escortthose kindergarten students to KT Kindergarten.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The Deceased would drive the Nanny Van back to Ping Shek carpark and return home after 9:00am to rest until about 10:30am. At about11:00am, the Deceased would again collect the Nanny Van. From about 11:25am-11:30am onwards, he would pick up eight St Josephâs(afternoon class) students and arrive at the school at about 12:15pm-12:20pm. St Josephâs required the Nanny Van to arrive before12:35pm.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The Deceased would park the Nanny Van at St Josephâs and rest until 12:45am. When St Josephâs morning class ended, the studentpassengers would board the Nanny Van by 12:55pm. The Deceased would drop them off in Lam Tin on a 35-minute trip ending at about1:25pm-1:30pm.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The Deceased would arrive at Man Kiu at about 1:45pm. After parking the Nanny Van on the street, he would have lunch and rest untilschool ended at 3:15pm at Man Kiu. After dropping off Man Kiuâs student passengers, the Deceased would pick up student passengersfrom KT Kindergarten at about 4:30pm and drop them off. He would return home at about 7:00pm.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  I disagree the Deceasedâs morning schedule was unreasonably busy and tight. There was time to rest between 9:00am and 10:30am.Although the schools required the school bus service to be punctual, there was insufficient evidence to suggest the morning scheduleput such undue pressure on the Deceased that he had to drive at high speed. Further, according to the morning schedule, the NannyVan would usually reach St Josephâs 15-20 minutes before the time required by the school. There was no reason for the Deceasedto drive at high speed to pick up student passengers for St Josephâs afternoon class.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr Shek also said that after the student passengers for the coming school term were confirmed at about the end of July each year,he would plan the Nanny Vanâs school bus routes, and then he and the Deceased would test drive them to work out the pick-up ordrop-off time for each student passenger. I find on balance they would have factored sufficient driving time for such routes forthe Nanny Van.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(e)  Accident</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  On the day of the Accident, the Defendant saw the Deceased leave for work at about 6:00am. At about 8:35am, Mr Shek met the Deceasedat the carpark outside Kwun Tong Community Centre and escorted the kindergarten student passengers to KT Kindergarten. The Deceasedchatted with Mr Shek and said one of the students was very well-behaved that day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The Widow told the Defendant that the Deceased returned home at about 9:00am to rest and have some food. The Deceased self-administeredblood test (see paragraph 60 below), which showed normal result. But the Widow was unsure whether the Deceased took his medication(see paragraph 60 below) before he left home later in the morning.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The Deceased drove the Nanny Van to pick up the St Josephâs (afternoon class) student passengers. There was no bus nanny on boardbecause Madam Shek was on sick leave.Between 11:30am and the time of the Accident, the Deceased picked up six students (includingthe Plaintiff). The Plaintiff sat on the offside fourth row seat near to the central aisle behind the driver. The other five studentsoccupied the following seats : (a) the two offside second row seats behind the driver (Tsang Chun Yip and Clinton Chang), (b) theoffside fourth row seat near to the window next to the Plaintiff behind the driver (Wong Kwan Lun), (c) the seat closest to the dooron the nearside bench which had no seat belt (Fung Sin Wing), and (d) the nearside rear seat which had no seat belt (Lui Kei Ching).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The Deceased then drove along the Road towards Lam Tin with a view to pick up some more students. The Nanny Van came down the DownSlope. It did not swerve, brake or decelerate (as confirmed by Fung Sin Wing, the Plaintiff and Mr Chan Tsz Wiu Andy (â<u>Mr Chan</u>â), a contractor carrying out construction work at the crest of the Down Slope near to lamppost TK030 (â<u>Crest</u>â)) despite the Right Bend. Then the Accident happened.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Some student passengers (including the Plaintiff) were thrown forward and suffered personal injuries. The Deceased was trapped inthe driverâs seat. He could not move and had no response. The Plaintiff and other injured students were eventually sent to hospital.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>IX.  Findings of fact : seat belts</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In light of the matters in paragraph 5 above and the conclusion in paragraph 13 above, the wearing of seat belt or otherwise isno longer a live issue. However, both counsel submitted the relevant evidence was reflective of witnessesâ credibility, so I willdeal with this briefly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  At the material time, only one passenger, namely, Primary One student Wong Kwan Lun, wore a seat belt. The Plaintiff claimed thatWong Kwan Lun being small in size could fasten his seat belt without adjusting its length (which had been pre-adjusted to fit kindergartenstudent). The Plaintiff could not remember whether at that time he had been taught to wear a passenger seat belt, but he knew howto adjust its length. Even so, he did not fasten his seat belt because it did not fit him. The Plaintiff claimed that the seat beltsof the Nanny Van had been pre-adjusted to fit kindergarten students. He further claimed that far from encouraging primary schoolstudent passengers to fasten seat belts, the Deceased scolded them and did not allow them to adjust the length of the seat belts.He told them not to use the pre-adjusted seat belts as it would be too troublesome to re-adjust their length for kindergarten studentpassengers afterwards. But the Plaintiff could not remember when the Deceased said this.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In my view, the Plaintiffâs explanation did not have a convincing ring. First, the passenger seats of the Nanny Van were originallynot equipped with seat belts since they were not mandatory. In about August 2002, Mr Shek installed two-pointed seat belts for 10out of 16 passenger seats (a) to provide better safety for the student passengers and (b) to enhance competitiveness in the marketfor school private light bus service. Given such intentions, there was no plausible reason for Mr Shek and in turn the Deceased toprohibit use of the seat belts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Secondly, there is no sensible reason why the youngest primary school student passenger Wong Kwan Lunwould dare disobey the Deceasedâsprohibition against using seat belts when more senior primary school student passengers (such as the Plaintiff) did not. Althoughthe Plaintiff said Wong Kwan Lun did not have to adjust the length of his seat belt, it still does not explain why he would defythe Deceasedâs instructions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Thirdly, the Nanny Van only carried four to five kindergarten student passengers and a bus nanny (whether Madam Shek or the Widow)would always be on hand to fasten their seat belts. So it would not have been a problem to adjust the length of the seat belts fora few kindergarten student passengers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Interestingly, the Plaintiff never complained to his mother that he was prohibited from using seat belts on board the Nanny Vanalthough he told his mother the Deceased drove at a fast speed. No satisfactory explanation was given.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  On balance I prefer Mr Shekâs evidence that after the seat belts were installed, the driver and bus nanny would teach every newprimary school student passenger how to use and to adjust the length of the seat belt, and would encourage them to wear seat belts.Whenever Mr Shek acted as substitute bus nanny on board the Nanny Van (which was not often and which only happened when the studentpassengers of his own school bus had a day off school), he would also encourage the primary school student passengers to fasten seatbelts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I accept Mr Shek did not instruct the Deceased (a) to only allow kindergarten student passengers wear seat belts, (b) to pre-adjustthe length of the seat belts to fit kindergarten student passengers only and/or (b) to prohibit primary school student passengersfrom using the seat belts and/or adjusting their length.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Mr Shek said (and I accept) some primary school student passengers, especially the senior ones, did not like wearing (and wouldnot wear) seat belts and the junior ones would emulate them. Mr Shek had personal experience of watching primary school student passengersunfastening seat belts after being teased by others. He said the driver would continue to drive even if any primary school studentpassenger failed to wear seat belt. But he asked the Deceased to pay attention to and give him the names of those primary schoolstudent passengers who refused to fasten seat belts, and he would telephone their parents to urge them to teach their children tofasten seat belts. Mr Shek frankly admitted he might not have telephoned the parents of all such student passengers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I see nothing of concern in Mr Shekâs approach. It was not mandatory to install or wear seat belts or even to have a bus nannyon board the Nanny Van at the material time. In my view, it was not negligent for the Deceased to continue to drive when not allprimary school student passengers had fastened their seat belts. It would be too onerous for the Deceased to stop the Nanny Van,alight from his driverâs seat and go to the passenger compartment to help the primary school student passengers fasten seat beltsbefore continuing to drive.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Further, Mr Shek could not be faulted for teaching, encouraging and expecting the primary school student passengers (in contra-distinctionto the younger kindergarten student passengers) to fasten seat belts themselves. He carefully buttressed such arrangements by pleasto parents to teach their children to wear set belts.  His frank admission that he might not have telephoned the parents of all studentpassengers who refused to wear seat belts was not reflective of the Deceasedâs negligence. I disagree with Mr Wongâs submissionthat the Deceased tried to shift the blame on the Plaintiff by his own wrong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In my view, the above assessment of evidence does not aid the Plaintiffâs case, but lends credibility to Mr Shekâs evidence.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>X.  Alleged negligence of the Deceased</u></i></p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(a)  Law</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  As stated in paragraph 6 above, the Defendant claimed the Deceased was disabled by a sudden heart attack and/or loss of consciousnessimmediately before the Accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In <i>Man</i><i>s</i><i>field</i> <i>v Weetabix Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20PIQR%20526" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] PIQR 526</a>, a van driven by the defendant left the road, crashed into a shop and injured the plaintiff. At the time of the accident, althoughthe defendant retained a degree of control over his limbs, his ability to drive properly was impaired due to hypoglycaemia (ie excessivelow blood concentration) of which he was unaware. The English Court of Appeal held that a driver who became unable to control a vehiclewould not be liable for damages caused by his loss of control if he was unaware of the disabling condition (whether sudden or gradual)from which he was suffering.

The burden of proof did not shift to the Defendant (see paragraph 17 above). Further, torebut the âresâ, all that was required was for the Defendant to show an equally plausible case of sudden heart attack and/orloss of consciousness. He did not have to prove that such explanation was more likely to be correct than any other (see paragraph19(c) above).

He went to bed and woke up early, and in his leisure time he would take tea, go shopping and hangout with friends. He had no particular hobby and did not particularly exercise, but he did not have any drinking habit. The Deceasedwas a smoker for over forty years, but quitted smoking about six months (Defendantâs witness statement) or three months (Defendantâsstatement to the police) before his death.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The Deceasedâs hearing and eyesight were good. He had never been hospitalised. Mr Shekâs and the Defendantâs impression wasthat the Deceased all along was in good mental health and condition. Since the Deceased started to drive the Nanny Van, he neverasked for sick leave.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  On 22<sup>nd</sup> December 2002, in view of the Deceasedâs age (ie about 61 years old), his family arranged a medical check up (including an assessmentfor diabetic complications) for him at Qualigenics Diabetes Centre (â<u>QDC</u>â), Prince of Wales Hospital. On 3<sup>rd</sup> January 2003, Mr Shek accompanied the Deceased to obtain the report (â<u>QDC Report</u>â). The Deceasedâs electrocardiogram showed no abnormality, but he had mild diabetes with reasonable glycaemic control.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Dr Peter Tong (â<u>Dr Tong</u>â) of QDC explained it was important for diabetic patients to undergo complication assessment because they generally had more cardiovascularrisk factors that would lead to coronary heart disease. Such risk factors should be identified and dealt with accordingly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Dr Tong told the Deceased he had to take medication regularly and self-administer blood test. Gliclazide and metformin were prescribedfor treatment and control of his diabetes. Lipid lowering agent was started for hyperlipidaemia, and anti-hypertensive medicationwas prescribed for hypertension. Advice on cessation of smoking or cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked was given to theDeceased since smoking would in general further exaggerate the process of atherosclerosis, which was common amongst diabetic patients.Advice on lifestyle modification and on compliance with drug treatment was also given to the Deceased to improve control of his diabeticdisease.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The QDC Report remarked there were no microvascular complications. Dr Tong and QDC took the view there was no reason to suggestthe Deceased was not fit for driving or any advice against driving was deemed necessary.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  After issue of the QDC Report, the Deceasedâs family bought equipment for him to self-administer blood test.

I am persuaded hedid not have any suicidal tendency at the time of the Accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Medically, the Deceasedâs diabetes was mild and under control by regular medication and monitoring.

He was retired and did not owe any debts. His income from drivingthe Nanny Van was his to spend, and he had spare money to lend to Mr Shek. I have also found in paragraph 22 above that his workdid not impose any pressure on him.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(3)  Circumstances of the Accident</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Since the Deceased did not have any suicidal tendency, it is difficult to reconcile the following objective circumstances of theAccident with the Plaintiffâs allegation that the Deceased was fit to drive and had full control of the Nanny Van :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Nanny Van only suffered accident damage and mechanical defect was ruled out.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">There were no extrinsic factors that would have interfered with the Deceasedâs driving or caused the collision.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Nanny Van left two tyre prints behind it on the kerbside.

The Down Slope was a straight stretchthat had a visibility of 100m. The police sketch showed there was a right bend sign and a no overtaking sign on the nearside pavementabout 88m and 51m respectively before the location of the Accident. In my view, a driver coming down the Down Slope who was mentallyalert, in control of his vehicle and not wishful of killing himselfcould not have missed the existence of the Right Bend or failedto react in some way. This was especially so for the Deceased who drove along the Down Slope and Right Bend every workday.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Mr Wong submitted that the matters discussed in paragraphs 67-68 above speak of negligent driving that showed scant regard for theRoad conditions. However, as explained in paragraph 16 above, the convenient label of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> represents a rule of evidence and states no principle of law. â[The claimant] merely proves a result [ie a set of circumstancesthat calls for rebuttal from the defendant], not any particular act or omission producing the resultâ (see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (supra at para.8-151 at pp.496-497)). In my view, it is inconceivable that the Deceased if he had his full faculties and was in controlof the Nanny Van to have directly ploughed himself into the Lamppost without making any attempt to save himself, bearing in mindalso that he was an experienced driver responsible for a busload of schoolchildren.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The above analysis and the factual matters discussed below lend weight to the Defendantâs explanation that some medical conditionmust have impaired the Deceasedâs ability to drive at the material time. I next turn to analysis of the Deceasedâs posture shortlybefore the Accident, which also supports this conclusion.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(4) Posture of the Deceased</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Of the six student passengers on board the Nanny Van at the time of the Accident, Tsang Chun Yip and Wong Kwan Lun did not pay attentionto the Deceased. Clinton Chang said the Deceased was driving in the usual manner. Lui Kei Ching noted the Deceased was facing thefront as he drove. Fung Sin Wing said she felt the speed accelerate as the Nanny Van went down the Down Slope, but she did not payparticular attention to the Deceased (who had his back to her) and only saw him facing the front with both hands on the steeringwheel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The Plaintiff in his statement to the police said as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">ââ¦â¦æåªè¦ºå¾æå°æ¶è»ä¿é§äºå°æè»ä¹ååæè·¯é éå§è½ææå°±éå§å å¿«ï¼æ¯å¹³æå¿«å°å°ï¼æè¦ç¶æå¸æ©æ¾ååæ­£å¸¸ååä¿å¸æ©ä½æ¸è»ï¼ä½¢é¢ååï¼æåªçå°ä½¢èé¢ï¼è<i>ä½¢ä¿è½ææä¸èº«åªå°å°å¾å</i>ï¼ä½é ­ä»æ­£å¸¸é¢ååæ¸è»ï¼è<i>æè»ä¹ååä¸å»ææå¸æ©æ¾ååå°±è¦ä½¢ä¼åä¿è»ç¤ä¸</i>ï¼è·ä½å°±æè»â¦â¦â (my emphasis)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  But when the Plaintiff (who confessed to have taken a look at the Deceased but did not pay attention to him all the time) gave evidence,he said differently. He said that although he could see the motions of the Deceasedâs shoulders/arms in driving the Nanny Van,he did not know the Deceasedâs mental condition because the Deceased as usual sat up straight and faced the front. When the NannyVan started to go down the Down Slope, the Deceasedâs upper body had not started to bend forward (ååå¾). The Plaintiff toldthe police officer the Deceasedâs body bent forward (ååå¾) just before the Accident, but the police officer wrote down âæè»ä¹ååä¸å»ææå¸æ©æ¾ååå°±è¦ä½¢ä¼åä¿è»ç¤ä¸â.The Plaintiff denied the Deceased slumped across the steering wheel and insisted he did not so tell the police officer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed that when he told the police officer the Deceasedâs body bent forward (ååå¾), the police officer askedhim whether the Deceased slumped across the steering wheel (ä¼ä¿è»ç¤ä¸). But the Plaintiff later said the police officer didnot try to clarify with him what he meant by the Deceasedâs body bending forward (ååå¾).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  At one stage the Plaintiff said he did not know the difference between the Deceasedâs body bending forward and slumping acrossthe steering wheel and thought they were the same or almost the same, so he did not correct the police officer. At another stagehe said he knew there was some difference between the two  (âå¤§æ¦ç¥éåå¥â), but did not realise the difference was sosubstantial. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr Wong submitted that bearing in mind the Plaintiff was then a 10 year-old child in a police station, his âuncontradictedâevidence at trial that he did not understand the difference between bending forward and slumping across the steering wheel was understandable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  However, I find the Plaintiffâs evidence in this respect inherently unreliable. First, the Plaintiff claimed he appreciated thedifference between âä¼ä¿è»ç¤ä¸â and âååå¾â by the time he gave evidence, namely, that the former meant the bodywas slumped across and touching the steering wheel, but the latter meant the body was bent forward at an angle without touching thesteering wheel. However, he insisted nobody taught him such difference and there was no special reason why he came to understandthe difference.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Secondly, the Plaintiff admitted he then knew what âè¶´ä¿å°â (colloquial way of saying âä¼ä¿å°â) meant, but tried tobrush this aside by claiming he did not know what âä¼ä¿å°â meant or that âè¶´ä¿å°â and âä¼ä¿å°â were the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Thirdly, the Plaintiff in his evidence offered another explanation for the phrase âæè»ä¹ååä¸å»æ â¦â¦ è¦ä½¢ä¼åä¿è»ç¤ä¸âfound in his statement to the police which was somewhat different from the explanation in paragraphs 74-75 above, namely, he thoughtthe police officer understood what he meant when he told the police officer the Deceasedâs body bent forward (ååå¾).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Fourthly, although the Plaintiffâs mother was with him when he gave his statement to the police, she did not point out the differencebetween what he said and what the police officer wrote down. If the difference between the two was apparently clear to the 15 year-oldPlaintiff without being taught, it should have been obvious to his mother as well as to the police officer who took his statementin March 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Fifthly and more importantly, the Plaintiff agreed (a) the events were fresher in his mind when he gave his statement to the policethan at the trial, (b) no one forced him to tell the police officer anything he did not wish to say, and (c) he had read his statementto the police or it was read back to him and he agreed the contents were accurate without any need for amendment. Indeed, the so-calledâerrorsâ in the Plaintiffâs statement to the police was not even touched upon in his witness statement or supplemental witnessstatement, and was only raised when he gave evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Sixthly, it is evident from the Plaintiffâs statement to the police that in recording what he said the police officer drew a distinctionbetween two different postures of the Deceased by the phrases âä½¢è½ææä¸èº«åªå°å°å¾åâ and âä½¢ä¼åä¿è»ç¤ä¸â.Looking at the totality of the evidence, I find the Plaintiff must have told the police officer these two different postures. Therewas no reason for the police officer to make them up. The Plaintiffâs evidence at the trial in this respect is unreliable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  On balance, I find that before reaching the Crest the Deceased sat up straight in his driverâs seat and faced the front. As theNanny Van started to go down the Down Slope, his upper body started to bend forward. Just before the Accident the Deceasedâs bodywas slumped across the steering wheel. Such behaviour is inconsistent with that of a driver who was fully alert and in control ofthe vehicle, but is consistent with the Defendantâs case that the Plaintiff suffered from and was disabled by a sudden heart attackand/or loss of consciousness immediately before the Accident. I now turn to the medical evidence.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(5) Expert medial evidence</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The Defendant adduced expert medical reports from a cardiologist Dr Chen Wai-Hong (â<u>Dr Chen</u>â) whilst the Plaintiff relied on those of Professor C R Kumana (â<u>Prof Kumana</u>â), an expert in internal medicine with emphasis in clinical pharmacology and therapeutics. Prof Kumana explained he also specialisedin cardiology in the course of his career and retained an interest in cardiology and cardiovascular clinical pharmacology.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(6) Cause of death</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The autopsy report dated 5<sup>th</sup> March 2005 (â<u>Autopsy Report</u>â) prepared by Dr Cheung Ka-Wai (â<u>Dr Cheung</u>â) stated that the cause of death shown by the post-mortem appeared to be haemothorax (direct cause) and traumatic rupture of heart(intervening antecedent cause).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Both Dr Chen and Prof Kumana agreed the Deceasedâs immediate cause of death was cardiac rupture, a well-recognised complicationof blunt trauma to the chest. The Accident resulted in rib fracture (ie blunt chest trauma) and injury to the cardiac chamber(s)(ie cardiac rupture) causing bleeding into the pleural cavities.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Mr Wong submitted the Autopsy Report did not say the Deceased had any heart attack. But one must bear in mind the purpose of anautopsy was to ascertain the cause of death, and here the cause of death is clear. Dr Cheung in her letter to the Plaintiffâs solicitorsdated 10<sup>th</sup> March 2006 (â<u>Dr Cheungâs Letter</u>â) said it was beyond the scope of the autopsy to say whether or not the Deceased actually suffered a sudden heart attack just beforethe Accident due to his medical condition. The Plaintiffâs expert Prof Kumana also said (and Dr Chen agreed) traumatic cardiacrupture was almost certainly the cause of death, so there was no need to invoke any other secondary mechanism such as impending heartattack.  </p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(7) Sudden heart attack</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Dr Cheungâs autopsy findings in relation to the Deceasedâs pericardium, heart and blood vessels were as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">ââ¦â¦<u>Heart</u>: â¦â¦ Left anterior descending coronary artery showed 75% atheromatous occlusion 2 cm from the origin.

She furtheropined that the finding of high grade stenosis with atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries was <i>per se</i> well-known as capable of causing sudden heart attack at any time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  Prof Kumana opined that since macroscopic and microscopic examination of the heart during the post-mortem yielded no evidence ofacute myocardial infarction (ie no anatomical suggestion of typical acute ischaemic heart muscle death or necrosis) and no thromboticocclusion (ie complete blockage by a blood clot) in any of the Deceasedâs coronary arteries, the Deceased <i>by definition</i> did not suffer any acute myocardial infarction. It therefore appears that his opinion was based on (a) no pathological changes tothe heart and (b) no complete occlusion of the coronary arteries.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  But in respect of (a), Prof Kumana did not address the point raised by Dr Cheung and also by Dr Chen that gross alteration of heartmuscle was difficult to identify until at least 6-12 hours had elapsed following onset of heart attack (see <i>Brauwaldâs Heart Disease</i> 7<sup>th</sup> ed, a textbook of cardiovascular medicine cited by Dr Chen, p.1145). Dr Chen said even with the use of special techniques, heartmuscle damage could only be discerned after 2-3 hours. This meant that the Deceasedâs immediate death after the Accident robbedany possible pathological evidence of heart attack. I prefer the opinion of Dr Cheung and Dr Chen that the absence of pathologicalchanges to the Deceasedâs heart did not rule out the existence of a sudden heart attack just before the Accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  In respect of (b), Dr Cheung said high grade stenosis with atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries was <i>per se</i> well-known as capable of causing sudden heart attack at any time. Dr Chen also said that in view of the severe obstruction of thetwo coronary arteries (ie evidence of coronary heart disease), it was possible for the Deceased to have an acute heart attack withloss of consciousness prior to the Accident. He explained that profuse bleeding could still occur after a heart attack that causeddeath almost instantaneously. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Dr Chen added that the absence of clot in the coronary arteries did not rule out heart attack. He explained there was a type ofheart attack that occurred without visible clot and that typically happened in the presence of severely narrowed coronary arteriesas seen in the autopsy (see <i>Brauwaldâs Heart Disease</i> (supra) which suggested that infarction does not necessarily require complete occlusion of the coronary artery(ies)). I prefer DrCheungâs and Dr Chenâs opinion that the possibility of acute heart attack existed despite the absence of thrombotic occlusion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Given the autopsy findings that evidenced coronary heart disease, I accept Dr Cheungâs view that a sudden heart attack could havehappened at any time and Dr Chenâs opinion that such acute heart attack before the onset of the Accident could have led to lossof consciousness. In light of the medical opinion supported by the above factual matrix, I find this a plausible explanation thathad a colour of probability for the absence of control of the Nanny Van and the eventual collision.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(8) Hypoglycaemia</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Both Prof Kumana and Dr Chen agreed that diabetic patients treated with glucose-lowering drugs were at risk of hypoglycaemia. Atthe time of the Accident, the Deceased was taking gliclazide which was a newly prescribed (ie for less than three months) oral anti-diabeticmedication.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Prof Kumana said gliclazide could give rise to hypoglycaemia especially if the patient missed out on or ate less breakfast thanusual, or vomited which he had imbibed or exercised more than usual. Both medical experts said hypoglycaemic episodes could giverise to acute reactions manifesting as excitement, acute loss of consciousness and even as a fit. Since the medication was newlyprescribed, it was possible the Deceased might not have recognised the onset of early symptoms of hypoglycaemia (eg sweating, excitement,anxiety and tremor) and might not have taken avoiding action (eg taking sugar) in time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Both medical experts agreed it was possible a hypoglycaemic episode might have occurred just before the Accident which caused theDeceased to lose control of and crash the Nanny Van. Based on such agreed opinion, the above factual matrix and the autopsy findingthat gliclazide was detected at therapeutic level, I find it a plausible explanation that the Deceased suffered a sudden hypoglycaemicepisode causing loss of or impaired level of consciousness just before the Accident.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(9) Arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  According to Dr Tong of QDC, the Deceased had at least four coronary heart disease risk factors, ie diabetes, smoking, abnormalblood lipids and hypertension (high blood pressure). The post-mortem confirmed coronary artery abnormalities. Both medical expertsagreed arrhythmia could occur in patients with coronary heart disease. Prof Kumana said although the Deceased might not have experiencedovert cardiac symptoms (see paragraphs 111-114 below), he could well have had an episode of abnormal cardiac rhythm. Extremely fastor slow heart rates could have ensued and given rise to altered state of and/or loss of consciousness resulting in the Accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  Dr Chen agreed that arrhythmias could occur in patients with coronary heart disease and were especially common in the setting ofacute heart attack. One type of arrhythmia was causing half of the deaths within one hour of onset of acute heart attack. The Deceasedhad severe coronary artery disease evidenced by the post-mortem and it was possible acute heart attack might have occurred causingdevelopment of abnormal heart rhythm that could lead to loss of consciousness.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Given the above factual matrix and the agreed expert medical opinion that it was possible the Deceased suffered from arrhythmia,I accept sudden arrhythmia leading to loss of or impaired level of consciousness just before the Accident was a plausible explanationthat had the colour of probability for the Deceasedâs absence of control of the Nanny Van and the eventual collision.</p>    <p class="heading"><i><u>(10) Plaintiffâs arguments</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  First, Mr Wong argued that the Defendant carried the evidential burden to prove his pleaded case of sudden heart attack and/or lossof consciousness immediately before the Accident on the balance of probabilities, and the Defendant failed to prove the same by cogentevidence. The medical expert opinion only identified speculative possibilities that could not be equated to medical findings. Therewas no pathological evidence of recent myocardial infarction and there was no mention of excessive low blood sugar concentrationin the Autopsy Report. Further, the Deceased had some food when he returned home after 9:00am on the day of the Accident and he self-administeredblood test with normal result.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  I fear the above submission fell into error on the law. I need go no further than the legal principles in paragraphs 14-19 abovewhich made clear the burden does not shift to the Defendant. To rebut the âresâ, the Defendant had to (a) show an equally possibleexplanation for the Accident without any need to establish that such explanation was more likely to be correct than any other, or(b) even if there were no explanation, show a way in which the Accident might have occurred without negligence (see <i>Ludgate v Lovett</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20WLR%201016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 1 WLR 1016</a>, 1018-1019, <i>per</i> Harman LJ). It did not matter there were several plausible explanations so long as they or some of them had the colour of probability.The Defendant was not required to prove on balance how the Accident actually happened.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  The medical experts could not pinpoint the exact medical condition that caused the Accident (Prof Kumana) or the relative likelihoodof the aforesaid medical conditions that might have happened to the Deceased (Dr Chen). But despite disagreement over whether theDeceased might have suffered acute heart attack, they both agreed it was possible the Deceased experienced hypoglycaemic reactionor abnormal cardiac rhythm.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  I disagree the medical reasons offered by the experts were merely theoretical possibilities. Here, both medical experts had to dealwith medical possibility rather than medical finding of acute heart attack because the Deceasedâs immediate death destroyed anyopportunity to acquire relevant pathological evidence. In light of Dr Cheungâs and Dr Chenâs opinion which I have accepted (seeparagraph 95 above), I am unable to attach any great weight to the absence of morphological evidence of any heart attack. Further,it is necessary to consider all relevant facts and circumstances instead of just this factor in determining whether the âresâhad been displaced.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  In my view, given the autopsy findings of severe occlusion of coronary arteries, coronary heart disease and gliclizade taken fortherapeutic purpose as well as the factual matrix discussed above, the Defendantâs medical conditions strongly supported the contentionthat the explanations proffered by the medical experts were plausible and/or had the colour of probability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  I am also unable to place substantial weight on the fact that excessive low blood sugar concentration was not mentioned in the AutopsyReport. There is no medical evidence before me it was medically possible for excessive low blood sugar concentration to be ascertainedor that Dr Cheung looked for the same at the post-mortem. After all, the cause of death was clear in this case (see paragraphs 85-87above). As Prof Kumana said, there was no reason to invoke other secondary mechanism for identifying the cause of death. In any event,gliclizade was found in the Deceasedâs blood at therapeutic level during the autopsy. More importantly, neither Prof Kumana norDr Chen (both of whom had reviewed the relevant medical background of the Deceased) suggested it was impossible for the Deceasedto have had a hypoglycaemic episode; on the contrary, they agreed it was a possibility.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Secondly, Mr Wong criticised Dr Chenâs expert report for starting off with an assumption that the Deceased apparently had lossof consciousness before onset of the Accident, then going on to look for a medical reason to justify the assumption and eventuallycoming up with the possibilities of heart attack and loss of consciousness. Mr Wong submitted there was no factual basis for suchassumption and âeven Dr. Chen could not tell what happened to the Deceased, namely hypoglycaemia, heart attack or abnormal heartrhythm â¦â¦ Dr. Chenâs said opinion is no more than mere speculation.â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Again, such argument fell into error on the law and I repeat paragraph 103 above. In fact Dr Chen came to his view â[from] allthe available evidenceâ after he had âgone through the documentsâ provided to him. From the primary documents (both medicaland factual) that would have been put to both medical experts, the Deceasedâs behaviour (if he were mentally alert and in controlof the Nanny Van at the time of the Accident) would have been unreasonable and inexplicable (see paragraphs 67-83 above). There wasno apparent effort to follow the Right Bend, brake or take any avoidance action. I find Dr Chen approached the primary medical andfactual matters with good common sense, and it is not correct to say he premised his opinion on a hypothetical assumption. Instead,he explored the medical issues and came to a firm opinion (seconded by Prof Kumana) <i>inter alia</i> that medically speaking it was possible the Deceased had hypoglycaemic episode and/or arrhythmia which could lead to loss of or impairedlevel of consciousness before onset of the Accident. I reject Mr Wongâs criticism of Dr Chenâs expert opinion.</p>    <p class="heading"><u><i>(c) Unawareness of the disabling condition</i></u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Leggatt LJ in <i>Mansfield</i>âs case (supra at p.529) said as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">ââ¦â¦ A person like [the defendantâs] very rare condition commonly does not appreciate that his ability is impaired, and heis no exception.

The medical experts also agreed that diabeticpatients (such as the Deceased) had an increased risk of coronary artery or ischaemic heart disease.

When Mr Shek acted as substitute nanny on board the NannyVan (see paragraph 45 above), he was able to observe the Deceasedâs manner of driving and found (which I accept) that the Deceaseddid not drive at a fast speed. Further, the Deceased never had an accident with the Nanny Van for at least two years during whichthe Plaintiff was a student passenger. There was also no evidence that the parents of the Nanny Vanâs student passengers ever complainedof any unsafe or careless driving on the part of the Deceased.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Mr Shek said the Deceased drove at the speed limit of 50kph or 70kph (whichever was applicable).

I am unable to accept the bald assertion (without consideration of the road conditions) that a school privatelight bus driven at the speed limit was necessarily too fast.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  I am also not persuaded by the Plaintiffâs evidence that the Deceased generally drove quite fast, âé½å¹¾ååï¼å³ä¿å¥½éâ(ie the Nanny Van was quite shaky) and that he had actually complained about the same to his mother. Strangely, there was no evidencehis mother took any action or made any complaint to Mr Shek or the Deceased. Further, although the Plaintiff stated in his statementto the police that the speed of the Nanny Van accelerated when it started to go down the Down Slope, he did not tell the police officerthe speed of the Nanny Van was quite fast on the day of the Accident or generally. The Plaintiffâs mother also did not mentionthe same. The Plaintiff blamed the police officer for not asking him about such matter, but the same police officer took statementsfrom other student passengers and some of their statements (see paragraph 122 below) referred to the speed of the Nanny Van. I findit improbable that the police officer did not have the matter of the Nanny Vanâs speed in mind when he took the statement fromthe Plaintiff. I am not persuaded the Deceased usually drove quite fast, but even if he did there is no sufficient evidence thatthe speed was <i>too fast</i> in the circumstances on the day of the Accident (see paragraph 125 below).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  As far as the Defendant knew, the Deceased was prosecuted only once for a traffic offence. The Defendant had an impression of theWidow telling him it was a minor traffic offence that happened ten odd years ago. However, police investigation revealed the Deceasedhad one âspeedingâ and one âcareless drivingâ traffic conviction record in 2001 and 2002 respectively. I accept on balancethe Defendant and Mr Shek were unaware of the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that the Deceased committed a minor traffic offence many years ago and one âspeedingâand one âcareless drivingâ traffic offence in 2001 and 2002 respectively. However, the circumstances and/or gravity of such trafficoffences are unknown and there is no evidence the latter two traffic offences were associated with the Nanny Van. These offencesmust be viewed against the fact that the Deceased had been a driver for over thirty years. Although I have taken these traffic offencesinto consideration, I am unable to say they were of probative value in suggesting that the Deceased drove too fast or negligentlyat the time of the Accident.</p>    <p class="heading"><u><i>(2) Speed of the Nanny Vanat the time of the Accident</i></u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  Tsang Chun Yip said he did not feel the Nanny Van was travelling at a fast speed before the Accident.

More significantly, although the Plaintiffâs pleadings averred that the Deceased was driving too fastin the circumstances, he did not say so in his witness statement and supplemental witness statement made in 2004 and 2007 respectively.The Plaintiff said the person who took such statements from him did not ask him, but I find that improbable in light of the Plaintiffâspleadings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  Mr Wong placed emphasis on Mr Chanâs statement to the police dated 18<sup>th</sup> March 2003 which stated âè©²è»[ie the Nanny Van]æ¯ä¸è¬è»åè»éå¿«â and after going past his position at the Crest itwent straight down the Down Slope, but I approach such evidence with some caution :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="91%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Apart from the Plaintiff, none of the other eye-witnesses (including Mr Chan) gave <i>viva voce</i> evidence or was subject to cross-examination.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="91%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">There might be a difference in perception because the student passengers were on board the Nanny Van and Mr Chan was an observer onthe street.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="91%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Although Mr Chan was an adult and the student passengers on board the Nanny Van were minor children, the latter were not ignorantor insensible to differences in speed.

In any event, I do not accept it was âa speed faster than those ofother vehiclesâ that caused the Accident. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  Mr Wong suggested the Deceased might have slumped across the steering wheel in reaction to an impending collision. I find it unlikelythat a seasoned driver like the Deceased would not instinctively react to an impending collision by swerving, braking or taking someother avoidance action and would instead bend forward to slump across the steering wheel to meet the impact head on.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  I also reject Mr Wongâs submission that the Deceased was conscious and in control of the Nanny Van up to the very last momentbefore the collision, but the Nanny Van was travelling so fast (at the speed limit of 50kph or higher) and without deceleration thatthe collision was inevitable. There is no cogent evidence that the Deceased was fully conscious until the very last moment beforeimpact.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  I find that the Deceased drove in his usual speed that was not too fast in the circumstances, but after passing the Crest his upperbody bent forward and the speed of the Nanny Van accelerated. He did not take any avoidance action and slumped across the steeringwheel just before the Accident. Such factual matrix correlated well with the expert medical evidence that the Deceased could havehad sudden heart attack, hypoglycaemic episode or arrhythmia leading to loss of or impaired level of conscious as the Nanny Van camedown the Down Slope and such medical condition(s) could have impaired his control of Nanny Van thus causing the Accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  I find it unsurprising that the student passengers thought the Deceased was driving as usual. With his back to them and his handson the steering wheel, they might have thought he was still driving the Nanny Van as it coasted down the straight section of theDown Slope that did not require obvious manipulation of the steering wheel.</p>    <p class="heading"><u><i>(f) Act of God</i></u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  In such circumstances, the Plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden in establishing on balance that the Accident was due tothe negligence of the Deceased. Indeed, on the above analysis of the evidence I am prepared to go further and find on balance thatthe Accident was an inevitable accident or act of God as described by Slesser LJ in <i>Ryan v Youngs</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1938%5d%201%20All%20ER%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1938] 1 All ER 522</a>, 524-525 :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">ââ¦â¦ An apparently healthy, apparently competent man, in charge of a competent machine, is suddenly struck down, and that isa matter which nobody can reasonably anticipate.
