The dismissal of the application was qualified to the extent only that the judge orderedthat two short passages in the Statement of Claim relating to the alleged capacity of the Defendant firm and its duties in relationto the Plaintiff were to be struck out as a result of concessions made on behalf of the Defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiff is a deposit taking company in compulsory liquidation and the action is conducted by its liquidator, the Official Receiver.The Defendants are a firm of accountants. The Plaintiff's claim is based on the alleged professional negligence of the Defendants.It was conceded before the judge and on the appeal that the Plaintiff intended to confine its claim against the Defendants to allegedbreaches of duty by the Defendants as the auditors of the Plaintiff, notwithstanding allegations in the Statement of Claim that theDefendants had also been the Plaintiff's accountants, tax representatives and financial advisers. It was also conceded by the Plaintiffthat none of its claims in the Statement of Claim relied on any cause of action arising out of the' Defendants' audit of the Plaintiff'saccounts for the period ended the 31st December 1977.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The writ in the action was issued on the 25th April 1984. It was amended on the 8th February 1985 and was not served until the 12thApril 1985. It was generally indorsed with claims for damages for breaches of duty by the Defendants in relation, so far as is nowmaterial, to its capacity as the Plaintiff's auditors. These claims were founded in contract and tort and also on the statutory obligationsimposed upon auditors under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap.32</a>).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The Statement of Claim was served on the 15th April 1985. It is not a model of the pleader's art. The breaches of duty alleged thereinagainst the Defendants stem from two matters. One matter is the alleged misappropriation of negotiable certificates of deposit ("NCDs")belonging to the Plaintiff by Nugan Hand Limited ("Nugan Hand"), an Australian company, closely associated, through common shareholdersand directors, with the Plaintiff. The NCDs in question are claimed to have had a value of (A)$2,702,776.39 and the misappropriationsare claimed to have occurred on various dates during 1978, 1979 and 1980 at a time when the NCD's had been released from the custodyof the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited to be held on the Plaintiff's behalf and to the Plaintiff's order. The Plaintiffpleads that in the annual accounts of the Plaintiff for the years ended the 31st December 1977 and 1978 its NCDs were described as"Deposits with other banks" in the sums of (US)$1,805,920 and (US)$1,533,957 respectively.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The other matter concerns payments amounting to (US)$92,620.58 and (US)$400,000 alleged by the Plaintiff to have been made to itby Nugan Hand Bank during the period between the 24th December 1976 and the 31st December 1977, and during the accounting year endedthe 31st December 1978 respectively. The Plaintiff pleads that these payments purported to have been made to the Plaintiff in respectof business introduced to the Nugan Hand Bank by the Plaintiff and in respect of the expenses incurred by the Plaintiff in operatingthe representative office of Nugan Hand Bank in Hong Kong.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> It is pleaded that the Plaintiff was not entitled to these payments, that the sum of (US)$92,620.58 was shown in the detailed profitand lose accounts in the Plaintiff's audited accounts for the above mentioned period ended the 31st December 1977 as "Commissionreceived" and that the sum of (US)$400,000 was shown in the detailed profit and loss account in the Plaintiff's audited accountsfor the year ended the 31st December 1978 as "fees and other income". The Plaintiff goes on to plead that without the abovementionedsum of $92,620.58 the Plaintiff's net profit for the abovementioned accounting period ended the 31st December 1977 would have beenonly (US)$31,293.71 and not (US)$123,914.29 as stated in the relevant accounts. It is also pleaded that without the abovementionedsum of (US)$400,000 the Plaintiff did not make a net profit of (US)$176,551 for the year ended the 31st December 1978 as stated inthe accounts but a loss of (US)$223,449.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Having pleaded these matters the Statement of Claim alleges four heads of breaches of duty by the Defendants which are alleged tohave caused loss to the Plaintiff. They are as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <p>(1)    <u>Failure to satisfy themselves that Nugan Hand were "proper custodians" of NCDs</u></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> By paragraphs 16 and 22 it is pleaded inter alia that at the date of the Defendants' appointment as the Plaintiff's auditors (theappointment is alleged in paragraph 4 to have been confirmed by the Defendants on the 14th of May 1978) and thereafter the Defendantswere in breach of their duty as the Plaintiff's auditors in failing to satisfy themselves that Nugan Hand were "proper custodians"of the NCDs in circumstances where the Defendants knew or ought to have known that it was necessary so to satisfy themselves. Thisallegation is the basis for a claim in paragraph 23(1) in respect of consequential loss sustained by the Plaintiff amounting to (A)$2,702,776.39representing the value of the NCDs allegedly misappropriated by Nugan Hand after the appointment of the Defendants as the Plaintiff'sauditors.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="95%"><u>Failure to satisfy themselves when auditing the Plaintiff's account for the ,year ended the 31st December 197 that the Plaintiff hada good title to the NCDs and that Nugan Hand did not</u></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> By paragraphs 17 and 22 it is pleaded further or in the alternative that the Defendants were in breach of their duty as the Plaintiff'sauditors in failing to satisfy themselves, when they carried out the Plaintiff's audit for the year ended the 31st December 1978,"as to the Plaintiff's entitlement to the NCDs and the proceeds thereof and Nugan Hand's lack of entitlement thereto". This allegationis the basis for an alternative claim in paragraph 23(2) in respect of the Plaintiff's alleged consequential loss amounting to (A)$2,200,000representing the value of the NCDs allegedly misappropriated by Nugan Hand after the 31st December 1978.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="95%"><u>Failure to discover, when carrying out the Plaintiff's audit for the year ended the 31st December 1978, that the Plaintiff visa insolvent</u></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>               </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> By paragraphs 18, 19 and 22 it is pleaded further or in the alternative that the Defendants were in breach of their duty as the Plaintiff'sauditors when carrying out the Plaintiff's audit for the year ended the 31st December 1978 by failing to establish the true financialposition of the Plaintiffs which was one of insolvency. This allegation was particularised by reference to the commissions and feesallegedly wrongly entered as income of the Plaintiff in the audited accounts and by reference to the alleged misappropriation ofthe Plaintiff's NCDs and their proceeds up to the 31st December 1978.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It is also alleged that if the Defendants had established the true financial position of the Plaintiff at the time of their auditthe Plaintiff would have ceased trading shortly thereafter or the Commissioner of Deposit-taking Companies would have suspended orrevoked the Plaintiff's registration. This allegation is also the basis for the alternative claim in paragraph 23(2) in respect ofthe Plaintiff's alleged consequential loss amounting to (A)$2,200,000.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>(4)    <u>Failure to qualify the Plaintiff's audited accounts for the year ended the 31st December 1978</u></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> By paragraphs 20, 21 and 22 the Plaintiff pleads further or in the alternative that the Defendants were in breach of their duty asthe Plaintiff's auditors in that, in breach of paragraph 29 of the Hong Kong Society of Accountants' Statement No. 108 and of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s141.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 141(3)(a)</a> and paragraph 2 of the Tenth Schedule of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>), the Defendants had failed to indicate, in the Plaintiff's audited accounts for the year ended the 31st December 1978,the general nature of the NCDs and their limited inquiries concerning them, and inter alia had failed to qualify their report bystating that they had been unable to satisfy themselves regarding the ownership of the NCDs due to lack of account records.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> It is also alleged that had the Defendants not been in breach of the abovementioned provisions the Plaintiff would have ceased tradingshortly thereafter or the Commissioner of Deposit taking Companies would have made inquiries into the affairs of the Plaintiff whichwould have led to the suspension or revocation of the Plaintiff's registration. These allegations are also the basis for the alternativeclaim in paragraph 23(2) in respect of the Plaintiff's alleged consequential loss amounting to (A)$2,200,000.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> On the 31st October 1985 the Plaintiff served Further and Better Particulars of the Statement of Claim which served to clarify or,in effect, amend a number of allegations in the Statement of Claim. The particulars of paragraph 16 made it clear that the Plaintiffwas alleging the breaches by the Defendant, summarised at (1) above, to have been committed by the Defendant in its capacity as auditorsonly and not as accountants, tax advisers or financial advisers of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Before the judge it was contended on behalf of the Defendant that the Statement of Claim should be struck out under Order 18 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 19</a> on the grounds that it disclosed no cause of action, was embarrassing and also that it was an abuse of the process of the court.It was also contended in the alternative that a substantial number of specified parts of the pleadings should be struck out for reasonsspecified in the summons.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The judge adopted a broad approach to the Statement of Claim and identified the gist of the Plaintiff's cause of action against theDefendants as a common place action for professional negligence against a firm of auditors. He mentioned that the Plaintiff's officerswere alleged to have engaged in what he called a "window dressing" exercise which allowed non-existent profits to appear in the accountsdue to "Imaginary commissions and fees" shown as income accruing to the Plaintiff, with the result that the Plaintiff was able tocontinue in business as a deposit taking company when in reality it was insolvent. He went on to mention the Plaintiff's allegationthat if the audited accounts had shown the true position the Plaintiff's registration and licence as a deposit taking company wouldhave been suspended before its assets had been misappropriated.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The judge was here identifying the claim summarised at (3) above. It was contended by Mr. Barlow for the Defendants on the appealthat the judge fell into error by his reference to "Imaginary" commissions and fees. Mr. Barlow stressed that the relevant amountshad actually been alleged to have been received by the Plaintiff and so they had to be entered in its accounts.  Moreover it wasnot alleged by the Plaintiff that the relevant amounts had been paid back or recovered from the Plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Whilst we accept that the payments of the amounts in question were clearly not imaginary we consider that the judge demonstratedby his subsequent observations, referred to above, that he apprehended correctly the nature of the Plaintiff's claim as summarisedat (3) above. That claim is based on the allegation of failure by the Defendants as auditors of the Plaintiff to ascertain the trueposition in relation to the commissions and fees and the alleged consequential insolvency of the Plaintiff, when auditing the Plaintiff'saccounts for the year ended the 31st December 1978. It is a claim which may well prove difficult to establish but it is not plainand obvious to us that, as pleaded, the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The judge had the following to say about the gist of the Plaintiff's claims pleaded in the Statement of Claim concerning the NCDs:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The second way in which the defendant is alleged to have failed in its duty as accountants and/or auditors is that it failed to detector do anything about a system whereby the plaintiff's principal asset, namely negotiable certificates of deposit, were allowed intothe hands of a company (Nugan Hand Limited) with which the plaintiff was associated.  Nugan Hand Limited was not the sort of companywhich should have been used as custodian or trustee of the plaintiff's asset. Nugan Hand Limited misappropriated the plaintiff'snegotiable certificates of deposits. If the defendants had blown the whistle on the unbusiness-like arrangement of Nugan Hand Limitedholding the plaintiff's negotiable certificates of deposit, the misappropriation would not have occurred."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>His subsequent conclusion that the Statement of Claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action was challenged by Mr. Barlow on the appeal.He further contended that the Plaintiff's claims in relation to the NCDs were embarrassing by reason of obscurity and irrelevanceand incapable of re-formulation to plead a reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In our judgment the judge was right as regards the claims summarised at (2) and (4) above to hold that a reasonable cause of actionhad been pleaded. These claims relate to alleged breaches by the Defendants in and about their conduct of the audit of the Plaintiff'saccounts for the year ended the 31st December 1978 and we consider that in relation to these claims the judge rightly held that,whilst there were obviously difficult questions of causation to be determined, this was not a plain and obvious case for strikingout the pleading.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> However, we accept Mr. Barlow's contention that the claim summarised at (1) above, based on the alleged failure of the Defendantsto satisfy themselves that Nugan Hand were "proper custodians" of the NCDs is not only obscure and therefore embarrassing but alsofails to disclose a reasonable cause of action. Part of the confusion in the pleading stems from the fact that, as originally pleadedin paragraphs 16 and 22, by reference to paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Statement of Claim, this claim is expressed to be based on an allegedbreach by the Defendants of their duties as auditors, accountants, tax representatives and financial advisers.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The particulars of the Statement of Claim contain substantial matter concerning the alleged duties of the Defendants in their capacitiesother than as the Plaintiff's auditors but the particulars given in relation to paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim and the concessionsmentioned above make it clear that the Plaintiff is in fact pursuing its claim under paragraph 16 against the Defendants only inits capacity as the Plaintiff's auditors. This leaves much dead .wood in the Statement of Claim and in the further and better particularsof that pleading. Furthermore, in the particulars given by the Plaintiff under paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim, the work requiredto be undertaken by the Defendants in their capacity as auditors is alleged to have been:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"................ the forming of an opinion as to whether the financial statements of the Plaintiffs being reported upon compliedwith the Hong Kong <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> and gave a true and fair view of the Plaintiffs' state of affairs for the accounting period in question."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In the light of these pleadings there is a complete absence of any material averment of fact or law to provide the basis for anyreasonable cause of action founding the claim under paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The Plaintiff has pleaded in paragraph 4, as particularised in the Further and Better Particulars of the Statement of Claim, thatthe Defendants were appointed to be the Plaintiff's auditors "on a date be about the 15th November 1977 and 1st February 1978 (and,in all probability, between about 29th November 1977 and 1st February 1978)". Paragraph 16 makes no allegation in relation to theconduct of any audit for the accounting period ended on the 31st December 1977 and Mr. Neoh for the-Plaintiff informed us that thePlaintiff's causes of action were not concerned with allegations of alleged misfeasance by the Defendants in the course of the 1977audit.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> That being so the Plaintiff, having identified the alleged duties of the Defendants as auditors as relating to the forming of opinionsregarding the sufficiency of "the financial statements of the Plaintiffs being reported upon", has made no allegation of any breachof such duty. Instead there is merely a vacuous allegation of failure by the Defendants, on and after their appointment as the Plaintiff'sauditors, to satisfy themselves that Nugan Hand were the "proper custodians" of the NCDs. This allegation, which is particularised,(in such a way as to include evidence and further pleadings), by reference to the alleged knowledge of circumstances which shouldhave put the Defendants on their guard, leads nowhere. Furthermore, we are satisfied that this claim is incapable of reformulationto establish a reasonable cause of action, having regard to the fact that the Plaintiff has conceded that its claims are made againstthe Defendants in their capacity as auditors only.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> It is clear from the Plaintiff's pleading that it is alleging a close connection, through common directors and shareholders, betweenthe Plaintiff and its associated Australian Companies. It is alleged, in effect, that one or more of the directors of the Plaintiffand its associated companies were dishonest and that assets of the Plaintiff were wrongly being put in jeopardy by the Plaintiff'smanagement. Assuming without deciding that the Defendants as auditors of the Plaintiff were alerted, before conducting the auditof the 1978 accounts, to the risk of the Plaintiff's assets being put in jeopardy by its management, we fail to see how it becametheir duty to intervene in the management of the Plaintiff company and usurp or supervise the functions of the directors. The dutiesand functions of the auditors of a company relate, as the Plaintiff itself alleges in the particulars of paragraph 4 of the Statementof Claim, to the scrutiny and certification or otherwise of the company's accounts in the light of the relevant statutory and otherrequirements. It is their duty to draw attention to irregularities ascertainable by reference to the accounts. They are not undera wider duty as auditors to intervene in the manage-ment of the company.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> We therefore consider that the judge should have struck out paragraph 16 and the claim for (A)$2,702,776.39 in paragraph 23(1) ofthe Statement of Claim.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> We heard argument at some length from Mr. Barlow on the appeal in support of the contention that the Statement of Claim should bestruck out under Order 18 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 19(1)(c)</a> for embarrass-ment, or that all or part of the pleading should be ordered to be amended. He relied on <u>Davy</u> v. <u>Garrett</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%207%20Ch%20D%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 7 Ch. D. 473</a> for the proposition that the Defendants were entitled <u>ex</u> <u>debito</u> <u>justitiae</u> to have the opposite party's case presented in an intelligible form so that they may not be embarrassed in meeting it.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Mr. Barlow complained that the judge had not dealt with the embarrassment issue which had taken up much of the time of the hearingbelow. Although the judge did not expressly deal with this issue we consider that he made it clear by implication that he was rejectingit, because, in a careful reserved judgment, he set out the numerous parts of the Statement of Claim which the Plaintiff  soughtto have struck out for reasons of alleged embarrassment or otherwise, and gave his reasons for declining to strike out any of thoseparts save for those which had been the subject of the Defendants' concessions mentioned above.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr. Neoh resisted the contentions that the Statement of Claim was embarrassing and yielded to them only to the extent of applyingfor and obtaining leave to make a number of minor amendments which were substantially cosmetic in their effect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Although we consider that the judge should have struck out paragraphs 16 and 23(l), we think he was otherwise right in decliningto exercise his discretion to strike out more of the Statement of Claim than he did on the ground of embarrassment. We mean no disrespectto counsel on both sides by not dealing seriatim with all the detailed arguments advanced on the issue of embarrassment. Having discernedtriable issues in the pleading, as the judge did, we consider that notwithstanding the undoubted blemishes in the Statement of Claimand the further and better particulars of that pleading, those blemishes are not sufficiently grave to justify the striking out ofany part of the pleading other than the parts struck out by the judge and paragraphs 16 and 23(1) which we have dealt with above.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Accordingly we will allow this appeal to the extent of ordering that paragraphs 16 and 23(1) of the Statement of Claim be struckout.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> As regards costs, a substantial amount of hearing time below and on appeal was taken up with three claims which have not been struckout and with the issue of embarrassment; and below the question of abuse of the process was raised unsuccessfully. On the other handthe Defendants have succeeded on appeal in striking out an alternative claim for (A)$2,702,776.39, thereby reducing the Plaintiff'soverall claim for special damages by (A)$502,776.39 to (A)$2,200,000. The Plaintiff has also been induced to apply for and obtaina number of minor amendments.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The Statement of Claim leaves much to be desired as a pleading. It has been substantially amended indirectly by further and betterparticulars and concessions and it appears from para graph 9 of the affidavit of Mr. Hartley, the Defendants' solicitor, that onthe 13th January 1986 Mr. Robertson, who has had the conduct of the Plaintiff's action, took a firm stand on his pleadings and refusedto consider amending the Statement of Claim until after a Defence had been served.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In our judgment the proceedings in the court below could have been avoided if the Plaintiff had re-considered its pleadings and madethe amendments that have now resulted from this appeal.  We consider that under the circumstances the Defendants were justified inmaking their application and pursuing it on appeal. We will therefore make an order nisi awarding the Defendants the costs belowand of this appeal in any event.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(P.G.
