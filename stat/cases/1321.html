When such quotation is accepted, there would usually be a <i>purchase order</i> or a <i>written confirmation</i>from D.  Upon completion of the work, the contractor would issue a <i>completion form</i>.  Similarly, the supplier would issue a <i>delivery note</i> upon the supply of the materials.  Dâs staff would then <i>sign</i> on the completion form or the delivery note.  Thereafter, the contractor or supplier would issue an <i>invoice</i> for Dâs settlement.  Tam Yiu Cho (âTamâ), the Managing Director of D, has also filed an affirmation to confirm such standardpractice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Ng and Tam have both exhibited documents in their affirmations purportedly to support their alleged standard practice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Ng has produced the following documents in Exhibit âNCP-2â purported to evidence such practice.

They belong to different projectsat different locations and for different times.  There is no connection between these documents and they do not even begin to evidencesuch practice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Tam has apparently found and exhibited in Exhibit âTYC-2â one complete set of quotation, completion note and invoice dated 2004from Make Worth Electronic Eng Ltd in relation to the dismantling of the closed circuit television system at âé¦æ¸¯åè§å ¡å£è¡57-59èæ¡å¯¶æ´æ¨â.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In my view, Exhibit âTYC-2â must be looked at in its proper context.  According to Ng, some 30 buildings are under the managementof D at all material times.  One can observe from Exhibit âNCP-2â produced by Ng that in managing these buildings, D engagedcontractors to do all sorts of work, ranging from changing a 20-tonne water condensation tower to changing a door lock.  Given Dâsalleged standard practice in requiring its contractors/suppliers to invariably provide a quotation, completion form/delivery noteand invoice, one would expect D to be able to come up with many complete sets of documents easily.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> P took out the present application on 10<sup>th</sup> February 2004.  Ng filed his first affirmation in opposition on 27<sup>th</sup> February 2004 exhibiting âNCP-2â.  Directions were given on 1<sup>st</sup> March 2004 for P to file an affirmation in reply and this application for summary judgment was set down for argument.  Originally,this application was scheduled to be argued on 31<sup>st</sup> May 2005.  On 26<sup>th</sup> May 2005, however, D applied for and was granted leave to file further affirmation(s) and the hearing date of 31<sup>st</sup> May 2005 was vacated.  Not until 28<sup>th</sup> July 2005 did Ng filed his second affirmation in opposition and Tam filed his affirmation in opposition exhibiting âTYC-2â. It has apparently taken D more than a year to come up with just one complete set of documents purporting to evidence something whichD alleges to be a standard practice over the years and known to all staff!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The fact that D can only produce one single complete set of documents  (i.e. a complete set of quotation, completion form/deliverynote and invoice) in Exhibit âTYC-2â must also be contrasted with the fact that D has not produced the same (i.e. a completeset) for the transactions revealed in Exhibit âNCP-2â as well as those invoices of P exhibited in âWWL-16â.  Tam has admittedin his affirmation that the work covered by the invoices exhibited in âWWL-16â had indeed been properly authorized and actuallyrendered by P.  Where are the corresponding complete set of documents for these transactions?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In the premises, I find Dâs alleged standard practice to be incredible.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Both Ng and Tam deposed to in their affirmation that D did not have notice or possession of the Disputed Invoices or the MaintenanceContract until after the present action was commenced.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Once stripped of its special context of purported variance with Dâs standard practice, Dâs allegation that it did not have noticeor possession of the Disputed Invoices or the Management Contract until after the present action becomes mere assertion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In any event, Dâs above contention is contradicted by Dâs then Assistant Operation Manager (i.e. Cheung), who has confirmed thathe had indeed signed the Maintenance Contract and submitted the Disputed Invoices to Dâs Accounts Department.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Given Cheungâs most damaging evidence, D has no choice but to seek to discredit him.  However, what D can come up with in termsof evidence and argument is just the following:</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">a.				</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Cheung is said 			to have close association with Ps.  First, Cheung has filed an 			affirmation in support of Psâ present application. Secondly, 			Cheung is the referee of a person employed by D whose address is the 			same as that of the 1<sup>st</sup>-named Plaintiff.  Thirdly, Cheung is said to be the brother-in-law of one of the Ps.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">b.				</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">It is said that 			Psâ business dwindled drastically from 60-odd jobs in 3 months to 6 			jobs in 2 months since Cheung left Dâsemploy.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">c.				</td>			<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">It is said that 			Cheung left Dâs employ in acrimonious circumstances.</td>			</tr>		</table>	</blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In my view, it is neither here nor there that Cheung has filed an affirmation in support of Psâ present application.  D admitsthat Cheung had been its Assistant Operation Manager.  It could very well be Cheungâs desire to tell the truth which prompted himto make the affirmation for Ps.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> I also find it not surprising that Cheung would refer someone (even someone residing with 1<sup>st</sup>-named Plaintiff) to work for D.  After all, Cheung had been Dâs Assistant Operation Manager and Cheung apparently had dealingswith Ps in discharge of his duties as confirmed by the undisputed invoices in âWWL-16â!  This does not reflect badly on Cheungâscharacter.  Quite to the contract, the fact that the person recommended by Cheung has been employed by D should reflect positivelyon Cheung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Cheung has denied that he is the brother-in-law of Ps.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is inaccurate for D to say that Psâ business have dwindled drastically after Cheung left Dâs employ is also insignificant. To start with, it is not known how significant is Psâ business with D in relation to Psâ overall business.  What D can say atthe most from the evidence is that Ps have not engaged the services of Ps as frequently as it used to be after Cheung left Dâsemployment.  But this is quite normal after a change of personnel.  What, perhaps, is more significant is that Cheungâs successor,Leung Wing Pong, has continued to use Psâ service (see Bundle of Exhibits pp.47, 48, 50 and 51).  D has certainly not challengedthe credibility of Leung as well!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Lastly, the only incident that D can come up with to support its allegation that Cheung left Dâs employ in acrimonious circumstancesis that Ng and Tam were dissatisfied with the way Cheung handled the dismissal of a staff who had embezzled $45,000.  It is not explainedwhy it was dissatisfactory and there is certainly no allegation of any dishonorable conduct on the part of Cheung.  Other than this,Ng and Tam can only showered wild accusations against Cheung without factual support.  Significantly, it is not Dâs case that Cheungwas fired!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> All in all, I find Dâs challenge to Cheungâs credibility incredible!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> It is trite law that mere assertion in an affidavit of a given situation does not, <i>ipso facto</i>, provide leave to defend, since the defendant must satisfy the court that he has a fair or reasonable probability of showing a realor bona fide defence (see Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004, para.14/4/9).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(A2)            Signing and stamping of the Disputed Invoices at variance with Dâs standard practice?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Ng observes in his affirmation that most of the Disputed Invoices were signed by Cheung and chopped with the company chop of D andthat was totally inconsistent with the common practice of D.  He says it is inconceivable that Dâs staff would sign and put thecompany chop on a contractorâs invoice without stating any reason.  He further says it is not clear whether the signature and thechop meant to signify Cheungâs acknowledgment of receipt of the Disputed Invoices only, or amounted to acceptance of the liabilityto pay.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> If Ng were correct about such common practice, one would expect to see many examples of documents signed by Dâs staff and affixedwith Dâs chop with the reason for signing and chopping stated thereon.  However, when one turns to the many documentary exhibitsin this case, one does not observe such a practice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Perhaps, the only document which may be said to be close to Ngâs alleged practice is a letter dated 6<sup>th</sup> October 1999 from Hitachi Elevator Engineering Co (HK) Ltd in relation to the replacement of landing door sill of a lift at BelgianBank Building (at Bundle of Exhibits p.171).   At the location of the signature and Dâs chop, there is the following statement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âConfirmed by:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><u>(Signed)                   (Dâs chop)</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">For and on behalf of OWNER</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Authorized Signature &amp; Chopâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Strictly speaking, the above document does not in fact evidence the alleged practice.  The statement âFor and on behalf of OWNERâhas apparently been typewritten on the letter by the other party who drafted the letter for Dâs staffâs signature and chop.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> In my view, it would be of more significance if there is evidence of Dâs staff actually stating the reason for signing and affixingDâs chop on a document.  However, D has produced no such evidence.  Quite to the contrary, the other exhibits produced by D actuallypoints the other way!</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">a.</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the invoice 				dated 20<sup>th</sup> May 2003 and numbered TI-1006/2003 (at Bundle of Exhibits p.128), the invoice dated 20<sup>th</sup> April 2003 and numbered TI-1003/2003 (at Bundle of Exhibits p.129) and the invoice dated 20<sup>th</sup> May 2003 and numbered TCI-1001/2003 (at Bundle of Exhibits p.149) have all been signed by Cheung without stating any reason thereon.

I have already discussed Dâs challenge to Cheungâs credibilityhereinabove.  Cheungâs evidence is also confirmed by the fact that Cheungâs successor (i.e. Leung Wing Pong) has also signedand affixed Dâs chop on similar invoices of P and without stating anything (see Bundle of Exhibits pp.47, 48, 50 and 51).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(A3)     Cheung had no authority to enter into contracts with Ps on Dâs behalf?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> It is common ground that Cheung was the Assistant Operation Manager of D at the time of the Disputed Invoices and the MaintenanceContract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Both Tam and Ng contend that it has been the open policy of D that only management staff of director level or above have the authorityto enter into contracts on behalf of D with contractors for repairs, maintenance or cleaning works or for the supply of goods andmaterials in respect of those buildings under Dâs management.  As such, Cheung had no authority to enter into contracts with contractors.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In my view, Tamâs and Ngâs contention is not consistent with the invoices exhibited in Exhibit âWWL-16â.  According to Ps,those invoices cover work done by Ps in relation to buildings managed by D.  Three things can be observed from these invoices.  First,these invoices cover the period between April and August 2003, and the Disputed Invoices cover the same period.  Secondly, some ofthe buildings covered by these invoices, namely, Belgian Bank Building, Lilac Court, Mongkok Harbour Centre, Yun Kei Commercial Building,Nan Sang Building, are also covered by the Disputed Invoices.  Thirdly, the nature of the works done under these invoices are similarto that of the Disputed Invoices.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Tam has only confirmed that the work covered by the invoices exhibited in Exhibit âWWL-16â had been properly authorized.  Noparticulars, however, have been given as to how they were authorized and the identity of the one (amongst the management staff ofD and of director level) who actually authorized those works!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In fact, Dâs case in this regard is also not supported by those invoices in the Disputed Invoices signed and chopped by Cheungâssuccessor (i.e. Leung Wing Pong) (see Bundle of Exhibits pp.47, 48, 50 and 51).  Leung has apparently continued to engage Psâ serviceafter Cheung has left the employment of D.  It is not Dâs case that Leung has also left Dâs employment.  Yet, there is no evidencefrom Leung confirming that he had indeed obtained authorization from management staff of D and of director level for those works.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Cheung has filed an affirmation to confirm that he had the authority to entered into the contracts covered by the Disputed Invoices. Again, reference is made to the discussion above concerning Dâs challenge to Cheungâs credibility. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> All in all, I find this aspect of Dâs case a mere assertion at the most.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(B)  Whether the Disputed Invoices display fundamental weaknesses or inconsistencies?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Ms. Sit has tried very hard in her submission to challenge Psâ case by pointing at alleged weaknesses or inconsistencies in theDisputed Invoices.  She submits that if at the end of the day the court has doubt as to the validity of Psâ case, the correct approachis to give unconditional leave to defend so that all the doubts can be ventilated at trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> First, she submits that if the parties had indeed entered into the Maintenance Contract, it would be inconceivable for Ps to separatelycharge and D to pay for the works covered by Invoices TI-1019/2003, TI-1037/2003, TI-1038/2003, TI-1032/2003 and TI-1040/2003, whichshould have been within the scope of the Maintenance Contract.  Having compared the nature of the works covered by these invoices(as described in the invoices) and the scope of work covered by the Maintenance Contract (see Bundle of Exhibits pp.10-12), I amnot satisfied that they relate to the same work!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Secondly, she complains that Ps have purported to charge D for works within the scope of the Maintenance Contract by Invoices TI-1017/2003,TI-1018/2003, TI-1020/2003, TI-1024/2003, TI-1028/2003, TI-1029/2003, TI-1031/2003, TI-1036/2003, TI-1059/2003 and TI-1060/2003 inthe Disputed Invoices.  A closer look at the description in these invoices reveals that the work covered is not in fact within thescope of the Maintenance Contract!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Thirdly, she complains that Ps have double-charged D on many occasions.  Having compared the description of work between InvoicesTI-1008/2003 and TI-1006/2003 and between Invoices TI-1051/2003 and TI-1059/2003 carefully, I do not agree that there is any duplication.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> What Ms. Sin has succeeded in this regard, perhaps, is to identify a possible duplication in Invoice TI-1029/2003 dated 17<sup>th</sup> June 2003 and Invoice TI-1036/2003 dated 21<sup>st</sup> June 2003.  Both invoices were for the same description of work and for the same amount of $8,500 and the invoices were dated 4 daysapart.  In this regard, Mr. Hung (counsel for Ps) concedes that D should be entitled to unconditional leave to defend to the extentof this $8,500.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Fourthly, Ms. Sit has tried to cast doubt on the authenticity of the Disputed Invoices by reason of the way they were numbered. She submits that the haphazard way in which Ps appear to have issued the invoices indicates that they were not issued in respectof work actually done!  She has apparently based her argument on the assumption that Ps would issue invoices immediately upon completionof the work involved.  However, there is simply nothing in the evidence to ground such an assumption!</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Lastly, Ms. Sit observes that Invoices TI-1079/2003 and TI-1085/2003 of the Disputed Invoices are neither signed nor stamped.  Bethat as it may, Cheung (Dâs former Assistant Operation Manager) has already confirmed in his affirmation and by means of ExhibitâWWL-4â that such work had been done and the invoices received by him and he, in turn, submitted them to Dâs Accounts Department. D has not succeeded in challenging Cheungâs credibility and I find this observation, whilst correctly made, of no significance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>(C) Whether the work had been done and the material been supplied?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Ultimately, it is Dâs case that the work alleged done and the material alleged supplied under the Disputed Invoices and/or theMaintenance Contract have not in fact been done or supplied. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> In answering Dâs above allegation, Ps and Cheung have both deposed at length as to how such work was done and such material supplied.
