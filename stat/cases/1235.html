Introduction</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a> This slander action was commenced by the Plaintiff against the Defendant in respect of the Defendantâs alleged utterances madeduring a regular meeting of the committee members of Wong Wan Hing Tong Clansmen Association Limited (é»ç°æ¶å å®è¦ªææéå¬å¸)(âthe Association Limitedâ).  It was held on 22<sup>nd</sup> August 2004 (âthe Meetingâ).  There are 21 committee members or members of the Association Limited including the Plaintiff andthe Defendant who attended the Meeting at the registered office at 2/F, 13 Fu Hing Street, Sheung Shui, New Territories.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2</a>. The Plaintiff alleged that during the Meeting, the Defendant proposed to extend the period of service of a committee member from2 years to 3 years.  The Plaintiff responded that such proposal should be considered in the annual general meeting, not in the committeemeeting. The Defendant then pointed at him and said loudly: âYou!  Donât kick a fuss!  Youâve defalcated lands and propertyof Fuk Tin (or Fu Tian) villagers, and I still havenât got you to cough up!â âä½ å! åå¥½åå±ååå! ä½ ä¾µååç¦ç°æäººå²åå°è²¡ç¢,æé½æªåä½ è¨å!â(âThe Wordsâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> It is more desirable to set out the background of the Association Limited first.  The Association Limited was incorporated in 1982. It was established for the objects of, inter alia, fostering the fraternity and unity of the clansman of Wongâs family of Fu Tianvillage, the Peoplesâ Republic of China (ç¦ç°æ) who have moved to Hong Kong or return from overseas.  Clansman from Shenzhenalso paid regular visits to the Association Limited.  The objectives of the Association Limited are set out in the Memorandum andArticles of the Association.  Paragraph 4 of the Articles of Association states: âAll persons, irrespective of creed, sex, or nativebelonging to a âWongâ family, of not less than 18 years of age, of good conduct and behaviour, who are willing to observe therules and regulations of the Association shall be eligible for admission as members of the Association.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> At the relevant time in 2004, there were more than 3000 members in the Association.  Some of them resided in Hong Kong and some ofthem resided in Fu Tian, Shenzhen.  Its board of directors consisted of 23 directors elected by its members.  The parties also describeddirectors as committee members (çäº).  A committee member may be elected as the chairman of the committee members (çäºé·). Senior committee members may be elected as the President (æé·).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant were senior committee members of the Association Limited.  The Plaintiff was a Honourary orLife President (æ°¸é æé·).  The Meeting was chaired by the Defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The main issue for determination at trial is whether the Defendant did utter the Words towards the Plaintiff during the Meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">B.  PLAINTIFFâS CASE</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> It is the Plaintiff's case that the Defendant did utter the Words during the Meeting.  In their natural and ordinary meanings, theWords are defamatory and were understood to mean that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) the Plaintiff has acted dishonestly defalcating the land(s) owned by the villagers of Fu Tian Village, Shenzhen;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) the Plaintiff was a corrupt person who engaged in defalcation activities;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) the Plaintiff should be disqualified as a member of the Association Limited as his dishonest act would have damaged the reputationof the Association Limited.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Plaintiff avers the falsity of the Words as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) the Plaintiff has never acted dishonestly defalcating the land(s) owned by the villagers of Fu Tian Village Shenzhen and shouldnot be disqualified as a member of the Association Limited;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) the Plaintiff has never been a corrupt person who engaged in defalcating activities.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The Plaintiff avers the malice on the part of the Defendant as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) in the Meeting, the said defamatory words might not be true nor were the same conclusive or found regularly and the whole matterin relation to the slander needed further investigation;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) while the Defendant had full knowledge and/or ought to have full knowledge as to the matter pleaded in sub-paragraph (1) above,the Defendant expressed the said defamatory words;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) the Defendant expressed the said defamatory words knowing them to be false, or recklessly, not caring whether they were true andfalse and/or with no honest belief that they were true.  In doing so, the Defendant was actuated by the dominant motive of damagingthe Plaintiff and his acting or working as pleaded in paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim, particularly as a member of the executivecommittee and the President of the Association Limited.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Plaintiff says that as a consequence of the Words, he suffered from general damages, including loss of reputation and loss ofrental profits.  He also seeks for aggravated damages.  Counsel for the Plaintiff quantified both heads of damages in the respectivesums of HK$500,000 and HK$300,000.  In respect of the loss of rental profits, the Plaintiff alleged that the Words resulted in, atleast one landlord, Madam Wong Kam Sim, the refusal to renew the lease of Fu Tian Village Ancestor House Square House no.20 (âHouse No.20â) (ç¦ç°æç¥ å å20èå±) after its expiration.  The Plaintiff was therefore unable to sub-lease the said propertyand suffered loss of monthly profits estimated at HK$30,000 as a result.  The Plaintiff further seeks for aggravated damages on theground that the Defendant failed to tender apology, withdraw, clarify or purge the Words.</p>    <p class="heading">C.  DEFENCE CASE</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The Defendant denied having uttered those words, if the Defendant was found to have uttered the Words, it was not defamatory.  Counselfor the Defendant conceded on 1<sup>st</sup> day of the trial that those words are defamatory but their stance remained that the Defendant did not utter the Words.  Secondly,the Words were not referred to or not capable of referring to the Plaintiff.  Thirdly, the Words were said during the occasion coveredby qualified privilege.  The Defendant was under the duty to raise enquiry for the rental income allegedly donated to the AssociationLimited.  Fourthly, the Defendant relied on the defence of fair comment on the ground that it is a matter of public interest to raisethe said enquiry.  Fifthly, the Defendant pleaded âjustificationâ and contended that the Words are substantially true in nature. Sixthly, although âmaliceâ may defeat the defence of qualified privilege and fair comment, the Plaintiff was unable to proveâmaliceâ.  Seventhly, the Defendant contended that the Plaintiff has not suffered any loss or damages nor the Plaintiff mitigatedhis loss and damage. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In so far as the defence of qualified privilege is concerned, the Defendant gave the particulars as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) there was a village committee known as Fu Tian Villagersâ Committee, Fu Tian District, Shenzhen (æ·±å³å¸ç¦ç°åç¦ç°ææ°å§å¡æ)(âthe Shenzhen Committeeâ) (æå§æ). The said Committee was later incorporated in Shenzhen known as Shenzhen Futian HuanqingIndustrial Co. Ltd (ç¦ç°ç°æ¶å¯¦æ¥­è¡ä»½æéå¬å¸) (âthe Shenzhen Companyâ). </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) the Association Limited was founded for âthe reunion of the villagers of Fu Tian village who have already moved to Hong Kongâ;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) On 1<sup>st</sup> June 2003, during a meeting of the Association Limited of which the Plaintiff was absent, the Defendant first knew from Mr. HuangWei Guang (DW3), the chairman of the Shenzhen Company that since early 1980âs, the Shenzhen Committee or the Shenzhen Company allegedlyresolved to donate the rental income accrued to the lands in lots 497 and 508 in DD 99 in Lok Ma Chau to the Association Limitedto meet its expenses.  However, no rental income was reportedly paid to the Association Limited since then.

If a personâs dominant motivewas not to perform this duty or protect this interest, he was outside the ambit of that defence.

Evidence Analysis</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In respect of the central issue as to whether the Defendant uttered the Words.  It is apparent that those witnesses who attendedthe Meeting had different versions.  The Plaintiff and PW2 had one version while the Defendant, DW4 to DW6 had another version.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> I prefer and accept the Plaintiffâs material evidence on the central issue and subsidiary issues in so far as it conflicts withthe defence case or the evidence of defence witnesses.  The Plaintiff gave evidence in a straightforward and frank manner, and washardly challenged or shaken under cross-examination. In contrast, the Defendant gave evidence in an extremely evasive manner.  Heeither said that he did not know how to answer or gave long and convoluted answers to simple questions.  Moreover, there is no gainsayingthat on some essential matters, his evidence changed and is out of common sense and logic.  I also accept the evidence of PW2 andPW3 and reject the evidence of other defence witnesses unless there is no conflict between the parties.  They are credible and reliable. Their answers are spontaneous and unbiased.  I shall highlight the salient points as follows.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In respect of the background leading to the Words, the Plaintiffâs version was that when he and another President objected to theDefendantâs suggestion to change the period of service of a committee member from 2 years to 3 years, the Defendant became angryand uttered the Words. The Defendantâs version was that when the Defendant queried the Plaintiff on the whereabouts of the rentalincome, the Plaintiff did not respond to the query but the Plaintiffâs son yelled on the issue of his grandmotherâs photograph.He did not utter the Words.  In relation to what was discussed in the Meeting, the copy of the minute was produced.  None of theparties called the person who recorded the minutes.  None of them challenged the contents except what the Defendant said they hadanother copy with additional words such as the time when the meeting ended.  The alleged additional words are not material.  Butthe undisputed part showed that the issue of rental income was not the agenda nor was it recorded as being discussed in the Meeting. This is contrary to the Defendantâs version and his witnessesâ versions. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Upon being put to the gist of the following versions, the Defendant gave evidence in the following manner:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) Counsel for the Plaintiff asked him along the line that one had to serve as a committee member for a period before he could beelected to be a President.  The President such as the Plaintiff had to be a respectable person among the Association.  In other words,it was not easy to become a President.  He said that he did not understand the question. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) When he was referred to the minute of the meeting held on 1<sup>st</sup> June 2003, it was put to him that DW3, the chairman of the Shenzhen Company did not say that the Plaintiff defalcated lands of FuTian villagers, what DW3 said that the rental income could be used to meet the Associationâs expenses.  The Defendant said thathe did not recall so much.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) The Defendant allegedly first knew of the issue of rental income in the meeting on 1<sup>st</sup> June 2003 and he just exercised his duty to ask the Defendant on the issue of rental income on 22<sup>nd</sup> June 2004.  It is admitted that in between the said two meetings, there were 9 other meetings that the Defendant was present, asto why he did not raise the same issue during the 9 meetings, he offered no explanation.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4) When the minute of the meeting on 1<sup>st</sup> June 2003 transpires that a date shall be fixed and the issue of rental income should be brought back to the native village for discussion,he was asked on what is his understanding of âbrought back to the native village for discussionâ (ææ¥åéåè¨è«), theDefendant at first said that he disagreed to it.  Same question was repeated and he asked what is meant by âback to the nativevillageâ.  Same question was repeated again then he answered it was meant by âback to Fu Tian Village to discuss.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5) When he was referred to his pleading on the defence of justification, especially had he uttered the Words, what are grounds inholding that belief, he repeated for more than 5 times that he could not answer as to the grounds in support of the Words.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(6) After the meeting, when he was in Fu Tian, Shenzhen, he heard villagers talking about the Plaintiffâs defalcating of the villagersâland, he was asked as to whether he attempted to clarify for the Plaintiff, he repeatedly said that he could not answer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(7) When he was asked as to whether he had the right or was justified to utter the Words, at first he refused to answer and laterhe said that he could not answer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(8) When he was asked to confirm the contents in his answers to the further and better particulars were correct, he said that he couldnot answer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(9) Except the place for meeting, the Association did not own any land, the Defendant disagreed.  When the question was repeated,he said that he could not answer.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I note that the Plaintiff was cross-examined on the alleged breach of the tenancy agreement between the Shenzhen Company and himby either sub-leasing the property to another or permitted the premises be used as a restaurant. He has given evidence that approvalwas granted to those who operated the restaurant or the landlord knew about that. This was supported by DW3âs evidence that despitethey knew about the alleged breach, they just elected not to terminate the lease until the expiry of the leases.  I do not find thisalleged breach of the leases is sufficient to outweigh my above conclusion on the question of credibility.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> In respect of DW2âs evidence, the Defendantâs pleadings and DW2âs own evidence suggested that in 1984, he completed all thenecessary documents in respect of the ownership of the land lot no. 497 in DD 99.  Then he arranged the cultivation and leasing ofthe land for generating income.  This is contrary to the undisputed document that as early as in 1898, Wong Kam Pok Tso was the ownerof the land with whom the Plaintiff was the registered manager since 1987.  There was no change of the ownership ever since the BlockCrown Lease.  DW2 produced not even a single document about the ownership of the land when he said that he came to Hong Kong to handlethe ownership of the land in early 1980âs.  He spoke louder than the document.  He is incredible. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> In respect of DW3âs evidence, he was referred to the documents  dated 16<sup>th</sup> September 2005 and 19<sup>th</sup> October 2009 issued by the Shenzhen Committee that the Defendant relied very much on.  It is unknown which person of the Committeeissued those documents.  The second document contains the allegations that the Defendant now contended for, including the allegationthat with the support of the Hong Kong Government, Fu Tian Village, through DW2, got back the land in lot 497 in DD 99 in 1980âs. The Plaintiff treated the land as if he owned it.  His stance in Court totally departed from the contents of this letter as revealedduring cross-examination, bearing in mind he was the officer bearer of the Shenzhen Committee and the Shenzhen Company.  Simply put,he agreed that he did not accuse the Plaintiff for defalcating the lands of his villagers.  He agreed that there was no evidenceto accuse the Plaintiff for defalcating the lands of his villagers.  He said that the document was issued by the office but he didnot know which person issued it.  In Court, he tried to be distant himself off from that document.  I reject his evidence unlessthere is no conflict with the Plaintiffâs version.  I particularly reject his allegation that the lands in questions were ownedby the Shenzhen Committee or the Shenzhen Company.  He relied on the hearsay evidence of DW2.  DW2 produced no document to supporthis bare assertion of the ownership despite he said that he came to Hong Kong in 1980âs to complete the procedure of the ownershipwith the support of the Hong Kong Government.  However, I placed weight on his current stance in Court, that he did not accuse thePlaintiff for defalcating the lands of his villagers.  He agreed that there was no evidence to accuse the Plaintiff for defalcatingthe lands of his villagers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> In respect of DW4âs evidence, he said that the Defendant raised the issue of rental income to the Plaintiff during the Meeting,the issue of rental income was not recorded in the minutes as the agenda or the topic being discussed, he agreed to that but offeredno explanation.  I also note that his statement was dated 27<sup>th</sup> October 2009.  That means he had to recall an episode happened 5 years ago.  There was no record of his own to refresh his memory. His evidence is unreliable.  Further, he said that several months after the Meeting, the Defendant told him that he received a letterfrom the Plaintiffâs solicitors about the alleged defamation.  This is in direct conflict with the Defendantâs version that henever received the letter before action.  Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the witness might mix up the Writ with the letterbefore action.  I do not agree.  What the witness said was several months after the Meeting the Defendant told him about the receiptof solicitorâs letter, and at the time, the Writ was not in existence.  The Writ was issued on 10<sup>th</sup> August 2005, about 12 months after Meeting.  After all, despite attempts, Counsel for the Defendant failed to establish that thewitness mistakenly treated 12 months as âseveral monthsâ.  This part of DW4âs evidence fortified my findings on the credibilityof the Defendantâs version.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> In respect of DW5âs evidence, his evidence is unreliable.  He did not witness the whole incident and he left while the Plaintiffand the Defendant were still exchanging angry words.  He gave imprecise answers as to whether the issue of rental income was raised.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> In respect of DW6âs evidence, I also note that his statement was dated 27<sup>th</sup> October 2009.  Likewise, that means he had to recall an episode happened 5 years ago.  There was no record of his own to refreshhis memory.  Further, he said that he once signed a witness statement prepared by the Defendantâs previous solicitors.  But infact, there was only one prepared by the Defendantâs current solicitors.  Moreover, contrary to the version of other defence witnesses,he said that the Plaintiff and the Defendant did not quarrel.  His evidence is unreliable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i>H1.  FINDINGS</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Given my conclusions on the witnessesâ relevant evidence, I make the following findings on the main issues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">The Defendant did utter the Words during the Meeting.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>In so far as necessary, I also make the following findings on the subsidiary issues:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) As conceded by the Counsel for the Defendant, the Words were defamatory.  I also found that the Words were understood to meanthat the Plaintiff has acted dishonestly defalcating the land(s) owned by the villagers of Fu Tian Village, Shenzhen and the Plaintiffwas a corrupt person who engaged in defalcation activities;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) The falsity of the Words are that the Plaintiff has not acted dishonestly defalcating the land(s) owned by the villagers of FuTian Village Shenzhen nor was he a corrupt person who engaged in defalcating activities.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) I also accepted the Plaintiffâs evidence in relation to the conduct of the Defendant when he uttered the Words, especially heused his right index finger pointing to the Plaintiff and uttered the Words loudly.  Those words were referred to the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4) It is more convenient for me to make findings on âmaliceâ first before I deal with the defence of qualified privilege andfair comment.  Because âmaliceâ defeats the defence of qualified privilege and fair comment.  But I also remind myself that malicemay carry different meanings in the said two defences.  Since I found that the Defendant did not raise the issue of rental incomeduring the Meeting that would have otherwise caused me to consider whether he was under the duty to raise it.  For completeness sake,take the defence case to the highest, the Defendant did raise the issue of rental income during the Meeting and that he was underthe duty to raise the issue, I need to consider two questions as suggested by Lord Nicholls in Chengâs judgment:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âJuries could be instructed with regard to: (a) fair comment, that the defence was defeated by proof that the defendant did notgenuinely believe the opinion he expressed; and (b) qualified privilege, that the defence was defeated by proof that the defendantused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the occasion was privileged.â </i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5) The evidence overwhelmingly established that the Defendant was guilty of malice in both senses.  In respect of malice in the contextof fair comment, to begin with, the Defendant did not honestly or genuinely believe the wholly untrue statements of the Words.  Thelogical progression is this.  The Defendant relied on DW2âs evidence.  But DW2 said so much about the completion of the procedureof the ownership of the land as early as in 1980âs and he did not produce a single document to support the bare assertion at allmaterial times.  The Defendant could not have relied on a bare assertion in respect of the question of land ownership. The Defendantalso relied on DW3âs evidence.  However, DW3 even tried to be distant himself off a libelous document dated 19<sup>th</sup> October 2009 issued by the Shenzhen Committee.  In short, as at the date of the Meeting on 22<sup>nd</sup> August 2004 or even thereafter, except bare assertion, there was no single piece of evidence to substantiate the ownership of thelands by the Shenzhen Committee or by the Shenzhen Company, let alone the allegations on the issue of rent or the Plaintiffâs defalcationof lands.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(6) Further, on the question of fair comment, I do not see how the bare assertion on the ownership of the lands by the Shenzhen Committeeor the Shenzhen Company, a matter of private interest would become a public interest, so as to afford him the defence of fair comment.Even if it concerns the public interest, the finding on malice defeats the defence of fair comment.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(7) In respect of malice in the context of qualified privilege, the Defendant uttered the Words with the sole or dominant, impropermotive of injuring the Plaintiff and aired his grudges and personal animosity towards the Plaintiff, after the Defendant perceivedthe Plaintiff being obstructive to extend the period of service of a committee from 2 year to 3 years, whether the Defendant hasany interest in such a proposed extension or not.He used the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the occasion wasprivileged (see <i>Chengâs case cited above and Lee Ching v Lau May Ming [2007] 3 HLRD 623</i>).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(8) Moreover, on the question of justification, the Defendant advanced the defence of justification knowing that it was unsustainable. He was puzzled by his plea of justification when Counsel for the Plaintiff explained his pleadings to him during cross-examination. This transpires that he knew that he could not show the Words were substantially true in nature.  He just put in whatever defencethat may be pleaded without caring whether it can be substantiated.  I found that as at the date of the Meeting, the Defendant knewor ought to have known that the defence of justification was unsustainable.  I say âas at the date of the Meetingâ because ofthe legal commentary cited above:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt is not permitted to rely upon post-publication events in order to establish the existence of reasonable grounds, since (by wayof analogy with fair comment) the issue has to be judged as at the time of publication.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(9) As a result, I do not see how his subsequent efforts to procure the Shenzhen Committee to issue the libelous letter dated 19<sup>th</sup> October 2009 is conducive to the defence of justification.  Worse still, DW3 tried to distant himself off the said document.  Thus,I also found that at the Meeting or any time thereafter and at trial, the Words are unsustainable and uttered with malice.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(10) As a result, in particular my findings on âmaliceâ, the statutory defence in relation to fair comment and justification under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 26</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">27</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a> did not avail the Defendant himself.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(11) In relation to damages, I shall set out my analysis hereunder.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i>H2.  DEFENDANTâS SUBMISSIONS</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> I shall deal with submissions made by Counsel for the Defendant.  To begin with, she submitted that for an action for slander, ifa plaintiff fails prove special damage, it is not actionable unless the words imputing a criminal offence or words calculated todisparage in any office, profession, calling, trade or business; words impute adultery or unchastity to a woman (see <i>Gatley</i> paragraph 5.1).  She submitted that the Words do not impute a criminal offence. She addressed me on what is the meaning of âdefalcatinglandsâ and submitted that at most it amounts to a breach of trust in civil sense.  In my view, the plain reading of the Words imputethat the Plaintiff have embezzled or swallowed up the lands for his own, a kind of dishonest misappropriation of lands of another. I do not agree with her interpretation, especially when I asked her whether there is âdefalcating lands legallyâ (åæ³ä¾µå),she failed to address me further.  In essence, I am of the view that the Words impute criminal offence.  Further, it is actionablewhen I have found at least in relation to House no. 20, the evidence of PW3 suggested that the Words caused the landlord not to renewthe lease to the Plaintiff.  Special damages is thus proved.  The next question is quantum and I shall come to that later.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Thirdly, she took a pleading point and submitted that the Plaintiffâs claim should be dismissed.  She relied on Order 82 Rule 3of the Rules of the District Court to say that the Plaintiff shall not plead malice in the statement of claim and shall leave ituntil filing the Reply after a defendant raises the defence of qualified privilege and fair comment.  Order 82 Rules 3 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âWhere in an action for libel or slander the plaintiff alleges that the defendant maliciously published the words or matters complainedof, he need not in his statement of claim give particulars of the facts on which he relies in support of the allegation of malice,but if the defendant pleads that any of those words or matters are fair comment on a matter of public interest or were publishedon a privileged occasion and the plaintiff intends to allege that the defendant was actuated by express malice, he must serve a replygiving particulars of the facts and matters from which the malice is to be inferred.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The crux of the above rule requires a plaintiff to give particulars on malice.  He needs not give particulars in the statement ofclaim.  But the rule does not prohibit giving particulars of malice in the statement of claim.  Counsel for the Defendant also agreedthat it is trite law that malice defeats the defence of qualified privilege and fair comment, that means once malice is proven asa primary consideration, those defence, even if they are raised, should fail.  I do not see there is anything wrong nor the Defendantwas being prejudiced or embarrassed by the Plaintiffâs early disclosure of the particulars of malice.  She also conceded that thePlaintiffâs pleadings did not embarrass the Defendant as they knew what are the Plaintiffâs allegations to meet. Even if shesaid that she was embarrassed, she could not explain why she has never applied to strike out pleadings that embarrass her.  Afterall, in so far as the pleadings are sufficiently concise and clear and did not take the other party by surprise, as in this case,I do not see any objectionable points that can be taken to prevent the Court from determining the real questions in controversy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><i><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> </i> Regarding the pleading objection, she also cited the case of <i>Omar, Zarina v Chow Yee Ping and Leong Moon Cheong HCA 3699 of 2002.</i>  She submitted that Mr. Justice A. Cheung accepted similar pleading objection and dismissed the plaintiffâs claim.  In that case,there were disputes between ex-Secretary and a new committee of a Co-operative Building Society over the management of the buildingand the manner in conducting certain meetings. The alleged libelous letter was lengthy with sequence of events and evidence to supportwhy the committee needed to set aside questionable resolutions that, if carried out, had the result to benefit the plaintiffâsprivate interest at the expense of the resources of other owners.  A questionnaire was distributed for other owners to express theirviews. In considering a pleading objection, Cheung J quoted the concessions made by the plaintiffâs counsel:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>â[Paragraph 32] Mr. Chiu rightly accepted in final submission that the allegation in the statement of claim that the Defendantsâmaliciously publishedâ the offending words was not sufficient pleading for express malice in the present context.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>[Paragraph 35] In other words, given the concession, and assuming that the Plaintiff is allowed to rely on what has been pleaded insupport of a case of malice in response to the defence of qualified privilegeâ¦ it is not established or is not sufficient to establisha case of malice (in the qualified privilege sense), the Plaintiffâs case must fail.â </i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>[Paragraph 59] It would be quite unfair to the Defendants to allow the Plaintiff to use what she has pleaded in relation to maliceunder fair comment to establish a case of malice under qualified privilege.  Whilst the lack of an honest belief might be an overlappingelement in the two different meanings of malice under the two different defencesâ¦ .</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>[Paragraph 60] This is fatal to the Plaintiffâs action.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> It is apparent that Cheung J upheld the pleading objection because firstly, counsel for the plaintiff conceded that the pleadingis insufficient to establish malice in relation to the defence of qualified privilege.  Secondly, even if it is sufficient, it wasnot established on evidence.  Thirdly, the plaintiff attempted to use the pleaded malice in relation to fair comment to salvage theinsufficient pleaded malice in relation to qualified privilege. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> In the present case, not only there was no such concession made by the Plaintiff, Counsel for the Defendant did not say that particularsof malice as pleaded were insufficient for pleading purpose. Secondly, the malice was established on evidence in this case.  Thirdly,from the partiesâ pleadings, the parties clearly join issues on what were pleaded, including the allegations of malice.  It isapparent that the carefully worded particulars of malice could be used to defeat both the defence of fair comment and qualified privilege. Thus in the Omar case where the plaintiff attempted to use the pleaded malice in relation to fair comment to salvage the insufficientpleaded malice in relation to qualified privilege, which is not case here.  In my view, the ultimate questions are of two fold: whethermalice pleaded in this general sense would cause confusion to the Defendant, hence unfair to him; whether juries would be confused,if in a particular case, malice may bear different meanings in the defence of fair comment and qualified privilege.  The answer tothe 1<sup>st</sup> question is âNoâ because the Defendantâs counsel conceded that she was not embarrassed by what was pleaded by the Plaintiff. The answer to the 2<sup>nd</sup> question is âNoâ too.  This Court is sitting in both the capacity as a trial judge and a jury, so long as I properly remind myselfthat malice might bear different meanings and properly direct myself of the two questions below as suggested by Lord Nicholls inChengâs judgment, there would be no confusion. </p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âJuries could be instructed with regard to: (a) fair comment, that the defence was defeated by proof that the defendant did notgenuinely believe the opinion he expressed; and (b) qualified privilege, that the defence was defeated by proof that the defendantused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the occasion was privileged.â </i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> I must add that each case depends on its own facts.  Words of slander and libel vary much.  Even similar words may carry differentmeanings in different context.  What the Court of Final Appeal concerns in Chengâs judgment, is not only the constitutionally guaranteedfreedom of speech, hence a more generous approach on the right of fair comment, but the Court also envisaged the juries might beconfused by the concept of malice in relation to different defences. After suggested the above two questions for jury, Lord Nichollswith the endorsement of the bench, concluded that the Trial Judgeâs summing-up on malice was fatally flawed and a new trial wasordered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> In brief, although her argument is an attractive one, I am not prepared to accept it. The technical objection must fail too. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> She has made other submissions and cited other authorities that were not mentioned here.  I am of the view that they either do nothold water, they are irrelevant or the facts are materially different from the present case or they do not carry the legal propositionsas suggested by her. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i>I.</i> <i>DAMAGES</i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>Quantum of damages and aggravated damages</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Counsel for the Plaintiff quantified the general damages and aggravated damages in the sums of HK$500,000 and HK$300,000 respectivelywhile Counsel for the Defendant said at most the respective sums of HK$10,000 and HK$20,000 should be awarded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The quantum of damages to be awarded shall depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.

Nonetheless, at trial, the Defendant attempted to rely on a libelous letter issued by Shenzhen Committee or ShenzhenCompany.  That made the facts of this case more serious in the sense that as at the trial, there was no retraction from the conduct. The Defendant procured the Words be put into a permanent form that the Defendant relied on it at trial.  Anyone in the office ofthe Shenzhen Committee or the Shenzhen Company can be accessed to the document and the Words were spread across the border.  As admittedby the Defendant, after the Meeting, he went to Shenzhen to inform DW3 of what happened during the Meeting.  DW3 was the officerbearer of the Shenzhen Committee and the Shenzhen Company.  Before the trial, the Defendant procured the Shenzhen Committee to issuethe libelous letter that DW3 tried to distant himself off the letter at trial.  Further, the Defendant also admitted that when hewas in Fu Tian Village, Shenzhen, he heard about the villagers talking about defalcating the villagerâs land.  He did not participatein the chat nor did he seek to clarify for the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Besides, the Plaintiff has been serving for the Association Limited since it was established for about 28 years continuously up tothe date of the trial.  The Defendant defamed the Plaintiff in front of about 20 committee members.  Through the Defendantâs channel,the Words touched down in Shenzhen that resulted in a libelous letter issued by the Shenzhen Committee, a committee representingat least a few thousand villagers.  While the main objective of the Association Limited is for the fostering of the fraternity ofthe clansmen of Wongs, and the Plaintiff has been endeavouring to promote the same, the substance of the defamatory words broughtthe Plaintiff to the most unwanted hatred within Wongâs clansmen.  The Plaintiff suffered of loss of confidence, dignity and reputationamong his clansmen.  He also enjoys a high degree of reputation and social recognition similar to the plaintiffs in <i>Chan Iu Seng</i> case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I do not intend to award damages in respect of the loss of rental profits that the Plaintiff sustained in respect of House No. 20.For the rest the 3 landlords who allegedly refused to renew the leases because of the Words, they were not proved. In my view, havingdrawn the analogy with the cases cited above, it seems that an award to restore the reputation is more suitable.  In brief, I cometo the view that an award of HK$100,000 will restore the reputation of the Plaintiff in the present case, so far as money can do.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Aggravated damages</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> The Plaintiff also seeks for aggravated damages on the ground that the Plaintiff had already asked the Defendant to mend his misdeed,through the help of the clansman before the Plaintiff's solicitors' pre-action letter was issued.  The Defendant was given sufficienttime and opportunity to apologize before the writ was issued in August 2005 or thereafter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> However, the Defendant, through his counsel, pleaded all possible defences including justification at trial.
