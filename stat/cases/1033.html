Action No.A6690 of 1987. It is brought under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Practitioners Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/159">Cap.159</a>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff in the action is Richardson Greenshields of Canada (Pacific) Limited which is a subsidiary of Richardson Greenshieldsof Canada Limited a Canadian firm of brokers. The defendant is Mr. Tse Yim and the plaintiff claims a sum in the region of HK$65million with interest which they say is due and owing to them by the defendant after they had liquidated his share margin accountby selling the shares to another customer of the plaintiff, Mr. Li Ka Shing.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> I am indebted to Miss Susan Kwan, who appears on behalf of the Bar Association, in opposition to this application, for a helpfulsummary of the contents of what has been called "the Fresh Defence and counterclaim" in the action filed by the defendant on 22ndNovember 1990. I mention here that the Law Society, although served with notice of the application, is not represented before metoday and I take it that they take no stand in the matter.  The Attorney General is represented by Mr. William Marshall, Q.C. whohas taken a neutral stand although he has made a number of helpful observations in his efforts to assist the Court in reaching itsdecision.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> I summarise the Counterclaim. It is pleaded that on 16th December 1986 a customer trading agreement was entered into between theplaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff was to open and operate a margin account for the defendant. Express and/or implied termsof the agreement are set out and the plaintiff is alleged to have been the defendant's agent, thus owing him fiduciary duties. Shareswere deposited by the defendant with the plaintiff as security for operating the margin account as shown in Schedule A.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The plaintiff is averred to have approached the defendant on 20th October 1987 to dispose of shares 6 days later following the stockmarket crash. It is said that the defendant refused, and that he denied and disputed that the margin account had fallen below margin.It is then pleaded that the defendant did not authorise the transactions of the sale and purchase of shares allegedly carried outby the plaintiff on his behalf on 19th October 1987 as set out in two further Schedules (B &amp; C), and further that the transactionscarried out on that date were not in compliance with rule 536 of the Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in that the plaintiffdid not deliver to the defendant, within 7 days, duly stamped contract notes recording the relevant transactions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The pleading goes on to aver that there were discussions on 22nd October 1987 between the plaintiff and the defendant about the latter'soutstanding indebtedness, followed by a letter from the plaintiff's solicitors. A deadline was imposed for the payment of part ofthe indebtedness. The deadline was 26th October 1987. The letter said that if the deadline was not met the plaintiff would be leftwith no alternative but to liquidate the defendant's account without further notice. A letter from the plaintiff dated 26th October1967 and addressed to the defendant is mentioned in which it was stated that the plaintiff intended to sell the defendant's sharessince no funds had been received. The defendant alleges that the relevant letter provided him with insufficient particulars and didnot give him reasonable notice or adequate opportunity to make good the deficiency.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It is then pleaded that there were sales by the plaintiff of the defendant's shares in the market as set out in Schedule D on 26thand 27th October 1987. These sales are alleged to have been in breach of the terms of the customer trading agreement entered intoin December 1986.  In the alternative it is pleaded that the plaintiff was in breach of duty as an agent and guilty of conversion.It is further said that the 27th October 1987 sales by the plaintiff of the defendant's shares in a private sale to Mr. Li Ka Shingand/or Penkilan were at undervalue as shown in Schedule E.  It is alleged that the plaintiff's decision to proceed with the privatesale was taken after discussions with and/or instructions given by its parent company in Canada. It is further alleged that the plaintiffwas in breach of certain terms of the agreement or its duty as agent and was guilty of conversion. It is said that the private salewas in contravention of certain specified provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333">Cap. 333</a> and in breach of a number of the Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It is alleged that the private sale was not bonafide and that the plaintiff had failed to take reasonable care to obtain the best price.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It is then pleaded that the plaintiff had utilised shares deposited by the defendant as security for the margin account by depositingthem as security for facilities granted to the plaintiff by Canadian Eastern Finance; particulars of the shares are given in theSchedule F. Conversion is alleged, and breach of certain terms of the agreement and of the plaintiff's duty as agent, as well asa breach of another provision of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/333" class="autolink_findacts">Securities Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The pleading goes on to say that the plaintiff had dealt with or disposed of the securities which the defendant caused to be transferredto margin account from other brokers; the particulars of the shares are given in Schedule G and conversion is alleged and/or breachof the terms of the December 1986 agreement and/or of their duty as agent. Apart from an averment that the agreement was not in compliancewith the formal requirements of a particular rule of the Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, it is said that the agreement wasnot in Chinese, did not contain a Risk Disclosure Statement and had other defects, with the result that it was invalid. It is alsosaid that the plaintiff was not entitled to charge the defendant brokerage or commission on the private sales. The outstanding balanceof $64 million claimed is denied.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> There is then the Counterclaim against the plaintiff's parent company in Canada (Richardson Greenshields of Canada Limited), Mr.Li Ka Shing and Penkilan Limited. The defendant avers that Mr. Li Ka Shing and/or Penkilan converted the shares set out in ScheduleE. It is further alleged that Mr. Li Ka Shing and/or Penkilan knew or failed to make adequate enquiry that the plaintiff was actingin breach of its fiduciary duties in concluding the private sale of the shares. It is further averred that they had assisted theplaintiff to act in breach of its fiduciary duties or had participated in the breach themselves, and that they had received the defendant'sproperty for their own benefit and were thus liable to account for it. They were liable as constructive trustees.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> As regards the Canadian parent company it is averred that they had procured the plaintiff to act in breach of the agreement and/orof their fiduciary duties and that they well knew that the private sale was made in breach of the plaintiff's fiduciary duties. Thusit is pleaded that the parent company is liable in tort and/or as a constructive trustee.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In the supporting affidavit for this application, sworn by a partner of the solicitors firm acting for the defendant, it is submittedthat the claim, Defence and Counterclaim involve a number of difficult and complex issues of fact and law, and these are listed.In the light of the fact that I have summarised the pleadings, I do not think it is necessary for me to spell out all the issueswhich are said to be difficult and complex.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> It is stated in the affidavit that there have been many developments in the law concerning constructive trusts in the last few yearsand that Mr. Leaver himself had represented one of the parties in an action the judgment in which is reported in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20Ch%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 Ch. 265.</a> It is also submitted that there are two additional features which make it desirable for overseas counsel to appear in the instantcase: (a) there is an international element in the case because allegations were made against the Canadian parent company, and (b)there were allegations made against Mr. Li Ka Shing who is "a very well-known local personality".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The affidavit in support goes on to say that Mr. Leaver is one of the leading practitioners in commercial matters, and in particularsecurities matters, and has been practising in England and Wales in these areas of work. It is said that his expertise would be ofsubstantial assistance in the conduct of the proceedings. The affiant expressed the view that "it is necessary and essential forthe full and efficient preparation and conduct of the [case] to engage leading counsel with the experience and expertise possessedby [Mr. Leaver]."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The trial dates have been fixed, and it is clear that it will be a long hearing (between 26th June 1991 and 30th July 1991).  Incorrespondence between the solicitors acting for the defendant and the Bar Committee, the question whether or not the Bar Associationwould oppose the application for Mr. Leaver's limited admission was canvassed. By a letter dated 21st December 1990 the Bar Associationindicated that the Bar Committee was not prepared to give its consent to the proposed admission.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Counsel have helpfully referred me to all the authorities that are relevant. It is well established that the public interest is theparamount consideration. It is clear that the application before me is founded firmly on the submission that the case to which itrelates is of unusual difficulty or complexity. I note that the affidavit does not suggest that no local counsel with appropriateskill and experience is available, nor did Mr. Eddis, who appears on this application (and is briefed for the defendant in the actionitself), submit that that was the position. When one reads the cases of <u>Re Coles</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20HKLR%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] HKLR 480</a> and <u>Re Glasgow</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20HKLR%20607" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 HKLR 607</a>, it is clear that as the authorities stand if the averment is that the case is one of unusual difficulty or complexity it is necessaryonly to satisfy that condition. As Roberts, C.J. said in the <u>Glasgow</u> case at page 609:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="73%" class="quote">                "      So far as paragraph 6 of <u>Coles</u> is concerned, the list there set out is meant to be in the alternative. That means that if a local counsel with appropriate skilland experience is not available, there is no need to show that the case is one of unusual difficulty or complexity.               <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>            <td width="14%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="73%" class="quote">         If, oh the other hand, the allegation of local solicitors is that the case is one of unusual difficulty or complexity, itis necessary only to satisfy this. If that fails, then solicitors may have to approach local counsel to see if one of appropriateskill and experience is available. It is not necessary for them to approach all local leaders. Some are clearly inappropriate forsome cases.

I can well understand the proposition that if paragraph 6(a) is satisfied there is no need to satisfy paragraph 6(b); what I findmuch more difficult is the principle that if the case is shown to be of unusual difficulty or complexity (paragraph 6(b)) "it isnecessary only to satisfy this".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Miss Kwan has touched on this interesting and difficult point. She suggests that on the assumption that <u>Glasgow</u> is right, although the criteria in paragraphs 6(a) and 6(b) are framed in the alternative, there is some connection between the two,for if a case is of unusual difficulty or complexity, this must carry the connotation that local counsel with the appropriate skilland expertise required to conduct the case are necessarily few in number. Hence, she argues, there is no need for solicitors to embarkon the exercise of approaching such appropriate local counsel.  Conversely, she submits, if there is a sufficiently large numberof local counsel of appropriate skill and experience, and willing to accept the case, the ground of unusual difficulty or complexitywould appear to fall away. She draws some support for this submission from the case of <u>Denny</u> HCMP No.2728 of 1987 (unreported), a decision of Roberts, C.J. dated 19th January 1988.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Miss Kwan contends that if the Court is of the view that the instant case does not require specialist knowledge of a kind not readilyavailable in Hong Kong and that the case is well within the competence of local leading counsel, then a case of unusual difficultyor complexity has not been made out.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> As I have said, I do not propose on this occasion to comment further on this aspect of the matter but in my respectful opinion thequestion will need to be addressed one day, and Roberts, C.J.'s explanation in <u>Glasgow</u> of the interrelation between paragraphs 6(a) and (b) will have to be reviewed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I have been told from the Bar that Mr. Leaver has been advising the defendant ever since May 1989. I accept that this is a factorto be taken into account but it cannot, of course, be a governing consideration for obvious reasons.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> After anxious consideration, and recognising the desire of the defendant to continue to be represented by counsel of great experience,in whom he has already placed his trust, I am quite satisfied that the burden has not been discharged of showing that this is a caseof unusual difficulty or complexity. Of course, an enormous amount of money is involved, and I know from an interlocutory appealwe had to deal with recently, that thousands of documents and a mass of evidence will have to be considered. However, we must notbe mesmerized by the figures. I see nothing in this case that would justify the granting of an application based on the ground advanced.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I will add here that in reaching my conclusion I have not considered that this case has an international element of the kind thatinfluenced the decision of Cons, V.P. in the case of <u>Lord Irvine of Lairg</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 582</a>, nor did I consider that the fact that one of the defendants by counterclaim is undoubtedly a well-known local personality should,on the material facts pleaded, affect the outcome of this application.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> For the reasons I have attempted to give, the application is refused</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. F.
