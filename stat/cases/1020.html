I have before me two applications by the Defendants : one to set aside default judgmententered against them on 8th May 1992 and another to appeal from an order of Master Yam who refused to strike out the Statement ofClaim herein. These summonses arose in this way. On 17th April 1991, the Plaintiff issued a writ of summons in High Court ActionNo. A2704 of 1991 ("the 1st Action") against the Defendants seeking, inter alia, damages in the sum of HK$159,450.94. On 1st June1991, the Defendants served and filed a Defence and Counterclaim. On 28th June 1991, the Plaintiff sought certain further and betterparticulars of the Defence and Counterclaim. A summons seeking these particulars was taken out on 26th July 1991.</font></p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Negotiations for the settlement of the 1st Action thereafter commenced as a result of which the hearing of the summons for particularswas adjourned sine die with liberty to restore by the Master. The negotiations did not reach fruition. The summons for particularswas restored but before the matter could be heard, the respective solicitors of the parties reached a compromise of the 1st Actionon 5th December 1991.</font></p>    <p><u><font face="Times New Roman">The Settlement Agreement</font></u></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The terms of the settlement agreement are not in issue here. They are pleaded in paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim herein :-</font></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">"(1)    Judgment be entered in favour of the Plaintiff against the Defendants for the sum of HK $110,000.00 in full and final settlement;</font></p>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(2)    the Defendants do have leave to withdraw their counterclaim;</font></p>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(3)    there be a stay of execution on the Judgment so long as the Defendants pay the Plaintiff the sum of HK$110,000.00 by six installments(sic) in the following manner:-</font></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    the first instalment of HK$20,000.00 to be paid on the date of execution of a Consent Summons;</font></p>            <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    the second to fifth instalments of HK$20,000.00 each and the sixth instalment of HK$10,000.00 to be paid by post-dated chequeson the same date as the date of the Consent Summons in (sic) each and every succeeding month;</font></p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(4)    if the Defendants shall default in paying the said instalments or any part thereof on the due dates or any one thereof, thestay of execution shall be immediatley removed in respect of the whole outstanding balance at the time of such default and the Plaintiffshall be at liberty to levy execution forthwith;</font></p>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(5)    the Plaintiff shall transfer the 20 ft. trailer No. 10095T to the Defendants and shall execute all necessary documents to effectsuch transfer;</font></p>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(6)    the Defendants shall transfer the 40 ft. trailer M. 98797 to the Plaintiff and shall execute all necessary documents to effectsuch transfer; and</font></p>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(7)    there be no order as to costs."</font></p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> At the hearing of the summons for particulars, Master Cannon was informed of the settlement and the summons was adjourned.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the Plaintiff's solicitors sent to the Defendants' solicitors a draft consentsummons for the latter's endorsement. The Defendants' solicitors never endorsed this consent summons. Instead, they came off therecord.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The new solicitors for the Defendants then indicated to the Plaintiff that the settlement was reached without "the express authorityof the 2nd Defendant" and therefore "not binding upon her". This second firm of solicitors, however, was subsequently also dischargedby the Defendants. Before a new firm of solicitors was instructed by the Defendants, the. Plaintiff took out a summons for judgmentagainst the Defendants in terms of the settlement agreement. This is, if I may say so, a wholly misguided attempt to resolve thedispute then arising between the parties.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I have been referred to paragraph 5 of Atkin's Court Forms, 2nd edn, vol. 12 (1990 Issue) at p. 11 :</font></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">    "If one party disputes that a binding agreement has been made to compromise or settle the pending proceedings, or denies the makingof such an agreement, or repudiates the agreement, the other party is entitled to apply to the Court to stay all further proceedingsand to enforce the agreed terms. The ground of the application is the making of the compromise or settlement agreements and the courtmay entertain the application in the pending proceedings themselves; or on the application of a party, the court may direct an issueto be tried as to whether a binding agreement or settlement has been concluded between the parties, and, if satisfied that it has,the court may stay all further proceedings and enforce the agreed terms."</font></p>    </blockquote>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I have no doubt that the procedure recommended by the editors of Atkin's is the correct one. Here, the Defendants have agreed toconsent to a summons by which judgment is to be entered against them in accordance with the terms agreed. The Defendants, however,reneged from their agreement. They claimed that there was no true agreement. If so, there is an issue between the parties as to whethera binding agreement had been made. I cannot see how in these circumstances the Plaintiff could hope to bulldoze through a judgmentagainst the Defendants in the same terms as the settlement agreement.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The summons for judgment, not surprisingly, was dismissed by Master Wooley. Instead of persisting with her contention that the 1stAction had been settled by either appealing Master Woolley's order, or more correctly, by issuing another summons following the procedurerecommended in Atkin's, the Plaintiff restored the summons for particulars.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On 12th February 1992, the Plaintiff obtained an order from Master Bokhary ordering the Defendants to supply the further and betterparticulars sought with costs to the Plaintiff in any event. It is said that this is a consent order but the order itself does notbear out this fact.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The particulars were not supplied and on 6th March 1992, the Plaintiff took out a summons for an unless order. This summons resultedin a consent order whereby again the Plaintiff obtained an order of costs against the Defendants. The particulars were eventuallysupplied on 11th March 1992.</font></p>    <p><u><font face="Times New Roman">The Present Proceedings</font></u></p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> On 1st April 1992, the Plaintiff issued the writ of summons in these proceedings and claimed damages in the sum of HK$110,000 inrespect of the breach of the settlement agreement.</font></p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Instead of putting in a defence, the Defendants by summons dated 14th April 1992 applied to strike out the Statement of Claim hereinunder the various grounds of 0. 18 r. 19. Master Yam dismissed this summons with costs on 29th April 1992. Notice of appeal againstthis decision was filed on 1st May 1992.</font></p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The Plaintiff in the meantime pressed for an acknowledgment of service and a defence. This was ignored by the Defendants' solicitor,Mr. Chan Man Hon, who in an affirmation dated 18th May 1992 frankly admitted that he thought that since the Defendants were seekingto strike out the claim, there was no need to file a defence. He said :-</font></p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">"I deliberately instructed our clerk to serve the Notice of Appeal on the solicitors for the Plaintiff before [the deadline for thedefence] because I had two assumptions :</font></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(i)    I thought that once the Notice of Appeal was filed, the Clerk of Court would not entertain as (sic) application for defaultjudgment;</font></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii)    Once, the solicitors for the Plaintiff received our Notice of Appeal, they would wait until the outcome of the appeal beforethey would proceed to enter judgment in default of defence."</font></p>    </blockquote>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I shall not comment on whether these assumptions are reasonable suffice to say that they are wrong and Mr. Chan now also realisesthey are wrong. Mr. Chan, quite rightly I think, hastened to add that he had to take full responsibilities for making the above falseassumptions.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Judgment in default against the Defendants was entered on 8th May 1992. The application to set aside the default judgment now comesbefore me together with the Defendants' appeal from Master Yam's decision of 29th April 1992.</font></p>    <p><u><font face="Times New Roman">Burden of A Defaulting Defendant</font></u></p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Miss Wong who appears for the Defendants accepted that the judgment was a regular judgment and that she had to show merits in thedefence under O. 13 r. 9. She does not dispute the right test to apply in these circumstances is that laid down in The "Saudi Eagle"(1986]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20Lloyds%20Rep%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 Lloyd's Rep. 221 (C.A.)</a> that a defendant must show he has a defence which has "a real prospect of success". But what does this mean in practical terms ?Does it mean that a defendant must show a defence with better than 50/50 chance of success?</font></p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It will not be overlooked that 0. 13 r. 9 gives a wide discretion to the Court. That discretion, on the language of the rule, iswholly unfettered. In Evans V. Bartlam  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%20AC%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] A.C. 473 (H.L.).</a> Lord Atkin thought (at p. 480) that even the rule on the requirement of an affidavit of merits "could, in no doubt rare but appropriatecases, be departed from".</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> When a similar question came before the English Court of Appeal in The "Saudi Eagle"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 221</a>, Sir Roger Ormrod who delivered the judgment of the Court, said (atp. 223) :-</font></p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">"In the course of his argument Mr. Clarke, Q.C., used the phrase 'an arguable case' and it, or an equivalent, occurs in some of thereported cases (e.g. Burns V. Kendel,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 554</a> and Vann V. Awford). This phrase is commonly used in relation to R.S.C., O. 14, to indicate the standard to be met by a defendantwho is seeking leave to defend. If it is used in the same sense in relation to setting aside a default judgment, it does not accord,in our judgment, with the standard indicated by each of their Lordships in Evans V. Bartlam. All of them clearly contemplated thata defendant who is asking the Court to exercise its discretion in his favour should show that he has a defence which has a real prospectof success. (In Evans V. Bartlam there was an obvious I defence under the Gaming Act and in Vann V. Awford a reasonable prospectof reducing the quantum of the claim.) Indeed it would be surprising if the standard required for obtaining leave to defend (whichhas only to displace the plaintiff's assertion that there is no defence) were the same as that required to displace a regular judgmentof the Court and with it the rights acquired by the plaintiff. In our opinion, therefore, to arrive at a reasoned assessment of thejustice of the case the Court must form a provisional view of the probable outcome if the judgment were to be set aside and the defencedeveloped. The 'arguable' defence must carry some degree of conviction."</font></p>    </blockquote>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The "Saudi Eagle" was a case where the defendants had taken a deliberate decision not to defend the plaintiff's claim initially becausethey thought they had no assets.

As it is an obiter dictum it is not binding on me and I am under no obligation to follow it; but I doubt whetherSir Roger Ormrod was intending to say that.</font></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">    Mr. Barlow relied on this criticism for the proposition that Sir Roger Ormrod had propounded too stringent a test for an arguablecase and that the judge in the present case had therefore erred in following such a test which amounted to requiring the defendantto show that he would probably succeed in his defence at the trial.</font></p>        <p align="justify" class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">    I am unable to accept this argument.

Thus he had earlier observed at p. 223 that Evans V. Bartlam indicated that,in the exercise of the court's discretion whether to set aside a default judgment, the primary consideration is whether the defendant"has merits to which the Court should pay heed" (per Lord Wright at p. 489), not as a rule of law but as a matter of common sense,since there is no point in setting aside a judgment if the defendant has no defence ....'.

A Courtwill not exercise its discretion in vain if the defence is bound to fail;</font></p>        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(v) All the defendant needs to do is to show his defence is a real one and there is a proper or serious question to be tried. He willnot have discharged his burden if his defence is not a bona fide defence or is illusory.</font></p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In this respect, I agree with Hobbouse J. in The "Ruben Martiner Villena"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20621" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 2 Lloyd's Rep. 621</a> that the Court in The "Saudi Eagle" is not saying that the Court "should only set aside a judgment if it is satisfied that the outcomeof the action will, on a better than 50/50 chance, be a judgment in favour of the defendants" (at p. 624). As I have pointed outearlier, in The "Saudi Eagle", the defendant there had deliberately chose to let the judgment go by default. That must be a matterwhich the Court took into account.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Insofar as Clough J.A. in Fountain is endorsing a general view that a defaulting defendant must satisfy the Court that his defencehas a better than 50/50 chance of success, then such a view is not in line with Evans V. Bartlam.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> In the present case, the default was solely caused by the Defendants' solicitor taking a wrong view on a procedural step. That hasnothing to do with the Defendants.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It would be wholly unjust in these circumstances to shut out a defendant on the ground that his defence though real and bona fideis not one which the Court can say will probably succeed on a balance of probabilities at trial. I am of the view that all that sucha defendant is required to do is to show that he has a bona fide defence which raises a serious question to be tried. Unless thatquestion is a purely legal one and there are no facts in dispute, he is not obliged to ask the Court to decide that issue in hisfavour before he is entitled to set aside the judgment. For if the Court is to do that, it is expressing a preliminary view on themerits at an interlocutory stage where not all the facts are known. This has been shown in many other instances to be a very dangerousroute to take not to mention that the trial judge may well be influenced or feel hampered by the preliminary view expressed by theCourt, particularly when that Court is an appellate court. I would go so far as to say unless the point is patently clear, the Courtshould refrain from expressing a view on the merits of the parties' respective cases.</font></p>    <p><u><font face="Times New Roman">Burden of the Defendants on the Striking Out Application</font></u></p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In order to succeed on the application to strike out, the Defendants must discharge a much higher burden.

Whether the Defendants will succeed on only the application to set asidejudgment or both applications depends on to what extent the Defendants can show they have a good defence to the Plaintiff's claim.Since the facts relied on and the legal issues are the same, I propose to consider both applications at the same time.</font></p>    <p><u><font face="Times New Roman">Effect of the Settlement on the Original Cause of Action</font></u></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Whether a settlement has effectively and finally disposed of the original cause of action depends on the intent and effect of thesettlement.

I think it is still the law that a mere accord withoutsatisfaction does not put an end to an existing liability after breach, but I think it amounts to an agreement which can be enforcedby a claim for damages if it is broken by one of the parties when the other has shown his readiness to perform the terms of the agreement."</font></p>    </blockquote>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Slesser L.J. agreed (at p. 657) with both the judgments of Scrutton and Greer L.JJ.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The position in law in the case of a settlement of a cause of action is thus if the settlement is reached in return for a promiseto pay or to do an act, there is an accord and satisfaction. The effect of this is that as soon as agreement is reached, the originalcause of action is discharged and the plaintiff can no longer pursue his original cause of action. Since the lis is extinguishedor gone, the  Court will no longer have jurisdiction over the matter and there is nothing the parties can do to revive either theoriginal cause of action or the jurisdiction of the Court. The only remedy open to the plaintiff is to sue for damages in respectof breach of the settlement agreement.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> This is the case in Green V.

On the front of the brief of counsel for theplaintiff was written "By consent, all proceedings stayed on terms indorsed on briefs. Liberty to apply." The terms were set outon the back of the brief signed by counsel on either side. When the action was called on for hearing, the' court was informed ofthe settlement and the terms thereof, but no order was made. The defendant then failed to pay one of the instalments agreed. Theplaintiff applied to the Court for judgment for the balance due under the terms of the settlement. Slade J. held (at p. 746) thatthe Court had no further jurisdiction in respect of the original cause of action, because it had been superseded by the new agreementbetween the parties to the action, and if the terms of the new agreement were not complied with the injured party must seek his remedyupon the new agreement.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> On the other hand, if the settlement is reached in return for the performance of an act or conditional or dependent upon the doingof an act, then there is merely an accord executory. If and when the promised act is performed, the plaintiff is contractually boundto accept it and once accepted, there is accord and satisfaction and the original cause of action is discharged or extinguished.But unless and until the promised act is performed, the original cause of action is merely suspended so that if the defendant doesnot perform his part of the bargain, then the plaintiff has a choice to either pursue the original cause of action or to sue on thesettlement agreement.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> In Scott V.

The defendant did not pay the said sum within the agreed period and the plaintiffsought to proceed with the action. Fullagar J. said at page 453 :-</font></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">    "The essence of the matter may be said to be that a mere 'accord' is not a contract at all. But, if we find in any particularcase that there is a contract - a promise accepted in 'satisfaction' against a promise - our problem is not necessarily at an end.We have still, I think, in some cases to construe the contract to see whether its effect is to discharge the original cause of actionabsolutely, so that the plaintiff can never thereafter sue on it but can only sue on the new contract, or whether it effects onlya conditional discharge, merely suspending the original cause of action, so that, if it is not performed by the defendant accordingto its tenor, the plaintiff may still maintain that original cause of action ....... The question is likely to arise wherever a timeis fixed for performance of the defendant's promise. In the present case, where a time is so fixed, if the compromise is a mere accord,the plaintiff could sue on the original cause of action at any time before acceptance of performance; he would not be bound to acceptperformance. If, on the other hand, the compromise is a new contract, he cannot sue on the original cause of action unless the timefor performance has passed and there is no performance. But, if the time for, performance by the defendant has passed and there isno performance, can he sue only on the new contract, the original cause of action being absolutely discharged by the new contract,or can he, at his option sue for breach of the new contract, or, rescinding the new contract, proceed on his original cause of action?The question, I think, is to be decided as a matter of construction of the new contract.</font></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">    Here the 'compromise' contains mutual promises, and I am of the opinion that there was no mere accord executory but a contractintended to create new 'antecedent' obligations in place of the 'remedial' obligation originally asserted by the plaintiff. But Iam also of opinion that that contract effected no absolute discharge of any cause of action : there was, in my opinion, to be a dischargeof any cause of action if, but only if, the defendant performed her promise. There is no mere accord executory; if the Defendanttendered performance, the plaintiff was bound to accept it, and he could not have sued before the time for performance by the defendantarrived. But the provision for adjournment of the action is, I think, conclusive to show that there is no absolute discharge,; nounconditional substitution of a new obligation' ......The abandonment of any pre-existing cause of action was, in my opinion, conditionalon the performance by the defendant of her part of the compromise. She did not perform her part, and thus the condition was not fulfilled."</font></p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Here, the agreement was that the Defendants should endorse on a consent summons whereby, inter alia, judgment would be entered infavour of the Plaintiff for a lesser sum. The Plaintiff never did promise the Defendants that she would abandon her cause of actionbefore judgment is signed. If the Defendants are to consent to judgment as agreed, the Plaintiff's cause of action will, of course,merge in the judgment; but until then, the cause of action remains. There is an accord, but until the consent summons is endorsedby the Defendants and filed and judgment entered, there is no satisfaction. The accord is merely executory. Alternatively, as inthe case of Scott V. English, the accord is conditional upon the befendants consenting to judgment.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The matter can perhaps be tested this way. The summons for particulars was adjourned. It was not dismissed. Before judgment is entered,the Plaintiff can at any time bring on the summons again. Likewise, until judgment is entered, the Defendants' counterclaim remains.They are not to withdraw their counterclaim unless leave is given under the consent summons. If the parties are stopped in theirtracks and asked, before the consent summons is endorsed, what are the respective positions of the, claim and the counterclaim, theparties will undoubtedly reply :-</font></p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">    "But of course, until the consent summons is filed and judgment entered, both the claim and the counterclaim will remain."</font></p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> In my judgment, neither the claim nor the counterclaim has ever been abandoned or discharged by the settlement agreement before thepromised act of consenting to the consent summons is performed by both the Plaintiff and the Defendants.

Faced with this repudiation, the Plaintiff has two choices : either to accept the repudiation and continuewith her original action for a large sum (but equally she will have to defend the counterclaim) or insist on the terms of the settlementand sue for the breach thereof. If she is to sue on the settlement agreement, the loss suffered by her will be the loss of the HK$110,000and the 40 feet container which the Defendants promised to transfer to her. If the Defendants were to persist with their counterclaim,the Plaintiff could probably apply to have it struck out on the ground that the Defendants had agreed to withdraw it and the Plaintiffis entitled to hold them to that agreement.</font></p>    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> These two choices of the Plaintiff, however, are mutually exclusive one of the other. This is accepted by counsel for the Plaintiff.If the Plaintiff elects to pursue the original action, she must be taken as having accepted the Defendants' repudiation of the settlementagreement. Her part of the bargain was she would give up the uncertainty of her original cause of action for a larger sum in returnfor the certainty of a judgment for a lesser sum. By persisting with her original cause of action, she must be taken to have abandonedor waived her right to have the certainty of a judgment for a lesser sum. On the other hand, if she insists on the settlement agreementbeing performed by the Defendants or seeks damages thereunder, she must keep her side of the bargain : that is, abandon or waiveher original cause of action for a larger sum.

John Fowler &amp; Co. Ltd. [1946) K.B. 579 (C.A.) instead. The issue beforethe Court in Peyman was whether the plaintiff there had elected to affirm or rescind a contract. The Court of Appeal found on theevidence that the plaintiff had not affirmed but in the course of his judgment, Stephenson L.J. embarked upon a detailed examinationof the law on waiver or election. He sought to explain (at p. 486G) Lord Diplock's speech in Kammins as merely concerning "the elector'signorance not of his legal right resulting from the facts, but of the legal effect resulting from his exercise of that right of enablingthe other party to hold him to his election."</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman">            At page 487E, Stephenson L.J. said :-</font></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><font face="Times New Roman">    "Lord Diplock's words were on any view obiter dicta and Lord Pearson's unnecessary to his (and Lord Reid's) dissenting opinionthat there had in fact been waiver; and if they have to be interpreted as we are asked to interpret them, they seem to me, if I mayrespectfully say so, to conflict with the earlier opinions in their Lordships' House which I have already cited, particularly inEvans V.

I do not think that a party to a contract can realistically or sensibly be held to have made this irrevocable choice betweenrescission and affirmation unless he has actual knowledge not only of the facts of the serious breach of the contract by the otherparty which is the pre-condition of his right to choose, but also of the fact that in the circumstances which exist he does havethat right to make that choice which the law gives him. To hold otherwise ...... would in my opinion not only be unjust, it wouldbe contrary to the principles of law which one can extract from the decided cases."</font></p>        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Slade L.J. also agreed.

It was only after she failed to so enforce thesettlement agreement that she restored the summons for particulars and elected to pursue the original cause of action instead. Evenif she has turned a blind eye to the obvious, her legal representatives must know of the two mutually inconsistent courses of pursuingthe original cause of action on the one hand and seeking redress under the settlement agreement on the other. Their knowledge isthe knowledge of the Plaintiff. By pursuing the original cause of action without any indication to the Defendants that she intendedto reserve all her rights (assuming such reservation is possible), if any, under the settlement agreement, she must have intendedto abandon or waive such rights.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Alternatively, the Defendants must be regarded as having sufficiently set up a prima facie case of election. The Defendants havedone all they can to prove the necessary knowledge of the Plaintiff. They cannot be required to go on to do the impossible : to provethat the Plaintiff did receive proper legal advice that she had a choice to either pursue the original cause of action or to seekredress under the settlement agreement and that she acted according to such legal advice. To require such proof is in the words ofLord Pearson in Kammins [1971) A.C. 850 (H.L.) at p. 878D, to impose on the Defendants an unreasonable burden of proof.</font></p>    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> The Plaintiff did not adduce evidence by way of affidavit that she in fact did not know of her right to elect. Nor did she throughher counsel suggest that she was ignorant of such right. Indeed, there is no indication that knowledge would in fact be an issuein these proceedings. It could, of course, be argued that knowledge is a question of fact which must be determined at the trial onoral evidence and not on affidavit.

I bear in mind I must only exercise my discretion in the most clearand obvious cases.
