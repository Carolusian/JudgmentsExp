leave to the Plaintiff to re-amend its Statement of Claim subject to the provision of particularsunder paragraph 23 of the pleading and (ii) dismissed the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ application for specific discovery by summons dated 21<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>July 2005 (âthe Discovery Summonsâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Although there are ten defendants to this action, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>Defendants had applied for a stay of the claim against them in favour of arbitration in 1998 and by an order dated 2<sup>nd</sup> June 1998, Mr. Justice Findlay stayed the claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants in favour of arbitration.  The action only continued as against the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  An initial question arose as to whether the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>Defendantsâ discovery application is based on the amended Statement of Claim or the re-amended Statement of Claim.  This questionis relevant to the order in which I should deal with the two appeals.  Counsel for the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants informed me that her contention would be that the documents sought by the Discovery Summons were discoverable on eitherversion of the Statement of Claim (i.e. on the amended Statement of Claim and on the re-amended Statement of Claim).  Be that asit may, I think it is more appropriate for me to deal first with the appeal relating to the re-amended Statement of Claim.  It isonly after one has ascertained the applicable pleading that one can sensibly and meaningfully address the question of discovery,given that discoverability of a document is based on relevance and relevance is defined by the pleadings. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The pleadings: the amended Statement of Claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The original Statement of Claim was dated 23<sup>rd</sup> February 1998.

Particulars of the Collateral Agreement were given pursuant to Master Lungâs order granting leave to re-amend, and paragraph 23of the re-amended Statement of Claim set out above had already incorporated such Particulars.

I take that to include the right to build whatever it wished on the land (subject of course to the prevailingsmall house policy of the Hong Kong Government).  A similar argument was at one time raised by the Plaintiffâs then solicitorsin a letter dated 7<sup>th</sup> August 1997 to the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ solicitors. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The upshot of the above is that the Plaintiff now relies, for its entitlement to build six houses on Lot 539 RP, on a two-prongedargument.

Where amendments do not involve the addition of a new causeof action which is time-barred as at the date of the application, the court has a wide discretion in allowing amendments under Order20 rule 5(1).  However, where the effect of the amendment is to add a new cause of action which is time-barred, then the governingprovision is Order 20 rule 5(5).

The conceptof a ânew cause of actionâ had been explained further by Holroyd Pearce LJ in <i>Robinson v Unicos Property Corp. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%201%20WLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 1 WLR 520</a> at 525 as meaning âa new claim made on a new basisâ (applied in Hong Kong in <i>Red Sea Insurance Ltd. v Bouygues SA &amp; others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20HKLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 HKLR 161</a> at 167 <i>per</i> Sir Derek Cons VP, a point unaffected by the subsequent appeal to the Privy Council).   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In <i>Robinson</i> itself, the additional averment (unsuccessfully objected to as constituting the addition of a new cause of action) was to plead thatthe first plaintiff sued as equitable assignee of the benefit of a contract made with the defendant (the contract itself having beenpleaded in the original claim); in <i>Red Sea</i> the additional averment (again unsuccessfully objected to as constituting the addition of a new cause of action) was to add a pleaof foreign law to explain how the plaintiff was able to assert the cause of action pleaded in the original Statement of Claim. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In this case, it is not enough to say that both the amended Statement of Claim and proposed re-amended Statement of Claim assertedclaims âin contractâ.  That would be to view the matter at too high a level of generality.  The cause of action pleaded in theamended Statement of Claim is a cause of action in contract, based upon âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> agreementâ which involved events in 1993.  The causes of action pleaded in the re-amended Statement of Claim are (i) a cause ofaction in contract, based upon âthe Collateral Agreementâ which involved events in 1996 and (ii) a cause of action based on theinherent right of a property owner (as a result of the assignment of Lot 539 RP to the Plaintiff in 1993).  New material facts (suchas the date and place of the agreement and the terms of the agreement) are pleaded and the claim is made on the basis of a new (anddifferent) contract.  The proposed re-amendments go further than, say, merely to clarify the capacity in which a party sues (cf.<i>Robinson</i>), or to plug a gap caused by the omission of material facts relevant to a claim asserted in the original pleading (cf. <i>Red Sea</i>), or to supplement or expand on some material facts already pleaded.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In order to obtain leave to re-amend, therefore, the Plaintiff will have to show that the causes of action introduced by the re-amendment,though new, are based on the same or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief has already beenclaimed in the amended Statement of Claim (Order 20 rule 5(5)). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It has been said that whether the new cause of action arose out of the same or substantially the same facts is âa matter of impressionâ(see <i>Welsh Development Agency</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 1409</a> at 1418D <i>per</i> Glidewell LJ).  In <i>Paragon Finance</i>, however, Millett LJ observed at 418 that this might be so in borderline cases.  In other cases it must be a matter of analysis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I do not read these judgments as laying down any mechanical rule whereby one has first of all to decide whether a case is âborderlineâand then decide the question by (i) impression (if âborderlineâ) or (ii) analysis (if not âborderlineâ).  In my view thesejudgments simply set out a common sense approach (and in <i>Paragon</i> at 418g-h Millett LJ expressly referred to and agreed with the first instance judgeâs application of common sense).  It is notpossible to judicially âlegislateâ for all types of new causes of action that the Courts will have to consider.  There will invariablybe a spectrum of possibilities.  Some will obviously involve (or not involve) substantially the same facts; some less so.  The questionwill have to be addressed on a case by case basis. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It has been observed that the words in Order 20 rule 5(5) are not to be narrowly construed and that they should be given a broadand liberal interpretation in order to attain the objective of the rules: <i>Leung Kin</i><i>Fook v Eastern Worldwide Co. Ltd. (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20HKC%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 HKC 524</a> at 528C-D <i>per</i> Litton VP (as he then was). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In that case the defendant hired a barge from the plaintiff and the barge was lost during the period of hire.  The original claimpleaded a claim in bailment.  The formulation of the claim in bailment rendered it unnecessary for the plaintiff to plead facts asto how the loss occurred.  The proposed amendments concerned the additional of claims in breach of contract and tort, and includedthe additional of factual averments as to how the loss occurred. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The first instance judge held that the causes of action in contract and tort were new causes of action.  This was held, on appeal,to be correct.  The first instance judge then considered the factual averments (relating to the new causes of action) and held thatâthe new causes of action [did] not arise from the facts of the original cause of actionâ.  On this, the Court of Appeal heldthat the judge erred in focusing attention on the <i>additional</i> facts which the plaintiff needed to make to establish the new causes of action and that he applied the provisions of Order 20 rule5(5) too narrowly.  The absence of a complete overlap of facts did not take the case out of Order 20 rule 5(5). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In my view it must be right that in order for a new cause of action to fall within Order 20 rule 5(5), the material facts supportingthat new cause of action need <u>not</u> be identical to, or the same as, or be a âcomplete overlap withâ, those supporting the originally pleaded cause of action.  Thisis clear from the wording of Order 20 rule 5(5) itself, in that the sub-rule expressly recognized the possibility that an amendmentto add a new cause of action could arise out of <i>substantially the same facts</i> (i.e. facts which are not âthe sameâ but only âsubstantially the sameâ) as the cause of action originally pleaded.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Thus the originally pleaded cause of action may rely on material facts A, B and C.  The new cause of action may rely on materialfacts A, B, C and D (or A, B and D).  The additional of new fact D (or the substitution of new fact D for old fact C) does not <i>necessarily</i> mean that the facts are not substantially the same.  It depends (among other things) on the nature of the causes of action concerned(see, e.g. Millett LJ in <i>Paragon</i> at 418g-h) and the nature and importance of the new facts averred.  There can be no hard and fast rule.    </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  It is true that the new and old contractual causes of action arise out of the same <i>background</i> of an attempt to develop land comprised in Lot 539.  But that, as I said, is mere <i>background</i>.  When one analyzes the material facts underlying the causes of action, the original cause of action was based on âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> agreementâ made in May 1993 arising out of the meeting in early 1993; the new cause of action was based on the Collateral Agreementmade in August 1996 in a restaurant in Yuen Long.  The individuals making the âCollateral Agreementâ (in the proposed re-amendment)were (i) one Mr. Kan âand/orâ Mr. Lee Kin Cheong on behalf of the Plaintiff and (ii) Mr. Lee Hang Kwong and Mr. Lee Kwai Wo onbehalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants âand/orâ members of the Tso.  These names were not pleaded at all in the amended Statement of Claim.  In my view,the new cause of action based on the Collateral Agreement is <i>not</i> one arising out of substantially the same facts as the cause of action originally pleaded.  The time and contents are not the sameand the parties/ individuals concluding them are not the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  My conclusion is therefore that is so far as the proposed re-amendments involved the introduction of a new cause of action in contract,it does not arise out of the same or substantially the same facts as the contractual cause of action pleaded in the amended Statementof Claim.  The case does not fall within Order 20 rule 5(5) and hence leave will be refused. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  That leaves the other new cause of action based on the inherent right of a landowner (as a result of the assignment in May 1993(paragraphs 16 and 17 of the proposed re-amendments).  I cannot find any trace of this in the amended Statement of Claim and thisis a new cause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Though this is a new cause of action, the fact of the assignment had been pleaded in paragraph 13(b) of the amended Statement ofClaim.  It is true that the amended Statement of Claim did not go on to plead the conclusion which the Plaintiff <i>now</i> seeks to derive out of the assignment, namely that âAfter the Plaintiff became the registered owner of [Lot 539 RP], at all times,the Plaintiff and/or its assigns or successors have all the right or interest to use, occupy or enjoy [Lot 539 RP]â (paragraph17 of the proposed re-amendment).  However, that is more in the nature of a legal conclusion.  Even if it were to be regarded asthe addition of a new material fact, I am of the view that the cause of action based on the inherent right of a landowner arisesout of substantially the same facts as a cause of action pleaded in the amended Statement of Claim.  Leave will therefore be givento plead that new cause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  At the hearing Miss Chan, on behalf of the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants, expressed concern that the reference to âan agreement made in or about May 1993 â¦â in paragraph 16 of the proposedre-amendment might be relied on by the Plaintiff as giving rise to some sort of additional contractual cause of action.  Upon myclarification with Mr. Hung (for the Plaintiff), he informed me that it was not the intention of the Plaintiff to rely on the contentof any such âagreementâ (such as âIt was agreed on this date between the Plaintiff and the Defendants that the Plaintiff wouldbe allowed to build six houses on Lot 539 RP â¦â).  Miss Chan had indicated to me that she was content for paragraphs 16 and 17(of the proposed re-amendments) to remain as long as the reference to the agreement was excised.  I shall deal with this at the endof this judgment when I indicate the extent to which leave is granted. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  I should add that both the amended Statement of Claim and the proposed re-amendments contained an averment that the 12 indigenousvillagers need not come from the same village (paragraph 10(a) of the amended Statement of Claim; paragraph 7 of the proposed re-amendments). As I understand it, Miss Chan was not opposing the inclusion of paragraph 7 of the proposed re-amendments.  As a matter of completenessI would add that paragraph 7 of the proposed re-amendments, insofar as it sets out a ârightâ of the Plaintiff to insist thatthe 12 indigenous villagers need not come from the same village (and prayer (1) of the proposed re-amendments in effect seek a declarationof such an entitlement), is arguably a new cause of action.  The basis of this entitlement is different from that pleaded in theamended Statement of Claim: in the amended Statement of Claim this entitlement is pleaded as arising from the â2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>agreementâ (as then defined); in the re-amended Statement of Claim this entitlement is said to arise as a matter of constructionof the Deed.  That said, I am of the view that this cause of action arose out of the same or substantially the same facts as a causeof action pleaded in the amended Statement of Claim.  It is based on construction of the Deed, and the Deed was pleaded as part ofthe cause of action relied on in the amended Statement of Claim (it was there defined as âthe agreementâ).   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  There are other parts of the proposed re-amendments which are not objected to.  Again I shall deal with these at the end of thisjudgment when I indicate the extent to which leave is granted. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Given my decision above, it is technically unnecessary for me to deal with the question of prejudice.  Nonetheless, as a matterof completeness (and in case this matter proceeds further) I would set out my view on this point.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  I do not accept Miss Chanâs submissions on âprejudiceâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">42.</a>  Miss Chanâs</a> submissions, as I understand from her skeleton arguments, are based on her interpretation of paragraph 22 of the proposed re-amendments. In her skeleton arguments she seemed to be under the impression that the Plaintiff had pleaded, in paragraph 22 of the proposedre-amendments, that there was an agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in <u>March 1997</u> as to the building of six houses on Lot 539 RP. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  However, as can be seen from the extracts of the proposed re-amendments set out above, paragraph 22 pleaded nothing of that sort. It may be that Miss Chanâs skeleton arguments were based on the proposed re-amendments as they stood before the Master.  Withoutgoing into details, the proposed re-amendments before the Master contained a paragraph 23 which is differently worded from the currentparagraph 23 and is <i>capable of</i> suggesting that the âCollateral Agreementâ was concluded in about March 1997. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Be that as it may, on the basis that paragraph 22 of the proposed re-amendments pleaded an agreement in March 1997 between the Plaintiffand the Defendants about building six houses on Lot 539 RP, Miss Chan submitted that the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants would be prejudiced because it would now be difficult to track down the directors of the Plaintiff as at March 1997 asthey were all mainlanders.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The first point to note is that the âCollateral Agreementâ is now pleaded as having been made, not as part of the agreementpleaded in paragraph 22, but as having been made in August 1996.  The underlying premise of Miss Chanâs argument is therefore afalse one.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In any event, I find this argument on âprejudiceâ contrived and unreal.  It is not said that witnesses on <u>the Defendantsâ</u> side cannot be tracked down or are suffering from fading memories.  It is said that the 5<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants wished to track down <u>the Plaintiffâs</u> witnesses.  If anything, one would be expecting <u>the Plaintiff</u> (not the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>Defendants) to call their then-directors to support the Plaintiffâs case.  If these directors cannot now be tracked down and cannotbe called, then the likelihood is that the <u>Plaintiff</u> would be prejudiced, not the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>Defendants.  If the Plaintiff tracks them down and calls them, then the 5<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants will not be prejudiced because they will be able to <u>cross examine</u> them (rather than having to call them as the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ own witness and <u>be bound by their testimony</u>).  It cannot be sensibly suggested that the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants wished to call them for the purpose of turning them into hostile witnesses. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  It is of course possible that a party may know (or at least have reason to believe) that a witness who is at first sight a ânaturalwitnessâ for the other side (say, an employee or director of the other side) in fact has useful evidence to give <u>against</u> the other side and would be prepared to do so.  But there is no suggestion or evidence that this is the case here.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In any event there is no evidence that had the matter been pleaded from day one (i.e. at the time of the issuance of the Writ inFebruary 1998) the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants would have been able (or would have found it easier) to track down the directors of the Plaintiff as of March 1997.  Ifthese directors had all gone back to China upon Mr. Kanâs taking over of the Plaintiff in May 1997 then it may well be that evenas of the date of Writ these directors had <i>already</i> become untraceable.  One just does not know and one cannot speculate when they might have become untraceable.  The burden is on the5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants to adduce evidence of prejudice <i>caused by the late amendment</i>.  They had not done so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In oral submissions before me there was a faint attempt to suggest that it was a form of prejudice for a weak claim to hang overthe heads of the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants for such a long time.  I have great doubts as to whether the âclaim hanging over oneâs headâ type of prejudice (whichis a type of prejudice developed in the context of striking-out for want of prosecution and mainly directed at claims involving seriousallegations against professionals) can be prayed in aid of in the context of resisting an amendment under Order 20 rule 5(5).  Therelevant type of prejudice in the Order 20 rule 5(5) context, I am inclined to think, is prejudice flowing from having to deal withthe newly introduced plea such as evidential difficulties and the like.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  It is not necessary to decide whether this form of prejudice is in principle applicable in the present context.  There is simplyno evidence as to the sort of anxiety that these Defendants had been placed under, or what adverse effect the claim has had on thelives or business of these individuals. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I therefore reject Miss Chanâs submission about this type of prejudice on the basis of insufficiency of evidence. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The order I shall make in relation to the appeal against the granting of leave to re-amend the Statement of Claim is therefore asfollows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" colspan="2">Paragraphs 1 to 3 (inclusive) of the Masterâs Order dated 15<sup>th </sup>May 2006 shall be set aside.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" colspan="2">Leave be granted to re-amend the Statement of Claim limited as follows (references to paragraph numbers are references to numberedparagraphs in the proposed re-amended Statement of Claim to which re-amendments are made):-</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Paragraphs 1 to 15 â leave granted.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Paragraph 16 â Leave granted but with the deletion of the words from âBy an agreement â¦â up to and including the words âatthe price of $190,000â.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Paragraphs 18 to 22 â leave granted.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Paragraphs 23 and 24 â leave refused. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Paragraph 25 â leave granted subject to deletion of the reference to âand/or the Collateral Agreementâ. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(f)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Paragraph 26 â leave granted subject to deletion of the references to the Collateral Agreement and the Composite Agreement.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(g)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Paragraph 27 â leave granted subject to deletion of references to the Collateral Agreement and the Composite Agreement.

</blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In relation to the documents concerning the applications submitted by the Plaintiff, Miss Chan submitted (in her skeleton arguments)that these would be relevant to damages (for costs wasted) to be awarded to the Plaintiff as a result of the obstruction caused bythe 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>Defendants, as pleaded in paragraph 18 of the re-amended Statement of Claim. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  It is not apparent from paragraph 18 of the re-amended Statement of Claim that the acts pleaded (and complained of) in that paragraphare intended by the Plaintiff as grounding any claim for damages.  The only plea of damages is contained in paragraph 33 and thatparagraph, as modified by my order granting leave to re-amend, relied on the breach of the obligations pleaded in paragraph 25. Paragraph 18 is not intended to serve as particulars of the breach of those âparagraph 25 obligationsâ.  I therefore find itdifficult to see how Miss Chan can âconstructâ a line of relevance by reference to paragraph 18 of the re-amended Statement ofClaim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  More importantly, paragraph 33 of the re-amended Statement of Claim does not contain any particulars of loss and damage.  Had thatparagraph been introduced by way of re-amendment I would have refused leave, alternatively insisted on provision of proper particularsas a condition on which leave is to be given.  But that paragraph (and the damages plea) had been there from day one.  No attempthad been made to obtain Further and Better Particulars of that paragraph. Nor had the Plaintiff given any Particulars of Damage. On the basis of the pleading, therefore, one cannot see how the Plaintiff will seek to quantify its claim for damages and whetherthe documents asked for would be relevant to the damages claim.  On the basis of that pleading, the Plaintiff will not be allowedto adduce any evidence of loss. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Miss Chan submitted that sometimes some judges had been âlenientâ to a plaintiff in assessing its damages claim (perhaps inallowing oral evidence to be given âon the spotâ without pleaded particulars and without prior discovery of documents) and shewanted to see the documents (relating to damages) now.  I have difficulties in following this argument.  One must proceed on thebasis that all courts deal with cases on the basis of the pleadings and evidence before them.  I do not think I can legitimatelyproceed on the basis of how a partyâs legal advisors perceive to be the way some judges had in the past âlenientlyâ dealt withthe evidence and pleadings before them on the facts of some other case.  As far as this case is concerned the position is, in myview, quite straightforward:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">(1)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="96%" valign="top" class="quote">Damages had not yet been particularized.

They had not done so. Once such particulars are given the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants can then see precisely what sort of documents would be relevant to the Plaintiffâs claim.  Any discovery issue can beventilated <i>then</i>.  The 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants are now guessing. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  As things now stand, there is no properly pleaded issue on damages on the pleadings.  The question of discovery of documents goingto damages therefore cannot arise.  I reject this line of relevance. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Then it is said that as part of the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ case, they had pleaded (at paragraph 6 of the amended Defence) that members of the Tso resolved at the meeting in early1993 that the Tso would only allow 12 houses to be built and that Lot 539 RP should be used as a common area for the constructionof a playground, garden and for use as a car parking area, and that the Plaintiff agreed to all these.  It is said by Miss Chan thatthe Plaintiff had supplied members of the Tso with certain draft plans showing development of Lot 539 RP into tennis court, playgroundand parking spaces.  It is contended that these plans, if produced in court, would show that throughout the entire âcontractualperiodâ (words used in Miss Chanâs skeleton) the Tso had agreed that only 12 houses could be built with attending recreationalfacilities to be built on Lot 539 RP. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The problem with this argument is that the âplansâ allegedly given by the Plaintiff to members of the Tso (these were mentionedin a letter dated 26<sup>th</sup> August 1997 from the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ solicitors to the Plaintiffâs then solicitors) were simply not included in the Schedule to the discovery summons. The documents listed in the Schedule all specifically related to applications in connection with the construction of houses by the12 and 6 villagers.  There is no evidence that in any of the papers supposedly submitted by the villagers (or submitted by the Plaintiff)in connection with the construction of the 12 houses (and they were to build their houses on Lot 539 A-L), there had to be any draftplan or plans as to how <u>Lot 539 RP</u> (i.e. the land on which the 12 villagers were <u>not</u> going to build on) was to be used.  And by the time applications came to be submitted by the 6 villagers for building on Lot 539RP (or, more accurately, on six of the sections into which Lot 539 RP was later further sub-divided namely Lot 539M, N, P, Q, R andS), those applications would relate to the building of <u>houses</u> by these 6 villagers on those plots of land. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Therefore, on the basis of the Schedule as presently formulated, discovery (and any consequential production) of the documents listedtherein will not provide the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants with the documents they wanted. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  It is a matter for the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants to decide how they should formulate their discovery request to obtain what they want.  It is not the purpose of this judgmentto discuss whether or how that could be done.  Suffice it for me to say that on the basis of the Schedule as presently formulatedand on the basis of the supporting evidence as presented by the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants in supporting of their discovery application I am <u>not</u> satisfied that the documents sought are relevant along the lines suggested by Miss Chan. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Lastly Miss Chan argued that the applications for building licences by the villagers were referred to in the re-amended Statementof Claim and hence under Order 24 rule 10 they were entitled to call for the production of the applications for building licences.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Reference to a document in one partyâs pleading only confers an entitlement on the opponent to serve a notice under Order 24 rule10 calling for the production of that document.  It is still open to the party (who makes reference to that document in its pleading)to refuse to comply with the Order 24 rule 10 notice.  If the notice is not complied with, then the matter falls to be decided inthe context of an application for production made under Order 24 rule 11(1) (the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ summons in fact referred to Order 24 rule 10(1) in the marginal note, but I am prepared to treat it as meaning Order24 rule 11(1), which is really consequential upon service of an Order 24 rule 10(1) notice).  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Under Order 24 rule 13, no order for the production of any documents for inspection shall be made under (among others) Order 24rule 11(1) unless the Court is of the opinion that the order is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause of matter of forsaving costs.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  For reasons I had explained above I fail to see the relevance of the documents listed in the Schedule (and that included the applicationsfor building licences).  It is true that the applications were mentioned in the Plaintiffâs re-amended Statement of Claim.  However,if a fact is an immaterial averment to start with (in the sense that it is not a material fact necessary to constitute a cause ofaction) then the fact that it is pleaded by one party and then denied (or not admitted) by the other does not turn that into a materialor relevant averment for the purpose of discovery (see <i>Allington Investments Corp &amp; others v First Pacific Bancshares Holdings</i><i>Ltd. &amp; another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20HKC%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 HKC 139</a>; <i>Paulâs Model Art GmbH &amp; Co.

In my discretion I refuse the application under Order 24 rule 10 &amp; 11.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  I do not think that Miss Chan had pressed her Order 24 rule 10 &amp; 11 application in relation to the <u>other</u> documents listed in the Schedule (the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ summons for discovery did not separately identify which documents were sought under Order 24 rules 10&amp; 11).  Incase I were wrong and Miss Chan is in fact pursuing an Order 24 rule 10 &amp; 11 application for <i><u>all</u></i> the documents listed in the Schedule, then quite apart from the fact that none of them (save for the applications for building licences)had been referred to in the re-amended Statement of Claim, I would in the exercise of my discretion refuse to order their productionunder Order 24 rule 11, on the basis that I am not satisfied of their relevance or that their production would satisfy the conditionin Order 24 rule 13.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  It follows that I will dismiss the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ appeal against the Masterâs order refusing to order discovery.  Paragraph 4 of the Masterâs Order dated 15<sup>th</sup> May 2006 will therefore be affirmed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Costs</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  In relation to costs, the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants had succeeded substantially in their appeal relating to the re-amendment but failed completely in their appeal in relationto discovery.  The costs order made by the Master was on the basis that the Plaintiff succeeded on <i>both</i> amendment and discovery.  That has obviously to be revisited as a result of this appeal. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  One possibility would be to âcarve upâ the costs by reference to subject matter, in other words there would be one cost orderrelating to discovery (whereby the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants will be the paying party) and one costs order relating to re-amendment (under which the Plaintiff will be the paying party). That would be unsatisfactory because it would involve two sets of taxation (or two gross sum assessments, if that route is adopted). More time and costs will be incurred. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  I propose to adopt a broad brush approach and make an order in the exercise of my discretion that there be no order as to costsboth here and below, on the basis that the costs order obtained by the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants on re-amendment (both here and below) would probably balance out the costs order obtained by the Plaintiff on discovery(both here and below).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  I appreciate that this is rough and ready and that there can always be room for argument that costs incurred by the parties on thetwo summonses issues are not necessarily identical or of the same order of magnitude.  I have taken this into account.  But I havealso taken into account the time spent on argument on both issues (which was more or less the same before me) and the need to avoidfurther interlocutory skirmishes (such as arguments on taxation or gross sum assessments). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  My costs order is therefore, on a <i>nisi</i> basis, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Paragraphs 5 to 7 of the Masterâs order dated 15<sup>th</sup> May 2006 be set aside.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="4%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="96%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">There be no order as to costs for both summons and for this appeal.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Paragraph 8 of the Masterâs order shall stand.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Paul Shieh SC)<br />            Recorder of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Andy Hung, instructed by Messrs Pansy Leung Tang &amp; Chua, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Ms Winnie Chan, instructed by Messrs Clarence Wong, Cheung &amp; Liu, for the 5<sup>th</sup> â 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/5.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
