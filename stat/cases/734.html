It said that, on or about 3 October 2009, they sent to some of its overseas customers various e-mails (the âe-mailsâ)which were grossly defamatory to it.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The defamatory words were:</p>    <blockquote>      <p class="quote">â â¦ Our factory company is a partner of your supplier â Yokview Co., Ltd. [i.e. the Plaintiff]; but now we have developed separatelysince beginning of this year, no long produce and supply fashion handbags to Yokview.</p>      <p class="quote">We are a real manufacturer with own factory for Brands Fashion Handbags since 1994â¦ We replaced the production of all fashion handbags,while Yokview was only responsible for packaging and shipping to the buyers.

There was some form of business relationship or co-operation between the Plaintiff and AGT in the Plaintiffâs carrying onof its handbags business, and the Plaintiffâs success in its business was attributed to AGTâs involvement in such business relationship/co-operation.</p>      <p class="quote">B. The Plaintiff was not a true handbags manufacturer with its own factory for production, but need to rely on AGT or other thirdparty to manufacture handbags for the Plaintiff to fulfil the Plaintiffâs customersâ orders. The Plaintiff was only a tradingcompany and earned the price difference by liaising with suppliers and buyers. Furthermore, as a result of the cessation of the businessrelationship between the Plaintiff and AGT, the Plaintiff would be short of a source of supply of goods to the Plaintiffâs customers.</p>      <p class="quote">C. The goods previously supplied by the Plaintiff to the recipients of the said E-mail were actually manufactured by AGT or otherthird party, rather than by the Plaintiff.</p>      <p class="quote">D. The Plaintiff was dishonest in not disclosing to the recipients of the said E-mail that the goods previously supplied by the Plaintiffto them were in fact not produced in the Plaintiffâs own factory.</p>      <p class="quote"> E.  At least 40% of the prices previously charged by the Plaintiff on the recipients of the said E-mail was unjustified, as suchcosts could/should have been saved because the Plaintiff was just a trading company. Such costs could be saved if the recipientsof the said E-mail dealt with AGT instead.â </p>    </blockquote><p style="text-align:right">       (Paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim)</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Plaintiff asked for an injunction order, damages, including aggravated and exemplary damages, interest and costs.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant did not file her notice of intention to defend the proceedings, default judgment (final judgment on injunction and interlocutoryjudgment on damages to be assessed) with costs were obtained by the Plaintiff against her on 23<sup>rd</sup> February 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On the other hand, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant defended the claim. He said, inter alia, the followings.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  He did not employ the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant or any staff.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)  He did not send or ask anybody to send the e-mails.</p>        <p>(c)  He indeed never used any e-mail for communication in his business.</p>        <p>(d)  His trade name was âAGTâ only and he never traded and/or represented himself as âAGT Groupâ.</p>        <p>(e)  On or about 22 October 2009, he received an envelope addressed to âAGT Groupâ only and as such, he returned it by puttingthe same into a public post box with the marking of âåæ­¤äººâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In light of the Defence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiff sought a discovery order against Hong Kong Telecommunications (HKT) Limited to reveal the subscriber ofthe subject e-mail account. This Court made the order and the identity of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was later made known. She was indeed a sales marketing coordinator of the Plaintiff and worked there for some 5 monthsuntil being dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 17 May 2010, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was joined in the present proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  She also defended the proceedings herself. In her Defence, she said, among others, that she was suddenly dismissed by the Plaintiffon 25 February 2009. She was asked to pack up her own things and left immediately. She was not even allowed to touch any documentor the computer. The Plaintiff wrongfully deducted her wages but she was unable to contact the boss, Mr. Fong Chi Keung (âMr. Fongâ)of the Plaintiff. She denied the claim and said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â4. æ¬äººæ¯æéé»éµçç»è¨ç¨æ·ï¼åæä¸¦ç¸ä¿¡ååäººå/ä»£çäººç¥éè©²é»éµçç»å¥å¯ç¢¼ãæ¬äººèªçºååäººæ¯ææéé¿æ¯ä»æéææ¬ èªéï¼éé¿è² ä¸åäºæ³å¾è²¬ä»»ï¼èä½åºç¡ççæ¡æ¯ææ§ãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:right">     (2010å¹´7æ12æ¥å­æªçæè¾¯æ¸)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Parties thereafter went through the usual discovery stages, including filing of lists of documents and exchanging of witness statements.Leave was also later granted to set down the case for trial.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 1 March 2011, parties appeared before me at the pre-trial review hearing. The following points were noted.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) The Plaintiff confirmed that it would not pursue against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant for damages to be assessed at the trial.</p>        <p>(b) Parties could not agree on Issues in Disputes. To save time and costs, the matter would not be further pursued.</p>        <p>(c) The Plaintiff filed 5 witness statements, one from Mr. Fong and four from its oversea customers. The latter purported to confirmthat they had received the e-mails at the material times. The question of time, costs and proportionality were discussed in relationto whether the four oversea customers should or should not be attending the trial. No agreement was reached and the Court indicatedthat it would be a matter for them to try to come up with consensus, if possible.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The trial commenced on 27 May 2011, as scheduled. Mr. Ken To of Counsel appeared for the Plaintiff. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant no longer had legal adviser to help him, and he acted in person, as the case of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Preliminary matters</u></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  At the outset of the trial, Mr. To informed me that his client, for the purpose of saving costs and time, had decided not to callfor the four overseas customers to come to Hong Kong to give evidence. Hearsay notices were therefore issued on 4 March 2011. The3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant did not respond to it. However, those instructing Mr. To engaged in some argument in writing with the then solicitors actingfor the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. The correspondence ended when the solicitors ceased acting for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It therefore appeared that the question as to whether the witness statements of the four overseas customers was admissible or notwas still alive. Mr. To asked me to accept them. Both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants argued otherwise. In order to save time and costs, I allowed them on a <i>de bene esse</i> basis<i>.  </i> Now, after thought, Ihave decided to formally confirm such decision.  In short, I agree with the submissions made by Mr. To.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     Order 38 rule 21 of the Rules of the District Court regulates the position.</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">â21. â (1) Where a party tenders as hearsay evidence a statement made by a person but does not propose to call the person whomade the statement to give evidence, the Court may, on application-</p>          <p class="quote">(a) allow another party to call and cross-examine the person who made the statement on its contents;</p>          <p class="quote">(b) allow any party to call-</p>          <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) additional evidence to attack or support the reliability of the statement;</p>            <p class="quote">(ii) additional evidence to attack or support that first-mentioned additional evidence.</p>          </blockquote>          <p class="quote">(2) Where the court allows another party to call and cross-examine the person who made the statement, it may give such directionsas it thinks fit to secure the attendance of that person and as to the procedure to be followed. â</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(b)   There has been no application taken out by either the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant or the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. It is too late for them to make any complaint.</p>        <p>(c)   I should perhaps go a step further. Even if there were such an application before this Court, I would have ruled the same infavour of the Plaintiff. The crux of the evidence of the four overseas is that they did receive the e-mails. Further, one of them,namely Mr. Bruno Zerdoun went a bit further than the others by engaging in some further communication with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. However, there has been no challenge by any of the Defendants that the e-mails were untrue or inaccurate. The essenceof their cases is that, inter alia, they were not the sender.  It would therefore be a waste of time and costs, if one insists theattendance of the overseas customers in the witness box to confirm something which are not in dispute or controversial, especiallyupon taking into account the costs involved, including air fares and accommodation.</p>        <p>(d) Finally, I have also taken the view that, even if I would have ruled against the Plaintiff in the matter by rejecting the evidenceof the 4 overseas customers as inadmissible, it did not materially affect my assessment of the cases of the parties before me.   </p>    </blockquote><p class="heading"><u>The partiesâ arguments</u></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Unlike the usual trial for defamation, the Defendants did not raise the usual defence touching on the interpretation of the meaningof the words of the e-mails, justification, fair comment or qualified privilege. To sum up the matter, the parties ran completelydifferent cases.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   The Plaintiffâs case is that:</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">ââ¦ D1 and D3 have known each other well since D3âs working for D1 at Geotech. Just a week after D3 had been laid off by P, D1quickly set up AGT in a hope to rely on Pâs client contacts obtained in the course of D3âs employment with P to engage in tradesrelating to fashion bags. In order to divert Pâs clients to AGT, D1 D2, and D3 sent out the said Emails to defame P in an attemptto divert Pâs businessâ</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:right">(Mr. Toâs Closing Submission)</p>        <p>(b)    The 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants said that they did not know each  other.</p>        <p>(c)     It was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs case that he was wrongly sued because of many coincidences.</p>        <p>(d)    On the other hand, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant argued that the Plaintiff set up the matter against her as revenge.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Therefore, in the end, the crux lies on: Whose case is to be believed? Did the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants publish the e-mails?</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Upon consideration of all the evidence authorities and submission before the Court, I have decided to accept the case of the Plaintiffon balance. Its case is to be preferred to those of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants, in terms of the documents produced, credibility of the witnesses and the inherent probability/improbability of theirrespective cases.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Documents</u></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The parties in the present proceedings have not produced too many documents. Nonetheless, they all support and corroborate withthe Plaintiffâs case.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   The Plaintiff produced the e-mails received from its customers. There has never been any attempt by either the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant to challenge the authenticity of them.</p>        <p>(b)   In relation to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, his business search record showed that he commenced the business as âAGTâ for fashion bags from 1 March 2009 at 5/F,93 Catchick Street, Kennedy Town, Hong Kong.</p>        <p>(c)   From the e-mails issued by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant with the customers of the Plaintiff, she adopted the above address for correspondence. She apparently used âAGTâ andâAGT Groupâ interchangeably.</p>        <p>(d)   The Plaintiff further produced the company search of Geotech. It showed that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was its secretary, director and shareholder.</p>        <p>(e)   The CV of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant recorded that she worked as a sales officer at Geotech from January 2001 to July 2007.</p>        <p>(f)    The web site of Geotech downloaded by the Plaintiff contains reference of L&amp;M Group, L&amp;M Investments Company Ltd. andthe 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.</p>        <p>(g)   The company search of L&amp;M Investment Company Ltd. recorded that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was its director.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  From the documents, one can see that there were so many connections among the Defendants. It is simply unbelievable or not to bebelieved that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant did not know each other at the material times.</p>    <p class="heading">Credibility of witnesses</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  3 witnesses appeared before the Court. With respect, both the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants are not reliable witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In relation to the 1<sup>st</sup> witness, I have the following observations.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant traded as âAGTâ. It is a special trade name. Everyone expects that it will mean and/or stand for something. Upon beingquestioned by Mr. To, he explained:</p>      <blockquote>          <p class="quote">âi. D1 stated that AGT has no meaning. D1 explained that it was casually picked from the Internet, as these letters were used bya friend of him who was a reporter. D1 also stated that he did not ask this friend of him what the meaning of AGT may be. He adoptedAGT as his company name because it is easy to rememberâ¦â</p>      </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:right">    (Para. 10(a) (i) of Mr. Toâs Closing Submission)</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(b) The 3 letters âAGTâ cannot be picked at random. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was simply refusing to tell the truth. On balance, I find that it should come from the e-mail address of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant âApexGeoTech1991@netvigator.com</a>â.</p>            <p>(c)   The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant admitted that he did receive the demand letter in October 2009, but did not open it as the same was addressed to âAGTGroupâ, not âAGTâ. Apart from the close resemblance of the two names, one should not forget that it was sent to the addressof AGT. There was also the reference of a firm of solicitors on the envelope. It is again far from believable that a ârecipientâin the position of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would simply return the same by throwing it into a public post box with the marking of âåæ­¤äººâ.</p>        <p>(d) The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant also purported to explain in the witness box as to the setting up of AGT, its running of business and cessation. Nonetheless,as summed up by Mr. To, his explanation is far from satisfactory.</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">â10 (b) For D1âs setting up of AGT:-</p>          <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> i. D1 explained in his witness statement that his setting up of AGT was triggered by the approach of a friend of him who knew buyersof handbags. This formed the basis of his clientele;</p>            <p class="quote"> ii. Surprisinglyâ¦D1 gave evidence that he did not even know the name of his friend. He also did not know which company his friendworked for. All he knew was his friendâs nickname, âæç²â, who seemed to work as an editor in the media. D1 met âæç²âat some media events, and âæç²âmay have some contact in China;</p>            <p class="quote"> iii. Given the fact that D1 had no previous experience in manufacturing and trading, it is simply inconceivable that for D1 wouldjust set up a handbag trading company by relying on someone he knew so little about and chose not to inquire. Bearing in mind that âæç²â is supposed to provide the very source of buyers, which is the main reason why D1 set up AGT;</p>            <p class="quote"> iv. Such improbability us even clearer in light of the lack of financial means of D1:-</p>            <blockquote>              <p class="quote">1.

D1 has therefore to be financially conscious.

Such invention of D1 cannot be more inconsistent with the tenor o all the pleadings and the witness statements of D1. All alongthe case of P and the Said Emails are related to fashion bags.

Also, when D3 was challenged as to why she stated Pâs company name, âYokview Co.

He explained that the Plaintiff had decided notto call the 4 overseas customers to come to Hong Kong to testify because they asked for business class flight, accommodation andcosts for extra days to adjust the jet-lag. He also said that it would cost $200,000. I agree with his explanation, especially, havingtaken into account the fact that these customers only confirmed that they had received the e-mails only. There has not been any suggestionthat they made up the same with the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Further, as to why he did not call for the employees who helped him to dig out the information from the computer of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and to download the particulars from the internet, I also accept his answers. The documents have been disclosed for a longtime. Neither the 1<sup>st</sup> nor the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant has said that the information or the particulars were made up. They have also not sought to adduce contrary evidence torebut the same.

In short, he was simply unnecessarily and unfortunately dragged into the matter. It could only have happenedby many coincidences which were very fatal to him. He was therefore almost one of the unluckiest persons in the world. He maintainedhis story. However, as agreed by Mr. To, the case of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is highly improbable.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â3. D1âs case is one of multiple coincidences of the improbables, which happened with a probability close to the infinitesimal.D1 has absolutely no a relationship with D3, but D1âs company, Geotech, was somehow selected by D3 and put on her CV and job applicationform as a company D3 had worked for. The improbable fact was consistently supported by numerous website printouts. Nonetheless, toD1, this is no more than another coincidence that Geotechâs information was misrepresented on the web by someone unknown to him.To continue this series of improbable, D1âs company, AGT, was chosen as the apparent sender of the Said Emails to defame P, coincidentallyusing D1âs address and D3âs mobile phone number.
