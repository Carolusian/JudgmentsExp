As is well known, that is not a proper basis upon which to attemptto answer a summons for summary judgment.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The historical background:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In order that the claim by PEWC may be better understood, it is first necessary to set out certain background matters which arerelevant to all three actions.

Its primary business, as its name implies,is the manufacture of electrical cable.  However over the years it has expanded into various other businesses, as the cable businesswas profitable, and profits were available for other investments.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In the late 1980s, through a Hong Kong wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Blinco Enterprises Limited, (Blinco HK), PEWC acquireda 50% interest in the Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong.  In the usual way of a public company with the various investments held by companiesestablished solely for a particular purpose, which companies may also be known as a special purpose vehicle, (SPV), or wholly-ownedsubsidiaries such as Blinco HK, the investment in the Conrad Hotel was recognised in the annual accounts of PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Up until the end of the financial year 2001, the annual accounts showed that PEWC was doing well and was profitable.  Quite unexpectedly,the accounts for the financial year ended 2002, published in June 2003, contained a write-off in the amount of US$291 million.  Ofthat write-off, US$266 million was attributable to a wholly-owned British Virgin Islands, (BVI), subsidiary called Moon View VenturesLtd, (Moon View).  By reason of the substantial write-off the TSE suspended trading in PEWCâs shares pending a satisfactory explanationto the TSE.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In the course of an investigation following the suspension, the management of PEWC were unable to locate primary accounting recordsor statutory records for Moon View and other related companies, except within a very limited area. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In October 1999, Mr Hu had resigned from his position as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President of PEWC.  Prior tothat time and thereafter accounting matters for PEWC in Hong Kong were dealt with by a company outside the PEWC group, initiallycalled Trident Finance (Asia) Ltd, and subsequently renamed Trident (Asia) Ltd, (Trident).  This company was run by a Mr Robert MaKam Fook (Robert Ma).</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>   Those who had been involved, in Hong Kong, in dealing with PEWCâs financial affairs, primarily Mr Hu, and Mr Robert Ma, and thoseinvolved in Trident, refused to meet with or to cooperate with PEWC, or the liquidators of Moon View.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  A crucial element of the investigation into the liquidation of Moon View was the discovery of the involvement of a company calledCentral Pacific Enterprises Ltd, (CPE).  This company, established in 1994, was said to provide financing services to the PEWC Groupcompanies in Hong Kong and surrounding regions.  There was however, no real business or commercial purpose behind this company, asthere were already other PEWC treasury companies in Hong Kong which could, and should be, carrying out those financing services.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  CPE owed substantial sums to affiliates of Moon View and other wholly-owned subsidiaries of PEWC.  At the time of the investigation,CPE had been liquidated and accordingly there were no longer assets available in that company.  Consequently the debts of CPE, (receivablesin Moon View), were irrecoverable.  These receivables alone amounted to some US$266 million.  Together with a further US$20 millionwrite-off, virtually the whole of the US$291 million debt that had been shown in PEWC's accounts was accounted for.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  However PEWC was unable to verify the transactions giving rise to the irrecoverability of the receivables because Trident, whichwas responsible for managing CPE at all material times, refused to hand over primary accounting records or other material CPE documentsto PEWC.  Consequently the auditors were required to qualify the PEWC accounts, this leading to the suspension of PEWC on the TSE.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Further, at the time at which PEWC learned of the involvement of Trident and CPE in their affairs in Hong Kong, CPE had been liquidated. Importantly, the appropriate time was about to pass which would lawfully entitle those holding the financial records of CPE to destroythose records.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Fortunately, PEWC was able to take steps to reinstate CPE, the order finally being made on 4 November 2003.  With the reinstatementit became ultimately possible to obtain accounting papers.  These revealed that in most accounting years, shortly before the endof the accounting period, the assets and liabilities of CPE were transferred to a company called Mae Sai, apparently owned by PCHL. By this procedure, plainly orchestrated by Mr Hu, the true extent of the debt owed by CPE to PEWC had been concealed from PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The final occasion on which the write-offs occurred took place in July 1999.  In late 1998 and early 1999, PEWC had attempted toinvestigate the investments and companies which had been administered in Hong Kong under the control of Mr Hu.  They faced the refusalto cooperate by Mr Hu and those controlling Trident as described in paragraph 35 above.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In addition to concealing the extent of the debt,  the write-offs had enabled the directors of CPE to give a declaration of solvencyfor a members voluntary winding up to be held.  Fortunately, CPE had been reinstated in sufficient time to avoid the destructionof its books and records.  The ultimate discovery of those records revealed the full extent of the fraud that had been carried out.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  This discovery, and the revelation of the hidden corporate structure, enabled PEWCâs investigators to trace most of the proceedsof the funds that had been paid out by PEWC, or borrowed in PEWCâs name, (or the name of a subsidiary), and repaid by PEWC.  Followingthe receipt by PEWC of investigative accountantsâ and solicitorsâ reports demonstrating matters now relied upon, these proceedingswere issued.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Had CPE not been reinstated, the consequential destruction of its records would have virtually buried the entire audit trail leadingto the use of PEWC moneys which passed through CPE.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The hidden corporate structure:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Central to the case for PEWC is the contention that, between 1990 and 1995, various companies were formed, primarily by Mr Hu, ostensiblyowned by PEWC, using PEWC funds, and that these companies were never reported to the full board of directors of PEWC, or properlydisclosed to the board to enable them to be reflected in the financial statements of PEWC as subsidiaries.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  At the same time, the case for PEWC goes, the various companies were represented to third parties, particularly lenders and regulators,as wholly owned subsidiaries of PEWC.

A share certificate, issued in accordance with Article 4 of the Articlesof Association forms part of the evidence.  There is no evidence to suggest that any other shares have been issued in the company. It has plainly been open to the directors of Blinco BVI to establish that some other party holds the majority of shares in the company,but no evidence has been put before the court to that effect.  The only evidence is that PEWC is the sole shareholder in Blinco BVI.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Although the only copy of a share certificate in Patagonia does not contain either the common seal of the company or the signaturesof directors or officers of the company, the clear inference is that, just as with Blinco BVI, PEWC is the only shareholder in Patagonia.

I shall refer to these circumstances further below,(see paragraphs 148-156).</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The source of funds to establish Patagonia and Blinco BVI:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  It is beyond argument that the funds required to establish both Patagonia and Blinco BVI came from PEWC.  An invoice from KPMG,the accountants involved in the incorporation of Blinco BVI is addressed to Blinco BVI c/o PEWC.  There is no suggestion, and noevidence, that funds other than PEWCâs funds were applied in payment of the establishment costs in relation to the two companies,and payment of the share capital, required to be paid in order that shares may be issued.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  There is a separate argument, which will be dealt with separately, that funds used to acquire the various properties ultimatelyat issue, did not come from PEWC, but from other sources, by way of loans.  That argument aside, no arguable case is made to counterPEWCâs evidence that Patagonia and Blinco BVI were established with funds from PEWC. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  That being the case, and with PEWC holding the only issued shares in Patagonia and Blinco BVI, it must follow that Patagonia andBlinco BVI were established for the benefit of PEWC.  No argument was mounted or could have been mounted on the evidence, that Patagoniaand BVI were established for the benefit of someone other than PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">PCHL:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  On 6 August 1991, PCHL was incorporated in Hong Kong, originally as Time Full Ltd.  It was a shelf company, with an authorised capitalof $10,000, and two issued shares, one of which was transferred to Blinco BVI, the other to Patagonia.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The authorised capital was increased from HK$10,000 to  HK$20 million on 10 September 1991, and the shares, fully paid-up, wereallotted equally to Blinco BVI and Patagonia.  On 16 September 1991, Mr Hu wrote to KPMG stating that Blinco BVI was a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of PEWC.  There is no direct evidence as to the source of these funds; having regard to the whole of the evidence, andthe absence of any evidence indicating the contrary, I am satisfied that the source of these funds was PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  On 9 April 1992, the share capital was further increased to HK$70 million, with 30 million of the additional shares being allottedto Blinco BVI, and 20 million being allotted to Patagonia.  The evidence of Mr Wellem Sham, effectively unchallenged, is that thesource of the HK$70 million, applied in the share capital, was a sum of US$10 million, remitted from the overseas accounts of PEWC. The defendants are unable to point to any other source of funds, other than to say that some other source might be discovered inthe course of a trial.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>   On 29 April 1992, the share capital was increased by a further 10 million shares, with those shares being allotted to Patagonia. Consequently, Blinco BVI and Patagonia each held 40 million shares in the company.  Again, there is no evidence to suggest thatthe additional share capital came from any other source than PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The company went through a series of name changes ultimately becoming, on 24 October 1996, PCL Holdings Ltd.  For convenience, throughoutthis judgment I have referred to the company as PCHL.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  From 1991 onwards Mr Hu, Mr Tung, and Mr Sun made a number of substantial investments, using PEWC funds, channelled through PCHLand into subsidiary companies, owned by PCHL or other PCHL subsidiaries.  They represented PCHL and the various subsidiaries to theSFC, and to various lenders, as wholly owned subsidiaries of PEWC, but as seen in paragraphs 80-84 below, when asked at a board meetingof PEWC in 1993 Mr Sun denied that PCHL had any connection with PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  I am satisfied that the evidence justifies the submissions made by Mr Neoh, in paragraphs 30-35 of his skeleton argument, and Annexes3 &amp; 7 to the skeleton, that the various companies used by Messrs Hu, Tung &amp; Sun were formed using funds of PEWC, but werenever reported to the full Board of PEWC nor were they recorded in PEWCâs financial statements as subsidiaries of PEWC.  Thereis nothing in the affidavits filed by the various defendants to detract from this conclusion.  The assertion that the complexityof the matter and the large number of documents might mean that other information will rise in the course of discovery and a fulltrial is not a sufficient basis to avoid this finding.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  I am further satisfied that the evidence establishes that the funds for capitalising PCHL were provided by PEWC.  Neither BlincoBVI nor Patagonia, the two shareholders of PCHL, and represented in these proceedings before me, have been able to provide any seriousargument that this was not so.  They have filed no evidence at all to indicate an argument that the funds that might have come fromsome other source.  Mr Neoh put it correctly when he said that it was âthe quality of the evidence that was the cornerstone oftheir remarks in this regardâ.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  It is clear, and the contrary is not argued, that the shares in PCHL, issued to Blinco BVI and Patagonia, were fully paid-up in1992.  Neither Blinco BVI nor Patagonia, being US$1.00 companies themselves had funds to capitalise PCHL.  The only inference openis that it must have been that PEWC  provided the monies that capitalised PCHL.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  There is direct evidence from Mr Wellem Sham, and Mr Anthony Cheung that PEWC provided the funds.  There are, as correctly describedby Mr Neoh, âcountlessâ representations made by Mr Hu, Mr Tung and Mr Sun, directors of Blinco BVI and Patagonia, and directorsof PCHL, that PCHL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  I am satisfied that where funds, other than borrowed funds were used, either by PCHL or any of the subsidiaries or SPVâs establishedfor the purchase, to acquire the property at issue in these proceedings, those funds came from PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  On a number of occasions, when referring to specific transactions, Mr Westbrook criticised the quality of the evidence relied uponby PEWC to support of the foregoing conclusions.  It needs to be remembered that these are civil proceedings and the burden of proofis the balance of probabilities.  The overwhelming tenor of the evidence is such that where, in respect of a specific transactionthere is no direct evidence of the source of funds, the clear inference arises that the funds came from PEWC.  That is particularlyso when the defendants themselves produced no evidence upon which it might be said that there was some other source of funds in respectof a specific transaction.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  It is not enough, in O 14 proceedings such as these, for a defendant to say there must be leave to defend because of the absenceof direct evidence in respect of a specific payment, or even a number of specific payments.  Instead the defendant must put beforethe court some evidence upon which it can be said there is an arguable case that the funds came from some other source than PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Quite simply, there is no such evidence.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">PEWCâs knowledge of the hidden corporate structure:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  It is convenient at this point to deal with an argument that PEWC were aware of the investments made, and cannot say that the investmentswere not made for the benefit of the parties presently holding the shares in the relevant companies.  This âknowledgeâ argumentis also used by the defendants, and will be dealt with later, when dealing with limitation issues.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The evidence upon which the âknowledgeâ argument is based falls into three categories.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>   First, in late 1992, there were three newspaper articles referring to the acquisition of South Horizons.  Two of the articles directlyrefer to the fact that PCHL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PEWC, the third refers to PCHL as a âTaiwanese-funded financial institutionâ. In early 1993, reports in Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers referred to a large project on the mainland in which PCHL was involved. Mr Wellem Sham, an employee of PCHL at the time, was concerned that Taiwanese authorities would suspect, from the article, thatPCHL was a subsidiary of PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Second, a company brochure issued by PCHL in late 1992, records that PCHL was âfully supportedâ by PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  As to these two matters, both were raised at a board meeting of PEWC on 19 November 1993.  Mr Hu, Mr Tung, and Mr Sun were all present. The board minutes record as follows:</p>                                                                                                                            <blockquote>                                                                                                                                <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âCase: Pacific Capital (Holdings) Ltd of Hong Kong has from time to time in Hong Kong and Mainland published advertisement and propagandain the capacity of an enterprise relating to our Company.

But again there is no evidenceto suggest that those in PEWCâs offices in Taiwan appreciated the true nature of PCHL, that, although a wholly-owned subsidiaryof PEWC, it was in fact in the control of Messrs Hu Sun and Tung, who were acting independently of their obligation to PEWC.  Neitheris there any evidence that anyone  reported the situation to the board.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  I accept Mr Neohâs submission that, in the whole of the circumstances, it cannot be argued that PEWC knew of the hidden corporatestructure.  The matters relied upon by the defendants amount to nothing more than information that the various properties at theheart of the dispute were acquired for the benefit of PEWC, but that PEWC has not in fact received that benefit.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  In particular, it is quite clear that at no stage at all has PEWC had any, or effective, control of the various companies holdingthe property.  Indeed, if it did, this litigation would be quite unnecessary, for PEWC could then take appropriate steps to appointresponsible directors who would be able to discharge their obligations as directors for the benefit of the true ultimate owner ofthe subsidiary companies.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  It is unarguable that Messrs Tung, Sun &amp; Hu, as the directors of PEWC and of the various subsidiaries, and in particular asdirectors of PCHL at all relevant times, were under a duty to ensure that the acquisitions made were accurately reported in PEWCâsfinancial statements.  This they have demonstrably failed to do.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  The rule is clear.  PEWC is not affixed with the knowledge of directors who are acting fraudulently to, or in breach of, their dutyto the company of which they are directors.  Further the companyâs right of action or defence cannot be affected by a directorâsnegligence to find out the true position.

PEWC is content with summary judgement against PCHL, as once it controls the shares in PCHL, a HongKong company, it then controls the four subsidiary companies, Ever Dragon, which in turn owns Harmutty, which in turn owns both Casparsonand Haddowe, and consequently, ultimately, the commercial property it seeks to recover.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  There was no dispute at all as to the structures used or the circumstances in which the South Horizons complex was acquired.

This sum was applied in repayment of the Dual Currency Facility.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  In December 1996 a new Transferable Loan Facility Agreement was entered into with Rabobank, by Haddowe and PCHL for HK$475 million. The documentation records that sum was to be applied in part in repayment of the Transferable Loan Facility of US$60 million.  Onthis occasion, a âLetter of Comfortâ, again on PEWC letterhead, was signed by Mr Hu, in favour of the lender.  The letter assuredRabobank that PEWC would ensure that Haddowe was at all times, in a position to meet its liabilities to the lender.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  On 30 January 1997, the US$60 million Transferable Loan Facility was fully discharged.

I am satisfied, and no sensible argument has been mounted to the contrary, that the repayment of borrowed funds has comeeither from subsequent borrowing secured against the property, or from income from the property.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  The evidence is equally plain in respect of the acquisition of the East Block.  As indicated, and it was not challenged, the proceedsof sale of the East Block were applied in the repayment of loans.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that there was any other source of funds, particularly there is no evidence to suggestthat any of the defendant companies had funds of their own, (from a source other than PEWC or borrowing), or from any other personor entity unrelated to PEWC, which was applied in the acquisition of South Horizons.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The PacMos Shares:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Again, in respect of the PacMos shares, there is no dispute as to the structures used or the circumstances in which the shares wereacquired.  The defendants offered no evidence to challenge the factual basis put forward by PEWC.  The argument was confined to achallenge as to the source of the funds used, and the legal consequences of the facts established.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  The evidence establishes that it was the intention of Mr Hu and his associates to acquire a listed company into which certain assets,including South Horizons, could be injected.  This appears from instructions given by Mr Hu and Mr Robert Ma to Richards Butler,solicitors, in relation to an attempt to acquire a particular public company.  That particular proposal, code-named Project Lai See,was not successful.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  That first project being unsuccessful, Mr Hu and Mr Ma sought another target.  This resulted in the acquisition of the PacMos shares.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  The acquisition of the PacMos shares began on 25 April 1995, when Mr Robert Ma sent a fax to Mr Hu on the letterhead of PCFL(Finance)Ltd, a company which was described on that letterhead as a âMember of the Pacific Electric Wire &amp; Cable Group of Taiwanâ.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  In the fax, Mr Ma informed Mr Hu that he had located an appropriate candidate company for a backdoor listing on the Hong Kong StockExchange (HKSE).  The company concerned was Win Win International Holdings Ltd, (Win Win).  Again, Richards Butler was the solicitorsinstructed.  It is clear from the correspondence that they regarded PEWC as their client in the acquisition, but that, while recognisingthat the role of PEWC in the matter would have to be disclosed, Richards Butler knew from the instructions they received that theymust keep PEWC in the background as much as possible.</p>                                                                                                                            <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Win Win was ultimately renamed PCL Enterprises Holdings Ltd, and later renamed PacMos Technologies Holdings Ltd.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  In order to ensure that PEWC was kept in the background, a Mr Larry Horner, a certified public accountant from the United Statesof America was engaged to be the ostensible individual involved in the acquisition of PacMos.  At that time Mr Horner was chairmanof Pacific USA Holdings Corporation, (PUSA), a company incorporated in the United States of America and a subsidiary of PEWC.  MrHorner says, and there is no challenge to his evidence, that he was asked by Mr Robert Ma to hold the shares in the public companyto be acquired, on trust for PEWC, as he and Mr Hu thought that if PEWC was exposed to be the shareholder of most of the shares inthe public company, it might drive up the share price making the acquisition more difficult.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  Mr Westbrook has, extensively, criticised Mr Hornerâs evidence, contained in a statutory declaration.  It is right that in assertingthat All Dragon was the ultimate holding company for the PacMos shares, when in reality the ultimate holding company was PEWC, itmay be contended that Mr Horner was part of a fraudulent scheme.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  But that submission, involving as it does, both an acknowledgement that there was a fraudulent scheme, and that PEWC was, in reality,the ultimate holding company for the shares, does not assist the defendants.  Mr Neoh is perfectly entitled to rely on those partsof Mr Hornerâs statutory declaration which assist him, and reject those parts which do not.  In the whole of the circumstancesthose parts which are rejected simply do not coincide with the overwhelming reality of the whole of the evidence.  That part of MrHornerâs evidence may be rejected is not in my view a sufficient basis to take this matter to trial.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  Two SPVâs were formed for the purpose of the acquisition.  Mr Horner became sole shareholder in Prima Pacific (Holdings) Ltd,(PPH), and made a declaration of trust in favour of PEWC for those shares.  The other was Texan Management Ltd (Texan) a BVI company. The shares of Texan were held, as to 51%, by Pacific Capital Investment Ltd, (PCI), the company incorporated in Hong Kong, and awholly-owned subsidiary of PCHL.  The remaining 49% of the shares were held by PPH.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  It is Mr Hornerâs evidence that the ultimate beneficial ownership of all of the shares in PacMos belonged to PEWC absolutely. Having regard to the whole of the circumstances, the defendants offer no reason why this assertion should not be accepted otherthan to say they wish to challenge it.  In the whole of the circumstances of the case it is difficult to see who else should be entitledto the PacMos shares.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  The argument for the defendants amounts to confining themselves to the ultimate corporate entity holding shares, and contendingthat that entity should be entitled to PacMos shares, an argument which completely ignores the identity of the persons controllingthose ultimate corporate entities, and which offers no justification for those persons, whose identity the defendants are not willingto expose, being entitled to the property.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  Texan acquired 50.1% of the shareholding in PacMos from its majority shareholders, this acquisition requiring a Mandatory GeneralOffer to be made.  This Offer was made pursuant to the Hong Kong Code on Takeovers &amp; Mergers and Share Repurchases.  The OfferDocument, although offering a better price than the best trading price in the last six months, resulted in only 5,446,000 sharesbeing tendered, with Texan consequently acquiring a total of 155,610,000 shares.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Texan, having been established as a SPV purely for the purpose of the acquisition, had no money of its own.  On the evidence beforeme, it is beyond argument that the funds required for the purchase of the shares came from PEWC.  As there is no evidence from thedefendants to challenge the financial trail outlined by Mr Neoh it is not necessary for me in this judgment to set up precise detailsof that trail.  I am satisfied that there could not have been any other source for the funds.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Despite Mr Hornerâs declaration of trust in favour of PEWC, and the fact that the whole of the funds for the acquisition had comefrom PEWC, the investment made in PacMos was never recognised in the books or accounts of PEWC, and was never reported in the annualaccounts of PEWC.  Instead, the relevant funds were booked as loans by CPE to Texan, using Trident.  As has been seen above, CPEdid not repay any sums to PEWC or any of its subsidiaries.  Instead CPE was liquidated with all of its liabilities assigned to MaeSai thereby concealing the true nature of the underlying transactions as to which PEWCâs moneys were applied.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Part of the funds required came from a $30 million Floating Rate Note, (FRN) issued by PEWC (Treasury).  These borrowed funds wererepaid by PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The sale of PacMos shares by Super Wish to Vision 2000:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  The original majority shareholders of PacMos had retained 69,186,000 shares in the company.  In November 1996 these shares wereacquired by Super Wish Ltd, (Super Wish), a BVI company which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texan. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  Again, as an SPV, Super Wish had no funds of its own, and although there is no direct evidence of the source of the funds used bySuper Wish to acquire the remaining shares, the only inference open is that those funds too came from PEWC.  There is no evidencefrom the defendants that points to any other source of funds; the case is being argued on the basis that something might appear inthe course of a trial.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  Super Wish sold those PacMos shares to Vision 2000 Venture Ltd, (Vision 2000), a company controlled by Mr Hu.  Super Wish has notaccounted to PEWC for the proceeds of those sales.  Although Vision 2000 is controlled by Mr Hu, it has not been made a party tothe proceedings and no relief is sought against it.  Instead, PEWC looks to Super Wish to account to it for the proceeds of the saleof the shares to Vision 2000.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">All Dragon acquires the balance of the PacMos shares:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  In the Annual Report of PacMos for the year ended 31 December 1996, All Dragon International Ltd, (All Dragon), again a BVI company,was declared as, in place of PCI, holding 51% interest in Texan, and being the ultimate holding company in relation to PacMos.  AllDragon is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PEWC.

In a numberof documents, primarily flowing from PCHL, PEWC is shown to be the ultimate controller or owner of All Dragon.

Any conclusionsreached as to the consequences of the method of the acquisition of the South Horizons property consequently apply equally to theShouson Hill property.  Involved in this action are both real estate, 11A Shouson Hill Road West, and funds deriving therefrom andcash.  I do not understand Mr Smith or Mr Westbrook to argue to the contrary.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  On 3 September 1997, part of the South Horizons property was sold to a company called True Union Enterprises Inc., (True Union). The consideration was a sum of HK$1,200 million, subject to an adjustment on the net asset value of Haddowe and Casparson, and theassignment of shareholders loans.  In part payment, cash of HK$180 million was paid by the purchaser.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  True Union defaulted in making a second part payment of HK$120 million on 6 February 1998, (at the height of the Asian financialcrisis), and the deposit paid, of HK$180 million, was forfeited.  Action was commenced against True Union, that action being settledby way of a transfer of the issued capital in a company called Greateam Ltd, (Greateam), which holds the property at 11A ShousonHill Road West.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  There can be no doubt that if PEWC can establish on the facts, as they have done, that they effectively provided the whole of thecash for the acquisition of South Horizons, then it must follow if, as a matter of law, they are entitled to succeed on the SouthHorizons action, then they will succeed on the Shouson Hill action.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">PEWC has provided the monies for the acquisitions:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  For the reasons given in the foregoing paragraphs I am satisfied that PEWC has provided all of the funds required for the acquisitionof the various properties.  It has done so either by the use of PEWCâs own cash, or by repaying funds borrowed, if not in PEWCâsown name, with PEWC having been represented as the ultimate source of responsibility for the funds.  Where borrowed funds have notbeen repaid, it is clear that PEWC are liable to repay the funds.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  Before I turn to consider the legal submissions it is necessary to review briefly certain factual matters that have occurred followingthe acquisition of the various properties, that impact upon the factual circumstances.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Control of Patagonia and Blinco BVI:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  The records show that Messrs Hu, Sun and Tung were the first directors of Patagonia and Blinco BVI.  There is no evidence of theresignation of those three first directors, and on the evidence the only inference to be drawn is that they remained directors until30 June 2005.  Neither Patagonia nor Blinco BVI suggest otherwise. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  On that date, the BVI Companies Office records show that the three men were replaced as directors of Patagonia and Blinco BVI, bytwo Seychellois companies, Dunsmore Services Inc, (Dunsmore), and Goldkey Inc, (Goldkey), the directors of which are persons residentin Panama. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  The Articles of Association of Blinco BVI and Patagonia provide that new directors may only be appointed by existing directors orshareholders.  Despite being invited to produce either the shareholders register of Blinco BVI and Patagonia, or the relevant registerand minutes appointing them, the Seychellois corporate directors of Patagonia and Blinco BVI have produced nothing at all to demonstratethe means by which Dunsmore and Goldkey were appointed as directors of those companies.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  The submission has been made, apparently on the instructions of the current directors of Patagonia and Blinco BVI, that becausethe events in question occurred prior to their appointment as directors they are unable to make any affidavits as to the circumstances.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  On any terms that is a disingenuous submission. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  At the very least it was open to the current directors to provide the court with proper particulars as to how they themselves wereappointed.  The plain case for PEWC throughout has been that its money was used to fund the very substantial acquisitions in SouthHorizons, PacMos, and Shouson Hill, all of which, according to the corporate records, are owned by, ultimately, PCHL, the sharesin which are owned by Blinco BVI and Patagonia.  I have accepted that evidence.  It must have been clear to both Blinco BVI and Patagoniathat they were at risk that that finding might be made.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  There is no evidence to establish who the directors of Blinco BVI or Patagonia were, other than the evidence that shows that MessrsHu, Ting and Sun were and remained directors until June 2005.  If it were not those three gentlemen who appointed, or were instrumentalin appointing Dunsmore and Goldkey, then both Dunsmore and Goldkey ought to have said so.  In the absence of evidence to the contrary,the inference is overwhelming that those three gentlemen, none of whom now have any connection whatsoever with PEWC, were instrumentalin making the appointments.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  No explanation is offered by either Dunsmore or Goldkey as to why Seychellois companies, with Panamanian directors, should be appointedat all, by persons who, in June 2005, had no connection whatsoever with PEWC, to crucial positions in companies which own very substantialproperty in Hong Kong, all of which has demonstrably been acquired with funds from, or borrowed by or repaid by, PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  What is abundantly plain is that, despite the clear evidence that the companies were established for the benefit of PEWC, whoeverit is who controls Blinco BVI, and Patagonia, and consequently PCHL and all the subsidiaries thereunder, it is not PEWC.  PEWC hasprovided the funds, repaid the loans, but has no control over the property acquired.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Mr Robin Willi, and the attempted disposal of the PacMos shares:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  The only possible area in which it can be argued that a substantive defence has been mounted by any of the various defendants liesin two affidavits sworn by Robin Miles Willi on behalf of Blinco BVI and Patagonia on 7 July 2006.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Mr Willi is described on a letterhead as the Chief Executive Officer of a company called Swissfirst Structured Bonds AG, based inZurich.

It is right that Mr Sham was not a director or officer of PEWC,or any of its subsidiary companies.  But the evidence clearly establishes his deep involvement in the administration of the affairsof PEWC in Hong Kong, entitling weight to be placed upon his assertions.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  In my view it is irrelevant that Mr Sham gave his statements to the prosecutor as a witness, not as a defendant in these proceedings,neither is it relevant whether or not he was given immunity from prosecution in return for making these statements.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  The assertions that he makes, upon which Mr Neoh relies, are, in numerous instances, entirely consistent with the documentary evidence,thereby giving credibility to Mr Shamâs assertions.  It is right that in some cases there is no documentary evidence to substantiatestatements by Mr Sham, but having regard to the overall consistency of his statements with the documentary evidence, I accept hisassertions, as relied upon by Mr Neoh, where there is no documentary evidence to support him.  No basis is provided by the defendantsto assert that Mr Sham himself might have been part of the fraudulent scheme, and to be protecting himself by false statements.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  As to Mr Hu, the statements he has made to the prosecutor in Taiwan are plainly statements against his own interest.  That aloneprovides the basis upon which they may be relied upon.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  PEWC are perfectly entitled to rely upon these statements, from persons directly involved in the activities under question, as tothe intentions of those directing the activities of the companies involved, particularly in the complete absence of any evidencefrom either Mr Wellem Sham or Mr Hu, disavowing those statements.  The evidence was such that Mr Neoh was entitled to say that therehas been contact with Mr Hu by those involved with the various defendants.  There was no assertion from the defendants that theywere unable to obtain evidence from Mr Hu.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Order 14A argument:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  The argument was made that it is not open to this court to determine a point of law, that is whether or not a resulting or constructivetrust arises upon the established facts, because no application has been made pursuant to O 14A.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  The O 14 procedure is a procedure by which a plaintiff may, having verified the truth of the allegations in the statement of claim,assert that a defendant has no defence to the claim.  When such an application is made, the defendant must show cause by affidavitor otherwise to the satisfaction of the Court, in which circumstances he will be given leave to defend: see O 14 r 4.  In most circumstancesthere will be an evidential obligation on the part of a defendant to convince the court that there exists a triable issue, so thatconditional leave to defend is given, or the application for summary judgment is dismissed.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  The O 14A procedure, not so commonly used, enables the disposal of the case on a point of law.

Over 25 authorities in relation to trusts, together with several textbooks and learned articles were cited by counselin the course of argument.  The matter has been comprehensively argued.  Although Mr Westbrook suggested that the issue has not beenfully argued, he did not indicate which particular areas he had not fully dealt with, or not dealt with at all.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  While I accept that points of law involving resulting or constructive trusts, and the concept of moneys had and obtained, are difficult,I am satisfied that all relevant aspects of these points of law have been sufficiently argued before me.  Further, in the circumstancesof the present case, the factual basis upon which the legal principles are to be applied is, ultimately, sufficiently clear, andthe principles to be applied also sufficiently clear that, at the end of the day, in this case, whilst a complex factual situationis involved, the application of the legal principles is not difficult. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  I am accordingly satisfied that it is appropriate to deal with these legal issues in O 14 proceedings.

One orother of them was a director of Blinco BVI, Patagonia, PCHL, Texan, Super Wish, All Dragon, Harmutty, Haddowe, Casparson, and Greateam. To this day Mr Hu remains a director of Haddowe, Harmutty, Casparson and Greateam.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  As to the existence of a fiduciary duty, Mr Westbrook contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish that a fiduciaryduty existed in the Taiwanese law.  It is irrelevant in my view whether or not such a fiduciary duty existed.  All of the propertyin issue is Hong Kong property.  All of the acts upon which PEWC relies were acts carried out in Hong Kong.  It simply cannot beargued to the contrary, that, at Hong Kong law Messrs Hu, Sun and Tung owed a fiduciary duty to PEWC, when dealing with the propertyof PEWC in Hong Kong.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  It equally cannot be argued to the contrary that in the conduct described above they have acted in breach of that fiduciary duty. The overwhelming inference from the whole of the facts is that it is Mr Hu, who is controlling the companies presently owning theproper relevant property, and that he is doing so for his own benefit, and the benefit of Messrs Tung &amp; Sun.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  It is that breach of fiduciary duty that entitles PEWC to pursue its property in the manner sought by the relief pleaded.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  It is no answer to argue, as Mr Westbrook does, that Messrs Hu, Tung and Sun are not parties to the O 14 proceedings, and that nonehave admitted a breach of fiduciary duty.  The court in considering the O 14 proceedings is perfectly entitled where there is evidenceupon which appropriate inferences may arise, to make any factual findings where the defendants, the subject of the O 14 proceedingsoffer no evidence to the contrary.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  It is right that recourse has usually been had to a constructive trust in circumstances where trust property has become intermingledwith other property.  But there is nothing in the law that limits the use of a constructive trust to those circumstances.  It isequally applicable in circumstances where the whole of the property at issue arises as a result of wrongful conduct.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  It has been plainly established that the whole of the property at issue has been acquired with PEWCâs funds, and that, by virtueof the devices used by Messrs Hu, Sun and Tung, the companies now owning that property, although wholly-owned subsidiaries of PEWC,are not in control of PEWC.  That circumstance has arisen through a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of Messrs Hu, Sun and Tung,which in my view unarguably gives rise to a constructive trust.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  On this basis alone, PEWC must succeed in the South Horizons action, subject to the limitation argument, against PCHL, Harmutty,Haddowe, Casparson, All Dragon, Blinco BVI and Patagonia.  At the relevant times Messrs Hu, Sun and Tung were directors of thosecompanies which are impressed with the knowledge of those directors as to the circumstances in which each company acquired the property. Each company did so as a constructive trustee.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  At the time Greateam acquired property arising from the aborted sale of South Horizons, neither Messrs Hu, Sun and Tung were directorsof that company.  Mr Hu subsequently became a director of the June 2000.  From that time on Greateam became impressed with Mr Huâsknowledge of the circumstances in which the property had been acquired originally. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  As to the Shouson Hill action, although it may have been arguable that at the time Greateam acquired the property it was a strangerto the trust, equity imposes a constructive trust from the time the stranger knows of the claimantâs proprietary right in the trustproperty: see Underhill &amp; Hayton, at para 34.1.

The resulting trust should apply when ever someone obtains title to anotherâs property in the circumstances. In many cases, the provider will retain the legal ownership of the property taken without consent, but there will be many othersin which title does pass, e.g. where stolen money is used as currency or deposited in a bank account.

Those directors knew too that the three companies had provided, themselves, no considerationfor the monies provided by PEWC to enable the property to be taken in their names.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  There is no evidence to substantiate a submission that Mr Robin Willi, or some person on his behalf, was a bona fide purchaser forvalue.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  For these reasons I am satisfied that a resulting trust arises to the benefit of PEWC, against each of the parties presently holdingthe property.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The consequence of Taiwanese law:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  Mr Westbrook contended that the concept of constructive or resulting trusts, not existing in the law of Taiwan, the court oughtnot to make findings upon those bases in favour of PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  Whether constructive or resulting trust is relied on, the existing law of Taiwan is simply irrelevant to property in Hong Kong.

The concept of money had and obtained is in reality an expressionof the right of a person to trace and follow an asset.  This process is best described in the judgment of Lord Millett in <i>Foskett v McKeowen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20AC%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] AC 102</a> at 127B-C, as follows:</p>                                                                                                                            <blockquote>                                                                                                                                <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe process of ascertaining what happened to the plaintiffsâ money involves both tracing and following.  These are both exercisesin locating assets which are or may be taken to represent an asset belonging to the plaintiffs and to which they assert ownership. The processes of following and tracing are, however, distinct.  Following is the process of following the same asset as it movesfrom hand to hand.  Tracing is the process of identifying a new asset as a substitute for the old.  Where one asset is exchangedfor another, the claimant can elect whether to follow the original asset into the hands of the new owner or to trace its value intothe new asset in the hands of the new owner.  In practice is choice is often dictated by the circumstances.â</p>                                                                                                                            </blockquote>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  Having established a proprietary right in the suit property, by way of demonstrating that PEWC either provided, or has repaid, oris liable for, the funds provided to acquire the suit property, PEWC is then entitled to trace and follow its funds to the assetsso acquired.  In relation to trust funds, Lord Millett puts it this way in <i>Foskett v McKeowen</i>  at p 127G:</p>                                                                                                                            <blockquote>                                                                                                                                <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âA beneficiary of a trust is entitled to a continuing beneficial interest not merely in the trust property but in its traceableproceeds also, and his interest binds everyone who takes the property or its traceable proceeds except a bona fide purchaser forvalue without notice.â</p>                                                                                                                            </blockquote>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  For the reasons I have given I am satisfied that both a constructive trust and a resulting trust arise.

Second, it is argued that as the corporateaccounts show that the funds from PEWC were advanced by way of loan to the subsidiary companies, the intention was that it shouldbe the subsidiary company that benefits, and that PEWC is merely a creditor of the subsidiary for the amount of the advance.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  I am satisfied that both arguments must fail.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  Where there were borrowed funds from outside sources, they were either borrowed by PEWC, or entities represented to lenders as PEWCwholly-owned subsidiaries, and then applied in the acquisition of the assets. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  When funds are borrowed for the acquisition of property those funds become the property of the borrower who is liable to repay thefunds, but is no less the owner of the whole of the property.  It cannot be argued that if a company borrows funds from the bank,and gives a mortgage to the bank, or some other form of security, (such as in this case a Floating Rate Note), and then applies thefunds to the acquisition of a property, that the company does not become the owner of the whole of the property.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  Chambers, at p. 13, refers to the circumstances where borrowed money is used to acquire an asset in the following terms:</p>                                                                                                                            <blockquote>                                                                                                                                <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âA contribution to a purchase can be made by accepting a liability to pay the purchase price, e.g. by way of mortgage.

That the transfer of the funds were booked by way of loans between the companies was plainly a decision ofMessrs Hu, Sun and Tung.  It simply cannot now be said that the defendant companies which they control can avail themselves of thatdecision to their advantage.  The decision to book the transfer of funds by way of loans was not an act on the part of PEWC , anddoes not in any way indicate an intention on the part of PEWC that it intended the character of money used to be that of a loan.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a>  The second answer requires an examination of the purpose for which the sums are shown in the accounts of the companies.

Because they are private individuals there is no requirement that there be a set ofaccounts prepared between them, and accordingly no formal description is given to the transaction in which the funds are provided.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a>  Where a company uses a subsidiary, or an SPV, to acquire property on its behalf, the clear intention is that the SPV holds the propertyfor the company, in other words on a trust for the company.

That is an assertion that PEWC is not a shareholder in Blinco BVI or Patagonia.  If PEWC is not a shareholderin those companies then quite simply the principle enunciated in <i>Salomon</i> does not stand in the way of a contention that the shares are held in trust for PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p249" class="para" id="p249">249.</a>  If PEWC is a nominal shareholder in Blinco BVI and Patagonia then at first sight the <i>Salomon</i> principal is a bar to an assertion that property owned by Blinco BVI and Patagonia is held by those companies upon trust for PEWC.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p250" class="para" id="p250">250.</a>  Again, the argument may be made that property held by Blinco BVI and Patagonia, (principally in this case it refers to the sharesthey hold in PCHL), is owned on trust for PEWC.  As I have set out in paragraph 238 above, that is a trust which arises quite independentlyof any ownership of shares by PEWC in either Blinco BVI to Patagonia.  It is a trust which arises by virtue of the circumstancesin which Blinco BVI and Patagonia have acquired and hold their shares in PCHL.  That a trust arises in the circumstances in no wayoffends the rules in <i>Salomon</i> or <i>Macaura</i> because it arises independently of the ownership of the shares.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p251" class="para" id="p251">251.</a>  Further, the propositions in <i>Salomon</i> and <i>Macaura</i> need to be carefully examined.  The circumstances in which the principles in these two cases arose are quite different from the presentcircumstances. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p252" class="para" id="p252">252.</a>  Here, while PEWC is apparently the sole shareholder in both Blinco BVI and Patagonia it is demonstrably unable to assert controlover either company.  As I have already said, were it able to do so this litigation would simply not exist.  Were PEWC able to assertcontrol over those two companies, it could rapidly take control of PCHL and all the subsidiary companies thereunder, and assert controlover the suit assets.  The litigation would simply be unnecessary.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p253" class="para" id="p253">253.</a>  When that situation is examined the conclusion must be reached that it cannot be that the principles in <i>Salomon</i> and <i>Macaura</i> could be applied to deny PEWC a right to the property in question.  It would be quite against conscience that either Blinco BVI orPatagonia could rely upon those principles to deny PEWC their rights. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p254" class="para" id="p254">254.</a>  If it were necessary I would hold that in circumstances where, without the knowledge of a party, that partyâs assets are appliedin the acquisition of shares in a company in the name of that party and subsequently assets by that company, then an exception tothe principles in <i>Saloman</i> and <i>Macaura</i> arises, and the assets of the company, in which the party is a shareholder, are held on a trust by the company for that party.  However,for the reasons set out in paragraph 238 and 250, it is not necessary to have resort to an exception to those rules.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p255" class="para" id="p255">255.</a>  In so far as the remaining defendants, (Mr Westbrookâs lay clients), are concerned, the answer to the <i>Salomon</i> and <i>Macaura</i> arguments is simple.  PEWC is not a shareholder in any of the companies in that category.  Consequently neither <i>Salomon</i> nor <i>Macaura</i> are a bar to finding that any of those companies hold property on a constructive or resulting trust for PEWC.

The companies against whom an action may be brought in the circumstances of this case, where those companiespresently holding the suit property have knowledge, by way of the former directors, of the circumstances in which the property wasacquired, are themselves trustees, and in these O 14 proceedings, it is those companies against whom relief is sought. </p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p258" class="para" id="p258">258.</a>  An argument is available to a defendant on a trust action that notwithstanding those provisions there is a limitation period.

That appears from the affidavit of Jennifer Tse, Treasurerand Assistant Financial Controller of Pacific Overseas Investment Management Ltd, (POIM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PEWC, whichis a company responsible for the management of PEWCâs operations and investments in Hong Kong.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p261" class="para" id="p261">261.</a>  It is right, as Mr Westbrook submits, that if a plaintiff could, with reasonable diligence have discovered the matters earlier,then the postponement will not apply.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p262" class="para" id="p262">262.</a>  Mr Westbrook is correct too in submitting that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the concealment.  Bearing in mind the appropriatestandard of proof I am satisfied that it has done so.  Mr Westbrook has pointed to a number of matters, in particular the receiptby PEWC of certain documents on 20 October 1998, from which certain of the fraudulent transactions effected by the former directorsmay be seen.  But that does not demonstrate that reasonable diligence would have enabled PEWC to determine the matters earlier.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p263" class="para" id="p263">263.</a>  I have already outlined the difficulties faced by PEWC from 1998 until 2001, in ascertaining what had happened.  The deliberateconcealment of debt by way of the transactions between Mae Sai and CPE effectively concealed matters from PEWC until the final writingoff in July 1999.  It was shortly thereafter, in 2000 and 2001, that PEWC were able to take the necessary steps to restore CPE fromliquidation and establish what had happened, leading to the write-off in the 2001 accounts published in 2002.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p264" class="para" id="p264">264.</a>  POIM took over the management of PEWCâs Hong Kong subsidiaries from Trident in September 1998.  Numerous requests were made toTrident for the delivery of all the books and records relating to the PEWC group which had been under the management of Trident. This included companies such as PCHL, Moonview, and other companies.  From September 1998 to September 2002, Mr Robert Ma of Trident,plainly acting on the instructions of Mr Hu, failed to deliver the accounting papers to POIM, thereby concealing from PEWC the truesituation.  I say that Mr Ma âplainlyâ acted on the instructions of Mr Hu, because the evidence establishes clearly a long-standingassociation between the two, with Mr Hu giving instructions to Mr Ma in relation to numerous PEWC matters.  There is no suggestionat all that Mr Ma received instructions from anyone, properly authorised by PEWC.  There is no suggestion from the defendants tothis effect.  He was not acting on his own behalf and the only inference is that he acted on the instructions of Mr Hu.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p265" class="para" id="p265">265.</a>  Further, it is clear from the evidence that the existence of the write-off in the accounts of PEWC placed the company at risk ofsuspension from the TSE until the write-off was properly explained.  There can probably be no greater penalty, short of receivershipor liquidation, that may be faced by a publicly listed company, other than suspension.  It has a drastic effect on the companyâsshares and shareholders.  Plainly, as soon as PEWC knew of the need to make the write-off it knew that it faced the risk of suspension. That occurred during 1999.  It was not until after the reinstatement of CPE in 2003, upon a subsequent availability of the recordsof CPE, that PEWC were able to discover what had actually happened.  That they were able to discover what happened was as a resultof considerable diligence; I have no doubt that the efforts to avoid suspension must have been frantic.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p266" class="para" id="p266">266.</a>  There is no evidence to suggest that PEWC had slept on its rights, but rather that it had diligently investigated the matter, andwhen the proper picture was revealed to it after the reinstatement of CPE in 2003, appropriate steps were taken.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p267" class="para" id="p267">267.</a>  Other than to point to the documents received by PEWC on 20 October 1998, no evidence is put before the court by the defendantsupon which an argument can be mounted that PEWC had failed to apply due diligence in learning what had happened.  The importanceof the burden of proof in limitation matters is demonstrated in <i>Paragon</i>.  There, in the absence of evidence, the plaintiffs failed to discharge the burden showing that they were entitled to the postponementof the limitation period.  In the present case I am satisfied that the plaintiff has discharged that burden, and has establishedthat by virtue of the concealment undertaken they could not have discovered the fraud without exceptional measures which they couldnot reasonably have been expected to take.  The defendants have failed to discharge the burden upon me to establish an arguable caseto the contrary.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p268" class="para" id="p268">268.</a>  I am satisfied that unlike the situation in <i>Paragon</i>, (see p 418 thereof), there is ample evidence in the present case to hold that PEWC could not, with reasonable diligence, have discoveredthe fraud before the relevant date.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p269" class="para" id="p269">269.</a>  I am accordingly satisfied that if there is a limitation period, and in the proceedings have been commenced outside that period,PEWC is entitled to a postponement of the limitation period, and that accordingly the proceedings have commenced within time.</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">A final word:</p>                                                                                                                            <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p270" class="para" id="p270">270.</a>  In <i>Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20AC%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] AC 548</a> at 559, Lord Templeman cited these words, [of Lord Wright in <i>Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v.
