Mr. E. M. McMillan and Mr. M. J. Johnson were appointed to be joint liquidators.Axona was formerly known as Bancom International Limited (B. I.

A sum of US$100,000was placed on deposit for 91 days. According to the applicant her husband Nelson P.K. Chan always dealt with the investment and gaveinstructions to B.T.L. or Axona for the renewal of the deposit with interest accrued upon maturity from time to time.

With interestthese deposits on maturity amounted to US$31,855.14 and US$44,609.19. Records in respect of these two deposits are incomplete, butit appears that the deposit for US$44,223.62 was previously invested with B.I.L. from the 28th December 1981 until the 23rd June1982 when it was transferred to Vila. It is the total of the three deposits with interest on the 26th November 1982 that is claimedby the applicant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The original deposit was made with R.I.L. on the 10th September 1979 for 91 days.

On that date the deposit returned to Vila where it has since remained.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The applicant contends that the deposits were always placed with Axona under its former name, and with no other bank. In fact theapplicant says she would not have invested in a bank abroad. However, she agrees that she signed the investment confirmation slipsthat were addressed to her by B.I.L. upon maturity of the deposit from time to time.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>LIABILITY AS PRINCIPAL</u></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Mr. Merry who appeared for the applicant submitted that Axona is liable either as the principal debtor or as the agent of Vila. Withregard to the contention that Axona is the principal debtor it is alleged that the funds were only placed in Vila as a result ofan internal arrangement between the two companies. However, the uncontradicted letter of the 11th April 1980 is cogent evidence thatrefutes this allegation. Apart from the similarity in the names of the companies before the change to Axona there was no evidenceto show the exact relationship or association between them. Each company must necessarily be treated as a separate legal entity.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The course of dealing between the parties reveals that the monies were transferred to Vila on the instructions of the applicant'shusband and the applicant concedes that she signed confirmation slips to this effect. I  am unable  to accent that  such transferswere made as a result of an internal arrangement, so that I reject the argument that Axona was the principal debtor.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>LIABILITY AS AGENT</u></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I now come to the question whether Axona acted as agent for Vila. The law was expressed in a case cited by Mr. Merry <u>The Swan</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 1 Lloyd's Rep 5</a> where Brandon, J. at page 12 had this to say:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where A contracts with B on behalf of a disclosed principal C, the question whether, both A and C are liable on the contract or onlyC depends on the intention of the parties. That intention is to be gathered from (1) the nature of the contract, (2) its terms and(3) the surrounding circumstances: see Bowstead on Agency, (12th ed.)(1959), at pp. 257 and 258, par. 113, and the authorities therecited. The intention for which the Court looks is not the subjective intention of A and B. Their subjective intentions may differ.The intention for which the Court looks is an objective intention of both parties, based on what two reasonable businessmen makinga contract of that nature, in those terms and in those surrounding circumstances, must be taken to have intended.</p>        <p class="quote">          Where a contract is wholly in writing, the intention depends on the true construction, having regard to the nature of thecontract and the surrounding circumstances, of the document or documents in which the contract is contained. Where, as in the presentcase, the contract is partly, oral and partly in writing, the intention depends on the true effect, having regard again to the natureof the contract and the surrounding circumstances, of the oral and written terms taken together.</p>        <p class="quote">             Many of the decided cases on questions of this kind relate to contracts wholly in writing. But it seems to me that, inprinciple, there can be no difference in the approach to the problem, whether the contract concerned is wholly in writing 'or partlyin writing and partly oral. In either case the terms of the contract must be looked at and their true effect ascertained."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr. Merry also referred to <u>Stanley Yeung Kai Yung and another v. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20A%20C%20787" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) A. C. 787</a> where Lord Scarman at page 795 said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"......It is not the law that, if a principal is liable, his agent cannot be. The true principle of the law is that a person is liablefor his engagements (as for his torts) even though he is acting for another. unless he can show that by the law of agency he is tobe held to have expressly or impliedly negatived his personal liability."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Having regard to this passage Mr. Merry contends that there is a presumption that an agent is liable for the acts of his principalunless he can disprove the presumption by showing a contrary intention.  Mr. Poon counsel for the liquidators agrees that an agentmay be held liable in addition to the principal, but that the words of Lord Scarman on this point were obiter. In that case lettershad been written by brokers to the bank on behalf of Mr. Wong to register  share transfer deeds upon which the plaintiff's signatureas transferor had been forged.. On this matter Lord Scarman had said earlier on page 795:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"........... The letters were the letters of the brokers notwithstanding the fact that they were written on behalf of Mr. Wong. Thebrokers (as they have admitted in their pleading) made the request to the bank; and they requested the bank not only to effect thetransfer but to send the new certificates, when prepared, to them. The fact that the request, by the law of agency, was also Mr.Wong's request in the sense that it was made with his authority does not necessarily prevent it from being a request made by thebrokers. There is nothing in the letters or in the signature, which in each case was. unquailified, to suggest that the request beingmade was exclusively Mr. Wong's and not theirs. On the contrary, the terms of the letters convey irresistibly the message that StanleyYeung &amp; Co., stockbrokers and members of the Far East Exchange, were making the request."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> In order to determine the liability of Axona it is necessary to look objectively at the surrounding circumstances to ascertain theintention of the parties from the point of view of the reasonable businessman or as expressed by Mr. Merry the reasonable depositor.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> When deciding whether an agent can be held liable one factor to be taken into consideration is the fact that the principal is a foreignersee <u>Teheran-Europe Co. Ltd. v. S.T. Belton</u> (Tractors) Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%202%20QB%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 2 Q.B. 545.</a> The foreigner in that case was an undisclosed principal whereas the identity of the principal in the instant case is known. However,in my opinion this matter carries no weight here for it is a common practice especially in Hong Kong for investors to place theirfunds off shore in foreign currencies.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Although there was no evidence of the terms of the agreement between the applicant and B.I.L. Mr. Merry suggested that when the accountwas opened in 1979 the effect was to bring into existence a master controlling agreement whereby the applicant entrusted her fundsfor deposit in Hong Kong or to Vila as a disclosed principal. I do not accept this submission. When the applicant and her sisteropened the account they contracted to lend to B.I.L. US$100,000 for 91 days to be repaid on the expiry of that period with interestat the stipulated rate. There was no obligation to renew the deposit upon maturity. The applicant could have withdrawn the fundsand placed them elsewhere as she wished. If she wanted to renew the deposit a fresh instruction. had to be given for the period required.Accordingly in my judgment each deposit upon renewal formed a separate contract.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the course of dealing was not consistent, but this is not borne out by the evidencewhich clearly shows that the deposits were either placed with B.I.L in Hong Kong or with the bank in Vila. No reasonable person afterreading the letter of the 11th April 1980 could be in any doubt that the investment had been transferred to Vila. If the applicanthad given no instruction for the transfer, and objected to this course, it is pertinent to enquire why no action was taken.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Thereafter the funds remained in Vila for two years on short term deposits until they were placed on deposit in Hong Kong with B.I.L.for almost three months before their final transfer back to Vila. When the investment returned to Vila the applicant received notificationsfrom B.I.L. as she had on previous occasions by way of pro Forma Investment Confirmations that they had been requested by Vila toadvise the applicant of the details of the investment. There were four separate deposits in Vila which were rolled over before thefinal deposit on the 26th October 1982. Upon confirmation of each deposit the applicant was requested to sign a copy of the confirmationslip which she agrees she signed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It is apparent from these documents that the investments were placed in Vila after the 23rd June 1982. The applicant had conductedher business with or through B.I.L. for three years. She elected through her husband to invest either with B.I.L. in Hong Kong orwith Vila depending no doubt on the  most favourable rates of interest offered by the respective companies.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> By transferring the funds to Vila and dealing with the applicant's instructions to renew the deposits did Axona also hold themselvesout to be personally liable. Instructions are placed every day through banks to invest monies in other parts of the world withoutthe transferor bank becoming liable as agent. The plain documentary evidence indicates that the  intention of the parties was to treat Axona as an agent without incurring any personal liability.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Accordingly I am of  the opinion that the decision of the liquidators that Vila is solely responsible to repay the deposits was correct.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The summons is therefore dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(B.
