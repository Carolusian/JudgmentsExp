I indicated that I will hand down the reasons of my judgmentlater. I now give my reasons for entering summary judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiffs are well-known manufacturers and developers and sellers of an extremely popular series of games called Game Boy. Thename Nintendo is identified all over the world as being the maker of the popular Game Boy games. The Game Boy games are to be playedon the Game Boy consoles manufactured and sold by the plaintiffs. The Game Boy games and the playing of these games are shown, atthe hearing, in a video played to me which I found to be of enormous assistance. What the video shows is the playing first of theplaintiffs' games, namely the Game Boy games played with the plaintiffs' Game Boy console by means of the plaintiffs' Game Boy cartridgeinserted into the Game Boy console. The video also shows the defendants product which they called Flash Linker, Flash Card and Flashdisc which together enable the defendants to uplift the games contained in the cartridges of the Game Boy, copy them onto the computerand then reproduce the games into the defendants' Flash Card. The device of the Flash Linker and Flash Card are ingenious and theselling by the defendants of their Flash product turned out to be extremely successful and very large sums of money had been madeby the defendants just in the years 2001 and 2002 which is the operative year that we have been looking at the hearing of the summaryjudgment application.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> There are three large issues which need to be resolved at the hearing of the summary judgment application. First, on liability whetherthe 1st and 2nd defendants, i.e. the companies, have any arguable defence; secondly, whether the directors, that is the personaldefendants, have any arguable defence; thirdly, if there is to be summary judgment on liability whether interim payment should beordered in the circumstances or whether the court should leave the whole question of damages to be assessed. I will deal with eachof these alleged defences in turn.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> First, on liability of the companies. The basis of the liability of the defendants turns on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 273</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a>. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 273</a> is enacted to prevent people selling machines knowing that such machine will enable unlawful copying to be made where the softwarewas copy protected. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 273</a> was directed therefore not at the person who made unlawful copy but person who furnish the means to enable unlawful copying to takeplace. By analogy with drugs, it is not aimed at the drug addict but at the drug trafficker. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 273</a> is not therefore in my view to be given a narrow meaning or read restrictively. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 273</a> reads as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1) This section applies where-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) copies of a copyright work are issued or made available to the public; or</p>            <p class="quote">(b) an unfixed performance is made available to the public or copies of a fixation of a performance are issued or made available tothe public,</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">by or with the licence of the copyright owner, the performer or the person having fixation rights in relation to the performance,as may be appropriate, in any form which is copy-protected.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) The person issuing or making available the copies or the unfixed performance to the public has the same rights and remedies againsta person who, knowing or having reason to believe that it will be used to make infringing copies or infringing fixations-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) makes, imports, exports, sells or lets for hire, offers or exposes for sale or hire, advertises for sale or hire, or possessesfor the purpose of, in the course of, or in connection with, any trade or business, any device or means specifically designed oradapted to circumvent the form of copy-protection employed;</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">...</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4) References in this section to copy-protection include any device or means specifically intended to prevent or restrict copyingof a work ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The two hotly contested points by the defendants in relation to the alleged breach under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 273</a> of the Ordinance are, one that the copyright of the Game Boy games of the plaintiffs are not copy-protected in the sense that theyare not issued in a form with device or means specifically intended to prevent or restrict copying of a work within the meaning of<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 273(4).</a> The second specific dispute is that the product of the defendants are not device or means specifically designed or adapted to circumventthe form of copy-protection employed, that is to say under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 273(2)(a)</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> It would be seen therefore that two hotly contested points of the defendants are firstly to look at the nature of the Game Boy productas a whole and to say whether it can arguably be said that the plaintiffs' product in question were not in a form specifically intendedto restrict copying. The second point looks at the nature and quality of the product of the defendants to see whether it could arguablybe said that they were not devices or means specifically designed or adapted to circumvent the copy-protection.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On the first point, the argument of the defendants is that there was nothing special or unique in the Game Boy Cartridge which houseswithin it the Game Boy games software so as to rank it as copy-protected within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 273(4)</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Game Boy software product however must not be looked at in isolation. The whole Game Boy product must be looked at, namely theGame Boy console, the way the console is made, the way that console's terminal allow the terminals of the Game Boy cartridge whichis of unique manufacture to slot into it with a complete fit, so that when the power of the console is turned on with the a bootcode embedded in both the console as well as in the software in the cartridge, recognition is made and a game then can be playedby the console taking up from the software in the cartridge and thereby allowing the game be played. The Game Boy game is intendedto be played only, and for many years can be played only, by slotting the cartridge of the Game Boy into the console of the GameBoy. The software of the Game Boy game was embedded in a special Rom i.e. a chip fixed into the Game Boy cartridge so as to makethe whole Game Boy product i.e. the software embedded in the chip embedded in the unique housing of the special Game Boy cartridgedifficult of access and that was of course something that was designed a few years back when technology perhaps was less advancethan today. Ordinary people without specialist tools would not be able even now to access the Game Boy software thus stored in theGame Boy cartridge. It does not matter that specialist with skills can gain access. What is important is whether the product is issuedin a form with devices and means specifically intended to restrict copy. I must say, speaking for myself as a layman and having handledand played the game on the actual Game Boy console and Game Boy cartridge supplied to me, as well as having watched the video filmdisplaying the way that Game Boy product works, I have no doubt that the Game Boy software housed in the Cartridge is copy-protectedwithin the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 273</a> of the Ordinance. The video film shows how the defendants' clever Flash product managed to overcome and circumvent the copy protectionbut this only goes to show that nothing is totally safety proof. I have no doubt that the plaintiffs by their elaborate means takenwith the Game Boy product intended to restrict copying. The attack was made on some of the affidavits of the plaintiffs in relationto the specific intention of prevention and restriction of copying. The attack was specifically made as to the narrow way Mr Shirkof the plaintiffs described the design of the product. However, one must not look at only a partial picture of the plaintiffs' evidence,Mr Hayward, for example, in his affidavit covers a much wider scope. Looking at the product and the overall evidence of the plaintiffs,I can have no doubt whatsoever that these Game Boy products were specifically designed and intended by the plaintiffs to preventor restrict copying. In the example I gave at the hearing of a burglar alarm, the question is not whether the burglar alarm is ahundred percent efficient, namely is guaranteed to exclude all burglars no matter how sophisticated or professional the skills ofthe burglar. Some burglars are extremely inventive and creative and, notwithstanding good burglar alarms, can manage to get in andsteal just as in this case the defendants as clever copyright burglars managed to steal the copyright from the plaintiffs. The factthat they have high level skills and succeeded in stealing does not, in any way, detract from the product being specifically intendedto restrict copying or to use the expression of the burglar alarm to prevent the entry by burglars. I therefore come to the conclusionon the first major point of dispute that there is no serious prospect at the trial that the defendants will be able to satisfy thecourt that the Game Boy products of the plaintiffs are not copy-protected and therefore falls outside the protection of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 273.</a></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The second point of contention of the defendants that the Flash product of theirs are not specifically designed to circumvent thecopy-protection has even less merit. The argument is that these Flash products can be put to innocent uses and that therefore theyare not specially designed to overcome the copy-protection. I think the question that should be asked is "what is the substantialpurpose of these Flash products of the defendants and what made them such successful products which sell like hotcakes?" And I haveno doubt that the reason they sell like hotcakes is because they delivered the means whereby a person would be to able to steal thegames of the plaintiffs housed inside the Game Boy cartridge of the plaintiffs and then illegally put the stolen games into the defendants'Flash Card. The plaintiffs sell their Game Boy games at US$50 a game. The blank Flash Cards sell for a fraction of that. I have nodoubt whatsoever that although they may be sometimes innocent usage that the product can be put to, the predominant usage of theFlash product of the defendants is to enable protected software of the plaintiffs to be stolen. The defendants' own manual, as wellas the defendants internet advertisement, all point to the ability of the Flash products, the Flash Linker, the Flash Card to takeadvantage of the Game Boy product and specifically designed for the Game Boy product. What is fatal to the innocent user argumentis the upstream ability of the Flash product namely the specially designed Flash Linker which is tailor made to enable the Game Boycartridge to be inserted into it so as to enable the software inside the Game Boy cartridge to be extracted/copied onto the computer.That upstream design has no other legitimate objective except to circumvent the copy protection and to steal the copyright.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I have therefore little doubt that notwithstanding all that had been urged upon me by both the counsel for the first three defendantsas well as by Mr Kampl himself as the 4th defendant that there is no defence to the claim based on the dispute under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 273(2)</a> that the Flash product of the defendants are not devices and means specifically designed or adapted to circumvent the form of copy-protectionemployed. I think there is no serious prospect that any judge or jury would hold at a trial that the product of the defendants arenot specifically designed to circumvent the copy-protection. In fact as I see it the circumvention of the copy-protection is thevery reason for their existence and for their popularity and lays at the foundation of the large profits which the defendants havebeen making from the selling of these products.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> I therefore conclude on the first major issue in favour of the plaintiffs, that is to say I hold that the corporate defendants, the1st and 2nd defendants, have no viable defence in respect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s273.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 273</a> breach.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> On the second major issue as to the liability of the personal defendants (3rd and 4th defendants), it had been said that becausethey are merely directors therefore they do not take on any personal liability. It is also said they are not reckless because theythought the company was not in anyway breaking the law. The summary in table form (handed up to Court) of the personal defendant'sinvolvement in the business of these Flash products and their knowledge of capabilities of the Flash product to do the upstream stealingof the plaintiff's Game Boy games together with the video tape convincingly shows that these two persons deep involvement in thisunlawful business of the Flash products. The 3rd and 4th defendants are the real owners of these two defendants - they are the <em>alter ego</em> of the companies and every act done by these companies is really an act of these two persons through the instrument of these companies.These two persons have the expertise, they have the knowledge and they stand to make the large profits. I do not think there is anydoubt that they knew what they are doing.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> It is said that the 3rd and 4th defendants should not be held liable or at least arguably should not be held liable on a summaryjudgment application because they took legal advice and there was the letter of Bird &amp; Bird referred to and that their acts couldnot be said to be reckless. In my view, the Bird &amp; Bird letter does not help the 3rd and 4th defendants because it is not a lettersetting out the advice given to the defendants by Bird and Bird that they are not liable. It merely contains the assertion of nobreach by the companies. There was the history of complaint by the plaintiffs. But notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the 3rdand 4th defendants knowing the strong objections of the plaintiff and the undertaking by the companies not to engage in the objectedactivities, the 3rd and 4th defendants caused the companies to continue, reckless as to the tort being committed against the plaintiffs.These two persons were reckless because there was large profit to be made. I accept the submission made to be by Mr Clark and inparticular what he said in paragraphs 44-48 of his Skeleton Argument. I have no doubt that there is no prospect at the trial thatit might be established that the defendants have no personal liability to the plaintiffs. In my view, they are also tortfeasors togetherwith the 1st and 2nd defendants and they all stand to profit and they have profited largely by what they had done. So on the secondissue of the personal liability of the 3rd and 4th defendants the defence fails.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On the final issue of the interim payment, it is not contested that the plaintiffs sell their product for US$50 a game. The lossof revenue as result of games lost was given at some US$20 million. But what is the sort of likely loss of the plaintiffs which canbe established on assessment of damages. The court on assessment will obviously look at very carefully the profit margin of the plaintiffsand other matters to see what is their real loss. But there can be no doubt that it will be very substantial. As an indication ofthe profit that had been lost by the plaintiffs is the amount of profit that had been generated by the defendants in the one yearselling these Flash products. The figures set out in the table submitted to the court during the one year period show a gross profitof something like $17 million. Some of the figures in the tables are disputed. But no matter how one disputes or how one would saythat gross profit figure of $17 million must be scaled down, I have no doubt that at the trial of the action on the assessment ofdamages, a figure very much in excess of $5 million would be shown. I suspect the figure is likely to be much higher than $5 million.So conservatively, I believe quite comfortably this court can hold that $5 million would be the minimum figure that would be provedby the plaintiffs at the end of the day. Interim payment of $5 million therefore is a reasonable order to make and I so order.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> It follows therefore on the three main issues that had been contested, I hold all of them in favour of the plaintiffs. The detailorder that will be drawn up will fairly reflect the judgment that I have given.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">( William Waung )</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Judge of the Court of First Instance,</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p><em>20 March and 21 May 2003</em></p>        <p>Mr Douglas Clark of Messrs Lovells, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Simon Yip, instructed by Messrs George Tung, Jimmy Ng &amp; Valent, for the 1st to 4th Defendants</p>        <p><em>22 May 2003</em></p>        <p>Mr Douglas Clark of Messrs Lovells, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Simon Yip, instructed by Messrs George Tung, Jimmy Ng &amp; Valent, for the 1st to 3rd Defendants</p>        <p>Mr Kampl, the 4th Defendant acted in person</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2003/217.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
