The leg injury and subsequent complications have produced a permanent disability.  Quantum is agreed at $1,600,000.  Only liabilityis in issue here.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The plaintiff was born on 29 July 1989.  He lives with his parents and family in a flat at Tin Shing Court, Tin Shui Wai.  The developmentwas built for the HA in 1999, and the family moved into their flat in January 2000.  Within the development there is a 7-storey carpark and shopping centre, which is managed by Kai Shing.  This building has on its roof tennis, volleyball and basketball courts,separated by wire mesh fences about 6 metres high.  At the relevant time the tennis and volleyball courts were not, and had neverbeen in use; they were awaiting remedial works and were kept locked up.  The basketball court was, however, open for use by residentsevery day from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m.</p>    <p class="heading">The accident</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 21 October 2001 at about 8:10 a.m. the plaintiff and his younger brother went by themselves to play at the basketball court. Their parents had gone jogging separately. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  It is not in dispute that a resident who wished to use the basketball court was supposed to register with Kai Shingâs guards beforedoing so.  The plaintiff and his father say that this was to be done at a registration counter near the ball courts.  The plaintiffsays that the counter was not manned when he went there.  The defendantsâ evidence is that although there was an office with aregistration counter off the lift lobby on the roof, it was not in use then, and was only used later when the tennis court was opened. In the meantime registration was to be done at the management office on the ground floor, although residents, or indeed anyone couldin fact simply enter the basketball court without registering.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In any event, the plaintiff and his brother went into the basketball court without registering.  In the course of play, their ballaccidentally went over the fence into the adjoining, locked volleyball court.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  According to the plaintiff, he went to the registration counter to see if he could find a watchman or guard who could open the volleyballcourt for him, but no one was present there and the door was locked.  He went down to the guard post at the ground floor of the shoppingcentre, and again found no one.  He and his brother waited until about 9 a.m., in the hope that some watchman or guard would appear,but none did.  The boys were due back home; their time was running out.  So the plaintiff decided to climb over the fence and getthe ball.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The ball court complex is surrounded, and the individual courts within it are divided by high fencing made of steel tubing and wiremesh, about six metres in height.  The perimeter fence is supported by a series of stands with a triangular cross-section.  The standlooks like three ladders placed vertically in an isosceles triangle with one side against the mesh.  From the photographs it appearsthat the mesh is about 6 cm square.  The horizontal tubes, or rungs of these stands are 31.75 cm wide and 24 cm in circumference. The internal fencing between the courts is also supported by stands but they are flat rather than triangular, though the dimensionsof the tubes are the same; these stands look like single ladders to which the mesh is attached.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The plaintiff climbed up one of the external triangular stands, and down the other side of it into the volleyball court.  Havingthrown the ball into the basketball court, he then climbed up one of the flat dividing stands, to get into the basketball court;but having got over the top, he fell from the stand to the floor of the court.  His brother managed to telephone their father, andthen the plaintiff was taken to hospital.</p>    <p class="heading">The claim</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The plaintiff claims that the accident was caused by the defendantsâ breach of the common duty of care under section 3 of theOccupiersâ Liability Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a> (âthe OLOâ) or by their negligence. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The claim is particularised as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     Failing to post a guard or watchman at the ball courts to provide assistance to the users;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    Failing to post the telephone number of the management office at the courts, so that the users could seek assistance;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     Failing to erect warning signs to warn the plaintiff of the danger of climbing the stands;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)    Failing to deploy staff to ward off children from playing or climbing on the stands;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)     Failing to fence off the stands, so as to prevent children from climbing on them;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(f)     Failing to take all reasonable care to keep children off the stands;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(g)     Failing to consider the risks presented by the stands as an allurement to children;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(h)     Failing to take reasonable care that the plaintiff would be reasonably safe in using the courts as a resident; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)      In the premises failing to discharge the common duty of care owed to the plaintiff under the Ordinance.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Part of Kai Shingâs defence is that the plaintiff was a trespasser.  By way of Reply, the plaintiff has added two further particulars,of:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     Failing to erect warning signs or notices that the volleyball courts were not open to the public and entry was forbidden,and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    Failing to demarcate to the residents of visitors the non-entry zone of the rooftop in a proper manner.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The defence</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The HA pleads that it had contracted out the management of the estate to Kai Shing, and was therefore not an occupier and owed noduty to the plaintiff.  The accident was caused by Kai Shingâs negligence, if the plaintiff can establish that, and the HA is notliable; but contributory negligence is also pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Kai Shing pleads that the basketball court was open, but the other courts were not; the plaintiff was a visitor when in the basketballcourt, but once he climbed the fence, he became a trespasser; the accident happened while he was trespassing, and as such Kai Shingowes him no duty under the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Kai Shing further denies negligence and pleads that if it owed the plaintiff any duty as a trespasser, there was no breach of suchduty.  It also avers that it had put up warning signs for âNo Climbingâ in the basketball courts, and a notice indicating a telephonenumber which the users could call for assistance, and that it had a well-established patrol system for the shopping centre, includingthe basketball courts.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Both defendants plead that the plaintiff was negligent in climbing the fences, when he knew or ought to have known that it was dangerousto do so; in disregarding warning signs; and in failing to seek assistance from the management office or control room, or from hisown parents.</p>    <p class="heading">Issues</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The plaintiff entered the volleyball court as a visitor.  When he climbed the fence, did he continue to be a visitor or didhe become a trespasser?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     If he continued to be a visitor, was there a breach of the common duty of care owed to him under the Ordinance?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     If he became a trespasser, what common law duties were owed to him?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     Was there a breach of those duties, and did such breach cause the accident?</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Visitor or trespasser</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Under section 3 of the OLO, an occupier of premises owes a common duty of care to all his visitors, to take âsuch care as in allthe circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposesfor which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there.â</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  By section 2, the persons who are to be treated as an occupier and as his visitors are âthe same as the persons who would at commonlaw be treated as an occupier and as his invitees or licenseesâ.  However the Ordinance, which follows the 1957 Occupiersâ LiabilityAct of England and Wales, does not regulate the duty of an occupier to a trespasser.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  âTrespasserâ is a broad term and was defined by Lord Dunedin in <i>Robert Addie &amp; Sons (Collieries) Ltd v. Dumbreck</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1929%5d%20AC%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1929] AC 358</a> at 371 as âone who goes on the land without invitation of any sort and whose presence is either unknown to the proprietor or, ifknown is practically objected toâ.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Where a person enters on land with limited permission, e.g. as to where he may go or as to the purpose for which he is there, andgoes outwith the limits of his permission he is a trespasser.  Per Lord Atkin in <i>Hillen v. ICI (Alkali) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1936%5d%20AC%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1936] AC 65</a> at 69 (followed by Lord Hobhouse in <i>Tomlinson v. Congleton Borough Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20AC%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 AC 46</a> at 86G):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSo far as he sets foot on so much of the premises as lie outside the invitation or uses them for purposes which are alien to theinvitation he is not an invitee but a trespasser, and his rights must be determined accordingly.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In <i>Tomlinson</i> at 91G-H Lord Hobhouse further held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ However, under the Occupiers Liability Act 1957 (and at common law) when an invitee or licensee breaches the condition uponwhich he has entered the premises, he ceases to be a visitor and becomes a trespasser; section 2(2)â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The plaintiff entered the basketball court as a visitor.  He had the permission of the defendants, as a resident, to use the courtto play basketball.  He did not have their permission to enter into the volleyball court, which was out of use and kept locked.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Nor, in my view, did the plaintiff have the defendantsâ permission to climb the fencing.  Such fencing is there, primarily andnecessarily, to keep balls from flying out of the courts when in play.  Though the fence may be strong and its supports may looklike ladders, it is not there for climbing.  One who climbs the fencing uses it for a purpose which is alien to his invitation orlicence.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The plaintiff pleads that the defendants failed to consider the risks presented by the stands as an allurement to children.  Thepresence of an allurement in a place accessible to children may aid the inference of an implied licence.  See <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 19<sup>th</sup> edn., $12-18.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The general rule at common law, as laid down in <i>Addie v. Dumbreck</i>was that an occupier was under no duty to potential trespassers, whether adults or children, to do anything to protect them from dangeron his land, however likely it may be that they would come on the land, and however lethal the danger may be.  The plaintiff refersto the case of<i>Cooke v. Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1909%5d%20AC%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1909] AC 229.</a>  This was one of a line of cases where the courts held that an allurement amounted to an implied invitation to children, so as tosidestep the rule that no duty was owed to a trespassing child.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In <i>British Railways Board v. Herrington</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%20877" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 877</a> the House of Lords reconsidered the decision in <i>Addie v. Dumbreck</i>.  The effect of their decision was that it became possible for a plaintiff, even though he was a trespasser, to recover in negligence. The precise nature of the duty owed to a trespasser gave rise to controversy and provision was made by the Occupierâs LiabilityAct 1984 for the liability of an occupier to a trespasser in the United Kingdom.  There was no corresponding Hong Kong statute. The law applicable in Hong Kong is that set out in <i>Herrington</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Since <i>Herrington</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%20877" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 877</a>, the fiction of an allurement as an implied invitation, so as to bring the trespassing child by implication into the category oflicensee, or visitor under the legislation, has been discarded.  See <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 19<sup>th</sup> edn., Para. 12-62.  Mr Lam has referred in his written final submissions to the passages in <i>Herrington</i> which are authority for this but I need not reproduce them here.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In any event, the plaintiff did not climb the fences because he was trapped by being fascinated by them, or for a thrill, or toshow off to his friends.  He climbed them to get his ball and not because he was in some way allured by the fences themselves.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It seems to me, therefore, that the plaintiff, when he climbed the fences, was a trespasser and no longer a visitor, and that theprovisions of the OLO do not apply to him.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of common duty of care</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Arguments have been put forward that, even if the plaintiff was still a visitor when he climbed the fences, there were no dangersdue to the state of the premises or to things done or omitted to be done on them (section 2(1) of the OLO).</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I think this must be right.  There was nothing risky in the state of the fences themselves.  As in <i>Tomlinson</i>, the risk arose out of what the plaintiff chose to do and not out of the state of the premises; see the judgment of Lord Hoffmanat 80B-D.  Further there was nothing done, or omitted to be done to the fences, which gave rise to a danger.  They did not fall onthe plaintiff; they were perfectly sound fences and not dangerous in themselves.  The danger only arose when they were climbed.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  It was also argued that if the plaintiff was a visitor, he was owed no duty under section 3(2) because he was not using the premisesfor the purposes for which he was invited or permitted to be there.  This must be right, but at the end of the day, this provisionsimply excludes statutory liability to one who, by his actions, has crossed from the category of visitor to that of trespasser.</p>    <p class="heading">What duties, if any, were owed to the plaintiff as a trespasser?</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Lord Diplock summarised the parameters of the duty to trespassers in <i>Herrington</i> at pp 941 in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe duty [to the trespasser] does not arise until the occupier has actual knowledge either of the presence of the trespasser uponhis land or facts which make it likely that the trespasser will come on to his land; and has also actual knowledge of facts as tothe condition of his land or of activities carried out upon it which are likely to cause personal injury to a trespasser who is unawareof the danger. ... Once the occupier has actual knowledge of such facts, his own failure to appreciate the likelihood of the trespasserâspresence or the risk to him involved, does not absolve the occupier from his duty to the trespasser if a reasonable man possessedof the actual knowledge of the occupier would recognise that likelihood and that risk.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest said at 909:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... An occupier owes no duty to make his land fit for trespassers to trespass in. ... [but there is] a duty which, while not amountingto the duty of care which an occupier owes to a visitor, would be a duty to take such steps as common sense or common humanity woulddictate: they would be steps calculated to exclude or to warn or otherwise within reasonable and practicable limits to reduce oravert danger.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In <i>Chan Yan Nam v. Hui Ka Ming &amp; Ors</i>, HCPI 1169 of 2000, I summarised the application of the occupierâs duty to a trespasser as it applied to the facts in the casebefore me, in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... to become liable [the 2nd defendant] would have to know that the condition of the platform was such that it would be dangerousto a trespasser who went on to it and it would have to know or expect that someone would go on to it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  When that case came before the Court of Appeal (CACV 242 of 2002), Le Pichon JA, with whose judgment the other members of the Courtagreed, noted that the appellantâs counsel did not challenge the accuracy of my summary, and did not herself criticise it. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I am therefore emboldened to apply the same summary, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, in this case and to hold that, in order to become liable, Kai Shing would have had to know that the condition of the fencing wassuch that it would be dangerous to a trespasser who climbed it, and would have to know or expect that someone would climb it.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  One needs only to look at the photographs of the fencing to realise that it would be dangerous to a trespasser who climbed it. The fencing is very high and the stands and the fences are vertical.  While one can obviously climb the ladder side of the standsvery easily, climbing on the mesh side would be harder, because the mesh is quite small.  While the mesh provides plenty of hand-holds,it might be difficult, though not impossible, for a an adult to get the toes of his shoes into it though a child might find thateasier.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  There is no suggestion that Kai Shing knew that trespassers did in fact climb the fencing, but it must have known, for it left thecourts unsupervised from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., apart from visits by a patrolling guard, that persons, including children would be ina position to climb the fencing if they wanted to; and there would be nothing and no one to stop them. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  It is also a fact of life that, no matter how high one may build a fence around a ball court to keep the balls in, sooner or latersome player will, through inadvertence or lack of skill, manage to put a ball out of the court.  If a ball goes out of play in thisway, the obvious remedy, where this is possible, is to go and fetch it back.  If the ball goes into an area where one is not supposedto go, e.g. a neighbourâs garden, there is nevertheless a temptation to go there, even if that means climbing a wall or fence. It is notorious that children have been succumbing to that temptation that from time immemorial.  The only difference between thatsituation and the situation here is that in the present case the fence was very high.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  High though the fences may be, to a young person possessed of normal fitness, fortitude and self-reliance they would appear an easyclimb.  The triangular and the flat stands are in the form of ladders with rungs.  Anyone could go up them easily.  One who did somight have problems climbing up or down the mesh side, because the mesh is quite small, and it might be difficult to get the toesof his shoes securely into it.  Nevertheless, there are plenty of hand-holds and toe-holds.  The climb would be easier than thaton an artificial rock-climbing wall, for instance, and probably much easier.  Indeed the plaintiff, having got up the triangularstand, must have got down the mesh side into the volleyball court without mishap.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  It seems to me, therefore, that any reasonable person must expect that from time to time balls would go out of the basketball courtinto the closed volleyball court, and sooner or later, some basketball player would go over the fence to get his ball back.  Theprobability of this happening was low, but, especially where the courts were unsupervised, the risk was there.  It was thereforethe duty of Kai Shing, in the words of Lord Morris, to take such steps as common sense or common humanity would dictate to excludeor to warn or otherwise within reasonable and practicable limits to reduce or avert danger.</p>    <p class="heading">Was there a breach of that duty?</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  As to exclusion, nothing was done.  Given the low probability of someone climbing over, it probably did not need to be.  It wouldcertainly not have been reasonable or practicable to have the court manned at all times when open.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  As to warning, the plaintiff and his father say there were no warning signs at the relevant time.  The defendants have produceda photograph of a âNo Climbingâ sign, though of course we do not know when the photograph was taken.  But I do not think thesematters.  A warning notice will only be of use and will only be required where there is a need to warn and warning will avert thedanger.  Here, the danger is obvious and no warning sign is needed.  Nor would it help in the situation where someone climbs overto get his ball; once he decides to do it, no amount of warning notices will stop him.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The plaintiff pleads the defendants that to post the telephone number of the management office at the courts, so that the userscould seek assistance.  The defendants plead that there was a notice on the wall outside the closed registration office indicatinga telephone number which the users could call for assistance, and that it had a well-established patrol system for the shopping centre,including the basketball courts.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The defendants have produced photographs, nos. 13 and 14 in the photograph bundle, showing three notices, one giving the openinghours of the basketball courts, one setting out a series of rules for its use and beside these, the notice with the telephone number. The first two are on yellow paper and the last on pink paper.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I do not suppose that the patrol system, if there was one, would have done much good to stop someone climbing the fences, no matterhow good it was; the guards could not be there all the time.  However, the notice is important.  Putting up a notice to tell theplayers at an unsupervised basketball court where they can get help, and a telephone number to call, is easy to do and costs littleor nothing.  It is reasonable and practicable.  It would suffice to avert the danger; a player wanting to get his ball back couldcall for assistance rather than being tempted to take the risk of going over a 6-metre fence, no matter how easy the climb looked.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The plaintiff and his father say that the notices shown in the photographs were not there, or not all there, on the day of the accident. Only a notice giving the basketball court opening hours was there.  The plaintiff says that this was the notice shown in the photographsbut his father says that it was not; there was only a handwritten notice at that time. </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In any event the plaintiff and his father agree that there was only one notice on the wall.  They also say that a notice shown inphotograph 12, stuck on the glass door, to the effect that this was the registration office and changing room for the tennis court,was not there either.  The paper of this notice also appears pink on the photograph.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Mr Chan, the defendantsâ witness, says that at the time of the accident, the registration office was not in use; it was only inuse when the tennis court came into use in early 2002.  He did not take the photographs himself, and he accepted that the noticeposted on the glass door of the office was probably not there before the tennis court came into use.  But he insisted that the otherthree notices were posted on the wall since 1999; the rules and the telephone number to call for assistance, as well as the openinghours.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  There is a slight question mark over the evidence of the plaintiff and his father.  If the tennis court was not in use the officewas probably not manned; there would be no point in manning it.  This casts doubt on their evidence that they normally registeredat the counter there.  On the other hand, they were both quite clear that it was sometimes manned and sometimes not.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  What is more important, however, is the appearance of the notices in the photographs.  The notice with the telephone numbers ison pink paper; the others are on yellow paper.  This suggests that they were not put up at the same time.  Indeed the pink noticewith the telephone numbers and the pink notice on the glass door probably went up at the same time, and at a different time fromthe yellow notices.  There would be no need, as Mr Chan accepted, for the notice on the door if the tennis court was not in use. This suggests that the pink notices were not present on the day of the accident. </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I realise that all the witnesses are talking about what was there, or not there, a long time ago; and management companies in housingestates and even private blocks are always putting up notices of one sort and another for people to disregard.  But there is nothingto contradict the plaintiffâs evidence that he waited at the counter for someone to come.  He would have been in a position tosee if there was a notice giving a telephone number that he could call.  He was a straightforward and apparently honest young manand did not give the impression of concealing anything or making anything up. </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The fact that, after the accident, the plaintiffâs younger brother was able to telephone their father also suggests that, if thenotice had been there, one of the boys would have telephoned the number given, either on a mobile phone if they had one, or by askingto borrow a telephone somewhere in the shopping centre.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Considering the evidence as a whole, I am satisfied that the only notice present on the wall on the day of the accident was onewhich gave the opening hours of the basketball court.  There was no notice giving a number to call for assistance.  That, in my view,was a breach of the limited duty which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant owed to any person who was in the foreseeable but not very likely situation of having lost his ball into the closed courtand wishing to retrieve it.  If there had been a notice, the plaintiff could have called the number.  He would not have climbed thefences and the accident would have been avoided.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  I conclude that Kai Shing was in breach of its duty and is therefore liable to the plaintiff for negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">Contributory negligence</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Although the plaintiff does not admit contributory negligence, his counsel Mr Wong accepts that such a finding is inevitable.  Obviouslythe plaintiff was partly to blame.  The danger was obvious.  He said that he did not consider the danger but was pressed to acceptthat now, if given the choice, he would not climb.  In any event he did not take reasonable care for his own safety.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr Lam, for the defendants, argues for a finding of 75% contribution.  He compares the plaintiffâs situation with that in <i>Keown v. Coventry Healthcare NHS Trust</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20953" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 953</a>, a case which he cited in his discussion of the difference between the visitor and the trespasser.  However, I do not find this caseof assistance.  The appeal did not touch on the question of contributory negligence and each case depends on its own facts.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The plaintiffâs evidence is all we have.  According to him, he stood and waited for a guard, and then he looked for one at theguard post.  He found no one.  He did not go to the management office because he did not know where it was; indeed he did not evenknow that there was a management office.  He did not think of going home to ask his parents for help. </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  I find it a little difficult to imagine that an intelligent 12-year-old would not know that there must be a management office somewherein a housing estate, though he might not know where it was.  His father, who says he registered there, might have obtained residentcards for all the family; this is not in evidence.  A more important point is that the plaintiff could easily have gone home withoutthe ball and asked his parents for help; he was due home anyway, and indeed that is why, according to him, he climbed over in orderto retrieve the ball.  There is no evidence from the plaintiff or his father that he would have been in trouble if he had done that.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  As I have said, it would have appeared an easy climb.  A mature man would have had more sense than to try it because of the obviousdanger it poses; but even a young adult might have tried it.  12-year-old boys are often silly and thoughtless.  Everyone knows that. It applies even to boys who, like the plaintiff, have done well at school; there is no real correlation between that and good sense. One cannot expect of a boy of that age the foresight of the reasonable man. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I find the plaintiff 50% liable for the accident. </p>    <p class="heading">Result</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The plaintiff will have judgment for 50% of the agreed quantum figure of $1,600,000, i.e. $800,000.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Counsel advised me that I need not apportion blame between the defendants.  However in view of my findings, it is necessary to considerwhether judgment should be entered against Kai Shing only.  This eventuality was not considered at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I will hear the parties on this and on costs and related matters on a date to be fixed.  This judgment will be handed down in themeantime so that counsel may consider it in advance of the hearing.  If convenient the infant settlement may be dealt with at thesame time. </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(G.P.
