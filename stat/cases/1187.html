The plaintiff is the owner of the property known as Shops Nos. 5 and 6 on the Ground Floor of Princess Mansion(&lsquo;the property&rsquo;).  The property is located at the junction of King&rsquo;s Road and Fuk Yuen Street.  The address ofthe property includes the names of both streets, namely 165A, 167, 167A, 169, 169A, 171, 171A, 173 and 175 King&rsquo;s Road and8-14 Fuk Yuen Street.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="37"><p><a class="para" id="p3" name="p3">3.</a>     On the Fuk Yuen Street side of the property is a wall with <brs_term brs_term_id="21" brs_term_type="9">columns</brs_term> (&lsquo;the wall&rsquo;).  The plaintiff had let part of the wall to the defendant.  The judge found (and of which finding thereis no appeal) that the area let consisted of &lsquo;the external wall of the <brs_term brs_term_id="64" brs_term_type="9">columns</brs_term> and the space in between for the length of about 12 feet&rsquo; (&lsquo;the wall space&rsquo;).  It is not in dispute that the widthof the space that was located between the <brs_term brs_term_id="107" brs_term_type="9">columns</brs_term> was about 1.5 feet to 1.6 feet. </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="38"><p><a class="para" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a>  The defendant rented the wall space from the previous owners of the property since 1968.  The plaintiff became the owner of theproperty and the landlord of the defendant since 31 May 1995.  Written tenancy agreements were entered into by the parties.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="39"><p><a class="para" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a>  It is also not in dispute that the defendant had since 1968 erected a structure of about 3 feet by 12 feet (&lsquo;the originalstall&rsquo;) against the external side of the wall for operating the business of selling ivory and mahjong tiles.  The originalstall was erected on the pavement of Fuk Yuen Street which was land belonging to the Government.  From 1977 onwards the defendanthad obtained from the Urban Council a &lsquo;<brs_term brs_term_id="22" brs_term_type="9">Wall Stall Licence</brs_term>&rsquo; to operate as a <brs_term brs_term_id="23" brs_term_type="9">wall stall hawker</brs_term> at the stall.  This licence was subsequently renamed as the &lsquo;<brs_term brs_term_id="24" brs_term_type="9">Fixed Pitch Hawker Licence</brs_term> (Wall Stall)&rsquo;.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="40"><p><a class="para" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a>  The plaintiff&rsquo;s claim was based on <brs_term brs_term_id="25" brs_term_type="9">forfeiture of the tenancy agreement</brs_term> and nuisance.  The plaintiff claimed that on 15 March 2002, the defendant demolished the original stall and erected a new stall (&lsquo;thenew stall&rsquo;) of a smaller size i.e. about 4 feet 5 inches by 2 feet 7 inches (81.3 cm by 135 cm) at a location of about 2.5inches (about 50 mm) away from the wall.  The defendant continued with his trade in the new stall. </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="41"><p><a class="para" id="p7" name="p7">7.</a>  The plaintiff claimed that the demolition carried out by the defendant was <brs_term brs_term_id="108" brs_term_type="9">in breach of</brs_term> the terms of the tenancy agreement.  The plaintiff further claimed that the defendant had failed to pay the monthly rent of $5,800since 20 January 2002.  These two <brs_term brs_term_id="109" brs_term_type="9">breaches</brs_term> formed the basis of the forfeiture claim.  The plaintiff further claimed that the new stall precluded the plaintiff from lettingout the wall space to other <brs_term brs_term_id="68" brs_term_type="9">tenants</brs_term> and the trading activities of the defendant in the new stall had caused nuisance and annoyance to the plaintiff.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="42"><p><b><u>The <brs_term brs_term_id="1" brs_term_type="9">finding</brs_term></u></b></p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="43"><p><a class="para" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a>  The judge found that the plaintiff and the defendant had in fact reached an agreement on 20 February 2002 that the defendant wouldterminate the tenancy of the wall space on 19 March 2002 and it was agreed by the parties that the two months rental deposit heldby the plaintiff would be used to set off the rent from 20 January 2002 to 19 March 2002.  The judge, however, did not accept thedefendant&rsquo;s evidence that he had informed the plaintiff that he would demolish the original stall.  There is no appeal againstthe <brs_term brs_term_id="2" brs_term_type="9">findings</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="44"><p><a class="para" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a>  On such <brs_term brs_term_id="3" brs_term_type="9">findings</brs_term>, the judge held that the existence of the new stall does not interfere with the rights of the plaintiff.  He held that the new stallis an independent structure standing away from the wall and the defendant no longer occupies the wall space let to him by the plaintiff. He held that <brs_term brs_term_id="26" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> had been delivered by the defendant.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="45"><p><a class="para" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a>  He further held that the original stall was not part of the premises let to the defendant.  As such the demolition was not a demolitionof the &lsquo;partition, fittings and decoration&rsquo; of the wall space let to the defendant.  The defendant was therefore not<brs_term brs_term_id="110" brs_term_type="9">in breach of</brs_term> the terms of the tenancy agreement.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="46"><p><b><u>Was <brs_term brs_term_id="70" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> delivered?</u></b></p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="47"><p><a class="para" id="p11" name="p11">11.</a>  We disagree with the judge that <brs_term brs_term_id="71" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> of the wall space had been delivered by the defendant.  The <brs_term brs_term_id="111" brs_term_type="9">right to vacant possession</brs_term> means actual unimpeded <brs_term brs_term_id="27" brs_term_type="9">physical enjoyment</brs_term> of the wall.  The impediment does not mean any impediment but one which substantially prevents or interferes with the enjoyment ofthe right of possession of a <brs_term brs_term_id="28" brs_term_type="9">substantial part</brs_term> of the property.  This principle is clearly stated i<i>n Cumberland Consolidated Holdings, Limited v. Ireland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1946%5d%201%20KB%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1946] 1 KB 264</a> where the English Court of Appeal was dealing with the question of giving <brs_term brs_term_id="73" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> in a contract of sale of land.  At completion there was rubbish (in the form of many sacks of cement which had hardened) in the propertywhich the vendor refused to remove.  The court found that <brs_term brs_term_id="74" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> was not given by the vendor. </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="48"><p><a class="para" id="p12" name="p12">12.</a>  The right of an owner of a property has as much right to the use and enjoyment of the internal part of his property as the externalwalls of his property.  Again this principle is firmly established in <i>Cobb v. Saxby</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1914%5d%203%20KB%20822" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1914] 3 KB 822</a> where Rowlatt J at page 826 held that,</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="49"><p>&lsquo;He (i.e. the owner) has the right to do anything he likes to the wall, for example to display advertisements upon it, and ifthese rights are invaded or obstructed, he has, in my opinion, a <brs_term brs_term_id="29" brs_term_type="9">good cause of action</brs_term> against the person causing the interference with his rights.&rsquo;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <brs_paragraph id="50"><p><a class="para" id="p13" name="p13">13.</a>  In this case, the wall space let to the defendant is on the external wall of the property.  If the defendant is to <brs_term brs_term_id="30" brs_term_type="9">deliver vacant possession</brs_term> of the wall space let to him then he has to do so in a way which will enable the plaintiff to have unimpeded use of that space. By demolishing the original stall, the defendant would, of course, have provided the plaintiff with unimpeded access and use of thewall space.  However, by erecting the new stall in front of the wall space, the defendant in effect prevented the plaintiff fromusing that part of the external wall of the property.  While the new stall is an independent structure away from the exterior wall,the gap in between this stall and the exterior wall is only about 2.5 inches.  The plaintiff cannot gain access to the external wallof his property through that thin gap.  This thin gap between the wall space and the new stall is meaningless in the context of giving<brs_term brs_term_id="76" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term>.  Although the new stall is on government land, it substantially prevents and interferes with the plaintiff&rsquo;s enjoyment ofthe right of possession of a <brs_term brs_term_id="79" brs_term_type="9">substantial part</brs_term> of its property.  If the principle on the giving of <brs_term brs_term_id="77" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> is recognized and applied, then on no account can it be said that <brs_term brs_term_id="78" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> had been given by the defendant.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="51"><p><b><u>The licence</u></b></p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="52"><p><a class="para" id="p14" name="p14">14.</a>  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (&lsquo;the Department&rsquo;) which has assumed the <brs_term brs_term_id="83" brs_term_type="9">functions</brs_term> of the former Urban Council had continued to grant the defendant a licence to carrying on trading in the new stall.  This licencecannot be an answer to the defendant&rsquo;s failure to <brs_term brs_term_id="112" brs_term_type="9">render vacant possession</brs_term> to the plaintiff.  The defendant may well have a licence from the government to carry out trading in a fixed pitch wall stall ongovernment land, but this is a separate issue from the question of his failure as a <brs_term brs_term_id="82" brs_term_type="9">tenant</brs_term> in giving <brs_term brs_term_id="81" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> of his rented premises to his landlord.

The Urban Council had the power to allocate pitches in a street to hawkers after the Commissioner of Transport had declaredthat a street may be set aside for hawking purpose under the <i>Hawker (Permitted Places) Declaration</i> (&lsquo;the Declaration&rsquo;) (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/132">Cap. 132</a>, Sub.

He was concernedthat the Urban Council might not have the power to grant the licence because the street in question was not subject to a declarationby the Commissioner for Transport.  We are not aware of the subsequent development of this case.  The judgment of 6 December 1991was not cited to the judge. </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="60"><p><b><u>The plaintiff&rsquo;s position</u></b></p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="61"><p><a class="para" id="p19" name="p19">19.</a>  In the present case, Ms Wu, counsel for the plaintiff, stated that Fuk Yuen Street is not one of the streets specified in the Declaration.

The Department is not a party before us.  It is also not necessary to examine whether, if it has such a power, its exercise is nowno longer consistent with the provisions of the Basic Law.  It is further not necessary for us to decide on the correctness of <i>Yu Shu Tung</i>.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="64"><p><a class="para" id="p21" name="p21">21.</a>  Although the judge said he did not rely on the defence of <brs_term brs_term_id="48" brs_term_type="9">statutory authority</brs_term> in <brs_term brs_term_id="49" brs_term_type="9">finding for</brs_term> the defendant, he had dealt with <i>Yu Shu Tung</i> in detail.  It is only right we should state our views on the application of that case.  We are of the firm view that the principlein <i>Allen</i> (as adopted by <i>Yu Shu Tung</i>) is not applicable to a situation like the present one.  In <i>Allen</i>, the appellant was authorised by the <i>Gulf Oil Refining Act 1965</i> (&lsquo;the <i>Act</i>&rsquo;) to construct an oil refinery.  The <brs_term brs_term_id="50" brs_term_type="9">preamble</brs_term> to the <i>Act</i> expressly stated that in order to meet the increasing public demand for the products of the appellant &ldquo;it is essential thatfurther facilities for importation of crude oil and petroleum products and their refinement should be available&rdquo;.  After therefinery was constructed and in operation, the plaintiff brought an action against the appellant for nuisance caused by the operation.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="65"><p><a class="para" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a>  One can immediately see the particular context in which <i>Allen</i> was decided.  It was a claim based on <brs_term brs_term_id="94" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> and if the nuisance created by the operation of the refinery was the inevitable result of the &lsquo;making or doing so authorised&rsquo;,then such an action would not lie.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="66"><p><a class="para" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a>  In the present case, we are concerned with whether a <brs_term brs_term_id="97" brs_term_type="9">tenant</brs_term> has delivered <brs_term brs_term_id="95" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> of rented premises to his landlord.  The question has to be adjudged by the context of this special relationship of the parties andthe law governing <brs_term brs_term_id="98" brs_term_type="9">delivery</brs_term> of <brs_term brs_term_id="96" brs_term_type="9">vacant possession</brs_term> ofa premises.  This by itself is distinguishable from the situation in <i>Yu Shu Tung</i> where the defendants were not in any contractual relationship with the landlord.  To extend the principle stated in <i>Allen</i> to the present situation is totally inappropriate. </p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="67"><p><a class="para" id="p24" name="p24">24.</a>  Proceeding on the basis of the <brs_term brs_term_id="13" brs_term_type="9">finding</brs_term> by the judge, the question of forfeiture and the absence of any written notice of termination by the defendant become irrelevantto the <brs_term brs_term_id="12" brs_term_type="9">issue</brs_term> one has to decide in this case.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="68"><p><b><u>The plaintiff is <brs_term brs_term_id="52" brs_term_type="9">entitled to judgment</brs_term></u></b></p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="69"><p><a class="para" id="p25" name="p25">25.</a>  This being the case, the plaintiff must be entitled to <brs_term brs_term_id="14" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> as follows :</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="70"><p>(1)    An <brs_term brs_term_id="51" brs_term_type="9">order for vacant possession</brs_term> of the wall space rented to the defendant. </p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="71"><p>(2)    In order to ensure that the plaintiff may properly enjoy that part of the wall space which is now the subject matter of thedispute, the court will grant an <brs_term brs_term_id="99" brs_term_type="9">injunction</brs_term> requiring the defendant to remove the new stall from its existing location so as to enable the plaintiff to <brs_term brs_term_id="54" brs_term_type="9">gain unimpeded access to</brs_term> that particular part of the exterior wall of the property in Fuk Yuen Street.
