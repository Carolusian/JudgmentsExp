There are many of them and from time to time they are involvedin accidents. Not unnaturally some owners have sought to devise means of avoiding liability for damage caused by the negligence ofthe drivers. The important question in the present case is whether the appellant Owner has successfully avoided liability for damagecaused to the Plaintiff by the undoubted negligence of the Driver of his bus. The trial judge held that he had not. The Appellantcontends that the judge, having come to the right conclusion as to the law which ought to be applied, has applied it wrongly to theprimary facts which he had found.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Owner engaged a company to manage his bus. The learned judge observed that liability was not to be evaded by the interpositionof any number of managers between the Owner and the Driver, and that the test must be:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"If the owner himself had made the arrangements directly with the driver instead of through an intermediary would he have been liablefor the driver's negligence? "</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>That was clearly right.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> There was no evidence as to the full terms of the arrangement between the Owner and the company but the managing director of thecompany gave evidence that it "hired out" buses to drivers who wished to use them.  The Owner paid the insurance premiums and paidthe company $200 a month as a "management fee." Out of this the company provided "spare" tyres - by which, I suspect, vas meant replacementtyres - and a cleaning service. In fulfilment of this arrangement the company advertised in the "employment column" of newspapersin the following terms:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Our company employs experienced public light bus drivers. We invite experienced public light bus drivers to come to our company andregister themselves and we will hire out public light buses to them. "</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>It will be seen at once that the advertisement was misleading in that it refers first to employment and then to hiring out. The respondentDriver was apparently one of those who answered the advertisment. What contract was in fact made with him is necessarily to be ascertainedfrom the evidence. Neither the Owner nor the company paid anything to the Driver, but the Driver paid to the company, for the accountof the Owner, an agreed sum for each shift during which the bus was available for his use. It was entirely up go the Driver, if,when and where he plied for hire (assuming that to be a correct term for the act of soliciting passengers for carriage in a bus)and clearly his liability to pay the agreed amounts to the Owner was not dependent upon his having received them by way of fares.In that respect (inter alia) the case is distinguishable from <u>Powles</u> v. <u>Hider</u> (1856) 6 El. &amp;B1. 207. The bus was apparently available for the use of the Driver at all times, but he was entitled to give threedays' notice of his intention not go drive and, if he did so, a substitute driver would be found. The Driver put all his takingsinto his own pocket, but, in addition to the fixed sum payable to the company for each shift, the Driver had to pay for fuel andto make good any damage. The managing director said that the Driver is told to keep public light bus in good repair , but it is notclear to me whether that required him to effect routine maintenance since he said further: when public light bus has to be testedit is driven by staff of garage to which we send it for repair before hand."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The judge found it unnecessary to decide whether the Driver was the servant of the Owner, because he rightly concluded that the questionwhich he had to decide was :</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Did the 1st defendant owner delegate a task to the 2nd defendant driver to do something for his (the lst defendant's) benefit? "</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>However, he went on :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Undoubtedly the 1st defendant did delegate the task of driving his 'bus to the 2nd defendant, albeit through the Hong Kong publicLight Bus Trading Co., Ltd., who "found" the 2nd defendant for him. Was the driving of the 'bus for the 1st defendants benefit? Ithink that I may safely assume that no one purchases and licences a public light bus for any other purpose than that it shall plyfor hire with a view to his enrichment. And whether such enrichment takes the form of hiring charges or some other form seems tome to be altogether immaterial."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>With great respect I think that in this passage the judge abandoned the question which he had properly posed for himself and revertedto the "interest or benefit" test which was rejected by the House of lords in <u>Morgans</u> v. <u>Launchbury</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1973%20A%20C%20127" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1973 A. C. 127.</a> The Owner did not delegate the task of driving his bus at all and the driving of it did not (at least directly) benefit him in anyway. It is doubtless fair to assume that no one purchases and licenses a public light bus for any other purpose than that it shallbe used to ply for hire, and it is also fair to assume that a person who does purchase and license such a vehicle expects to be enrichedas a result, but it is not to be assumed that he will ply for hire himself or that his enrichment will result from the plying forhire rather than from a hiring to someone else for the purpose of plying for hire. In the present case it mattered not to the Ownerwhether the Driver plied for hire, provided that he paid the hire charges. The Driver was engaged solely upon his own business andany enrichment resulting from that business was his and his alone.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In <u>Lam Chun lan</u> v. <u>Lo King-shing</u> 1980 Victoria District Court Civil Action No. 5483 (reported only at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20Hong%20Kong%20Law%20Journal%2085" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">12 H. K. L. J. 85)</a> another judge in a somewhat similar case inferred an agency from what he described as a request by the owner of the public lightbus and the fact that the owner's name and address appeared on the door of the vehicle. Although there was no evidence of this beforethe judge in the present case, the name and address of the Owner no doubt also appeared in a conspicuous place inside the publiclight bus, since that was required by reg. 137c(b) of the Road Traffic (Construction and Use) Regulations.  Whatever evidence ofa request there may have been in that case there was certainly none here: the fact that the Owner, through the management company,advertised in the manner indicated could not constitute a request by him that any person who hired a vehicle as a result of the advertisementshould drive as the agent of the Owner. The presence of the Owner's name and address pursuant to the regulations equally could nothave any bearing on the relationship between the Owner and the Driver. If it be thought that the person whose name and address isthus marked on a vehicle should always be vicariously liable for the negligence of the driver of that vehicle, regardless of thelegal relationship between them, it must be for the Legislature so to enact, for that would be a sweeping change in the law.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> We were referred to a decision of mine in the District Court, <u>Jor Sau Tong Medicine Co.</u> v. <u>Lo Yiu</u> <i>[</i>1960<i>]</i> H. K. C. L. R. 141, where the evidence bore a superficial resemblance to the evidence here and where I held that the owner of thevan was liable for the negligence of the driver. Unfortunately the headnote stated, inaccurately, that I had found that "the 1stDefendant was a bailee of the van under a contract of hire and was the agent of the 2nd Defendant". That would have been a contradiction.A reading of the judgment shows that in truth I disbelieved the evidence that the 1st Defendant was a bailee under a contract ofhire. I gave reasons for my disbelief and my conclusion was apparently not challenged on appeal. Here the judge made primary findingswhich should inevitably have led hint to the conclusion that the Driver was a bailee under a contract of hire, and yet the judgefound him to be an agent. It is this inconsistent finding of which the Owner complains and which forms the crux of the appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr. Lee on behalf of the Plaintiff sought to argue that some kind of statutory agency arose by virtue of the tents of reg. 5 of theRoad Traffic (Public Services Vehicles) Regulations in that there was a personal duty imposed by the public light bus licence onthe licensee to provide an efficient public light bus service. This contention was not open on the pleadings, was not argued beforethe District Judge and notice of it was not given to the Appellant by cross notice or otherwise. We declined to allow it to be takenbefore us.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It is to be observed that the Driver as well as the Plaintiff was made a respondent to this appeal, although no relief was soughtagainst him. He did not appear at the hearing.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> For the reasons given I would allow the appeal and enter judgment for the Appellant, the 1st Defendant in the action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Yang, J.
