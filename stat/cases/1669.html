The Bishop was the registered holder of inter alia 12,557 shares in the respondentcompany (to which I will refer hereafter as "the Bank") represented by four certificates. The Bishop held shares in the Bank in additionto the 12,557 shares and the certificates for these were held by the Bank's Securities Department which had in its records a specimensignature of the Bishop. Some time prior to the 3rd May 1973 the four certificates in question were apparently stolen from the Bishopbut he remained in ignorance of the theft. In May 1973 the four certificates in question were presented to the Bank by Stanley YeungStock Brokers Co. ("the brokers") together with completed share transfer forms. The presentation was made by the brokers under coverof standard forms of letter addressed to the Bank's registrar which stated that the certificates were enclosed "with duly completedtransfer deeds attached in favour of Mr. WONG Kwan-man as transferee." This standard form of letter requested the registrar of theBank to effect the transfer and to send the new certificates to the brokers. The staff of the Bank's registry placed no stock uponthe personality of those who submitted requests for transfer whether those requests were made by letter as in this case or in personover the counter. Although the Bank had been supplied with a specimen of the Bishop's signature, when they received the certificatesand transfer deeds from the appellants, the staff of the Bank failed to compare the signatures on the transfers with the Bishop'ssignature on the specimen cards. Had they done so, they would have immediately realised that the Bishop's signature on the transferwas not genuine because the discrepancies between the signatures on the transfers and the genuine signature were immediately obviousto the naked eye and would as the learned trial judge found as a fact have been noticed even by a layman. Neither the Bishop norWONG Kwan-man was a regular client of the appellants and the appellants had not taken part in any transaction of sale and purchase.They received no consideration from WONG Kwan-man for presenting the scripts to the Bank for registration nor there is any indicationon the instruments of transfer themselves (as distinct from the covering letter) that they were acting as brokers in presenting them.On the 2nd June1973 the Bank advised the Bishop that the transfers purporting to be signed by him together with the relative certificateshad been lodged for registration and that if the Bank did not hear from him by return it would assume that the transfers were inorder. The Bishop did not reply to this letter. Almost immediately after its despatch the Bank informed the appellants that new sharecertificates in the name of WONG Kwan-man were ready for collection. It would appear that the new certificates were in due coursecollected by the appellants. The true position became apparent a few months later and eventually the Bishop brought this action torequire the Bank to reinstate him on the register and make good the lost dividends, bonus shares etc. which should have been madeavailable to the Bishop between the date of the new registration and the date of the commencement of the action. The Bank defendedthe action taken by the Bishop but the only defence which it offered was that the signatures of the Bishop to the deeds of transferwere not forged. This was readily disposed of by the Bishop in whose favour an order was made for the relief which he had claimed.The Bank, however, had issued, with leave third party notices against, inter alia, the first and second appellants claiming thatthe first appellant was the sole proprietor of the brokers at all material times and that the second appellant having become a partnerin the brokers on the 21st January 1974 without having given notice pursuant to the provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer of Businesses Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/49">Cap. 49</a> wasliable for the debts and liabilities of the first appellant as at 21st January 1974. This was not disputed before us so that theappeal proceeded on the basis that the appellants were liable for the debts and liabilities of the brokers at relevant times. Itwas the Bank's case that by presenting the deeds of transfer the brokers had warranted that the signatures on the deeds of transferwere genuine and that the transactions evidenced by the instruments of transfer were of a genuine nature. It was on the basis ofthis warranty that the Bank sought to be indemnified against the loss occasioned to it by its liability to reinstate the Bishop asthe holder of the shares in question. The Bank is a corporation, created by the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank Ordinance 1866 andcontinues to be incorporated by the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation Ordinance Chapter 70. By section 4 of that Ordinancethe regulations of the Bank for the time being in force replace the original deed of settlement. Section 4 also provides that theregulations shall be binding in all respects upon the Bank and upon all persons whatsoever, whether shareholders or not, and shallregulate the rights and liabilities of all the above persons inter se their heirs, executors, administrators, assigns or successors.The regulations claimed to be relevant to this case are regulations 46, 48 53 and 54. Regulation 46 reads as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Bank shall keep at its head office or at such other place as the board may approve and at any establishment where a local registerof shares is kept records to be called 'registers of transfers' and therein shall respectively be fairly and distinctly entered particularsof every transfer or transmission of any shares on those respective registers. Such records may in the sole discretion of the boardbe copies of information maintained elsewhere with the sanction of the Board whether by devices for storing and processing of informationor otherwise."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Regulation 48 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The board may in its discretion and without assigning any reason therefor, refuse to register the transfer of any share to any personof whom it does not approve as transferee, or whilst the shareholder making the same is, either alone or jointly with any other person,indebted to the bank on any account whatsoever. The board may also refuse to register any transfer of shares on which the Bank hasa lien; and the board shall also be entitled without assigning any specific reason therefor to refuse to register any transfer ofshares made to a corporation, sole or aggregate or to a firm or to a limited partnership or to any person, firm or corporation holdingshares in trust or otherwise than in his or their own right, whether already a shareholder or not."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Regulation 53 paragraph 1 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Save as provided in paragraph 2 shares in the Bank shall be transferred by an instrument under hand signed by the transferor andthe transferee in the form set out in Appendix II or in any usual or common form which the board may approve."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Regulation 53 paragraph 4 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Every instrument of transfer shall be left with the Bank or at any other place from time to time designated by the board for registrationin that one of the registers in which the shares are entered accompanied by the certificate of the shares to be transferred and suchother evidence as the board or the deputed person or persons referred to in regulation 52 may require to prove the title of the transferoror his right to transfer the shares."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Regulation 54 provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where the instrument of transfer has been so registered the transferee shall be and be deemed a shareholder and shall from the dateof such registration be entitled to the same privileges and advantages and ... be subject to the same liabilities in respect of theshares as the shareholder from whom he derived his title."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The form of transfer set out in Appendix II of the rules provided for the following matters : the name and address of the transferor;the consideration; the name and address of the transferee; the number of shares to be transferred and an agreement by the transfereeto take the shares subject to the conditions on which they had been held by the transferor; the form requires the signature of theparties but does not provide for their signatures to be witnessed. The forms of transfer which were actually used in this case withwhich I will deal later were provided by the Bank and required the signatures of the transferor and the transferee to be witnessedand for the witnesses to state their address and calling. The purported signatures of the Bishop and of WONG Kwan-man were purportedlywitnessed by a Mr. WONG Man whose address and calling did not appear. The Bank then have a statutory duty to keep the register, aduty which entails registering as shareholders those whom they accept as shareholders under transfers which they may at their discretionaccept or refuse. There was no duty to register these transfers made in the name of the Bishop. The Bank had a discretion so to do.It is perhaps unnecessary to note that there can never be a duty on the part of the registrars of a company to register forged transfersbut the duty not to do so is owed, not to the public at large nor to a person presenting the forged transfer, but to the person whoseinterests will be immediately effected by the registration i.e. in this case to the owner whose signature as transferee has beenforged.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> It was the defence of the appellants throughout that at all material times they did not know of the forgery, acted bona fide andwere not attesting or otherwise verifying parties to the signature of the Bishop. The appellants sought to contend that the Bankknew or ought to have known from the contents of the deeds of transfer that the signature of the Bishop had not been attested orverified by the brokers, that the Bank kept shareholders' specimen signatures and ought to have checked the signatures appearingon the deeds of transfer against its record and were negligent in failing to make any adequate check or other inquiries. It was theappellants' case also that the Bank could have but did not defend the Bishop's action on the ground that the Bishop was negligentin causing or contributing to the loss by failing to notify the Bank of the theft of the certificates in question and failing toreply to the letter from the Bank by which it notified the Bishop of the intended transfer. The learned trial judge held that inthe circumstances of the case a warranty on the part of the brokers was implied by law and that consequently the appellants werebound to indemnify the Bank against any loss it may suffer by reason of compliance with the request of Stanley Yeung Stock BrokersCo. It is against that decision that the appellants now appeal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The grounds of appeal are that the learned trial judge erred in law in holding that a warranty was implied by law that the sharetransfer forms and the signatures thereon were genuine and that Stanley Yeung Stock Brokers Co. in presenting the same to the Bankfor registration of transfer were bound to indemnify the Bank against the loss.

Furthermore ifthe respondent had (as it should have) adequately checked the signatures it would have noticed the forgery and would have a ministerialor other duty to reject transfer.

A further ground of appeal relied on was that thelearned judge erred in law in holding that a duty of care on the part of the Bank was a prerequisite in apportioning liability forcontributory negligence and that alternatively on the learned judge's findings of facts liability should have been apportioned.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The first matter for decision therefore is whether any warranty did arise in the circumstances of this case and if it did the natureof that warranty.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Cases in which such warranty or implied contract of indemnity was implied find their first crystallization in <u>Dugdale &amp; Others</u> v. <u>Lovering</u><sup>(1)</sup>. There the plaintiffs who were in possession of certain trucks claimed by the defendant and by others parted with the trucks to thedefendant at the request of the defendant having earlier asked the defendant for an indemnity if they should deliver up the trucksto him. He did not answer them as to the indemnity but required them to deliver up the trucks to him. This they did. They were subsequentlysued by the other party for conversion of the trucks. The claim proved well-founded and the plaintiffs were obliged to pay in settlement.They sought to recover the amount of the payment from the defendant upon an implied contract of indemnity. It was held followingthe doctrine laid down in <u>Betts</u> v. <u>Gibbins</u><sup>(2)</sup>and <u>Toplis</u> v. <u>Grane</u><sup>(3)</sup> that there was evidence of an implied promise to indemnify. Brett, J. stated the problem succinctly at page 198:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is clear from the correspondence that the plaintiffs delivered these trucks to the defendant upon the request of the defendantand it is also clear that they belonged in truth to the Kiveton Park Colliery Company, who have made the plaintiffs answerable forsuch delivery. Under these circumstances, does there arise an implied promise by the defendant to indemnify the plaintiffs?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In the course of his judgment he deals with the earlier cases of <u>Adamson</u> v. <u>Jarvis</u><sup>(4)</sup>; <u>Humphrys</u> v. <u>Pratt</u><sup>(5)</sup>; <u>Betts</u> v. <u>Gibbins</u><sup>(2)</sup> and <u>Toplis</u> v. <u>Grane</u><sup>(3)</sup> and examines the correspondence between the parties and goes on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"From these letters I think the jury might well have found that the plaintiffs were justified in believing and did believe that thedefendant would indemnify them if they incurred liability. It is not necessary, however, in my opinion, to determine more than thatthe correspondence did not conclusively shew that the plaintiffs were not relying on an indemnity."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Grove, J. had the following observations to make:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I do not find that in these cases there is anything to show that the expressions must be limited to the case of agency. I shouldhesitate to say that in cases of this sort it can be an absolute proposition of law that the party making the request is bound toindemnify. Whether there is such an obligation must greatly depend on the circumstances of each individual case, the effect of whichseems to be for the jury to determine. All I wish to be considered as deciding is that in the present case there was reasonable evidencefor the jury of an implied contract of indemnity."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay &amp; Others</u><sup>(6)</sup> the facts were remarkably similar to those in the present case save that there was no question of agency. The facts were that a bankerin good faith sent to a corporation a transfer of corporation stock which purported to be executed by both of two registered holdersin favour of the bankers nominee with a request to the corporation to register the stock in the name of the bankers nominee. Thecorporation in good faith acted upon this request and granted a fresh certificate to the bankers nominee who transferred the stockto third parties. The third parties were registered as holders. Afterwards it was discovered that the signature of one of the tworegistered holders of the stock had been forged by the other and the one recovered against the corporation judgment whereby theywere compelled to buy equivalent stock and register it in the name of the registered holder whose name had been forged and pay himmissing dividends with interest. It was held that the banker was bound to indemnify the corporation against the liability to thevictim of the forgery upon an implied contract that the transfer was genuine. The expression "both parties having acted bona fideand without negligence" appears in the headnote. This is not an expression which is used in the judgments. In the course of his judgmentthe Earl of Halsbury L.C. at page 396 had this to say:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="89%" class="quote">Now, apart from any decision upon the question (it being taken for granted that all the parties were honest), I should have thoughtthat the bank were clearly liable. They have a private bargain with a customer. Upon his assurance they take a document from himas a security for a loan, which they assume to be genuine. I do not suggest that there was any negligence- perhaps business couldnot go on if people were suspecting forgery in every transaction - but their position was obviously very different from that of thecorporation. The corporation is simply ministerial in registering a valid transfer and issuing fresh certificates. They cannot refuseto register, and though for their own sake they will not and ought not to register or to issue certificates to a person who is notreally the holder of the stock, yet they have no machinery, and they cannot inquire into the transaction out of which the transferarises. The bank, on the other hand, is at liberty to lend their money or not. They can make any amount of inquiries they like. Ifthey find that an intended borrower has a co-trustee, they may ask him or the co-trustee himself whether the co-trustee is a partyto the loan, and a simple question to the co-trustee would have prevented the fraud. They take the risk of the transaction and lendthe money. The security given happens to be in a form that requires registration to make it available, and the bank 'demand' - as,if genuine transfers are brought, they are entitled to do - that the stock shall be registered in their name or that of their nominees,and are also entitled to have fresh certificates issued to themselves or nominees. This was done, and the corporation by acting onthis 'demand' have incurred a considerable loss.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="1%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="89%" class="quote">          As I have said, I think if it were res integra I should think the bank were liable; but I do not think it is res integra,but is covered by authority."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="1%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">The Earl of Halsbury goes on to approve as a general principle of law that put forward by Mr. Cave in <u>Dugdale</u> v. <u>Lovering</u><sup>(1)</sup> in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is a general principle of law when an act is done by one person at the request of another which act is not in itself manifestlytortious to the knowledge of the person doing it, and such act turns out to be injurious to the rights of a third party, the persondoing it is entitled to an indemnity from him who requested that it should be done."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Lord Davey at page 399 put the matter in this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I think that the appellants have a statutory duty to register all valid transfers, and on the demand of the transferee to issue tohim a fresh certificate of title to the stock comprised therein. But, of course, it is a breach of their duty and a wrong to theexisting holders of stock for the appellants to remove their names and register the stock in the name of the supposed transfereeif the latter has, in fact, no title to require the appellants to do so. I am further of opinion that where a person invested witha statutory or common law duty of a ministerial character is called upon to exercise that duty on the request, direction, or demandof another (It does not seem to me to matter which word you use), and without any default on his own part acts in a manner whichis apparently legal but is, in fact, illegal and a breach of the duty, and thereby incurs liability to third parties, there is impliedby law a contract by the person making the request to keep indemnified the person having the duty against any liability which mayresult from such exercise of the supposed duty. And it makes no difference that the person making the request is not aware of theinvalidity in his title to make the request, or could not with reasonable diligence have discovered it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">This he says is "the broad principle to be deduced from such cases as <u>Humphrys</u> v. <u>Pratt</u><sup>(5)</sup>, <u>Betts</u> v. <u>Gibbins</u><sup>(2)</sup>, <u>Toplis</u> v. <u>Grane</u><sup>(3)</sup> and the other cases which have been cited". At page 401 of his judgment Lord Davey has this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In some cases it is a question of fact whether the circumstances are such as to raise the implication of a contract for indemnity;but in cases like the one now before your Lordships, when a person is requested to exercise a statutory duty for the benefit of theperson making the request, I think that the contract ought to be implied. It matters not to the corporation whether A. or B. is theholder of stock, but to the purchaser who has paid his purchase-money or the banker who has lent money on the security of the stockit is of vital interest. The Court of Appeal distinguished the sheriff's cases on the ground that the request was to execute hisduty in a particular manner. In the cases in question that was so. But I think the argument haeret in cortice, and is neither logicalnor maintainable. It is difficult to imagine a case where a person should innocently request the sheriff to execute a writ which,though apparently regular, is in fact fictitious or invalid. If such a case be possible it would come within the exact words of TindalC.J.; and I entertain no doubt that the person presenting the writ would be held liable to indemnify the sheriff. It does not seemto matter at what stage of the transaction the request to do an act which turns out to be outside the officer's duty is made. Inthe present case, as pointed out by Mr. Bankes, the appellants ran no real risk until they issued the new certificate on the demandof the respondents."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">At page 403 having expressly dissented from the views put forward by Lindley, J. (as he then was) in <u>Anglo-American Telegraph Co.</u> v. <u>Spurling</u><sup>(7)</sup> he went on:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">I dissent from the proposition that a person who brings a transfer to the registering authority and requests him to register it makesno representation that it is a genuine document, and I am disposed to think (though it is not necessary to decide it in the presentcase) that he not only affirms it is genuine, but warrants that it is so. I think that this is the result of the decision in <u>Oliver</u> v. <u>Bank of England</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281902%29%201%20Ch%20610" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1902) 1 Ch. 610</a>, affirmed in this House under the name of <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>Bank of England</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281903%29%20AC%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1903) A.C. 114.</a> It may be argued with some force that for this purpose no solid distinction can be made between the power of attorney through whichthe transfer of Consols is effected and the deed of transfer in the present case. Each of these instruments, it may be said, is putforward as evidence of the authority with which the person making the application professed to be clothed to request the removalof the stockholder's name and the substitution of another name in his place. But, however this may be, it is enough for the decisionof this appeal to say that the deed of transfer was put forward as a genuine document, and the appellants were invited to act uponit as such.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          I am also of opinion that the authority keeping a stock register has no duty of keeping the register correct which theyowe to those who come with transfers.

This point was decided by all the learned judges who took part in the decision of the first case of <u>Simm</u> v. <u>Anglo-American</u> <u>Telegraph Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=5%20QBD%20188" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(5 Q.B.D. 188)</a> I will content myself with quoting the language of Cotton L.J. at page 214:</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="14%" class="quote">'</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="85%" class="quote">The duty of the company is not to accept a forged transfer, and no duty to make inquiries exists towards the person bringing the transfer.It is merely an obligation upon the company to take care that they do not get into difficulties in consequence of their acceptinga forged transfer, and it may be said to be an obligation towards the stockholder not to take the stock out of his name unless hehas executed a transfer; but it is only a duty in this sense, that unless the company act upon a genuine transfer they may be liableto the real stockholder.'</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="1%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">True it is that the appellants, following what is now the usual practice, gave notice of the transfer which had been brought in tothe persons named as transferors, but they had no duty to do so, and it was done merely for their own protection.

That, of course, is so,and the appellants admit that if they were suing on the warranty their action would be out of time. But I can see no legal reasonwhy, in circumstances like those of the present case, it should not be held, if necessary, that the true contract to be implied fromthose circumstances is not only a warranty of the title, but also an agreement to keep the person in the position of the appellantsindemnified against any loss resulting to them from the transaction. And I think that justice requires we should so hold. I agreewith the Lord Chief Justice that, as between these two innocent parties, the loss should be borne by the respondents who caused theappellants to act upon an instrument which turned out to be invalid."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is noteworthy that in seeking to distinguish this case Mr. Litton did so upon two grounds : firstly, on the basis that his clientthe appellant was a mere conduit pipe, a bare agent for the transferee, and secondly on the basis that the bank were in default inthat they might, had they bothered to inspect the signature specimen card in their possession relating to the Bishop, have discoveredthe forgery without difficulty. He emphasised particularly the words used by Lord Davey at page 399 of the report from which I havequoted "without any default" and suggested that in any event the warranty given was not the warranty of the appellants but the warrantyof their principal the transferee. It is, in this connection, to be noted that the stock brokers request was for the new certificatesto be returned to themselves and not to WONG Kwan-man. New certificates were in due course returned to them and not WONG Kwan-man.The stock brokers must have appeared to the Bank at any rate despite the absence of their chop from the transfer forms to have beenacting in the ordinary course of business and in the eyes of the Bank the brokers may have had a very good reason for requestingthat the certificates be returned to them rather than to the transferee. The Bank did so and requested the brokers to pay the transferfees. Apparently the brokers did.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Again it is argued that the Bank, because of its regulations and because the transfer although in a form approved by the Bank didnot bear the address and calling of the attesting witness, had a discretion to refuse them registration. From this Mr. Litton seeksto suggest that in registering them the Bank was not performing a ministerial duty in doing so. I do not think this follows. TheBank had a ministerial duty to keep the register. In the purported but mistaken exercise of that duty it exercised its discretionat the request of the brokers to register the "transferee" as owner of the shares. In doing so it seems to me to be only logicalto regard it acting pursuant to its ministerial and statutory duty.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It was the respondent's submission that a broker putting forward shares to a company for transfer is deemed in law to furnish a contractof indemnity, on the basis that the transfers are genuine and if they turn out to be forged liability attaches to the brokers. Mr.Dicks referred to a number of textbooks in which that rule is formulated. The rule is baldly stated in Halsbury 4th Ed. Vol. 7 p.229paragraph 414 under the heading "Forged Transfers":</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A person who, innocently, and even without negligence, brings about the transfer is bound to indemnify the company against any liabilityto the owner of the shares who has been displaced by a forged transfer."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The learned authors quote <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay &amp; Others</u><sup>(6)</sup> as authority for this proposition and they also refer to <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>The Bank of England</u><sup>(8)</sup>; <u>The Bank of England</u> v. <u>Cutler</u><sup>(9)</sup>; <u>Welch</u> v. <u>The Bank of England</u><sup>(10)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Palmer 22nd Ed. Vol. 1 at page 406 para. 40-28 states the rule with more particularity in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A person, claiming under a forged transfer, who sends in and procures registration of the transfer and the issue of a fresh certificateis bound, though acting in good faith, to indemnify the company. On the same principle, where a stockbroker, acting innocently undera forged power of attorney from one of two trustees of stock, had induced the Bank of England to transfer the stock, he was heldliable to indemnify the Bank of England as having impliedly warranted his authority to the Bank."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The use of the words "claiming under a forged transfer" seem to indicate the learned authors of Palmer were not prepared to go asfar as the learned authors of Halsbury. Gore-Browne on Companies has this to say at page 379:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But estoppel cannot be invoked by a person who has presented for registration a forged transfer in his favour. Indeed such a personmay instead be required by the company to reimburse it for any damages that it has been compelled to pay out to a third party underthe estoppel principle."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">For this Gore-Browne quotes <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup> as authority. The learned author goes on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The proposition, just stated, that a company can claim reimbursement for any damages it has had to pay out on a forged transfer fromthe person who presented the transfer for registration, stems from the wider principle that a person presenting a transfer impliedlywarrants that it is genuine and given with due authority. Thus, a broker who deposits a forged transfer in good faith is liable tothe company for any loss it may suffer thereby."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">For this bold statement <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup> is again quoted as authority. The learned author continues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"and, if a broker represents, whether in good faith or not, that he has authority to act for the supposed transferor when in facthe has not, he is liable to the company upon an implied warranty that he has authority."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">For this <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>The Bank of England</u><sup>(8)</sup> is relied on. The question for decision appears to me however to be whether these three learned authors may be going too far in arguing,(insofar as they do) that a broker acting as a mere agent who puts forward a forged transfer on behalf of his principal is so liable.The use by Palmer of the phrase "<u>claiming</u> under a forged transfer" and the use by Gore-Browne of the words "in his favour" would appear to suggest some limitation on the phrase"the person who presented the transfer for registration". The following passage appears in Halsbury 3rd Ed. Vol. 36 p.520 para. 788:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Warranty of authority. A broker who represents himself as possessing the authority of his clients warrants the truth of that representation,and is liable in damages to any one who, relying upon the truth of it, acts to his detriment, whether by entering into a contractwith the broker or otherwise."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">For this proposition <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>The Bank of England</u><sup>(8)</sup>and <u>Collen</u> v. <u>Wright</u><sup>(11)</sup> are quoted as authority. I do not consider that the cases based on warranty of authority are directly relevant to our considerationsfor in our case the brokers did not warrant that they were acting on the part of the Bishop whose signature was forged. If they warrantedthat they were acting on behalf of anyone it was on behalf of WONG Kwan-man. Their standard letter reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We beg to enclose herewith the undermentioned certificates for ........... shares in your company with duly completed transfer deedsattached in favour of Mr. WONG Kwan-man and shall be glad if you will kindly effect the transfer and send to us the new certificateswhen ready."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The certificates number and the name of the holder are inserted in the bottom of this letter. In the normal course of business stockbrokers sending transfer documents to a company would send them on behalf of the transferee rather than on behalf of the transferor.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> There are, then, two lines of authority. The one stemming from such cases as <u>Collen</u> v. <u>Wright</u><sup>(11)</sup> to the effect that an agent warrants that he has the authority of his principal putting forward a share transfer. <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>The Bank of England</u><sup>(8)</sup> is an example of this. The second line of authority stems from the early "sheriff" cases and runs through <u>Dugdale</u> v. <u>Lovering</u><sup>(1)</sup> to culminate in <u>Sheffield</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup> is to the effect that a claimant under a forged transfer that is to say a person who would obtain benefit under the forged transferif it were not forged, who presents the forged transfer to a company who registered it as a result is bound to indemnify the company.The question then is whether or not the authorities go so far to render liable a broker who presents a forged transfer on behalfof the transferee under a transfer to which the "transferors" signature is forged. <u>Sheffield</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup>appears to have been limited to the case of the person who "claimed the benefit under the forged transfer", although there were infact two respondents, Barclay &amp; Co. Ltd. who forwarded the transfer to the Sheffield Corporation and Barclay who was registeredas the new owner. This may be to make a distinction where there was little or no difference. Lord Halsbury ignores any such distinctionin saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The bank which lent the money" (for which the stock was to be security) "sent the transfer to the proper officer of the corporationand demanded, as they were entitled to do if the transfer was a genuine one that they should be registered as the holders of thestock."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">There was no distinction drawn between the two respondents in the argument and and it was never suggested, as it is here, that thelimited company was not a person "claiming under a forged transfer". Is, then, a broker who presents a forged transfer as the appellantsdid here "a person claiming under a forged transfer" within the rule in <u>Sheffield</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup>? To put it another way did the brokers here by sending the forged transfer on behalf of WONG Kwan-man both acting in good faith,warrant not only that they had the authority of WONG Kwan-man but also that the transfer is genuine? Does their warranty go beyonda warranty of their authority to act and amount to a warranty of the authenticity of the document under which the act requested isto be performed? On their facts neither <u>Sheffield</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup> nor <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>The Bank of England</u><sup>(8)</sup> is conclusive. No agent was involved in <u>Sheffield</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup>; it was the authority of the agent to act which was questioned in <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>The Bank of England</u><sup>(8)</sup>. For in <u>Starkey's Case</u> the broker mistakenly believed himself to be instructed by the stockholder. He was not because the power of attorney in his favourwas forged. It was contended by counsel for the respondents that <u>The Bank of England</u> v. <u>Cutler</u><sup>(9)</sup> brings the two lines of authority together. There the Bank of England before registering any transfer of stock required to be satisfiedthat the person claiming to transfer was the person entitled to the stock. The Bank of England kept a list of stockbrokers whoseidentification of intending transferors would be accepted by them. They also accepted identifications made by some of their own staffor representatives of private banks. Cutler was one of the recognised stockbrokers. A woman, fraudulently personating another whowas a registered holder of stock, secured an instruction to Cutler in the name of the holder of that stock, and instructed him toprepare a transfer. On Cutler's introduction the personator attended and forged the holder's signature at the bank Cutler identifyingher as the holder. The stock was subsequently transferred to a purchaser bona fide and for value. The original stockholder claimedto be reinstated. The bank purchased stock of the like amount, transferred it to the original stockholder and sued the defendantfor an indemnity. It was held that the proper inference of fact was that Cutler's request to the bank to permit the entry and registrationof the forged transfer involved the legal consequence that the defendant contracted to indemnify the plaintiffs against any liabilityresulting therefrom. On the facts then the <u>Bank of England</u> v. <u>Cutler</u><sup>(9)</sup> is almost on all fours with the present case. Vaughan Williams L.J. dissenting on the question as to whether or not a request tomake the teansfer was to be inferred from the broker's introduction had this to say: (at page 221)</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay</u> was decided on the ground that the transfer was put forward as a genuine document, and that the corporation was invited by the bankto act upon it as such. Sometimes the obligation to indemnify is implied in cases where the request is made by a person representingthat he is an agent for another acting with authority, and it turns out that the alleged agent, who may himself have been deceivedby forgery or otherwise, has no such authority. <u>Oliver</u> v. <u>Bank of England</u> is an instance of this class of case. Sometimes the obligation is implied in cases where the person entitled to be indemnified isa person who is called on to perform a ministerial duty, statutory, or common law. <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay</u> and <u>Attorney-General</u> v. <u>Odell</u> are instances of this class. But in every case the ratio decidendi in the same; the warranty or promise of indemnity is based ona request made. It is true that the request need not be expressed in words, and that both the request and the promise of indemnityimplied there from may be implied from conduct and circumstances, including the relation of the parties as one of the circumstances- including that is, in the present case that the defendant was one of a class of witnesses whose testimony the Bank of England waswilling to accept and consider when satisfying itself as the 'parliamentary bookkeepers of this fund'."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Farwell L.J. at page 232 had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Did the defendant make" (a request) "here and represent that he made it on behalf of the true stockholder? He says himself that hewas instructed to prepare a transfer and to put a ticket forward. I think the drawing up of this ticket, the taking it to the Bank,the payment of 2s. 6d. to get the transfer expedited and made ready on the same day, the attendance at the Bank with the proposedtransferor, and the identification of the forger as the stockholder constitute, when taken together, as distinct a request to permitthe transfer to be made in the books as the 'demand to act' under the power of attorney did in the case of <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>Bank of England</u>. He bases his finding on the accumulated facts there stated, and I see no object in discussing what would have been the case if thiswas an action against a person who had merely appeared to identify a transferor. I express no opinion on the point. But here theappellant is a broker whose ordinary course of business is to put forward transfers and carry them through. He is also on the Bank'slist of privileged brokers, and as such knows that his identification will be accepted as sufficient. He puts forward the forgeras the real Miss Pearson on the ticket in which he requests the Bank to prepare a transfer. He attends at the Bank on the executionof the transfer and identifies her, and otherwise acts for reward in the manner described by himself in his account as 'attendingat the Bank for the purpose of transferring same', and in his book as 'transferring India 3 Â½ per Cent. Stock.' He put forward andpassed the transfer, using his privileged position to identify her."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">At page 235 Kennedy L.J. had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We are bound to take the law as it has been laid down by the House of Lords in <u>Starkey</u> v. <u>Bank of England</u> and later in <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay</u>. The application of that law to the present case hangs, I think, in the particular circumstances upon the answer to one question- Is it true as a matter of fact that the defendant 'requested, directed, or demanded of' the plaintiffs (to use the language ofLord Davey) that they should permit the transfer in their books of the India stock which the true owner of that stock had not authorized?Or, to put the same question in a slightly differently form, did the defendant's conduct, as proved, in fact amount to such a request,direction or demand? If the question ought to be answered, as my brother A.T. Lawrence has answered it, in the affirmative, thenthere is, in the circumstances of the present case, nothing upon which, so far as regards the plaintiffs' claim to indemnity, thedefendant can successfully seek to base a defence."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In <u>Welch</u> v. <u>The Bank of England</u><sup>(10)</sup> the plaintiff, the victim of her co-trustee's forgery, sought in an action to have her name restored to the register as the holderof certain stocks; as to a number of the transactions she succeeded despite allegations of negligence on her part in that she hadreceived notices of the transfers from the bank and had done nothing about them. As to some of the transactions involved she failedbecause "she was deemed to have had the control of the money before it passed into the account of her co-trustee". She could notsucceed in respect of those transactions the proximate cause of which was her own negligence. It was only where her negligence wasnot directly connected with the loss and her conduct did not amount to an estoppel or ratification that she was successful. The defendantshad brought in five separate parties as third parties alleging the same case against each of them namely that in respect of the particulartransaction in which they were respectively concerned each of them individually had presented transfers to the defendants which wereforged. The defendants were claiming accordingly that the presentation by a broker or jobber of a forged transfer to the bank importedan implied liability in respect of all costs, charged and expenses which the bank might suffer as a result of acting on their transfer.Harman.

It is because, coming to equity, the plaintiff has, as Iheld, to submit to equitable principles that she failed in respect of four of the seven transactions."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">These findings and the rulings as to costs which follow them are a clear indication that Harman, J. is of the opinion that both jobbersand brokers presenting forged transfers, however innocently are liable to indemnify even though presenting those transfers in goodfaith. He was in effect applying the <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup> rule to stockbrokers who acted merely as agents. This is only right. The bank's attitude to a private individual presenting a documentof transfer might well differ from its attitude to a stockbroker presenting such a transfer. It would not have done in this casesince the learned trial judge found that the staff of the bank's registery placed no stock on the personality on those who submittedrequests for transfers. Nevertheless the stockbrokers here cannot, as Mr. Litton so strongly suggested, be regarded as a mere conduitpipe. I don't think a mere messenger would be liable to indemnify but a stockbrokers are professional persons and have a responsibilityto those with whom they deal. Again they asked that the new certificates should be issued to them. They got the new certificates.It was not for the bank to know that they had no financial interest. Without their intervention the transfers would not or mightnot have been effected. As professional men it is to be anticipated that they will as reasonable and prudent brokers not deal withtransfers in the manner with which they were dealt here without assuring themselves of their authenticity. Therefore I would holdthat in presenting the transfers the brokers gave the implied indemnity the bank claims.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> I turn then to consider the question whether the action of the bank in accepting the transfers without checking on the specimen signatureof the Bishop or in exercising their discretion to accept transfers which did not bear the addresses and calling of the attestingwitness disbars them from claiming full relief. I cannot see that it does. They accepted the transfer without further reference tothe stockbrokers. Their acceptance did not affect the action of the brokers in presenting the transfers. At the time of the bank's"negligence" the implied contract of indemnity was already in existence with all its terms and before I could hold that the bank's"negligence" was an answer in whole or in part to their claim, I should have to imply a further term in the implied indemnity tothe effect that transfers would not be acted upon until the bank had satisfied itself as to the authenticity of the signature ofthe transferee. Such an implied term has not been argued and would be impossible to argue, for it would be destructive of any impliedindemnity. One does not indemnify against loss due to forgery and at the same time require the person indemnified himself to ensurethat there has been no forgery. The "negligence" of the bank could not in any way have affected the action of the brokers in presentingthe transfer and could not amount to an estoppel. Equally it could not amount to "default" in the sense in which that term was usedby Davey, L.J. in <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(6)</sup>. As I see it default there must amount to some form of complicity by a servant of the bank in the fraud and occur before or accompanythe presentation of the transfers.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> A further question for consideration is whether the bank in defending the action taken against it could successfully have arguedthat the Bishop could not succeed because of his failure to reply to the bank's letter warning of the impending transfer. I thinkthis argument is fully answered by the comments on this point of Lord Esher M.R. in <u>Barton</u> v. <u>London &amp; N.W. Railway Co.</u><sup>(12)</sup> when he said at page 87:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"With regard to the last transfer, of which notice was sent to the plaintiff, it is alleged that having disregarded such notice, sheis estopped from saying that the transfer is bad, or if she is not estopped, that, as she is claiming equitable relief, if she misledthe defendants by not answering their letter to that extent she is not entitled to such relief. This letter point does not, as itseems to me, arise, because in substance what she is claiming is to have the register made right, which is her legal right as a shareholder;and I cannot think that the circumstances bring the case within any kind of estoppel."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Commenting on this and other authorities in Welch v. <u>Bank of England</u><sup>(10)</sup> Harman, J. is quoted as saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The direct cause of the loss was the felonious act by Maude in forging the defendants' name on the transfer and the authorities tothe brokers, and it follows from the authorities that the negligence of the plaintiff not being directly connected with the lossis no part of her claim." (sic)</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I take it that the last phrase should read "is no bar to her claim". In our case equally the negligence of the Bishop in failing toreply to the warning letters was not directly connected with the loss and was no bar to his claim. It follows that the bank was correctin its decision not to rely on this negligence when defending the action by the Bishop.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> There is finally to be considered the question whether the carelessness of the bank in failing to compare the forged signatures onthe transfers with the Bishop's specimen signature in their possession gives rise to any right in the brokers to have the bank contributeto their loss. The grounds of appeal in this regard read:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">3.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">That the learned judge erred in law in holding that a duty of care on the part of the respondent was a prerequisite in apportioningliability for contributory negligence.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">4.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">That alternatively, on the learned judge's own findings of fact, liability should have been apportioned."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">Ground 3 appears to me to be in error in that it quotes the learned judge out of context. What in fact he said was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The bank argues immediately that the suggestion is technically bad in that the doctrine of contributory negligence is limited toan action in tort whereas their action against the brokers lies in contract. But a question that needs to be dealt with first iswhether the bank is under any duty of care to the brokers, for if there be no duty there can be no actionable negligence." (my emphasis)"And that prior question has already been answered by Lord Davey in the Sheffield case where at p.403 he says :</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="15%" class="quote">'</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="79%" class="quote">I am also of opinion that the authority keeping a stock register has no duty of keeping the register correct which they owe to thosewho come with transfers...'"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">I would read the learned judge here as indicating that there could be no right in the brokers to claim relief in negligence againstthe bank in a claim based on an implied contract for indemnity unless negligence as distinct from contributory negligence was established.The appellants own pleading on this point is to be found in para. 9 of their defence which reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Further and/or alternatively the defendant kept or ought to have kept records of its shareholders' specimen signatures and oughtto have checked the transferor's signatures appearing on the Instrument of Transfer against its records before effecting any transfer.The defendant negligently failed to make any or any adequate check and/or other enquiries and thereby caused or alternatively contributedto the matters complained of."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">There is no mention here of contributory negligence. There is no counterclaim based on negligence. The claim is that the loss wascaused in whole or in part by the carelessness of the bank. This does not appear to me to provide any answer to the bank's claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> That claim is based on the implied agreement that the broker will indemnify the bank against any loss that may be occasioned to itby compliance with the brokers' request and to give effect to the brokers pleading would involve the inclusion of a proviso in theimplied agreement to the effect that the indemnity would be limited if the bank acted carelessly when complying with the preciseterms of the request giving rise to the indemnity. This does not make sense.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> If no such proviso is to be included in the implied agreement then necessarily any claim in respect of carelessness on the part ofthe bank must be based in negligence rather than in contributory negligence and be by way of counterclaim. As the learned judge hasshown negligence could not in any event be established. I consider for these reasons that no question of contribution (which is inany event appropriate only where joint tortfeasors are involved) can arise.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I would dismiss this appeal with costs.</p>    <p align="left">  </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Mr. Litton, Q.C. &amp; Mr. Denis Chang (Yung, Yu &amp; Yuen) for appellants.</p>        <p align="left">Mr. Dicks (Johnson Stokes &amp; Master) for respondent.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">(1)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281875%29%20LR%2010%20CP%20196" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1875) L.R. 10 C.P. 196.</a></p>    <p align="left">(2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20A%20%26%20E%2057" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 Ad. &amp; E. 57.</a></p>    <p align="left">(3)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=5%20Bing%20NC%20636" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">5 Bing., N.C. 636.</a></p>    <p align="left">(4)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20Bing%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 Bing., 66.</a></p>    <p align="left">(5)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281831%29%205%20Bli%20%28NS%29%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1831) 5 Bli.
