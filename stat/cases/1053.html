Damages are also claimed for breach of a collateral contractbetween the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant by virtue of representations and warranties made by the 3rd defendant on the 24th April1986 and other dates, that the corporate structure of the 3rd defendant, including the 1st and 2nd defendants, would include thepost of Regional Manager of Far East Marketing or equivalent status and that the plaintiff would fill that post for a minimum periodof two years save for misconduct. Damages are claimed against the 3rd defendant for reckless or negligent mis-statement whilst aseparate claim for damages has been made against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants for conspiracy to induce a breach of contract betweenthe plaintiff and the 3rd defendant.`</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> By the amended statement of claim, it is pleaded that the 1st and 2nd defendants are Hong Kong subsidiaries of the 3rd defendantwhich are owned and managed by the 3rd defendant. The negotiations for the employment of the plaintiff by the 3rd defendant werecarried out in February 1986 with employees of the 3rd defendant. By paragraph 15 of the amended statement of claim, it is allegedthat the plaintiff was assigned by the 3rd defendant to the 1st and 2nd defendants but that he was, at all material times, an employeeof the 3rd defendant subject to the directions of the directors and the corporate executives of the 3rd defendant. By paragraph 16,the plaintiff took up his duties in Hong Kong on the 1st July 1986 under the title of Regional Manager of Far East Marketing andalternatively, Managing Director/Far East Data General. Paragraph 18 pleads that at all material times it was agreed that any sumsexpended by the plaintiff as business expenses recently incurred and in the interests of the 1st, 2nd or 3rd defendant would be reimbursedto the plaintiff. By paragraph 22, the plaintiff claims reimbursement for a business expense for joining the Aberdeen Marina Clubwhich he claims was to be met by the 1st, 2nd or 3rd defendants. By paragraph 24, the plaintiff alleges that on the 3rd August 1987while he was at the 3rd defendant's headquarters in Massachusetts U.S. A., he received a letter dated the 31st July 1987 signed onbehalf of the 2nd defendant, informing him that the position of Area Manager, Data General Asia Marketing had been eliminated andthat Data General Hong Kong, was serving notice of its election to proceed under section 7 of a Foreign Assignment Agreement datedthe 24th April 1987 to terminate the assignment. He was also told that there was no other position with the 3rd defendant or theData General group available so that he would receive three months' pay in lieu of notice together with certain other benefits.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Paragraph 49 of the amended statement of claim pleads a conspiracy by the 3rd defendant with the 1st and 2nd defendants to inducea breach of contract between the 3rd defendant and the plaintiff to injure the plaintiff by eliminating the post of Area Manager/DataGeneral Asia Marketing by the 2nd defendant's earlier notice terminating the plaintiff's employment with the 3rd defendant or alternatively,the Data General group generally and thereafter withholding certain contractual benefits which are pleaded in paragraph 27.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> It was submitted by Mr Huggins, counsel for the 1st and 2nd defendants, that as the allegations in the amended endorsement of thewrit with regard to the plaintiff's employment with the 1st and 2nd defendants had not been repeated in the amended statement ofclaim and that the contract was with the 3rd defendant alone, the allegations were deemed to have been abandoned and should thereforebe struck out. Mr Huggins went on to argue that the 3rd defendant could not conspire with the 1st and 2nd defendants to induce itselftobreak a contract between itself and the plaintiff because it would involve an allegation that the 3rd defendant intended to breakits contract with the plaintiff by obtaining the 1st and 2nd defendants' agreement that they should combine with the 3rd defendantto induce the 3rd defendant to do so. He submitted that this contention is absurd for the 3rd defendant could not be induced by itselfand the 1st and 2nd de defendants, because the 3rd defendant would need no inducing as it would have already decided to break thecontract when it combined with the 1st and 2nd defendants. Alternatively, there could be no persuasive communication, persuasivecommunication being an essential ingredient of the tort of conspiracy, by the alleged conspirators, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants,since the 3rd defendant as already persuaded. Further, there is no allegation of knowledge by the 1st and 2nd defendants of the existenceof the relevant contract of employment between the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant, which knowledge is material, and an essentialaverment for a cause of action that cannot be inferred from other facts pleaded in the statement of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Neither the 1st nor 2nd defendants could have eliminated the post of Area Manager for they are separate legal entities, nor was italleged that they persuaded the 3rd defendant to do so. In respect of the service of the notice of termination, no liability couldbe attached to the 1st defendant whilst the 2nd defendant was acting as agent for the 3rd defendant, so that it was the 3rd defendant'sact which terminated the contract. It is therefore not an act whereby the 2nd defendant induced or procured the 3rd defendant tobreak its contract with the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr Graham for the plaintiff argued that although the plaintiff was employed by the 3rd defendant, Data as a group was responsible.However, it is clear that Data cannot be liable as a group, for it is not a separate legal entity.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On behalf of the plaintiff, it was contended that the pleadings should be looked at as a whole and that the plaintiff was assignedby the 3rd defendant to the 1st and 2nd defendants in order to conduct the 3rd defendant's business in Hong Kong. Mr Graham agreedthat the 3rd defendant was contractually bound to ensure that the plaintiff received contractual benefits through the 1st and the2nd defendant and that the expenses incurred by the plaintiff to take up his post here for the 3rd defendant, was through the operationof the 1st and 2nd defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> With regard to the contractual benefits, it was only pleaded that they were to be provided by the 3rd defendant, so that only the3rd defendant could withhold them. Even if the 1st and 2nd defendants were obliged to provide the benefits, the withholding of themwhich they were contractually obliged to provide to the plaintiff, could not involve the 1st and 2nd defendants inducing or procuringthe 3rd defendant to break its contractual obligations with the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Having considered the endorsement on the amended writ and the amended statement of claim, there is no repetition in the statementof claim of the allegation set out in the writ that the plaintiff was employed by one of the three defendants, but only by the 3rddefendant. The averments pleaded in the amended statement of claim with regard to the breach of contract terminating the plaintiff'semployment only relate to the 3rd defendant. No allegation has been made of a breach of contract by either the 1st or 2nd defendants.Whilst I accept that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendant may well be part of a group of companies, nevertheless, each company must betreated as a separate legal entity. The contention made by Mr Huggins that material facts must be set out to support the plaintiff'sclaim have not in fact been complied with by the plaintiff in the pleading. Further the basis for the claim for reimbursement ofexpenses is totally lacking from the pleading. It is trite law that a claim set out in the endorsement of the writ which has notbeen repeated in the statement of claim, is deemed to have been abandoned and should, therefore, be struck out. I am also satisfiedthat no cause of action has been alleged in paragraph 18 of the amended statement of claim against the 1st and 2nd defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> I accept the argument that was put forward by Mr Huggins with regard to the allegation of conspiracy that the 3rd defendant cannotinduce itself to break its contract with the plaintiff, nor could there, therefore, be any persuasive communication as is required.Knowledge by the 1st and 2nd defendants off the existence of the contract between the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant was also absent.Accordingly, I agree that the allegation of conspiracy is misconceived and must be struck out The appeal is therefore allowed andthe action against the 1st and 2nd defendants will be struck out. There will be an order nisi for the costs of the appeal and beforethe master to the 1st and 2nd defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(B.
