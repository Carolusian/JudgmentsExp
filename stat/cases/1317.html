She was employed as an AccountManger in the Defendant's Data Management Services Sales Department (DMS) and assigned to work in team R at a basic monthly salaryof HK$11,000. She was further paid a monthly travelling allowance of $300 and share in the sales commission and shipment bonus basedon the performance of team R. On 1 January 1998, her basic monthly salary was increased to $11,350. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In this action, the Plaintiff claims she was unlawfully discriminated and victimised due to her pregnancy.  She seeks damages underSection 76(3A)(b) &amp; (f) of the Sex Discrimination Ordinance (SDO) for injury to feelings and loss of income and punitive or exemplarydamages.

For discrimination by way of victimization, the Plaintiff hasto show that she was treated less favourably and was dismissed by reason that the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had committedan unlawful act which would contravene the SDO.  The law and the appropriate test to be applied under the law will be dealt withbelow.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">The Plaintiff's Case</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Plaintiff, Ms. Janice Chan, was employed on 2 June 1997 as an Account Manager at team R of the Defendant's Data Management ServicesSales Department (âDMS').  Her monthly salary during probation was $10,000. She was entitled to a guarantee monthly commissionof $4,000 or sales commission/bonus whichever was higher.  She passed her probation after 4 months on 2 October 1997.  Her monthlysalary was increased to $11,000 with a travelling allowance of $300.  Instead of a guarantee commission/bonus, she became eligiblefor a share of the sale commission and shipment bonus, her share percentage was subject to the agreement between Toppan and the staff. She claimed that this bonus was a major part of her income and was directly linked to the monthly sales and shipment volume i.e.value of goods delivered to clients of the whole team.   Each team was assigned a list of clients to serve, a monthly sales and shipmentbudget and actual sales would be prepared by the team and the team's commission and bonus would be based on the actual sales andshipment by Toppan attributed to each team.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  While at team R, Ms. Chan worked under the supervision of the senior Account Manager Mr Alan Mok who worked under Mr Caric Lee,the Sales Manager of DMS.  DMS was headed by the General Manager, Mr Johnson Chiu (âMr Chiu').  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  It is Ms Chan's case that Toppan had assigned to team R a number of important corporate clients with whom it had a well-establishedbusiness relationship with high annual business turnover such as Aeon Credit Services (Asia) Co. Ltd., Citibank, Kumon Hong KongCo. Ltd. (âKumonâ), and Crocodile Garments Ltd. (âCrocodileâ).  Ms Chan was recruited by the Defendant to look after theaccounts of these valued customers and to follow up their orders.  It was part of her duties to liaise with these clients and withToppan's own production department to facilitate and process clients' orders.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Ms Chan claimed that at team R she supervised and was assisted by account executives in the handling of small accounts and minoroffice routine.  Ms Chan insisted that the account executives were responsible for making cold calls and visits to explore new businessopportunities with potential clients and such were not the duties of the Account Managers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Ms. Chan claimed that her performance as an account manager at team R was good. At the end of 1997, she was selected as a memberof Toppan's Achievement Club that gave her an opportunity to visit Japan and Toppan's parent company in April 1998. She was selectedto be the master of ceremony at a function to celebrate Toppan's 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary in Hong Kong in 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Ms. Chan claimed that after she became pregnant, Toppan's management staff began an orchestrated course of conduct making the workenvironment difficult and unfavourable for her, that the unfavourable treatment constituted unlawful discrimination and/or victimizationon the ground of her pregnancy.  Such course of conduct is revealed by the following facts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>First Pregnancy</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In May 1998, she became pregnant and informed Mr Caric Lee (âMr Leeâ) in mid-May of the pregnancy.   Mr Lee began to pick onher for meeting clients before coming to the office in the morning. She claimed that this was a common practice in the DMS and thatshe had never been criticised for it before she told Mr Lee of her pregnancy.  She also claimed at that time, other employees ofDMS were not picked on in the same way.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Ms Chan had a difficult pregnancy, she was admitted into hospital for pregnancy complications between 12 and 18 May 1998.  At theend of May, she had a miscarriage and underwent an operation in the hospital for which she was put on sick leave from 25 May to 6June 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Upon her return to work, Mr Johnson Chiu made a remark to her to the effect that âsince childbearing was so difficult, she shouldspend her time on working hard instead of wasting time on itâ.  She was hurt and upset by the remark. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Second Pregnancy</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  At the end of November 1998, she became pregnant again. She duly notified Mr Caric Lee of her pregnancy in the latter part of November1998 and took her annual leave between 30 November and 2 December 1998 on the advice of the Chinese herbalist.    She informed Leein late December that it was not suitable for her due to her pregnancy to participate in physically demanding work at a trade fairToppan would be taking part in early January 1999.  Consequently, certain unfavourable remarks appeared in her appraisal report inlate December 1998, she attributed her two pregnancies as the reason for the unfavourable remarks in appraisal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Transfer to Team U</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  At the end of December 1998 and beginning of 1999, she was told by the DMS Senor Account Manager of team Q, Mr Terrence Man (âMrManâ) that she would be transferred to team Q.  In January, however, he was told she would be joining a newly formed team, teamU, also headed by Mr Man.  She was reluctant to accept the transfer and waited for the official written notification which nevercame.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  She complained that no official notice or documents explaining the reasons for the transfer were sent to her nor did she receiveany official notice or document explaining the reason why a new team was formed consisting only of herself and Terrence Man who remained,at the same time, the head of team Q.   She was told the creation of this new team was Mr Johnson Chiu's idea.  As she was not explainedthe impact the transfer would have on her job or income, she was concerned particularly when it came at a time she had become pregnant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Reduction of Income</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Ms Chan was initially told by Mr Man that her share of commission and bonus at the new team would be 80% and he would get the remaining20%.  However, she was not given any written confirmation of her sales commission share percentage after the transfer in January1999, neither was she given access to the sales commission records of team U that were hitherto available to her at team R.  It cameas a surprise to her when Mr Man informed her in March 1999 her commission share percentage at team U was 60% only.  She also complainedthat she was assigned at team U the inactive clients, and clients that were known to be low income generating in 1999 from team R. Clients who were good income generators previously handled by her such as Aeon Credit Card and Citibank were removed from her accountand remained in team R.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Ms Chan further complained that she was not given the usual 4 months guarantee commission/bonus when she was transferred to teamU in the first 4 months of 1999. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Direction to Work During Sick Leave</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Ms Chan was put on sick leave by her gynaecologist to ensure she would rest in bed to avoid a miscarriage from 18 to 30 Januaryand for much of February of 1999.  She submitted the doctor's medical certificate in support of her sick leave on vaginal bleedingand threatened abortion ground.   She claimed she was told to return to the office to attend to a client on 23 January 1999.  On26 January 1999, while still on sick leave she was told to accompany the customer and Mr Man to visit Toppan's factory in Yuen Longand Tsuen Wan.  At the visit, she felt unwell and asked to be excused but was told to stay until later on when she found her bleedinghad persisted and had to leave to seek medical attention.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Ms Chan claimed Mr Man instructed her to liaise with Toppan's inactive client Top Glory Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd. while she was onsick leave in February 1999.  She did so with favourable results but was prevented from following up with the client upon her returnfrom sick leave. She was told the client had been wrongly assigned to team R.  She considered the action was deliberate to depriveher the fruits of her labour and to demoralize her.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Ms Chan considered that Toppan through Mr Man had deliberately put pressure on her to create a difficult working environment toforce her to leave her employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Disparaging and Derogatory Remarks from the Management Staff</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On 22 February 1999, Ms Chan claimed that Mr Man directed her to unpack her belongings that had been taken to a desk at team U whenshe returned to work from sick leave.   He humiliated her by telling her in front of colleagues that she should get her husband tounpack for her when she told him she could not do so due to her pregnancy. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Since her return from sick leave in March 1999, she felt members of the senior management had discriminated and isolated her becauseof her pregnancy.  She claimed that Mr Man and Ms. Pepeanna Lau (âMs Lau'), the new sales manager, were in the habit of pickingon her and scolded her at morning meetings in front of other colleagues.  Ms Lau had on a number of occasions made derogatory remarksabout her troubled pregnancy and sick leave and suggested to her she should pack up and go home.   While Mr Man had also made othersarcastic remarks about her pregnant condition.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Difficult Working Conditions</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  She claimed that she was not given any assistance at team U for no account executives had been assigned at team U and she had topreformed the duties previously done by account executives at team R, such as visits and travelling and cold calls etc.  At the sametime, promotion awards such as dining vouchers to clients placing orders over $50,000 were not extended to cold call clients recruitedby her.  Furthermore, she was not given any support from senior management when a cold call client recruited by her, Carltex, requestedto meet with senior management to discuss business development, both Mr Man and Ms. Lau failed to meet the client.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Ms Chan complained that in July 1999, she was made to travel to Kwun Tong when she was heavily pregnant to pick up a film that shehad already inspected and approved and to deliver it to the printer in Tsuen Wan.  On another occasion in July, while she was onsick leave, she requested Mr Man to follow up the details of an order handled by her, he failed to follow up the details and hadchanged the printing firm without telling her upon her return from sick leave.  She was then told to wait at the office for his callto tell her of the designation of the new printing firm.  She was then instructed to visit the printing factory at 11pm at nightto supervise the printing process.  It was a simple job that did not require an onâsite inspection.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Cancellation of Black-Storm Warning Leave Approval</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On the mornings of 23 and 24 August 1999, black-storm warnings were hoisted, Ms Chan claimed that the staff's annual leave wouldnot be deducted if prior approval had been obtained from his/her supervisor when the black-storm signal was hoisted.   She duly obtainedapproval from Mr Man on the mornings of 23 and 24 of August to be excused from coming back to the office in the morning, and annualleave was granted to her for the afternoon of 23 August.  Six months later, she discovered that Terrence Man had subsequently fileda leave application on her behalf without her knowledge or consent for the mornings of 23 and 24 August 1999, contrary to the approvalhe had given to her at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  She believed the unfair manner she was treated was because Mr Man had wanted to pick on her and made life difficult for her duringthe last stages of her pregnancy so that she would leave her employment voluntarily. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Post-Maternity Leave UnfavourableTreatment</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Upon her return from maternity leave and annual leave on 22 November 1999, she found a memo from Ms Lau to her issued on 10 November1999 referring to a formal complaint by a client and accused her of unprofessional and unacceptable performance. Ms Chan found theaccusations unjustified.  She relied on a letter of 28 December 1999 from the said client Kumon International solicited by Ms Lauthat supported Ms Chan's claim that the client was satisfied with her performance attributing the poor quality of the productionreferred by Ms Lau to the printing team.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mrs Chan denied the allegations of poor productivity and record maintenance in another of Ms Lau's memo of the same date.  In athird memo dated 29 November 1999, Ms Lau informed Ms Chan that Kumon had been removed from her clients list. Ms Lau further imposedstrict work procedures and requirements based on Ms Chan's allegedly poor performance and informed her she would be trained as ajunior sales staff. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Accusation of Inflated Sales</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  On 1 December 1999, Ms Lau accused Ms Chan of making up non-existent orders from clients and duplicating documents to give an impressionof high sales volume. Ms Lau suggested to Ms Chan that she should resign.  Ms Chan felt she was wrongly accused, defamed and treatedunfairly because of her pregnancy, she told the Toppan Human Resources manager and Mr Chiu that she would be making a report to theEqual Opportunities Commission (âEOC').   Mr Chiu promised her he would look into the complaints of duplication of client's ordersand the accusation of falsified sale order and her alleged unfair treatment, but full investigation of her complaints never tookplace.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Transfer to the China Business Sales Division</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Ms Chan claimed she was transferred against her will to the China Business Sales Division (âCBS') in January 2000.  She was demotedto the position of Senior Sales Executive working under the Account Manager in CBS. She was told CBS required someone with her languageskills in English, Putonghua and Cantonese to develop the Mainland China and Taiwan market.  She claimed this later turned out tobe untrue for CBS was eventually closed down.  She claimed the transfer was a demotion and her monthly basic salary was reduced from$11,350 to $9,000.  At CBS, she was entitled to a travelling allowance of $2,000 and a guarantee commission of $5,200 each month. She claimed as she was only allowed the $5,200 monthly guarantee commission, this resulted in a further reduction of income in 2000compared to the previous year. She further found that contrary to what was promised, Toppan had no plans to develop the MainlandChina market. That in spite her efforts in trying to develop the Macau, Taiwan and Mainland China markets, none of her business proposalswere seriously taken up nor was she given any support. Business in Macau developed by her was taken away from her after she laida complaint to the EOC in May 2000.  Information requested by a potential client in Taiwan was not supplied.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Complaints to the Labour Department and the EOC</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Ms Chan complained to the Labour Department and filed a claim against Toppan in May 2000 because she had refused to accept her transferto CBS officially.  And because Toppan had at the Labour Tribunal hearing used the daily activities reports filed by her at the CBSas evidence of her acceptance of the transfer, she had since the hearing in July refused to file any further official daily activitiesreports.  However, she claimed she had made verbal reports and recorded notes on Mr Fritz Lieu's desk planner instead.  She claimedthis practice had been accepted by the senior accounts manager Mr Fritz Lieu and account manager Mr Chet Yim of CBS. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  On 19 September 2000, she received a warning on her failure to file daily activities reports since January 2000.  She denied theallegation and supported her claim by forwarding copies of the daily activities reports between January and July 2000 to her superiorat the latter part of September 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>The Dismissal</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On the day of the warning letter of 19 September 2000, she met with Mr Kato, the Managing Director of Toppan.  She was informedthat due to the closing of the CBS, she would be made redundant.  She was further told to withdraw her complaint at the EOC or shewould be dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  She claimed that at the end of September and early October 2000, Mr Lieu had refused her application for compassion leave on thedeath of her father because she was not able to present a death certificate at the time of application although she had a policereport proving the death.  She had to obtain leave approval from Human Resources division directly.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  On 24 October 2000, she received a warning letter from Mr Yim but she refused to acknowledge it.

She claimed that she was not able to find another job withouta fair reference of her work experience.  Furthermore, the incident had caused her to lose confidence in future job seeking.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>The Defence</u> <u>Case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  It is the Defendant's case that as an account manager, Ms Chan's job description included dealing with Toppan's existing customers,developing new business with existing customers and locating new customers.  The Defendant admitted that each sale team consistedof a team leader and 2-3 members.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The Defendant denied that Ms Chan's salary package was reduced after the transfer to team U, for she received 60% of the team'ssales at team U instead of the 25% at team R.  She should have concentrated on developing new accounts and improving sales that wouldhave a positive effect on her income.  Toppan denied that team U was newly established in 1999 and claimed the transfer of Ms Chanto this team was a usual management decision, the 1998 records of sales and sale percentages of staff was exhibited as evidence insupport.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The Defendant claimed Ms Chan's performance in 1999 was below the average standard even after allowances were given to her leaveof absence due to pregnancy.  This became a matter of concern and in August 1999, the sales manager Ms Lau requested for a letterof warning to be issued to Ms Chan, but the Manager of Human Resources and Administration (âHR dept.'), Ms Ewaidy Lo, consideredsuch action to be unsuitable at the time because of Ms Chan's pregnancy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Ms Lau alleged that Ms Chan's performance continued to be unsatisfactory and on 10 November 1999, she issued two warning memorandato Ms Chan about certain poorly executed work with the client Kumon and the poor sales returned by her.   A further memo was sentto her on 29 November 1999 notifying her of the areas of her shortcomings, giving her guidelines to follow and requesting her totake up training as a junior sales person.  On 1 December 1999, Ms Lau issued a memorandum on the matter of Ms Chan allegedly placinga duplicated sales order on 1 December 1999 to Mr Chiu. Ms Chan disagreed with Ms Lau's observations and accusations.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Meetings were held between Ms Chan and Ms Lau and between Ms Chan and Ms Lo, the manager of Human Resources in late November andearly December 1999 to resolve the concerns and accusations raised by Ms Lau.  Ms Lau recommended Ms Chan's transfer to China BusinessSales Division (âCBS').  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In response to the complaints by Ms Chan of the unfair treatments and accusations by Mr Man and Ms Lau to Mr Chiu and Mr Kato, Toppanconducted an investigation of the allegation of duplication and false order raised by Ms Lau.  Toppan found no documentary basisto support Ms Lau's suspicion and Ms Lau was directed to apologise to Ms Chan in March 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Toppan claimed that Ms Chan had assured the management she was able to handle a larger number of clients, therefore, she shouldhave been able to achieve her sales budget in 1999.  Further, Ms Chan did not complain about being discriminated during her pregnancyor soon after the birth.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  It is Toppan's case that Ms Chan maintained a hostile attitude at CBS and therefore the relationship with her colleagues was poor.She regarded her transfer to CBS as a demotion which was denied by Toppan.  It claimed that Ms Chan continued to ignore the requirementsof reporting to the office in the morning before visiting clients and submitting daily activities reports in spite of the memorandafrom Mr Yim to all staff at CBS on 10 July 2000 and from Mr Chiu to all sales-persons on 18 September 2000.  Mr Lieu and Mr Yim issueda warning letter to Ms Chan on 19 September 2000 regarding her failure to file daily activities reports.  Ms Chan claimed she didfile daily reports but she was only able to produce copies of 7 daily activities reports between January and July 2000.  Toppan furtherclaimed her performance continued to be poor and her attitude hostile.  Consequently, her employment was terminated on 25 October2000. The Defendant claimed that her termination was not connected with her pregnancy for it took place over 1 year after she hadgiven birth.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  It is the Defendant's case that Ms Chan's first pregnancy had come to it's notice only after she submitted a medical report in supportof her application for sick leave after her miscarriage in June 1998.  That it had only received notice of Ms Chan's second pregnancyafter she returned from her sick leave on 1 February 1999.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Mr Man denied the incidents of compelled attendance at work.  He claimed Ms Chan had raised no objections to the invitations forthe client was Kumon, a major client handled by Ms Chan. Furthermore, it is the Defendant's case that sales-persons are sometimesrequired to work irregular hours. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The Defendant denied any of its staff had ever made any derogatory remarks on Ms Chan's pregnancy.  That Ms Lau's comments to MsChan made in 1999 was purely based on her performance and ability.  Further, Ms Chan's transfer in January 2000 took place aftershe had given birth and it was made at her request to be transferred from team U because of her poor relationship with her supervisorsat team U.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The defendant denied it had discriminated and victimized Ms Chan on account of her pregnancy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>The Law</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 8</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480" class="autolink_findacts">Sex Discrimination Ordinance</a> provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âA person discriminates against a woman in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III</a> or IV if â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(a)  on the ground of her pregnancy he treats her less favourably than he treats or would treat a person who is not pregnant; or</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(c)  on the ground of her pregnancy he treats her less favourably than he treats or would treat a person who is not pregnant but-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(i)  which is such that the proportion of persons who are pregnant who can comply with it is considerably smaller that the proportionof persons who are not pregnant who can comply with it;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(ii)  which he cannot show to be justifiable irrespective of whether or not the person to whom it is applied is pregnant,</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(iii)  which is to her detriment because she cannot comply with it.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">There are two local decided cases on pregnancy discrimination under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.8</a> SDO, the case of Chang Ying Kwan v Wyeth (HK) Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKC%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKC 129</a> and the case of Yuen Wai Han v South Elderly Affairs Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%203%20HKLRD%20621" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 3 HKLRD 621.</a>  Both cases referred to the âbut forâ test which was the test applied by the courts in similar cases in other jurisdictions suchas the English House of Lords case of R v Birmingham City Council ex p Equal Opportunities Commission  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20AC%201155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] AC 1155</a> and James v Eastleigh Borough Council  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20AC%20751" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] AC 751.</a>  The Chang Ying Kwan case further referred to the test applied in cases of victimization cited in cases such as Nagarajan v LondonRegional Transport  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20AC%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 AC 501</a> and Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20ICR%201065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] ICR 1065</a> where the courts held that the âbut forâ test required the comparator in the case of pregnancy discrimination to be not anotherpregnant employee but a normal employee.

They remained to be persuasive authorities in appropriate cases.  In the case of Chang Ying Kwan, Judge Saundersset out the basis and extent of the application of the English authorities on the cases in Hong Kong under the SDO and the interpretationof the English Courts of equivalent legislation in the UK.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  On Page 134 of the report he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"> â<u>The Appropriate Text</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">The forms of discrimination alleged by Miss Chang, i.e. as a consequence of pregnancy and victimization consequent upon a complaintto the EOC, are commonly called direct discrimination.

But, to constitutevictimization, according to Slade J., the motive which caused the alleged discrimination to treat the complainant less favourablythan others must be a motive consciously connected with the race relation legislation.  Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the case ofChief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v. Khan said at p. 1071 para. 23 â 28 âThe statute is to be regarded as calling fora simple comparison between the treatment afforded to the complainant who has done a protected act and the treatment which was orwould be afforded to other employees who have not done the protected act.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In the English Court Appeal Case of King v.

(1) It is for the applicantwho complains of racial discrimination to make out his or her case.  Thus if the Applicant does not prove the case on the balanceof probabilities he or she will fail.  (2) It is important to bear in mind that it is unusual to find direct evidence of racial discrimination. Few employers will be prepared to admit such discrimination even to themselves.  In some cases discrimination will not be ill-intentionedbut merely based on an assumption that âhe or she would not have fitted inâ.  (3) The outcome of the case will therefore usuallydepend in what inferences it is proper to draw from the primary facts found by the Tribunal.  These inferences can include, in appropriatecases, any inferences that it is just and equitable to draw in accordance with section 65 (2b) of the Act of 1976 from an evasionof equivocal reply to a questionnaire.  (4) Though there will be some cases where, for example, the non-selection of the applicantfor a post or for promotion is clearly not on racial grounds, a finding of discrimination and a finding of difference in race wereoften point to the possibility of racial discrimination.  In such circumstances, the Tribunal would look to the employer for an explanation. If no explanation is then put forward or if the Tribunal considers the explanation to be inadequate or unsatisfactory it will belegitimate for the Tribunal to infer that this discrimination was on racial grounds.  This is not a matter of law but, as May L.J.put it in North West Thames Regional Health Authority v Noone  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20ICR%20813" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 ICR 813</a>, 822; âalmost common sense.â  (5) It is unnecessary and unhelpful to introduce the concept of a shifting evidential burden ofproof.  At the conclusion of all the evidence the Tribunal should make findings as to the primary fact and draw such inferences asthey consider proper from those facts.  They should then reach conclusion on the balance of probabilities, bearing in mind both thedifficulties which face a person who complains of unlawful discrimination and the fact that it is for the complainant to prove hisor her case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In the case of Yuen Wai Han v.

It held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â24. First, in the response to the House of Lord's inquiry, there can be no question of comparing the situation of a women who findsherself incapable, by reason of pregnancy discovered very shortly after the conclusion of an employment contract, of performing thetask for which she was recruited with that of a man similarly incapable for medical or other reasons.   â¦</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">â26. Furthermore, contrary to the submission of the United Kingdom, dismissal of a pregnant woman recruited for an indefinite periodcannot be justified on grounds relating to her inability to fulfil a fundamental condition of her employment contract. The availabilityof an employee is necessarily, for the employer, a precondition for the proper performance of the employment contract.    However,the protection afforded by Community law to woman during pregnancy and after childbirth cannot be dependant on whether her presenceat work during maternity is essential to the proper functioning of the undertaking in which she was employed.  Any contrary interpretationwould render ineffective the provision of the Directive.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The House of Lords in Webb v.

Section 4 in the context of the present case providesthat if the act is done for two or more reasons and one of which is pregnancy, then âthe act shall be taken to be doneâ for thereason of pregnancy.  It follows that if in the present case Ms Chan was found to have been treated unfavourably due to her pregnancy,even if there was a second reason for her treatment, the acts (under s.4) shall be taken to be done because of her pregnancy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Findings</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The burden is on Ms. Chan to show there was discrimination under the SDO on a balance of probabilities.  Once the Court is satisfiedthat Ms. Chan has shown from the primary facts that inferences can be drawn that disclosed a possibility of discrimination, the Courtwill look to the employer for an explanation.  If there is no reasonable or satisfactory explanation put forward, the Court willdraw an inference of discrimination as a matter of common sense.  This was the conclusion of Neill L.J. in King v. GB - China Centreafter he considered the relevant authorities and the dictum of May L.J. in North West Thames Regional Health Authority v. Noone <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20ICR%20813" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] ICR 813.</a> Neill L.J. referred to the following passage in May L.J.'s judgment at p.528 B-D:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIn these cases of alleged racial discrimination it is always for the complainant to make out his or her case.  It is not oftenthat there is direct evidence of racial discrimination, and these complainants more often than not have to be dealt with on the basisof what are the proper inferences to be drawn from the primary facts.  For myself I would have thought that it was almost commonsense that, if there is a finding of discrimination and of difference of races and then an adequate or unsatisfactory explanationby the employer for the discrimination usually legitimate inference will be that the discrimination was on racial grounds.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Applying the same test to the present case, the Court will look at the primary facts raised by Ms Chan to determine whether she hadestablished a case of discrimination based on her pregnancy.  Ms Chan has established the following against the Defendant:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a)  evidence of good performance, good relationship with clients and previous good sales record;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)  changes in management attitude and treatment after she became pregnant, had a miscarriage and took pregnancy related sick leaveand maternity leave before and after childbirth between 1998 and 2000;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c)  derogatory and insulting remarks made by senior management staff during her pregnancy;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d)  evidence of repeated demands by the supervisor during her pregnancy compelling her to return to work and attend to clients duringsick leave and black-storm warnings while other employees were treated differently;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e)  transfers to a one person team in DMS in 1999 and CBS division in 2000 without prior consultation or consent after the employerdiscovered she was pregnant and after she gave birth;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(f)  reduction of income after transfer with unfair appraisals and humiliating requirements for re-training imposed;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(g)  demotion after the second transfer with further reduction of income;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(h)  appraisals and repeated warnings based on unsupported allegations of poor and sub-standard  performance and groundless accusationof fraudulent behaviour;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(i)  failure to conduct investigation on fully justified complaints lodged by her to senior management.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Both Mr Leung and Mr Lui accepted and relied on the approach adopted by the Court in the case of Chang Ying Kwan in considering theevidence in the round in the context of employment and human relations, and the dignity and rights accorded to a person by the equalopportunities legislation.  I have adopted this approach in my consideration of the evidence adduced in this case.  As the incidencesreferred to by the Plaintiff were many, I shall only refer to some of them in my findings.  Suffice it to say, I have weighed theevidence of all the witnesses and taken into consideration all the documents exhibited. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> I find Ms Chan to be an honest witness, her evidence is consistent with the memoranda issued and letters exchanged.  I am satisfiedon a balance of probabilities that Ms Chan has established the primary facts on her claim based on discrimination under the SDO. The Defendant is required to give a satisfactory explanation of it's treatment of Ms Chan and her eventual dismissal.  My findingsare based on the principle and guidance set out in Neill L J's judgment in King v. GB-China Centre.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Ms Chan's Performance</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> The Defendant claimed that Ms Chan's performance in 1999 fell below standards.  This was Mr Man and Ms Lau's reason for criticizingMs Chan's performance at team U and their poor appraisals of her work and her attitude in 1999.  Ms Chan, however, was able to showthat she was praised for her high achievements both in 1997 and 1998, she was made a member of Toppan's Achievement Club in 1997and awarded a free trip to Japan.  She was popular amongst her colleagues at the time, this is supported by the fact that was invitedto be the master of ceremony at Toppan's 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary party in 1998.  It is not disputed that in spite of comments about her âstrong will' her 1998 appraisal report wasa satisfactory one. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Toppan claimed that Ms Chan was given most of the clients she was handling in team R when she was transferred to team U but she failedto develop new customers and market new products to existing clients. Ms Chan, On the other hand, claimed that she was not allowedto bring some of her clients such as Aeon Credit Card and Citibank with her to team U other than Kumon and Crocodile.  She claimedthat she is a trained graphic designer and her previous experience was not in sales.  Furthermore, at the time she was employed,it was made clear that she would not be required to make cold calls and actively recruit new customers.  At team R, work such asroutine follow up and cold calls were performed by sales executives. After she was transferred to team U, there were no sales executivesto assist her, yet she was criticised for failing to recruit new clients to improve sales in team U in spite of the lack of support.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Ms Chan was further criticized for not reporting to work before making early morning visits to clients' offices.  Ms Chan's explanationwas that the early morning visits were known to be a preferred practice of her major client Kumon and she was not picked on beforeshe notified her superior that she was pregnant. At the same time, other staff members were not criticized for the same practice. From the Defendant's swipe card records exhibited, it is evident that Ms Chan was not the only staff making early morning visitsand these visits were also reported and recorded each time.  The record showed it was a prevalent practice of the Defendant's staffto make early morning visits.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Ms Lau admitted that after her transfer to DMS as the senior sales manager, she felt it was her duty to improve sales and was anxiouslyurging managers working under her to perform better.  While it is understandable that she should be anxious to show that she wascapable of achieving better sales, it is a different matter if in order to do so, she had deliberately put particular pressure ona particular member of staff because she was pregnant and had been put on sick leave and maternity leave due to her pregnancy comparedto a member of staff who had not been pregnant.  Ms Lau, in her evidence, repeatedly compared Ms Chan's sales figures in 1999 withanother staff Monique Wong who was not pregnant.  She pointed out that Ms Chan had due to her pregnancy taken 127.5 days of sickleave and maternity leave in 1999, this clearly showed that she was anxious that the sick leave and maternity leave taken by Ms Chanwould affect the annual sale of the teams supervised by her.  Instead of taking the pregnant employee's condition into consideration,Ms Lau concluded that Ms Chan had performed poorly because she was pregnant and always on sick leave and therefore had failed toachieve the same or a higher level of sales compared to the previous year.  This can be seen from the comments she made to Ms Chanafter she became pregnant in early 1999 and the August 1999 memorandum to Ms Ewaidy Lo requesting for a warning letter to be issuedto Ms Chan.  While she may not have intentionally discriminated Ms Chan because of her pregnancy, her actions amounted to acts ofdiscrimination.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> While Ms Chan was on maternity leave, Ms Lau issued 2 memoranda on 10 November 1999 accusing Ms Chan of fraudulent conduct and poorperformance.  Ms Chan, however, was able to show that the incident of printing error was caused by the printing team and the lettersolicited by Ms Lau from Kumon supported Ms Chan's claim that Kumon was satisfied with her performance.  As to the allegation offalse sales report, an investigation conducted by Mr. Chiu resulted in Ms Lau withdrawing her complaint against Ms Chan.  Ms Lau'sreadiness in levelling unverified and unsubstantiated accusations of errors and fraudulent conduct at Ms Chan demonstrated her biasopinion of Ms Chan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Requirement to Work During Sick Leave</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> Mr Man, Ms Chan's supervisor at team U, claimed that it was up to Ms Chan to refuse his requests to return to work to handle Kumon'saccount during her sick leave.  He claimed that in the end, he did allow her to leave the factory early after Ms Chan complainedrepeatedly that she was unwell and her bleeding had persisted during the visit. These insensitive responses fully reflected the attitudeof the Defendant's management staff that either the employees' welfare was not its concern or Ms Chan was singled out because ofher pregnancy.  It was clearly unreasonable for him to insist Ms Chan to return to work on the Saturday during her sick leave becauseit was her long week.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> If, in total disregard of the pregnancy and the health of the employee, the employer required the employee to report for duty duringher sick leave due to threatened abortion; compelled her to work late hours when she was 8 months pregnant where there was no realneed to stay in the office until 11 pm; cancelled her previously approved leave during blackâstorm signals without prior warningor notification, when no other employee was treated in the same way, the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that the employerwanted the employee to experience particular pressure because of her pregnancy.  It is also unlawful under S.8(a) &amp; (b) of theOrdinance.  In the present case, there was no evidence adduced by the Defendant to show that it had demanded other employees on sickleave to return to work in the same way it had required Ms Chan to do.  On the other hand, Ms Chan has successfully shown from documentsexhibited that other employees were granted leave on the two mornings of black-storm warnings and they did not have their annualleave deducted, while her annual leave was deducted because Mr Man had filed a leave application on her behalf without her knowledgeor consent.  The Defendant failed to explain the difference in treatment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Transfer to Team U</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Ms Chan objected to the transfer to team U claiming that it was without good cause and against her wish.  Mr Alan Mok, supervisorat team R, persuaded her to accept the transfer, she was promised 80% share of the commission. The promised 80% commission did notmaterialise, in March 1999 she was told she would get only 60%, no explanations for the reduction were given.  The person who benefitedfrom the commission at team U was her supervisor Mr Man who also headed team Q.  Ms Chan claimed that the reason for the transferor the commission percentage was never put in writing contrary to company policy, and she was never consulted.  The Defendant explainedthe transfer was the company's usual arrangement. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> I am satisfied Ms Chan was reluctant to move to team U and no reason for the transfer had been given in writing.  I am also satisfiedthat she was entitled to be consulted for it obviously had an effect on her income and her work.  It is not disputed that she receivedno support at team U and a new account (Top Glory Insurance) successfully solicited by her was immediately transferred out of teamU.  The Defendant claimed at the trial that it was more appropriate for other staff to handle the account, but failed to explainwhy Ms Chan was told at the time the removal was an inadvertent mistake.   Clearly, Ms Chan had been denied the fruits of her labour. This is another example of her unfair treatment by the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Ms Chan claimed that during a sales promotion in February and March 1999, dining vouchers were given to clients placing an orderof over $50,000.  These, however, were not given to Ms Chan's clients.  The Defendant failed to given an explanation for the disparityof treatment.  While the Defendant claimed Ms Chan's transfer was a usual company move, the same answer was given for the arrangementfor Ms Chan to be the only member in team U when all other DMS teams have 2-4 members.   Neither did the Defendant explain why MsChan was not given any follow up support from senior management for a newly solicited client (Carltex) at DMS who had requested fora meeting with Ms Chan's supervisors concerning further business with Toppan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Ms Chan believed she was not allowed to remain in team R because she would share the commission earned by the whole team, and whenshe was transferred to a new team with fewer clients than before, it would have a negative effect on her income.  The Defendant claimedteam U had been in existence and in operation in 1998, that it was not a new team; however, in a letter dated 17 July 2000 to theEOC in response to Ms Chan's EOC complaint, the Defendant's reply in paragraph 4 (i) (p.128 of the bundle) was âMs Chan was chosento handle the <u>new</u> team U because of her experience'.  While the Defendant claimed it would be more efficient to have 4 teams in DMS to handle differentproducts and customers, it failed to explain why Ms Chan was the only person in team U when the other 3 teams had 2-4 members.  Itis clearly not a satisfactory explanation when Ms Chan would only be allowed to keep two of her clients from team R at the new teamU and doing exactly the same type of work as before but without the support of other team members or account executives.  The circumstancesand conditions of the transfer constituted acts of deliberately omitting to afford her access to benefits, facilities or servicesin contravention of s.11 (2) (a) of SDO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Furthermore, Ms Chan claimed she took annual leave on 18 November and 30 November to 2 December 1998 because she was advised to restin bed due to her 2<sup>nd</sup> pregnancy.  She told Mr Caric Lee, the then Senior Manager, in December 1998 that she would not be able to take part at the Defendant'sexhibition/trade fair in early 1999 to avoid complications with her pregnancy.  The Defendant denied it was told of her pregnancybefore Ms Chan's transfer to team U in January 1999; furthermore, the Defendant argued that Ms Chan's confinement was in mid September1999, her pregnancy therefore could not have commenced in November 1998.  Ms Chan's leave records at tab 160 (p.421-426) showed thatMs Chan did take advance annual leave on 18 November and 30 November to 2 December 1998. No medical certificates accompanied thetwo applications.  Whereas the 18 January to 30 January, February and March 1999 sick leave applications were supported by medicalcertificates testifying that she was suffering from threatened abortion.  Such evidence is not inconsistent with her becoming pregnantin late November or early December.  I accept Ms Chan's evidence that she had made it plain to Mr Caric Lee and Mr Chiu that sheintended to raise a family in spite of her miscarriage in May 1998 and in late November or early December 1998 she indeed becamepregnant again and had informed Mr. Lee of it in December.  Her confinement in September 1999 does not remove the possibility thather pregnancy was diagnosed in December 1998.  It is unlikely that it was diagnosed in November given that a normal term of pregnancyis between 38 to 42 weeks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Based on the aforesaid, there is evidence in support of the claim that the transfer was made because the Defendant or its managementstaff knew Ms Chan was pregnant and she would be taking maternity leave in 1999.  Her leave taking would obviously affect team Ror team Q's annual earnings, therefore she was sent to team U in January 1999.  It is foreseeable when Ms Chan was transferred toa team with her as the only member, her sales volume and earnings would not affect anyone but herself.  It should be clear to hersupervisors that while she had no support from account executives or other team members and she was required to develop a new customerbase at a time when she was pregnant, her performance in sales was bound to suffer.  Ms Chan's transfer as the only member of teamU, without the support previously available to her and working with only 2 of her team R clients made her job a more difficult one. Her resistance to the transfer was the cause of her constant disagreement with her new supervisors Mr Man and Ms Lau and Ms Lau'scomplaints of her attitude.  All in all, the transfer was clearly detrimental to Ms Chan in many respects. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Transfer to CBS</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Ms Chan resisted the transfer to CBS in early 2000.  She considered it a demotion because she was re-located to CBS as an accountexecutive, a position which she claimed was a rank below her previous account manger position.  This claim of ranking differenceis supported by the Defendant's DMS structure table.  Further, the transfer came also after Ms Lau issued a memorandum on 1 December1999 to Ms Chan accusing her of dishonesty for duplicating a sales report purportedly submitted by Mr Man on her behalf during hermaternity leave.  Her refusal to accept the transfer and demotion was justified for the accusation of falsifying sales report waslater withdrawn by Ms Lau after Ms Chan appealed to the general manager Mr Chiu.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> Ms Chan's claim of demotion is further supported by her subsequent discovery that the CBS division was intended to be axed by theDefendant.  The Defendant did not deny that CBS was eventually closed down.  It claimed that Ms Chan had accepted the transfer becausethe alternative was to dismiss her.  This may well have been the intention of the senior staff at Toppan, but there is no documentaryevidence or otherwise to show that Ms Chan was told of this decision. On the contrary, Ms Chan was told at the time that it was nota demotion and the transfer was the result of her request for transfer.  Ms Chan admitted that she had requested for a transfer backto her old team, team R in DMS, not a transfer out of DMS.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> The Defendant admitted that they had considered the dismissal of Ms Chan, but decided to transfer her to CBS as an alternative. Given this was the motive behind the transfer of Ms Chan to CBS, the move would have given Toppan the means to declare Ms Chan redundantupon the closure of CBS.  It lends further credence to Ms Chan's claim that she was given no support from her supervisors at CBS,the rejection of her market expansion proposals for mainland China, Macau and Taiwan and the Defendant's failure to follow up uponher recruitment of a new client in Taiwan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Mr Leung in his submission suggested that the Defendant had intended to create an unfavourable working environment for Ms Chan inthe hope that she may voluntarily resign from her employment at Toppan.  Based on the evidence adduced by Ms Chan, this is a highlycredible motive behind the Defendant's treatment of Ms Chan during and after her pregnancy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Ms Lau rated Ms Chan's performance in 1999 to be below-standard based on the budget sales figures set by Ms Lau.   According to theECJ ruling adopted by the House of Lords in Webb (no. 2), the protection to the employee is afforded to her âduring her pregnancyand after childbirth notwithstanding her presence at work during maternity is essential to the proper functioning of the undertakingin which she was employed'.  The facts in this case revealed that because Ms Chan was pregnant and had taken sick and maternity leave,she was criticised for under performing.  Because of the rated sub-standard performance, she received a poor appraisal report in1999, based on which Ms Lau recommended for Ms Chan's transfer, to be re-trained as a junior sales person and demotion to CBS (seememo of 29 November 1999).  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> I find the reasons given by the Defendant for Ms Chan's transfer to team U from team R in 1999 and her demotion to CBS in January2000 to be inadequate and unsatisfactory.  It was natural for Ms Chan to feel humiliated and degraded because of the actions of MrMan and Ms Lau.  I am satisfied based on the aforesaid, the two transfers and demotion were discriminatory and unlawful treatmentunder Section 11(2)(a) of SDO.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> From the documents exhibited, in particular, the correspondences and memoranda exchanged, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilitiesthat Ms Chan was discriminated on ground of her pregnancy; from the reasons given and, in many instances, the lack of satisfactoryexplanations by the Defendant in response to Ms Chan's claim of unfair treatment, and base on the evidence in the round, a legitimateinference can be drawn that Ms Chan had been discriminated because of her pregnancy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Victimisation</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> It has been shown that Toppan had put further pressure on Ms Chan after she told senior Human Resources staff that she would be makinga complaint to the EOC in December 1999.   When Ms Chan complained to Ms Lo about the transfer to CBS against her will, she was advisedto go to the Labour Tribunal, she did so in May 2000.  She also laid a complaint at the EOC in the same month.  I accept that becausethe filing of daily activities reports was used as evidence of her acceptance of the transfer to CBS at the Labour Tribunal, Ms Chanhad stopped filing these reports in writing formally and made reports orally and informally. She claimed this was later used as oneof the reasons for her dismissal in October 2000.  Unfair pressure was placed on Ms Chan after she told the Defendant she was goingto complain to the EOC.  Clearly, it was the cause of her unfair treatment in mid-2000 leading to her dismissal in October 2000. This amounted to victimization under Section 9 (1) (d) of the SDO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> Based on the facts referred to by Ms Chan and the failure of satisfactory explanations from the Defendant, I am satisfied that MsChan was transferred to team U in 1999 and to CBS in 2000 against her wish. Furthermore, the transfer to CBS was a demotion on thebasis that she had taken sick leave and maternity leave of 127.5 days in 1999 and had performed poorly in sales compared to otherstaff members who had not been pregnant or taken the same number of days of leave.  Ms Lau had at an early stage labelled Ms Chana trouble-maker, there was no explanation as to why she was so labelled other than her poor attitude towards Ms Lau and Mr Man. Due to the pressure Ms Lau and Mr Man had put on Ms Chan, it is to be expected that Ms Chan would feel aggrieved and angry at MrMan and Ms Lau. <b> </b>It is evident from Ms Lau's August 1999 memorandum to Ms Lo that she could not work with Ms Chan.  She therefore recommended dismissingMs Chan or transferring her out of team U.   Because of Ms Chan's pregnancy at the time, it would obviously be unlawful for the Defendantto do so.  Clearly, the transfer to CBS was adopted as a step before her dismissal.  There was a clear loss of trust and goodwilldue to the Defendant's unfair treatment of Ms Chan in 1999.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> Ms Chan was dismissed in October 2000 purportedly because she had under performed in sales, adopted a poor attitude to her supervisors,resisted the transfer to team U and demotion at CBS and failed to file official daily activities reports after she commenced theLabour Tribunal proceedings.  And because she had informed the Defendant's senior management that she would be filing a complaintto the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Labour Tribunal she was shunned by her colleagues and was taken off certain accountsand duties, the working environment at Toppan had became even more difficult for her.  The evidence showed that Ms Chan was victimizedbecause she made or had threatened to make a report to the EOC contrary to S. 9 of the SDO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> Based on the aforesaid, I am satisfied the Plaintiff has successfully shown that the Defendant had discriminated and victimized MsChan due to her pregnancy and the Defendant has failed to give reasonable and adequate explanations that its treatment of Ms Chanwas justified. The Defendant is therefore liable under s. 8 and S. 9 of the SDO.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Damages</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> Damages for the statutory tort of discrimination under S. 76 of the SDO are recoverable if the Defendant is found to be in breachof Part III of SDO.  Ms Chan claims damages under the heads of loss of earnings, loss of earning capacity and injury to feelings. She accepts that credit will be given to the compensation she may receive in the Labour Tribunal proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Loss of Earnings</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Ms Chan claims a loss of earnings after she was transferred to team U in 1999 and a further reduction of her over-all income in 2000.She claimed that if she had not been transferred to team U in 1999 and CBS in 2000 her income would not have suffered.  As therewas no change to her basic salary in 1998 and 1999, the difference in income was the reduced income from commission.  There was areduction in Ms Chan's monthly basic salary at CBS from $11,350 to $9,000, she received instead a $2,000 monthly travelling allowance. There is also a marked reduction in her income from commission at CBS.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> So far as the commissions earned in 1999 were concerned, each account manager's monthly and annual sales from his/her accounts havebeen set out in a table and his/her earning percentage within the team would be tabulated (see p.553-554 of the bundle of documents). Each account manager's performance in the year can be traced on this table of monthly and annual sales.  Based further on the Defendant'sevidence and documents, about 88% of Ms Chan's commission in team R in 1998 had came from the Kumon and Crocodile accounts.  Sinceshe took these two accounts with her to team U, had the sale of products to these clients been maintained, her income from commissionwould not have been much affected.  As to her claim that sales to these clients were known to be reducing in value in 1999, it wouldhave happened even if Ms Chan and her two clients had remained in team R.  She would have to seek new clients in order to improvethe volume of her sales in any event.  To a certain extent, she did so, but had the new client removed from her in the case of TopGlory.  As the Defendant failed to disclose the DMS sales to Top Glory at the relevant date, it is not possible for the Court tomake any assessment on Ms Chan's loss caused by the loss of this account.  On the basis that any reduction in sales from the Kumonand Crocodile accounts could have been compensated by the improvement of sales of new products and recruitment of new clients, andat the same time it is a relevant concern that Ms Chan had taken 127.5 days of leave in 1999.  The leave taken by her must have animpact on her income from commission based on sales.  It is conceivable that her leave taking would have reduced the time she spenton recruitment of new clients and marketing of new products. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> Based on Ms Chan's 1998 earnings, about 50% of her annual income came from her share of the team's commission, it follows that thefall in Ms Chan's sales volume in 1999 meant that her income must suffer accordingly.   I find Ms Chan's reduced earnings in 1999was caused directly by the fall in sales in team U.  Even though the reduction of sales may have partly been contributed by the removalof some of Ms Chan's clients at team R, it remained doubtful if Ms Chan could still have achieved her 1998 sales volume in 1999 hadshe remained in team R after she had taken 127.5 days of leave out of 286 work days in 1999 (365 â 65 â 14 annual leave).  Basedon an analysis of her 1999 commission, out of the 300 work days of the year less 14 days annual leave, she put in (127.5- 14) / (300-14)= 39.68% less of her colleagues' work days in 1999.  The $82,426.90 commission she earned in 1999 represented 39.59% of the $208,151.90earned by her in 1998.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">                      </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> Consequently, the figures showed while the transfer from team R to team U may have affected her morale, it would not have affectedthe commission earned by her in 1999 unless she was sharing the commissions earned by other colleagues in team R to supplement herown income. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> It is a different case with the transfer to CBS in 2000.  Ms Chan's basic monthly salary was reduced to $9,000 in 2000.  She received$2,000 travelling allowance monthly and was guaranteed 4 months commission of $5,200 per month.  The combined monthly income fellfar short of her 1998 and 1999 income.  This transfer to CBS was based on the recommendation of Ms Lau and supervisor Mr Man.  Thetransfer had clearly caused Ms Chan a loss of income in 2000. The loss was due directly to the demotion with a reduction of basicsalary at the CBS and she was deprived of the client accounts previously handled by her such as Kumon and Crocodile. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> Adopting Mr Leung's calculations on loss of income, on the basis that Ms Chan did work full time up to 25 October 2000 (there wasno evidence to the contrary), based on the Defendant's basis for calculation of commission from 1 April to 31 March of the followingyear, Ms Chan's commission at DMS in the 12 months prior to her transfer to team U, i.e. 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999, was $208,151.90. The total income including salary, travelling allowance, CNY bonus and commission in 1998 was $359,301.90 (136,200+208151.90+3600+11350). Her income including severance pay in 2000 was $194,796.70 (81,000+55,900+18,000+7,372.60+13,500+19,024.10), Ms Chan's loss in 2000was $(359,301.90 â 194,796.70) = $164,505.20.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Further Loss of Earnings</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> Ms Chan has a duty to mitigate her loss by actively seeking alternative employment.  She claimed she had found a job at a printingfirm which paid her a monthly salary of $ 32,000 after she left Toppan, but during her employment, the proprietor was embarrassedby the knowledge of Ms Chan's dispute with Toppan and she lost her job in May 2001.  She claimed she has lost confidence in seekingsimilar employment subsequently.  She exhibited a few letters of job applications in support.  She asks for 12 months earnings atthe level of her earnings in 1998 at Toppan as compensation under this head.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> On the issue of loss of future earnings, Judge Christie in his judgment in the case of K &amp; Others v.

As aresult, periods of future loss may be limited to 12 â24 months, or even less.'</i> â¦</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">â¦I do not think the learned authors of Discrimination: Remedies and Quantum meant that there is a cap to claims for future lossesin discrimination cases. They were, it seems, assuming assessments in cases where the plaintiffs had yet to find alternative work.In such cases assessments of two years or less as the time it would take to find employment are understandable. This must depend,however, on the facts of each case. In discrimination claims in England, there is no cap on future loss, as the concluding passageof the judgment of the EAT (Morrison J) in Minister of Defence v. Cannock  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/irc/1994/918.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] IRC 918</a> at p. 955G makes clear:</p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><i>âIn our guidance, we respectfully suggest that industrial tribunals need to keep a due sense of proportion when assessing compensation.Some of the applicants have received awards more appropriate for a person who has lost a career due to some kind of continuing disability.All of these applicants who were entitled to any award of compensation of loss of earnings are assumed to have been ready willingand able to resume their career in the services six months after their first child was born and, therefore, ready willing and ableto undertake reasonably suitable alternative employment. To this extent, their compensation for loss of  earnings is not likely tobe different from the thousands of cases of unfair dismissal with which the industrial tribunals are having to deal with each year,albeit, that there is no cap on the award.'</i> <i>â             </i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Following the ratio in the case of Ministry of Defence v. Cannock, I am satisfied that with Ms Chan's work experience and trainingin design, she should be able to find employment commensurate with her experience within a reasonable period of time.  She in factdid so soon after, but for the circumstances of her dismissal at Toppan, she would have been gainfully employed.  Unlike the Cannockcase &amp; the case of K. &amp; Ors. v. Secretary for Justice, Ms Chan is looking for a job in the private sector, not in the disciplinaryforces.  She should be able to find alternative employment within 6 months.  I allow damages equivalent to 6 months of her earningsin 1998 in the sum of $(359,301.9/12) x 6 = $179,650.95.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><u>Injury to Feelings</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> Ms Lau clearly held a biased opinion of Ms Chan, this is evident from her memoranda to senior management accusing her of fraud andmistakes in 1999 and 2000.

Sums in this range should be awarded in the most serious cases, such as wherethere has been a lengthy campaign of discriminatory harassment on the ground of sex or race.  This case falls within that band. Only in the most exceptional case should an award of compensation for injury to feelings exceed Â£25,000.
