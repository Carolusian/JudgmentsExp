Whitneyis based in New York.  Its principal business is to recruit and place senior executives in the banking and financial services industries. It is the parent company of subsidiaries based worldwide including Hong Kong.  Mr Peat was based in Hong Kong and was appointeda director of the local company.  That is the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, which I shall call Whitney Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  But on 29 June last Mr Peat gave notice and resigned from Whitney and let it be known that he was to join a company called Heidrick&amp; Struggles International Inc.  Heidrick as I shall call it is also American with offices elsewhere including Hong Kong, andis in competition with Whitney.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  It is said of Mr Peat that shortly before his resignation and departure and in breach of his contractual obligations with Whitney,he leaked confidential information to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant Alexandra Goodfellow.  Ms Goodfellow is an employee of Heidrick based in Sydney. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  It is said of this information, contained in a document called the Overview, that it came from Whitneyâs database and comprisedparticulars of people described as real estate professionals employed in selected investment banks in Asia.  Jeffrey Sussman, theChief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Whitney, stated in an affidavit in support of the application for an injunctionthat in effect this database is part of the lifeblood of Whitney, because it provides a pool of prospective candidates for positionswithin the financial services and related industries that Whitney are retained to fill.  Whitney would not have permitted this materialto be published outside its walls and most assuredly would not under any circumstances have condoned its release to a competitorsuch as Heidrick.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Mr Peatâs conduct gave rise to this action.  In the Endorsement of Claim annexed to the writ Whitney claims damages against himfor breaches of trust and confidence arising under the Operation Agreement and Employment Agreement and by virtue of his directorshipin Whitney Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Ms Goodfellow is sued for having requested the information and thus to have aided and abetted the breaches.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Interestingly no injunction is claimed.  The plaintiffs it seems will be content to recover damages to be assessed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The <i>ex parte</i> application for an interlocutory injunction came before the Duty Judge of the day on 30 July 2007.  Service out of the jurisdictionwas asked for because Mr Peat, having left Whitney, was then on holiday in France and Ms Goodfellow is based in Sydney.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Judge gave leave for service but declined to consider the application for the injunction <i>ex parte</i> and dismissed it.  He gave leave instead for an application to issue <i>inter partes</i>, returnable on 3 August 2007.  By this date both defendants had engaged local solicitors, who accepted service, and counsel.  Onthat date the matter came before me as the designated Summons Judge.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The injunctions asked for seek to restrain both defendants, pending trial or further order, from divulging information confidentialto Whitney to any person and, in particular, to Heidrick.  Further, they call for both defendants to file affidavits disclosing anyother information confidential to Whitney they have had and the names of any to whom that has already been disclosed with full anddetailed particulars.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The applications were opposed, and this having been a callover, in the normal way the parties through counsel would have invitedof me directions for the filing and service of evidence and for setting down for hearing as a defended cause.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  But at the outset counsel for both defendants (separately represented but adopting a united front) made two preliminary points forthe purpose of stalling or extinguishing the applications.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The first is that this court has no jurisdiction to deal with the action and that the interlocutory application should be stayedpending the outcome of an application to strike out that they have undertaken to proceed with in timely fashion.  The second wasput up in the event that I am satisfied that this court has jurisdiction.  It is that on the plaintiffsâ case following a successfultrial, damages will be an adequate remedy.  Whilst this is not a bar to an application and grant of an interlocutory injunction,in the particular circumstances of this case there would be no justification or logic for one.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  First then, the jurisdictional point.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It derives from the contracts Whitney and Peat were parties to.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The Operation Agreement contains at 3.3 under the subheading âconfidentialityâ the following, wherein Mr Peat is described asa shareholder:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ the shareholders acknowledge and agree that all information heretofore or hereafter provided to them by or on behalf of the Companyconcerning the business of the Company shall be deemed strictly confidential, shall belong to the Company and its Affiliates (andno other Person), and shall not, except as required by law, he disclosed to any Person without the prior consent of the Board. <i>â¦</i>â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Employment Agreement at 4(a) contained again under the heading âconfidentialityâ the following, wherein Mr Peat is describedas Executive:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">a.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote">Executive recognizes and acknowledges that: (i) in the course of Executiveâs employment pursuant to this Agreement, Executive shallbecome aware of valuable trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries(collectively referred to herein as the â<b><u>Confidential Information</u></b>â); (ii) the Confidential Information is the property of the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) the use, misappropriation or disclosureof the Confidential Information would constitute a breach of trust and is reasonably likely to cause irreparable injury to the Companyand its subsidiaries; (iv) it is essential to the protection of the Companyâs and each of its subsidiaries goodwill and to themaintenance of the Companyâs and each of its subsidiaries competitive position that the Confidential Information be kept secretand that Executive not disclose the Confidential Information to others or use the Confidential Information to Executiveâs own advantageor the advantage of others, and (v) the Executiveâs agreement to be bound by the provisions of this Paragraph 4 is a material inducementfor the Company to enter into this Agreement.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  As the endorsement to the writ reveals, Whitney brings its claim for damages for breach of these contractual terms.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  But both contracts contain clauses going to governing law and exclusive jurisdiction.

Of course there are many circumstances in which a breach of confidence action is founded in tort. As Mr Hon said, the editors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> devote a whole chapter to the subject.  But equally it can arise in contract.

Adirector may have a fiduciary relationship with his company or a partner with his co-partners which will give rise to a duty of confidence. An express duty of confidence may be imposed by a contract of employment.  In other cases, the courts have found a term to be impliedor have proceeded on the basis of an implied trust, though it is not generally necessary to approach the matter through equitabledoctrines.  The duty is highest while the employment is continuing.  The right of an employer to restrain an employee or ex-employeefrom divulging confidential information to others or from making use of it for his own benefit or that of a subsequent employer iswell-established.  The result can occasionally be to put an employee in a worse position than the rest of the world, which may acquireand be at liberty to use the information in legitimate ways.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I have to say that I can think of no clearer example of a breach of confidentiality founded in contract than in this case; thusit follows that the parties are committed to the exclusive jurisdiction clause of their contracts and this includes Whitney, whichwas after all the author and instigator of such provisions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The alternative proposition, that I exercise my discretion by considering the forum conveniens arguments, has a certain logic, giventhat Mr Peat lives and works in Hong Kong and the breach was committed in Hong Kong, that Whitney Hong Kong is in Hong Kong and soon.
