The 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff and the defendant are residents of Hong Kong.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff is a shareholder and director of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs.  The defendant is a PRC lawyer said to be in the employment of ä¸­åäººæ°è§£æ¾è»ç¸½æ¿æ²»é¨å¸æ³å±æ³å¾é¡§åè(translated as the Legal Advisory Division of the Justice Bureau head of the General Political Department of the Peopleâs LiberationArmy of the PRC) (âPLA Legal Advisory Divisionâ).</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In 1994, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs entered into agreements with one Beijing Xinglong Park Limited (åäº¬èéå¬åæéå¬å¸) (âBeijing Xinglongâ)for the development of two blocks of apartments in the Beijing Xinglong Lakeside Villa Project (åäº¬èéæ¹æ¯å«å¢) (âtheBeijing Propertiesâ).  The contractual completion date was 30 September 1994.  Pursuant to the agreements, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs had each paid sumstotalling HK$96,600,000 to Beijing Xinglong as deposits and purchase price for the Beijing Properties. Subsequently, disputes arose between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs and Beijing Xinglong.  It is the plaintiffsâ contention that Beijing Xinglong failed to deliver possession of the BeijingProperties to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs on the agreed completion date and further failed to pay interest for the period of delay as stipulated in their agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In June 2000, the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff came to know the defendant.  According to the plaintiffs, the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff acting on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs had subsequently agreed to and did appoint the defendant as their agent to recover the possession of the Beijing Properties. It is not in dispute that a number of documents were signed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs in connection with the taking of proceedings in the mainland to deal with the dispute over the Beijing Properties.  Theyare as follows:</p>    <p>(1)       A special authorization (ç¹å«ææ¬) dated 12 March 2001;</p>    <p>(2)       A letter of authorization (ææ¬å§ææ¸) dated 12 June 2001;</p>    <p>(3)       A legal service agreement (æ¶å¤å¾å¸«æ¥­åå§æä»£çåè­°) dated 19 September 2001:</p>    <p>(4)              Two letters of authorization (ææ¬å§ææ¸) dated 28 September 2001; and</p>    <p>(5)       Two letters of authorization (ææ¬å§ææ¸) dated 15 April 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The legal service agreement dated 19 September 2001 contain the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ä¸­åè¡å£«åºéçµç¹ (translated as China Themis Funds Organization of China) was appointed as the agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs in charge of the legal proceedings to pursue civil and economic rights and criminal prosecutionsrelating to the BeijingProperties (clause 1).</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ã</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">ã</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The PLA Legal Advisory Division was appointed as the agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs responsible for providing legal services incidental to the said legal proceedings (clause 5).</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs agreed to pay lawyer fees as stated in the agreement by paying a deposit of HK$ 1 million to China Themis Funds Organizationupon the signing of the agreement, with the balance of the lawyer fees to be paid in one go after the completion of the legal proceedings(clause 6).</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(4)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The parties agreed that the agreement is protected by the laws of the PRC and the laws of Hong Kong (clause 8).</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It is the plaintiffsâ case that the legal service agreement provided for the lawyer feesto be at 10% of the total amount actuallyrecovered in the proceedings.

Out of them, HK$ 1 million was as deposit for the lawyerfees.  According to the defendant, the balance of HK$9,249,366 was as reimbursement of costs, expenses, court fees and charges incurredby the PLA Legal Advisory Division for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  By a notice of termination of appointment dated 4 April 2004 signed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs terminated the appointment and authorization of the PLA Legal Advisory Division.  On 7 April 2004, a Mr Yang Xiang Wen(æ¥å­¸æ°) of the PLA Legal Advisory Division signed to acknowledge receipt of the notice.  Mr Yang also wrote on the notice thatthe PLA Legal Advisory Division had not received payments of HK$10,249,360 as set out in the notice.  </p>    <p class="heading">The application for stay</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 12 May 2003, the plaintiffs commenced the present action against the defendant claiming for an account of how the sum of $10,249,366was applied and for payment of any sum found due upon the taking of account.  The Writ was served on the defendant in Hong Kong.The defendant had filed an acknowledgement of service. Subsequently, the Statement of Claim was re-amended to add a plea in the tortof deceit and a claim for damages for breach of fiduciary duty and for deceit.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 16 July 2003, the defendant issued a summons applying to stay all the proceedings in this action on the ground of <i>forum non convenien</i> on the basis that the Beijing courts are the more appropriate forum.  On 16 December 2003, the Master handed down his decision dismissingthe defendantâs summons.

It would not be enough to show that the Beijing courts are equally appropriate asthe Hong Kong court to deal with the claim: <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v.

Mr Ku in his submissions no longer relies on this point about the non-availability orinconvenience of witnesses.  Indeed with modern technology, the fact that witnesses cannot travel to Hong Kong to testify in courtis no longer a factor of great significance.</p>    <p class="heading">The <i>partiesâ case</i> <i>and the issues in dispute</i></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In order to assess the grounds relied upon by the defendant, it is necessary to briefly examine the partiesâ case and the issuesin dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In essence, the plaintiffsâ claim is that the defendant in his capacity as the plaintiffsâ agent, had received the money forthe specific purpose of paying lawyer fees and reimbursing the costs and expenses, court fees and charges incurred.  As such, heis liable in contract and by reason of his fiduciary duty as agent to account to the plaintiffs how the money had been applied. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  As for the claim in deceit, the plaintiffsâ case is that the plaintiffs were only obliged under the legal service agreement topay HK$ 1 million as deposit for lawyer fees, and were not obliged to make payment for advance lawyer fees before the completionof the proceedings against Beijing Xinglong.  The plaintiffs say that the defendant had falsely represented the purposes and reasonsfor the payments of the money by representing that they were to reimburse the âout-of-pocketâ court expenses and charges.  Infact, the PLA Legal Advisory Division and the China Themis Funds Organization did not incur costs and expenses on behalf of the plaintiffsin the amount represented by the defendant.  The plaintiffs also say that the documents and materials revealed by the defendant showthat out of the money paid by the plaintiffs, HK$ 2 million was received by China Themis Fund Organization as âdonationsâ, anotherHK$ 4 million was received by the PLA Legal Advisory Division as âadvance lawyer feesâ, and HK$ 1 million was received by thedefendant as âadvance settlement of legal consultation fees, subsidies for traveling, communication and living expenses, and notarizationfeesâ.  The plaintiffs case is that the defendant made the false representation knowing they were false and with the intentionof luring the plaintiffs to make the payments. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Despite the lengthy affirmations together with the many exhibits filed by the defendant, it is not altogether clear what preciselyis the defendantâs case or defence to the claim.  The bulk of his affirmations deal with the plaintiffsâ disputes with BeijingXinglong and the actions and proceedings taken in the mainland in connection with the disputes.  The defendant had also gone at considerablelength to explain the role and relationship between China Themis Fund Organization and PLA Legal Advisory Division, and the mannerin which lawyer fees are to be charged and paid in the mainland.  All of these are however irrelevant and immaterial to the plaintiffsâclaim.  Mr Ku who only appears for the defendant on the appeal accepts, too, that there are a lot of irrelevant materials in theaffirmations.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  It would appear that the broad grounds of the defendantâs defence are that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">It was PLA Legal Advisory Division and China Themis Fund Organization, and not the defendant that were employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs.

On the first issue, it involves determiningthe relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant.  It is primarily an issue of interpretation of the various documents signedby the parties, notably the four letters of authorizations, which were all executed in Hong Kong at a solicitorsâ office.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Ku submits that the two letters of authorization dated 28 September 2001 are merely procedural documents intended for filingwith the mainland courts and are documents ancillary to the legal service agreement, and reliance should not be placed on them indetermining the relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant.  This submission is, however, not supported by the expertevidence adduced by the defendant.  In the Opinion of Professor Wang (çææ¯) dated 23 June 2004 (at paragraph 6), it is statedthat all the four letters of authorization have binding legal effect under Article 59 of the Civil Procedure Law of the PRC.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr Ku also submits that the legal service agreement has to be interpreted in accordance with the PRC laws, either solely or in conjunctionwith consideration based on Hong Kong law, hence the interest of the parties is more suitably served by having the case tried inthe mainland.  This submission stems from the Opinion of Professor Wang, which stated (in paragraph 9) that because the parties didnot choose the law of other places to be the applicable law, the applicable law for the legal service agreement should be the PRClaw.  In so stating, Professor Wang had not referred to clause 8 of the legal service agreement, which stipulates that the agreementis protected by both the PRC law and the Hong Kong law.  He had also not explained why despite clause 8, the agreement remains tobe governed by the PRC law when Article 145 of the General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC provides that the parties to acontract involving foreign interests, of which the legal service agreement is one, may choose the applicable law for settling thedisputes over the contract. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In <i>Ho Siu Pui v. Yue Sheng Finance Limited &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKC%20621" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKC 621</a>, Woo JA in dealing with a contract that provides for it to be protected by the laws of both Hong Kong and the PRC, observed thatâthere is nothing wrong for the plaintiff to choose the Hong Kong High Court as the forum for resolving the disputes and to seekthe protection of the Hong Kong Lawâ.  In the premises, notwithstanding the Opinion of Professor Wang, it cannot be said that thelegal service agreement has to be interpreted in accordance with the PRC law thereby rendering the Beijing courts the more appropriateforum .</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Additionally, Mr Ku submits that the interpretation of the documents and the PRC law is better done in the mainland courts becausethey stand to have a better understanding of how things are done in the mainland, and that the letters of authorization and the legalservice agreement are documents that they would frequently come across.  I am unable to accept this submission.  Firstly, it is asa matter of principle inappropriate to compare the competency and experience or otherwise of two jurisdictions.  Secondly, thereis no basis for suggesting or believing that the Hong Kong court does not have the requisite ability and skill to interpret legaldocuments, whether of the kind in question or generally.  Thirdly, the evidence before the court does not show that special skillis required to interpret the legal documents in question.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Turning to the second issue on the claim to account, the expert evidence tendered by the defendant is not conclusive of the issueand does not support the defendantâs contention that there is no duty to account under the PRC law.  As pointed out by Mr Pow inhis submissions, Professor Wang only stated that the legal service agreement did not expressly provide for a duty to account.  ProfessorWang did not state whether a duty to account could arise as a matter of law under the legal service agreement.  He also did not addressthe effect of the four letters of authorization that are also relied upon by the plaintiffs.  In the circumstances, there is no evidenceto support the contention that the PRC law and the Hong Kong law differ as to whether there is a contractual or fiduciary duty ona lawyer to account to his client for money had and received.  The Hong Kong court will have to proceed on the basis that the PRClaw and the Hong Kong law are in this regard the same and no difficulty will arise in the application: <i>Palace Hotel Ltd v. Owner of Happy Pioneer (a ship)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20HKC%20640" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] HKC 640.</a></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr Ku has also made the point that the proper parties to account to the plaintiffs are PLA Legal Advisory Division or China ThemisFund organization, and that either the plaintiffs should join them as a party to the proceedings or the defendant should be giventhe opportunity to join them.  It is said that in either case, the mainland courts are to be preferred for the interests of all theparties and the ends of justice.  There is however no explanation or elaboration on the reasons for regarding the Beijing courtsasthe more appropriate forum.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  As to the claim in deceit, the issues are likely to be factual.  As the matter now stands, the plaintiffsâ case of falsity islargely built upon the documents disclosed by the defendant in these proceedings.  At the same time, the fraud is said to have beencommitted in Hong Kong with the damage suffered by the plaintiffs in Hong Kong.  There is on the materials nothing to suggest thatthe Beijing courts are a more appropriate forum than the Hong Kong courts.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It would appear that the main thrust of Mr Kuâs submissions is that the present claim is a continuation of the mainland proceedingsand that the complaints of the plaintiffs cannot be tried without due regard to the law and practice of the PRC in relation to themainland proceedings. The analysis of the plaintiffâs claim and the issues in dispute show that the present claim is not a continuationof the mainland proceedings.  The litigations concerning the Beijing Properties only provide the background to the present claim. The submission that to litigate the present claim in Hong Kong is to artificially sever it from the set of proceedings in the mainlandis untenable.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr Ku further argues emphatically that the way of doing things in the mainland is very different from that in Hong Kong.  Hong Kongcourt may therefore find certain practices and events very unusual and difficult to believe when those are in fact the way of doingthings in the mainland.  It is further said that those practices would not be understood by Hong Kong court.  Apart from the factthat this is a  vague and loose submission, it is also in my view an extraordinary submission.</p>    <p class="heading">Multiplicity of proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The evidence filed by the defendant after the lodging of the present appeal reveals that China Themis Fund Organization had commencedlitigation against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs in the Beijing Intermediate Court.  The Beijing litigation was brought on 25 April 2004, well after the present claimwas brought.  This is therefore not a case of <i>lis alibi pendens</i>.  Any multiplicity of proceedings would also seem to be self-generated.  Further, while it is said that the Beijing litigation hasa more comprehensive coverage, it does not appear from the document exhibited that the defendant and the 3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff are parties to the litigation.  It is therefore doubtful whether the issues or relief sought in the present claim willbe addressed in the Beijing proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  For the reasons mentioned above, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the Beijing courts are a clearly and distinctly moreappropriate forum.  The Master is correct in dismissing the defendantâs summons for a stay of the proceedings in this action. Accordingly, the defendantâs appeal is dismissed.  The normal rule of costs follow event applies.  There is an order <i>nisi</i> that the defendant pays the plaintiffs the costs of the appeal, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(C Chu)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            Hong Kong</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Jason Pow instructed by Messrs.
