Miss Ma stated in evidence that in total 3 offer letterswere issued by Chesterton Petty on behalf of the Plaintiff. The first one was issued on 22 March 2000 ("the first offer"). On 23March 2000, Miss Ma spoke with Mr. Young of the Defendant over the telephone. Mr. Young allegedly said that the first offer was acceptablesubject to certain amendments. The second offer letter containing the amendments ("the second offer") was then faxed to Mr. Youngthat day. Then Miss Ma spoke with Mr. Young who indicated more amendments and a third offer letter ("the third offer") was faxedto Mr. Young the same day. In a subsequent telephone conversation, Mr. Young allegedly confirmed acceptance of the third offer. Thisthird offer is the one referred to in Paragraph 4 (a) and (b) of the Amended Particulars of Claim. It is important to note that all3 offers were marked "subject to contract". According to Miss Ma, it was standard practice of Chesterton Petty to mark offer letters"subject to contract".</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The evidence of Mr. Chan Chiu Kwok, apart from confirming that he gave instructions to Miss Ma, essentially deals with the allegedbreaches of the Agreement. According to Mr. Chan, the Defendant failed to re-paint the premises with paint as specified by the Plaintiff.Although the premises were re-painted, the standard of workmanship was far below that to meet the express or implied terms of theAgreement. Moreover, the Defendant failed to carry out the work in the To-Do List as expressly or implied agreed.</p>    <p class="heading">The Defendant's Case</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Young gave evidence on behalf of the Defendant. His evidence tallies with his written statement which says:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"5. Prior to the execution of the Written Tenancy Agreement, all the negotiations for the terms of the proposed lease were made betweenme acting on behalf of the Defendant and Miss Lynn Ma of Chesterton Petty Limited, the estate agent acting for the Plaintiff. I didnot have any direct contact or discussion with the Plaintiff.</p>        <p class="quote">6. It was known to and well understood by me and Miss Lynn Ma of Chesterton Petty Limited that all such negotiations were made onthe basis of "Subject to Contract", i.e. any proposed term or condition would not be legally binding on either party until and unlessthe same had been reduced into writing and contained in a written tenancy agreement to be executed by the parties.</p>        <p class="quote">7. During the negotiation process some proposals made by Miss Lynn Ma on behalf of the Plaintiff were rejected by me. These unacceptableproposals included (but were not limited to) break clause, special conditions as to the state of the premises and suggested decorationworks. I did make it very clear to Miss Lynn Ma that the Defendant would not accept any of these proposals.</p>        <p class="quote">8. During the negotiation Miss Lynn Ma of Chesterton Petty Limited had sent me two letters dated 22 March 2000 and 23 March 2000 respectively.Both letters were marked as "Subject to Contract". This was consistent with what I have said in paragraph 6 above, namely all thenegotiations for the terms of the proposed lease were made on the basis of "Subject to Contract". Both these letters were signedby Chesterton Petty Limited alone on behalf of the Plaintiff. The Defendant did not sign any of these letters because:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) they contained those unacceptable proposals exemplified above, which were rejected by me as aforesaid; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b) only the agreed terms would be reduced into writing and contained in the Written Tenancy Agreement to be executed by the parties.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">9. After the negotiation the Written Tenancy Agreement dated 31 March 2000 was eventually executed by Taipan Management Company actingon behalf of the Defendant and the Plaintiff herself to include and contain only the agreed terms of the lease. Such unacceptableproposals as break clause, special conditions as to the state of the premises and suggested decoration works were not included inthe Written Tenancy Agreement at all because they were rejected by me as known to the Plaintiff through Miss Lynn Ma.</p>        <p class="quote">10. Paragraph 5 of the Covenants/Conditions of the Written Tenancy Agreement did provide for the following renovation works to bemade by the tenant herself (i.e. the Plaintiff) at her own costs because this term was agreed by both parties:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) renovation of kitchen cabinets, including installation of an exhaust hood;</p>            <p class="quote">(b) renovation of closet in the master bedroom; and</p>            <p class="quote">(c) renewal of electricity main switch box and all wall sockets, and installation of additional wall sockets.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">11. The said paragraph 5 of the Covenants/Conditions further provided that, as mutually agreed, all the above works done at the owncosts of the Plaintiff shall become the property of the Landlord (i.e. the Defendant) upon physical vacation of the premises by thePlaintiff.</p>        <p class="quote">12. On or about 30 March 2000 Chesterton Petty Limited sent the Defendant by fax a list of the suggested decoration works. However,as mentioned above, these suggested decoration works were rejected by me and this was known to Chesterton Petty Limited. This explainedwhy the Written Tenancy Agreement did not include any of these suggested works and the Plaintiff still executed the Written TenancyAgreement dated 31 March 2000.</p>        <p class="quote">13. Accordingly the Defendant had never agreed with the Plaintiff and/or Chesterton Petty Limited to do any decoration and/or paintingworks. Therefore the Written Tenancy Agreement did not provide for any decoration and/or painting works to be done by the Defendantat all. Although the Defendant had re-painted the walls and sealed the floors of the premises before the commencement of the saidtenancy and adopted the colour preference of the paints suggested by the Plaintiff's said estate agent, none of these works was doneby the Defendant in pursuance of any agreed term of the lease. These works would have been done by the Defendant in any event withoutregard to the lease.</p>        <p class="quote">14. The Written Tenancy Agreement only provides for the said tenancy to include carpark No. G7 without stating whether this carparkis a covered space or not."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In essence, there are two issues of fact. The first is whether the Plaintiff through Miss Ma or Mr. Chan knew before the signingof the Written Tenancy Agreement dated 31 March 2000 that the car parking space G7 was uncovered. The second is whether Mr. Youngdid agree over the telephone on 23 March 2000 the terms of the second and third offers. In the light of the circumstances of thiscase, it is not necessary to make findings on these two issues. However, for completeness sake, I find that, on the balance of probabilities,Mr. Young told the truth. He was, of course, rigorously cross-examined by Mr. Tsu on behalf of the Plaintiff but unshaken. Moreover,his evidence is supported by the offer letters and the Written Tenancy Agreement dated 31 March 2000. The evidence of Miss Ma andMr. Chan, pretending not to know the number of the car parking space before 31st March 2000, and not to have inspected the car parkingspace until some time in April 2000 to discover that it was uncovered, is highly incredible. Both Miss Ma and Mr. Chan worked fora reputable professional estate agency. Mr. Chan himself especially has a personal interest in the matter. It is beyond belief thatthey would have not taken the trouble to ask, well before 31st March 2000, the number of the car parking space if the car parkingspace was originally included. Mr. Young was just one telephone away and there was no suggestion that he was not readily contactablethrough the telephone. Miss Ma and Mr. Chan said that they relied on alleged misrepresentation made by Mr. Chan over the telephonethat the car parking space was covered. The third offer dated 23 March 2000 specifically stated that the car parking space was covered.However, the Written Tenancy Agreement dated 31 March 2000 omitted the word "covered" for the car parking space. Since the thirdoffer was careful to include "covered", one wonders why the Written Tenancy Agreement dated 31 March 2000 without "covered" was accepted;unless, of course, Miss Ma and Mr. Chan knew by then that indeed the car parking space was in fact not a covered parking space.</p>    <p class="heading">The Contract</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Amended Particulars of Claim has been quoted in extenso to show that the Plaintiff relies on "the Agreement", i.e. one contract.Nowhere in the Plaintiff's pleadings refers to any collateral contract or collateral agreement. However, Mr. Tsu for the Plaintiffin his final submission discusses "the essence of the oral collateral contract". This is entirely without proper basis. In any event,it will be seen that, in my judgment, it was never the intention of the parties to enter into any contract by oral agreement. Theparties intended to bind themselves by a contract to be evidenced in writing.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The case, as mentioned earlier, can and should be resolved according to basic principles of contract law adumbrated by Mr. Youngof the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Chitty on Contracts, Volume 1, 28th Edition, Para 2-108 has this to say about agreements "subject to contract":-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" <em>Agreement "subject to contract."</em> Agreements for the sale of land by private treaty are usually made "subject to contract." Such agreements are normally regarded asincomplete until the terms of a formal contract have been settled and approved by the parties. Thus in <em>Winn v. Bull</em> the defendant agreed to take a lease of a house for a specified time as a stated rent, "subject to the preparation and approval ofa formal contract." It was held that there was not enforceable contract and Jessel M.R. said, "It comes, therefore, to this, thatwhere you have a proposal or agreement made in writing expressed to be subject to a formal contract being prepared, it means whatit says; it is subject to and is dependent upon a formal contract being prepared." Other examples where it has been held that theparties have made the operation of their contract conditional on the execution of a further document are an agreement to purchasefreehold land "subject to a proper contract to be prepared by the vendor's solicitors", an agreement to take a flat "subject to suitableagreements being arranged between your solicitors and mine", an agreement to grant a lease "subject tot the terms of a lease" (becausethis meant "subject to the terms to be contained in a lease executed by the lessor"); and an agreement to purchase a house "subjectto formal contract to be prepared by the vendors' solicitors if the vendors shall so require." In each of these cases the court heldthat the agreement gave rise to no legal liability. On the same principle, it has been held that an agreement to pay a fee to anystate agent was not legally binding where it was expressed to be "subject to contract."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Despite her pleadings, the Plaintiff relies on an agreement all the terms of which were actually contained in the third offer dated23 March 2000. That offer was issued by Chesterton Petty on behalf of the Plaintiff as "subject to contract". Chesterton Petty asprofessional estate agents can hardly say that they were not aware of the meaning and effect of marking the offer "subject to contract".</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Miss Ma said in evidence that Mr. Young of the Defendant orally agreed the terms as stated in the third offer dated 23 March 2000.It is on this basis that the Plaintiff contends that there was a binding contract under which the Defendant was obliged to perform.However, the conduct of the parties at the time clearly shows that the parties did not consider themselves to be bound except bya formal written contract. Chesteron Petty issued the first offer on 22 March 2000. On this written offer was a distinctly markedspace for the Defendant to sign for acceptance. Prima facie, Chesterton Petty as agent for the Plaintiff intended acceptance to bein writing. On 23 March 2000, twice Miss Ma had telephone conversation with Mr. Young of the Defendant, on both occasions allegedlyMr. Young orally accepted the terms of offer being negotiated. Yet offer letters setting out all the terms, including the terms thesubject of dispute in this action, were sent by fax to the Defendant for signature for acceptance. If orally acceptance by Mr. Youngfor the Defendant was deemed good enough, there would be no need for sending out the second and third offers in writing for signature.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Moreover, each of the offer letters was marked "subject to contract". Indeed the "contract" was concluded in the form of the WrittenTenancy Agreement dated 31 March 2000. That Written Tenancy Agreement did not incorporate all the terms in the third offer dated23 March 2000. For instance, the "break clause" originally in all the three offer letters was deleted in the Written Tenancy Agreement.Mr. Chan Chiu Kwok said in evidence that the Plaintiff agreed to delete the break clause because the Defendant agreed to paint thepremises according to the colour scheme specified by the Plaintiff. In other words, Mr. Chan tried to justify the deletion of thebreak clause as a variation of an originally binding agreement. However, if there was already a binding agreement on all the termsstated in the third offer dated 23 March 2000, the Defendant was already bound to re-paint the premises according to the colour schemeto be specified by the Plaintiff, there was no need or no reason for the Plaintiff to agree to delete the break clause.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The Written Tenancy Agreement dated 31 March 2000 clearly was meant to include every term finally agreed by the parties. It evenincluded particulars of improvements that the Plaintiff was to make.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Taking all factors and circumstances into consideration, the Plaintiff, or rather her agents, at every step took great care to spellout every detail to be included into the contract that was to be concluded. The contract that was actually concluded, i.e. the WrittenTenancy Agreement dated 31st March 2000, must, therefore, be taken as containing all the terms and conditions agreed by the partiesand the only contract binding on the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The Written Tenancy Agreement does not refer to the car parking space G7 as covered. So, quite apart from the evidence of Mr. Youngwhom I believe as a truthful witness that the Plaintiff and her agents well knew before 31 March 2000 that the said car parking spaceG7 was uncovered, the Plaintiff cannot say that the Defendant contracted to lease the premises with a covered car parking space.Moreover, since none of the Special Conditions in the third offer dated 23 March 2000 was included in the Written Tenancy Agreementdated 31 March 2000, the Plaintiff cannot hold the Defendant to those terms. Since all the terms as agreed by the parties are statedin the Written Tenancy Agreement dated 31 March 2000, there is in principle no room for implied terms. All the implied terms pleadedby the Plaintiff, I hold, are wholly unfounded.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Tsu for the Plaintiff seems to argue that there was part performance giving life to "the Agreement" reached on the 23 March 2000.The alleged acts of part performance being acceptance by the Defendant of payment of $30,000 and the painting of the premises. Sofar as the payment of $30,000 is concerned, it is common ground that it is a holding deposit for the Defendant to withdraw the premisesfrom the market pending conclusion of the contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. Such holding deposit of course in noway constitutes commitment on the part of the Defendant to lease the premises to the Plaintiff. Even on the wording in the thirdoffer dated 23 March 2000, the Defendant was at all times entitled to refund the holding deposit to the Plaintiff and lease the premisesto another party without being liable to the Plaintiff in damages for loss of bargain or otherwise. As to the painting, a landlordis always at liberty to re-paint his property. Painting is in no way a clear commitment referable to a binding agreement to lease.</p>    <p class="heading">Implied Covenants</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Mr. Tsu for the Plaintiff also argues that the Defendant as landlord has a duty implied by law to deliver to the Plaintiff as tenantpremises in tenantable repair. If this argument is accepted, because there is expert evidence from the Plaintiff that the paintingarranged by the Defendant was grossly sub-standard, the Defendant can be held liable.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> I have no doubt that the standard of tenantable repair is higher than the standard of fitness for habitation. Chitty on Contracts,Volume 1, 28th Edition, Paragraph 13-016 says that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" <em>Fitness for habitation: leases.</em> In general, a landlord gives no implies undertaking that leased premises are or will be fit for habitation or for any particularuse or that the premises can lawfully be used for any particular purpose. But where a house or flat is let furnished, there is animplied covenant or warranty that it is reasonably fit for human habitation when let, although there is no obligation at common lawto keep furnished or unfurnished premises in that condition or to repair them during the tenancy. However, covenants on the partof the landlord are implied in the cases of houses let at a low rent or for a short term."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In the premises, there cannot be any implied undertaking by the landlord that the premises are to be in the state of repair or decorationas contended or expected by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> But Mr. Tsu goes a little further. He submits that the proposition that there is no implied covenant by the lessor to repair or oncondition of premises is only a general rule and is subject to many exceptions. One of these exceptions is where the landlord (quoting<em>Woodfall's on Landlord and Tenant</em>, 1-1465 on page 618/9) "has expressly agreed to repair ......". Further, (quoting the last sentence in 1-1465 on page 619 of <em>Woodfall's</em>), "[If] a landlord does in fact execute repairs, he may be liable for injury caused by the negligence of himself or his servantsin carrying out the works".</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The two "exceptions" are not real exceptions. If as Mr. Tsu says the landlord has expressly agreed to repair, obviously the landlordshould be held to perform the express undertaking, there would be no case for implied covenant. But, as I have held, the Defendantas the lessor did not expressly agree. As to the case of a landlord being liable "for injury caused by the negligence of himselfor his servant", the basis of claim or the cause of action against the landlord or his servant would be one of tort. However, presentlythe Plaintiff is suing on contract, not on negligence or tort.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> I have not gone into the cause of the alleged poor finish of painting arranged by the Defendant. It may be that indeed the Defendant'sworker simply peeled off the wall paper and painted the walls and the ceiling without re-plastering. However, it was the Plaintiff'swish that the wallpaper be removed. This was done. It was the Plaintiff's wish to have the premises re-painted. Since the Defendant,as I have held, was not contractually bound to do the re-painting, the Defendant could have left the walls and ceiling bare withthe old plaster and it should be at the Plaintiff's expense to do the re-plastering. The fact that the Defendant did have the premisesre-painted does not mean that the Defendant voluntarily undertook also to do the re-plastering at its extra expense. It is reasonablefor the Defendant as landlord to have the premises re-painted as soon as the wallpaper had been peeled off to protect the premises(or more specifically the old plaster) from the elements. There was nothing to stop the Plaintiff from re-plastering and re-paintingto her heart's content as she should have done at her own expense. This, I believe, also answers the point about the "as is" stateof the premises which Mr. Tsu argued the Defendant ought to have preserved if there was no express undertaking by the Defendant tore-paint.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Accordingly, the Plaintiff's claim fails on all grounds.
