In February 2007, the Firm appliedfor summary judgment on its counterclaim for professional fees and disbursements for work done for the Plaintiff. On 12<sup>th</sup> March 2007, the Plaintiff applied to strike out the Firmâs bill of costs and to dismiss the counterclaim. Such applications wouldhave been heard in October 2007. Irrespective of the outcome of these applications which related to the counterclaim, the Plaintiffâsclaims against Mr Cheng and the Firm in the HC Action are still pending adjudication.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>II. Amendment application</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The application to amend the Summons was returnable before me on first day of hearing (â<u>First Hearing</u>â). The Plaintiff opposed the application on the basis that (a) the Defendant should have ensured the Summons was full/completewhen it was first issued, (b) the need for two summonses went to show the Defendant committed a great mistake, and (c) the amendmentwas a tactical move by the Defendant after sight of the Plaintiffâs affirmations in opposition.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  At the First Hearing, I granted leave to the Defendant to amend the Summons, and awarded costs of and occasioned by the applicationin favour of the Plaintiff against the Defendant to be taxed if not agreed. To assist the taxing master, I apportioned 15 minutesof hearing time for such application. I informed the parties I would hand down my reasons for decision which I now do.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Although the application to amend was made at a late stage, whether to grant leave to amend was a balancing exercise and the courtmust exercise its discretion in a fair manner having regard to all the circumstances. Here, the application to add a further alternativeprayer of relief to the Summons did not raise any new dimension since such relief was narrower in scope than the primary relief inthe Summons for striking out the entirety of the DC Statement of Claim.  I saw no irreparable prejudice that would prevent the amendment.The Plaintiff claimed that such further alternative relief as well as other reliefs in the Summons were unmeritorious, but such assertionshould be resolved by argument at the substantive hearing and not by shutting out the proposed amendment. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In respect of costs of the amendment application, there was no reason to depart from the usual principle that he who seeks the indulgenceof the court for leave to amend should bear the costs of the application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>III.

The Plaintiff filed his third affirmation dated 11<sup>th</sup> September 2007 without leave, but without objection from Mr Baillie I granted leave to the Plaintiff to file/serve and rely on histhird affirmation to oppose the Defendantâs Amended Summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(a) Defendantâs affidavit</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Firm and its principal Mr Cheng acted for the Plaintiff in the Actions. Whilst employed by the Firm, the Defendant undertooksome work for the Plaintiff concerning the 7307/03 and 3272/01 Actions in accordance with Mr Chengâs directions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Defendant denied the DC Negligence and Assault Claims. He claimed that although the averments in the DC Statement of Claim werevirtually identical to the Plaintiffâs alleged grievances and claims in the HC Statement of Claim, he was not made a party to theHC Action nor served with any documents/demands by the Plaintiff or the Firm concerning those proceedings. Had he been made a partyto the HC Action, he would have sought a complete indemnity from the Firm on the basis of its vicarious liability for any such claim(s)that the Plaintiff might establish.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(2) Plaintiffâs affirmations</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Plaintiff by his affirmations verified the matters referred to in paragraphs 5(b)-(i) and 6(a)-(b) above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In respect of the Plaintiffâs claim against Mr Cheng and the Firm for breach of the No Payment Agreement, the Plaintiff disclosedthe 10/8/04 Letter to the Defendant which alluded to such mutual agreement between the Plaintiff and Mr Cheng.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In respect of the DC Negligence Claim, the Plaintiff claimed he had on two occasions requested the Defendant to apply for temporarystay of the 7307/03 Action until further instructions or to vacate the hearing dates (see his letters of 1<sup>st</sup> June and 19<sup>th</sup> October 2005 to the Firm for the attention of the Defendant), but the Defendant failed to do so and caused substantial damage tohis case. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Plaintiff also complained he had on several occasions requested the Defendant to represent him at court hearings for the 7307/03Action, but the Defendant failed to turn up and he had to act on his own. In support, the Plaintiff disclosed a copy of his letterto the Firm dated 19<sup>th</sup> October 2005 for attention of Mr Cheng complaining of the matters referred to in paragraph 5(f)-(g) above. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 27<sup>th</sup> February 2007, the Plaintiff complained to the Law Society against the Defendant in respect of the above matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  For the Assault Claim, the Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant acted in a separate and autonomous capacity, and not as agent forMr Cheng, so he should be personally liable to the Plaintiff, but neither the Firm nor Mr Cheng should be vicariously liable forthe Defendantâs âviolent and unreasonable actâ. In support, the Plaintiff relied on Mr Maâs affirmation dated 18<sup>th</sup> November 2005 in the 7307/2003 Action that verified <i>inter alia</i> the matters referred to in paragraph 5(h) above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Plaintiff in his first and second affirmations said âthe Defendant and Mr Cheng are jointly and severally liable for any losscaused to [him] as a result of their professional misconductâ.In his third affirmation, he said the Defendant and Mr Cheng wereâseverally liable for any loss caused to [him] as a result of their professional misconduct and assault by [the Defendant] â¦â¦â.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In the Plaintiffâs first and second affirmations, he said the HC Action was a professional negligence claim against Mr Cheng forhis incompetent management of â[the Plaintiffâs] caseâ, but the present action was primarily concerned with the Defendantâsintentional assault against him, so the two actions were different in terms of their nature, subject matter, consequence and causeof action. In his third affirmation, the Plaintiff said ââ¦â¦ at the beginning, [the present action] primarily relates to [theDefendantâs] negligence in managing the plaintiffâs case and the intentional assaults against the plaintiffâ, and the Defendantcaused him to suffer damages due to the Defendantâs ânegligence, irresponsibility and misconduct â¦â¦ misleading all the plaintiffâscases, damaging the plaintiff for financial losses and time cost I.E. [the Actions], the plaintiff has suffered irreparable financialdamages, economic loss and special damages, therefore, the plaintiff, claim the defendant should compensate for the loss of his convenience,honour and rights, goodwill and reputation. â¦â¦â</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>IV. Defendantâs case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  For the purpose of the present application only, the Defendant does not (a) take issue over the merits of the Plaintiffâs claimset out in the DC Statement of Claim, (b) assert the DC Statement of Claim lacks material particulars of fundamental allegations,or (c) rely on the ground that the DC Statement of Claim fails to disclose any reasonable cause of action. But the Defendant reserveshis right to raise these contentions to resist the Plaintiffâs allegations should the court dismiss the Amended Summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Mr Baillie submitted it is well-established procedural law that a plaintiff must bring before the court all related parties anddisputes in one action rather than instituting separate actions in different courts, which amounts to an abuse of process of thecourt. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Defendant claimed that the present action is an abuse of process because the Plaintiff earlier instituted the HC Action againstthe Firm (ie the Defendantâs then employer) and Mr Cheng (ie the Firmâs principal) alleging a negligence claim (â<u>HC Negligence Claim</u>â) with the same or âvirtually identicalâ (albeit in more detail) cause of action and material facts as that set out in theDC Statement of Claim but without joining the Defendant as a defendant. Although the HC Statement of Claim allegedly concerned onlyMr Cheng and the Firm, and the Plaintiff alleged the DC Statement of Claim âprimarily relates toâ the Assault Claim, both theHC Action and the present action include negligence âclaimsâ against the Defendant. Further, the HC Statement of Claim also containsaverments in relation to the Assault Claim, which must be part of the <i>res gestae</i> which the Plaintiff apparently relies for the HC Negligence Claim even though the Defendant is not a defendant to the HC Action.By bringing and maintaining the HC Action and the present action for the same or âvirtually identicalâ claims, the Plaintiffmisuses the court process, and the present action being the subsequent action is liable to be struck out as vexatious and an abuseof process of the court. Alternatively, if the Assault Claim in the DC Statement of Claim is to be preserved, so much of such pleadingthat concerns the DC Negligence Claim should be struck out on the ground of abuse of process.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr Baillie further argued that the Defendant is an obviously vexatious litigant. As at 16<sup>th</sup> January 2007, he has issued 29 High Court and District Court actions and has been a defendant in 6 court actions. He has sued variousjudges, solicitor firm, civil servants, government departments, and government counsel. It was argued that this demonstrates thatthe present action is vexatious and oppressive, and an abuse of process of the court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>V.

The emerging rationale from the abovecases is that courts should proceed with the power to strike out claims for abuse of process on the ground of re-litigation (andthus debar a party from putting forward his case in another action) with great caution. However, it is necessary for the maintenanceof fair and effective administration of justicethat the judicial process does not suffer from re-litigation that erodes the publicinterests of (a) bringing finality to litigation and (b) preventing hardship on parties from being vexed again over the same issuesor issues that could and should have been finally determined in earlier proceedings (see <i>Barrow v Bankside Members Agency Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20All%20ER%20981" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 All ER 981</a>, 983 and <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (a firm)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20WLR%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 WLR 72</a>, 90 and 118).

The defendantignored the plaintiffâs notice of readiness. The plaintiff sued the defendant for the price of the tugboats with an alternativeclaim for damages for non-acceptance. The alternative claim was struck out on the ground that it was time-barred. The plaintiff proceededwith the rest of the claim, which was set down for an early hearing. The plaintiff served a fresh writ on the defendant claimingdamages for breach of contract computed by reference to the terms of the agreement. The defendant contended that the plaintiff wasestopped by the earlier order from relying on the time-barred cause of action âand, on wider principles, from making a claim fordamages which could have been advanced in the earlier actionâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The Court of Appeal held there was no issue estoppel or cause of action estoppel arising from the earlier order which merely determinedthat a claim for non-acceptance was deemed statute-barred. Even after the time-barred particulars were stuck out, the wording ofthe plaintiffâs first writ still included the words âthe plaintiffs claim against the defendants for â damages for failureto take delivery â the plaintiffs further claim against the defendants for damages for breach of contractâ, so the plaintiffcould have amended its pleadings to include the damages for breach of agreement sought in the second action. Instead, the plaintifffiled a re-amended statement of claim that no longer included any reference to the tugboats or damages for breach of agreement inneglecting to take delivery, which suggested that the plaintiff had abandoned any cause of action for breach of agreement. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  But by the second action the plaintiff once more purported to claim damages for breach of agreement.

In light of the Court of Appeal decision in <i>Collin Navigation Co SA</i> which considered the principle in <i>Buckland</i> as analogous to the rule in <i>Henderson</i>, <i>Greenhalgh</i> and <i>Yat Tung</i>, I see no reason not to, but will bear in mind that here different defendants are involved in two ongoing actions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  With the above principles in mind, I now turn to the circumstances of the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(f) Assault Claim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  I have no hesitation in concluding that the Assault Claim, being an intentional tort, constitutes a cause of action separate anddistinct from the HC Negligence Claim. To use the words of Diplock LJ in <i>Letang v Cooper</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%201%20QB%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 1 QB 232</a>, 242-243 and Millett LJ in <i>Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar &amp; Co (a firm)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20All%20ER%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 All ER 400</a>, 405 (see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2008</i> Vol.1 para.15/1/2 at p.221), I cannot see how the facts pertaining to the assault/battery allegedly inflicted by the Defendant onthe Plaintiff on 19<sup>th</sup> October 2005 are material to be proved to entitle the Plaintiff to succeed in obtaining a legal remedy against Mr Cheng and the Firmin respect of the HC Negligence Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The Plaintiff in his submissions made clear the Assault Claim is not directed at Mr Cheng and/or the Firm at all. He accepted itis hard to make out a case that the alleged assault/battery was within the Defendantâs scope of employment or done upon their instructions.As Mr Baillie aptly put it, the Plaintiffâs pleadings presented such alleged assault/battery as the Defendantâs âfrolic ofhis ownâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Mr Baillie placed emphasis on averments of the <i>same or virtually identical</i> facts relating to the alleged assault/battery in both the DC and HC Statements of Claim. But notwithstanding the similar factualbackground pleaded in both actions, the court in adjudicating the HC Negligence Claim and deciding whether there has been breachof retainer or of the No Payment Agreement in the HC Action need not come to any specific finding of fact in relation to the allegedassault/ battery. In short, the alleged assault/battery does not in the words of Deputy High Court Judge Muttrie at para.35 in <i>Ngai Few Fung</i> go to the root of the matter to be decided in the HC Action. In any event, mere re-litigation or the mere fact that the Plaintiffcould have joined the Defendant in the HC Action to maintain the Assault Claim against him in those proceedings is not enough.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  In my view, the Defendant has failed to discharge the onus in showing that the Assault Claim against the Defendant should have beenbrought in the HC Action and that litigating such claim in the present action is an abuse of process. There is also no unjust harassmentor oppression against the Defendant as a result of being vexed twice in respect of the Assault Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(g) DC Negligence Claim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mr Baillie submitted that the HC and DC Negligence Claims constitute the <i>same</i> <i>or virtually identical</i> cause of action based on the <i>same or virtually identical</i> material facts averred in both the HC and DC Statements of Claim. Although the Plaintiff has fallen short of making the Defendanta defendant in the HC Action (which Mr Baillie submitted is immaterial), the Plaintiff has made express negligence allegations againstthe Defendant in the HC Action, which allegations Mr Baillie submitted will be resolved in the HC Action. It was suggested that byreproducing such allegations in a later action in another court (ie the present action), the Plaintiff misuses procedure, duplicatecosts and prolongs the time for final resolution of the subject disputes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The first question is whether the HC and DC Negligence Claims amount to the same cause of action. Bearing in mind the modern definitionof âcause of actionâ referred to in paragraph 63 above, it is plain that a given set of facts does not necessarily give riseto a single cause of action, eg a tort claim is far different from a contractual claim arising from the same factual matrix sincethey involve different elements, defences, factual/evidential emphasis, legal concepts and remedies. Even for a tort claim, the centralissue is whether all damage complained of is due to the same breach of duty. In this respect, the identity of the defendant is sometimesessential because the existence/ scope of the duty of care and the standard of care owed to a claimant by different parties may vary.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  There is no dispute that Mr Cheng and the Firm owed the Plaintiff duty of care in contract and in tort. The contractual duty arisesfrom the retainer and, according to the Plaintiff, from the No Payment Agreement. The Defendant is not a party to the retainer orto the No Payment Agreement, so he will not be liable in contract. But if he was negligent, Mr Cheng and the Firm will be vicariouslyliable in addition to any primary or direct tortious liability they personally owe to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The Plaintiff argued that each solicitor owes his own professional duty to the client (and he referred to various provisions inthe Law Societyâs <i>The Hong Kong Solicitors Guide to Professional Conduct</i> in the course of his submissions), and that the nature and scope of such duty owed by Mr Cheng and the Firm as âbossâ and bythe Defendant as âemployeeâ are necessarily different.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Paraphrasing the Plaintiffâs submissions in legal terms, the Plaintiff contended (and Mr Baillie accepted) that if so proved theDefendant will be liable for ordinary fault-based primary or direct liability caused by his own personal tortious behaviour for whichhe can be sued in his own right. The Plaintiff then argued that Mr Cheng and the Firm on the other hand owe him three distinct formsof tortious liability. First, there is Mr Chengâs direct or primary fault-based liability for his personal tortious conduct inhandling the Actions (see, eg, paragraphs 5(d), (g) and (i), and 7(c)-(d) above). Secondly, there is Mr Chengâs and/or the Firmâsdirect liability for breach of their direct non-delegable duty, eg failure to engage competent professional staff (see, eg, paragraph5(d) above). Thirdly, there is secondary vicarious liability that falls on Mr Cheng and the Firm upon proof of primary tortious liabilityof their employee (ie the Defendant), which turns not on their fault but is predicated on their employment relationship with theprimary tortfeasor. In the circumstances, the Plaintiff is right in saying that in respect of the negligence claims Mr Cheng andthe Firm are severally liable (in respect of their primary or direct liability) as well as jointly and severally liable (in respectof their vicarious liability) with the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Since the Defendant does not for the purpose of this application challenge the merits of the Plaintiffâs claims, the Plaintiffâsanalysis must be correct. On careful consideration, I am not satisfied that the Plaintiffâs causes of action against the Defendantand those against Mr Cheng and the Firm are the same. To use the words of Lord Diplock in <i>Letang</i>, the factual situation that entitles the Plaintiff to seek legal remedy for damages against Mr Cheng and the Firm (in contra-distinctionto that against the Defendant) is not merely the circumstances as to how negligence by the primary tortfeasor occurred, but alsoadded facts such as employment of such primary tortfeasor (for vicarious liability) and their own direct conduct vis-a-vis the Plaintiff(for primary or direct liability). The Defendant has failed to persuade me the Plaintiff does not have a separate cause of actiondirectly enforceable against the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  But I must go on to consider whether the rule in <i>Henderson</i> is applicable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Here, according to Mr Baillie, the HC and DC Negligence Claims substantially overlap. But it is pertinent to note that such negligenceclaims are not co-extensive and, more importantly, are made against different defendants in different actions. Mr Baillie acceptedthat had the Plaintiff applied to bring the DC Negligence Claim in the HC Action by applying to join the Defendant as a further defendanttherein, the Defendant will have no basis for the present complaint against the Plaintiff for issuing separate claims on matterswhich it was argued could and should have been dealt with together. But since the Plaintiff has not done so, Mr Baillie submittedthat the correct approach is to strike out the DC Negligence Claim for abuse of process rather than to purge the aforesaid underlyingcomplaint by exercising case management powers to have all disputes ventilated and resolved in a just, efficient and economic manner.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In <i>Buckland</i> there was a compromise of what appeared to be the claimantâs whole claim in the first action which resulted in a stay of proceedings,and in <i>Collin Navigation Co SA</i> the plaintiff in the first action effectively abandoned the claim for breach of contract sought to be revived in the second action,so in both cases it was more obvious abuse to start the second action against the <i>same</i> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Here, even by approaching the issue on the basis that the DC Negligence Claim against the Defendant could have been brought in theHC Action in the manner suggested by Mr Baillie (there being no issue arising as to the statute of limitations), this does not (a)follow that it should have been so brought or (b) of itself demonstrate the course the Plaintiff took is necessarily an abuse ofprocess. The onus that falls on the Defendant is a burden of some weight, and is made heavier by the fact that there has been noprevious litigation between the parties up to the present action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  I accept that even though the factual matters relating to breach of retainer, breach of the No Payment Agreement and/or breach ofprimary or direct duty of care on the part of Mr Cheng and/or the Firm need not feature in the proof and/or resolution of the DCNegligence Claim against the Defendant, and the âtargetsâ of the two actions are different, the history amongst the relevantparties as pleaded in the HC and DC Statements of Claim that underlies the negligence claims shows substantial overlap between theessential facts required to be proved for the Defendantâs primary or direct liability in the present action and for vicarious liabilityon the part of Mr Cheng and the Firm in the HC Action. It is fair to say that the DC Negligence Claim is not wholly distinct fromthe HC Negligence Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  But unlike other cases where the re-litigation has been held to be an abuse of process, the present action is not an attempt torake over the ashes for a rerun of the HC Action in the guise of a new action. Here, as Mr Baillie accepted, the Plaintiff can suethe Defendant for negligence in his own right notwithstanding any vicarious liability on the part of Mr Cheng and the Firm. For thepurpose of this application, there is no challenge as to the merits of the Plaintiffâs claim herein or whether it constitutes areasonable cause of action. On such basis and on the further basis that the two actions (and hence both the HC and DC NegligenceClaims) against different defendants are ongoing, it is in my view axiomatic that the DC Negligence Claim against the Defendant shouldbe resolved one way or another.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Mr Baillie argued there is no good reason why the Plaintiff did not apply to add the Defendant as a further defendant in the HCAction. Although I reject the Plaintiffâs explanation that he could not locate the Defendant when he commenced the HC Action (sincethe Defendant remained with the Firm until 15<sup>th</sup> April 2006), I take into account the Plaintiffâs explanation that he made a judgment to limit his claim for damages against theDefendant (who was then an employed solicitor and not a principal/partner) within the District Court jurisdiction. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  In the present case, there is no question of manifest unfairness or unjust harassment for the Defendant is not vexed twice eventhough he may in future be a witness in the HC Action. However, his doing so will not be due to the Plaintiffâs compulsion butout of his own volition. Whatever common factual matrix is pleaded in both actions, it is in the present action that the Defendantis for the first time sought to be made liable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Mr Baillie raised the spectre of inconsistent decision should the HC Action and the present action proceed separately and inexorablyto trial. Whilst this is a factor which I should bear in mind when considering whether there is abuse, I do not see why (when theDC Negligence Claim against the Defendant should be resolved one way or another â see paragraph 78 above) this cannot be dealtwith by the courtâs case management powers and powers as to costs sanctions if there is no abuse.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Mr Baillie submitted that had the Plaintiff sued the Defendant in the HC Action, the Defendant would have been able to seek an indemnityagainst the Firm by way of third party proceedings. But as he acknowledged in his written submissions, even if the present actionremains, there is no bar to the Defendant seeking such third party relief, which turns on the employment relationship and/or contractualindemnity (if any) between the Defendant and the Firm. If such course is adopted, there is a risk of the Firm being a party in twoactions, but it cannot be said that the Plaintiffâs own conduct in commencing the present action (which is not predicated on theDefendantâs reaction to the claim) was to manipulate such outcome so as to amount to an abuse of process. As explained above, thecourts have wide case management powers that prevent multiplicity of proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Having considered all the circumstances, I am not persuaded the DC Negligence Claim was instituted without sufficient foundationwith a view to harass the Defendant or wear him down, or that such claim should have been brought in the HC Action in the <i>Yat Tung</i> sense such that the way in which the Plaintiff now wishes to litigate constitutes an abuse of process of the court. There is no manifestinjustice for the Defendant to defend the claim. Any need for efficient, economic and effective disposal of the ongoing proceedingscan be dealt with through proper case management.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(h) Special circumstances</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  But even if I am wrong and the DC Negligence Claim could and should have been litigated in the HC Action, there is in my view aspecial circumstance that requires the non-application of the rule in <i>Henderson</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Striking out pleadings or dismissing claims for abuse of process is made only in exceptional circumstances to ensure that justiceis done. In the particular circumstances of the present case, I do not consider it fair and just to grant such relief.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  I have reached the conclusion above that the Assault Claim should not be struck out for abuse of process. Mr Baillie submitted thatin such circumstances the material facts in relation to the Assault Claim should be limited to paragraphs 1-4 and 13-16 of the DCStatement of Claim (see paragraphs 5(a)-(c), 6(h) and 7(b) above) and paragraphs 5-12 and 17-18 that relate to the DC NegligenceClaim should be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  The Defendant denies the Assault Claim. No doubt credibility of witnesses will play a significant part in the adjudication of suchclaim. In assessing witnessesâ credibility, the court should consider the totality of their evidence against the relevant factualmatrix, which should not be confined to events just immediately before the alleged assault/battery as suggested in the above paragraph.From the DC Statement of Claim, it is evident that the alleged deteriorating professional relationship between the parties and thealleged uncooperative or irresponsible attitude of the Defendant in the course of handling the Plaintiffâs various pieces of litigationas well as the events on 18<sup>th</sup> October 2005 were all part of the underlying factual background that together with the more immediate triggering events culminatein the alleged assault/battery. To debar consideration of the whole relevant factual matrix by striking out the aforesaid paragraphsin the DC Statement of Claim is to cripple the trial judgeâs assessment of all relevant evidence for the Assault Claim. In my view,this amounts to a special circumstance that requires non-application of the rule in <i>Henderson</i>. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Mr Baillie would have this court strike out the Assault Claim for abuse of process because a determination of the above matterswill overlap with the HC Action. But such argument is tantamount to suggesting that mere re-litigation justifies striking out pleadingsor claims even if they do not amount to abuse of process. That cannot be right. As discussed below, concerns as to multiplicity ofproceedings in relation to legitimate ongoing proceedings can be met by proper case management. If costs have been incurred whichcould/should have been avoided, the trial judge will be able to consider what appropriate costs order is properly required by thecircumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  It follows, in my judgment, that the proper adjudication of the claims in the present action should be open for determination attrial or other appropriate procedure notwithstanding that the same or similar facts may have been raised in the HC Statement of Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Equally, it will be unjust to stay the DC Negligence and Assault Claims pending disposal of the HC Action. Since both actions areongoing and there is no dispute that the Defendant can be sued in negligence in his own right, there is no justification to staythe present action. Further, to stay the proceedings until a final conclusion to the HC Action will put the Plaintiff at risk ofbeing challenged again on the ground of <i>res judicata</i> in the wider sense which Mr Baillie strongly pressed at the hearing. That would be unjust.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(i) Vexatious litigant</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  Mr Baillie submitted that the numerous actions commenced by the Plaintiff against various judges, legal practitioners, governmentdepartments and civil servants speak of abuse, which demonstrates that the present action is vexatious and oppressive, and thereforean abuse of process.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  I have no quarrel with Mr Baillieâs submission that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to dismiss actions which are vexatiousand oppressive. But since there is no challenge as to the merits of the Plaintiffâs claims herein for the purpose of this application,I am unable to say that the present action is inherently vexatious and oppressive.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  I do not think <i>Ng Yat Chi v Max Share Ltd &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282005%29%208%20HKCFAR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2005) 8 HKCFAR 1</a> lends any support to Mr Baillieâs proposition. In that case, the Court of Final Appeal affirmed the constitutional right of accessto the courts under common law and as guaranteed under the Basic Law, and held that it is the pursuit of <i>abusive proceedings</i> that (a) amount to an improper exercise of such right of access and (b) may be regarded as adversely affecting the right of accessof others with meritorious cases that should <i>inter alia</i> be restrained by <i>Grepe v Loam</i> and/or extended <i>Grepe v Loan</i> orders, now enshrined in Practice Direction 11.3. In my view, unless in most exceptional cases, courts will not erode the constitutionalright of access to justice by barring a litigant from instituting legal proceedings altogether.  Indeed, the Chief Justice said atp.15 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">The focus of an extended order is on a <i>defined class of proceedings</i> which is prohibited without leave. <i>The class should be defined with clarity.</i> â¦â¦ That being its focus, an extended order is capable of protecting persons who are not parties to the original proceedings inwhich the extended order was made. If after the order was made, fresh proceedings are instituted against such persons, they wouldbe protected by the extended order <i>if the proceedings fall</i> <i>within the defined class</i>.â (my emphasis) </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Mr Baillie confessed he had no idea about the subject matters of the multiple legal actions commenced by the Plaintiff (other thanthe HC Action) or whether they dealt with the same subject matter as the HC Action or present action such that they fall within adefined class. In such circumstances, I do not see how these legal actions are indicative of the Plaintiffâs oppression and abusein commencing the present action. I bear in mind that the Defendant does not put the merits of the claim in issue for the purposeof this application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>VII. Case management</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  In the circumstances, I dismiss the Plaintiffâs application to strike out the DC Statement of Claim or the DC Negligence Claimtherein, or to dismiss/stay the present action.  That said, I am of the view that the present case calls for proactive case managementon the part of the court. In my view, procedurally speaking, the present case will clearly benefit from a transfer to the Court ofFirst Instance for the opportunity, if so ordered by the Court of First Instance, to have all disputes ventilated in one set of proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Mr Baillie cited <i>Tai Chao Cheng v Cheung Chun</i> HCA770/2003, Deputy High Court Judge Jat SC (unreported, 7<sup>th</sup> May 2004) to remind me that I have no power to order, upon transfer, consolidation of the present action with the HC Action. He submittedthat in such circumstances any transfer of proceedings is of no assistance. However, I note that notwithstanding such lack of powerto order consolidation, the learned judge in <i>Tai Chao Cheng</i> felt so strongly that all the partiesâ disputes should be resolved in one action instead of in two actions in the High Court andDistrict Court respectively that he exercised his case management powers to transfer the action before him to the District Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  This court plainly has power to regulate its own procedure and to transfer the present action on its own motion to the Court ofFirst Instance. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 42</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap.336</a> provides as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">The Court may, either of its own motion or on the application of any party, order the transfer to the Court of First Instance of allor part of any action or proceeding within the jurisdiction of the Court.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Although I am unable to make an order for consolidation of the present action, once transferred, with the HC Action, the partiescan apply to do so or the High Court has power on own motion to do so. I am also comforted by the direction of the statutory guidanceto the exercise of discretion by the Court of First Instance in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap.4</a> which provides as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦ the Court of First Instance â¦â¦shall so exercise its jurisdiction in every cause or matter before it as to secure that,as far as possible, all matters in dispute between the parties are completely and finally determined, and all multiplicity of legalproceedings with respect to any of those matters is avoided.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap.4</a> is similar to section 49(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1981. <i>Civil Procedure 2007</i> Vol.2 at para.9A-160 at pp.2393-2394 states <i>inter alia</i> that :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">The principles (1) that all matters in dispute should be completely and finally determined, and (2) that multiplicity of legal proceedingsshould be avoided are deeply embedded in the law and s.49(2) is but one manifestion of them. In most instances, finality and avoidanceof multiplicity will be compatible goals. â¦â¦  Other aspects of practice and procedure in which the principles states in s.49(2)may be seen at work include: <i>the transfer of proceedings from one court to another, the consolidation of proceedings, the trial of two or more claims on the sameoccasion, the addition and substitution of parties, the joinder of claims, and counterclaims and other additional claims</i> â¦â¦â (my emphasis)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  I note the Plaintiff is also opposed to transfer of the present action to the High Court on the ground that separate actions arerequired for Mr Cheng and the Firm on one hand and the Defendant on the other because they owe him separate duties of care. But suchcontention does not necessarily oust proper case management, or prevent consolidation or other appropriate procedure for just andeconomic disposal of all claims. Indeed, Order 4 rule 9 of the Rules of the High Court provides that the court may order two causesor matters which are pending to be <i>inter alia</i> consolidated or tried at the same time if it appears that some common question of law or fact arises in both of them or for someother reason it is desirable to make an order under the rule.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  I have carefully noted the objection by both parties. But I am convinced that in this case the court should act boldly to exerciseproactive case management to ensure procedural justice, economy and efficiency. I endorse the sentiment expressed by Deputy HighCourt Judge Jat SC that the parties should do whatever may be necessary to bring about the early resolution of this litigation toits proper conclusion. If not, it will left to the court to adopt appropriate procedure on own motion to bring about a just and efficientresolution.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>VIII. Conclusion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  In the circumstances, I dismiss the paragraphs 1-3 of the Amended Summons and grant leave to the Defendant to file and serve hisDefence within 14 days from the date hereof. I further direct that the present action be transferred to the Court of First Instance,and that this decision be brought to the attention of the Registrar of the High Court so that the Court of First Instance can beseized of the matter and, where appropriate, exercise its own unfettered case management powers on application by the parties oron own motion. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the Defendant do pay the Plaintiff costs of the Amended Summons on District Court scale to be taxed if not agreed in any event,and that the costs to date of the present action in the District Court be reserved to the Court of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  By my order dated 5<sup>th</sup> June 2007, I reserved the issue of costs of the application to vacate the hearing on 5<sup>th</sup> June 2007. I heard arguments on such costs issue at the Second Hearing. The hearing on 5<sup>th</sup> June 2007 was adjourned because the Plaintiff was medically indisposed. Although the Plaintiff claimed he should be entitled to costsbecause he has sent a draft consent summons for adjournment to the Defendantâs solicitors, I cannot ignore the fact that the Defendantwas not in any way to be blamed for the adjournment and was entitled to consider/test the Plaintiffâs grounds for the adjournment.In the circumstances, I consider a fair order on costs would be for each party to bear his own costs in respect of such adjournment,and I so order.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Marlene Ng)<br />            District Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left">Representation:</p>        <p style="text-align:left">The Plaintiff in person and present.</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Brian G Baillie of Messrs Fred Kan &amp; Co for the Defendant.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2008/29.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
