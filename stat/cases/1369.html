I permitted thepresent plaintiff to be substituted when the application was damaged. It transpired in evidence that the plaintiff is a wholly ownedsubsidary of Tai Sang Land Development Ltd.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Contractual relations between the parties commenced when a tenancy agreement was entered into dated the 19th of September 1978, thisfor a term of 2 years. The agreement was in standard form as used by the plaintiff and Clauses 7 and 17 provide as follows:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="3%" class="quote">7:</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="2%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">The tenant shall not use the said messuage for any other purpose from that of a dwelling house ..."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="5%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="3%" class="quote">17:</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="2%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">The premises is only permitted to be occupied as dwelling purpose only but not as school, institute ..."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It was the plaintiff's case, that despite the terms of the tenancy agreement, the user of the premises was commercial and that theprovisions of Part II of the Ordinance did not apply. The defendant's case was that the premises had been used as a dwelling in accordancewith the agreement and that it enjoyed the protection of Part II of the Landlord &amp; Tenant. (Consolidation) Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap. 7</a>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> A notice to quit was issued pursuant to Section 122 of the Ordinance (P11), this was dated the 11th of March, and I hold that thiswas properly served. However, the contents of the notice are of some importance. The notice is addressed to Wing Tai Hong at thesuit premises and reads as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We are instructed by Tai Sang Land Development Ltd., your landlord to give you notice in pursuant to Section 122 of the Landlord&amp; Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap. 7</a>, which we hereby do that you are required to quit and deliver up vacant possessionof the above-mentioned premises which you are now occupying as a monthly tenant for business purposes on the 19th day of September1980.</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="70%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="30%" class="quote">Yours faithfully,</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="70%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="30%" class="quote">YUng, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> It is of considerable importance that the holding company who is not actually the landlord had instructed the solicitors to issuethe notice to quit and that they referred in the notice in the clearest and most unequival of terms as the holding company being"your landlord". I shall return to this later.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiff's evidence</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Benedict KOO Kin-man, Manager of Tai Sang Land Development Co. Ltd. was the 1st witness called on behalf of the plaintiff. He explainedthe management relationship between these two companies, the plaintiff being a "100% subsidiary of Tai Sang". He stated that thewhole block was commercial premises and that the occupation permit was issued for the premises to be used as commercial premises(P1). He believed the business of the defendant to be "a tea leaf shop". He produced the tenancy agreement, between the managementcompany and the defendant as exhibit P3. His evidence was that the agreement was a standard form and that when premises were beingused for commercial purposes the word "domestic" would be deleted and the appropriate user substituted. The agreement was typed bya female employee and there were some 50 to 60 tenants in the building, all commercial users. He claimed that all the agreementsin the file produced by him had been changed except the present agreement P3 where there was a mistake in leaving the user as domestic.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The witness produced exhibits P4(a) and (b) to establish that the rateable value of the premises was $14,880 thus bringing the actionin respect of recovery of the premises within the jurisdiction of the District Court. Mr. Koo went on to explain that no rent hadbeen received or accepted since the agreement expired, and he also asserted that the current rental value for the suit premises is$5-7 per sq. ft. This in contrast with the original agreement providing for rent at $1 per sq. ft. In cross-examination, the witnessagreed that his company let out premises in other buildings for domestic purposes. The witness also referred to receiving complaintsas to delays in lift movements due to the transportation of tea leaves within the building. He disagreed when it was put to him thatit was originally intended that the suit premises were to be used for domestic purposes.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> During the lunch adjournment Mr. Young had an opportunity to inspect the bundle of tenancy agreements relating to the building afterwhich he agreed that some agreements were amended so as to delete Clauses 7 and 17 but were not initialled. Others were initialledby both parties. Still others by only one party. Further in some agreements only one or other of the clauses were deleted and wordsdenoting a commercial user substituted, or the words were deleted and nothing substituted.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> This assessment by Mr. Young was accepted by Mr. Chain subject to re-examination. The witness was cross-examined about usage of roomson the 4th and 5th floors and replied stating that as far as he could remember, they were used as a godown.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The 2nd witness Yam Cho Yam was caretaker of the Building. He stated that there were no bathroom in the whole of the building andthat the main gate was locked from midnight to 6 a.m. that goods was going up and down lifts and that a Mr. Lau lived there. He saidhe had instructions from his company that no one was to live in the building. The witness when asked as to what was the meaning attributedby him to "live". He replied "living there at night working on the following day".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The 3rd witness for the plaintiff was Tse King Tim, a rent collector employed by Tai Sang Land Development Ltd. He stated that WingTai Hang was "residing" at Flat C and D on the 11/F. and that the last occasion he went to the premises to collect rent was in Septemberof last year. That there was a wooden partition in the premises in December and there were goods namely tea leave stored and deskspresent in the premises. Prior to December 1980 there was no partition in the premises. The witness produced some photographs takenby him on the 17th day of July, the first day of hearing. (P10(a)-(c)) He acknowledged that there were some clothing shown hangingin front of the partition. He stated that he did not go behind the partition. He claimed that when collecting rent he never seenpersonal belongings or occupants inside the suit premises. He maintained that there were goods, desks, sofa and telephone.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The 5th witness called on behalf of the plaintiff was Hui Kwok Wai who was employed in a dual capacity by Tai Sang Land DevelopmentLtd. as a Clerk and rent collector commencing his duties in January 1980. He claimed that the occupant of Flat C and D on 11th floorwas "Wing Tai Hang" and that nobody "lives there". He explained that the premises were adjoining units and in the partition therewas an opening. He said that he went to collect rent at Flat C because "goods were stored in Flat D". He observed inside the premises,desks, a sofa, a weighing machine and a large quantity of goods, and asserted there was no partitioning before September of 1980.He said that on occasion he was present while tea leaves were being weighed. He claimed that the partition was put up at the endof September or October. He stated that the 18th floor was being used for business and then a group of persons came and used it asa home. They were refugees and they had left after the company discovered the domestic user.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> With regard to the 4th and 5th floors of the same building, he stated that this "could be a godown of Wah Kwok Restaurant" who occupiesthe ground floor. During cross-examination he agreed that he always went with Mr. Chui to collect rent and he also said in cross-examinationthat almost 70% of the floor area of the suit premises was occupied by boxes but that this varied. He maintained that there werealways boxes there. He denied seeing personal belongings lying around the suit premises nor any kitchen utensils. He also claimednot to have soon any clothes hanging in the premises.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The evidence for the defendant</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> LAU Yin-chow - the proprietor of Wing Tai Hang gave evidence. He said that he moved in January 1979 and that he resides there withhis wife and two sons. He claimed the agreement recorded the intention of both parties, that his wife did not work that both sonswork, and that he had placed a <u>small quantity</u> of goods inside the suit premises because he wanted to run a business. He also claimed that in the building, there are a number ofother units used for dwelling purposes. Flat D on the 11th floor, Flat C on the 16th floor, Flats C and D on the 19th floor and thewhole floor on each of the 4th and 18th floors. That there was a White Russian on the 18th floor but he qualified this by statinghe was not sure. He drew a plan of the premises and exhibited this, and went on to say that when rent collectors called there werecooking utensils and clothing displayed in the premises. He went on to say that the boxes of material and preserved foods were placedin the premises, because he had no where else to place them. Sometimes they could be put there for 3 months. During cross-examinationhe claimed that prior to living in these premises, he was in public housing and that this was not big enough, so he rented the suitpremises in order to live there. That he gone to sea prior to January of 1979, and at this time he returned to Hong Kong every 10odd days. Also at the time when the partnership of Wing Tai Hang was formed the idea was that the partners were to use the premisesas a dormitory for fokis and for any partners who wanted to live there. Business had not commenced, so only his nephew and Leung,a foki lived there. He claimed that the partnership had no other premises. The partnership was dissolved in less than 2 months, thisbefore any other place could be found from which to run the business. When he paid out his other three partners, the business waschanged into a sole proprietorship. He asserted that he has no business interest at the present time, and that he is living of hischildren. He claimed that a foki moved in during October of last year and the partition was erected before the foki moved in andthat it had not been necessary to erect it before. He went on to describe how he and his family all used a communal toilet drawingthe distinction between gentlemen's and ladies toilets. He stated that when he had a bath there was a lock and privary could be obtained.He went on to explain that if anyone visited after the main door was locked at nights, he had a key to the gate and on occasion hisfriends telephoned for him to come down. He claimed that he greeted residents going "up and down" and afterwards made enquiry bygoing to upstairs to their premises and confirming their status.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> I closely observed the demanour of the defendant, and I was unimpressed by him. I believe that some persons may be telling the truthdespite and inability to face the persons they are talking to. Even giving him this benefit, I was unable to accept his evidence.I accept Mr. Koo when he stated that the intention was to let the premises for commercial use and that failure to amend the agreementwas a mistake and I specifically reject the defendant's evidence, when he asserted that the letting of the premises for domesticpurposes was the original intention.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> However, the matter does not rest there. The original agreement expired on the 19th of September 1980; the defendant has remainedin occupation and the provisions of Section 51(2) apply. It is worth setting out this provision.</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">Section 51(2):-</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          Notwithstanding the purpose for which premises were let, in determining the nature of a tenancy for the purposes of thisPart, the following provisions shall apply:-</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">in any agreement in writing between a landlord and tenant, or between a principal tenant and sub-tenant, a term that the premisesshall be used for a specified purpose shall be prima facie evidence that the premises are being used for such purpose;</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">notwithstanding any evidence as to whether premises were originally let as a dwelling or not let as a dwelling, premises which arebeing used for another purpose shall be deemed to have been let for such other purpose.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">          Provided that where such primary user is user as a dwelling and in breach of any term in the agreement with the landlordor principal tenant, as the case may be, then the tenant or sub-tenant shall be required to establish that such user has been agreedto by the landlord or principal tenant, expressly or by implication, or acquiesced in by him;</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">subject to paragraph (d), where there exists insufficient evidence as to whether premises were let as a dwelling or not let as a dwelling,the nature of the tenancy or subtenancy shall be determined by the primary user of the premises;</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(d)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">where there is evidence that premises were let otherwise than as a dwelling, or that they were being used otherwise than as a dwellingat the commencement of a sub-tenancy created out of the original tenancy, any premises the subject of such sub-tenancy shall themselvesbe deemed to be used otherwise than as a dwelling until the sub-tenant satisfies the court to the contrary;</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(e)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">the use of premises as a boarding or lodging house is a use other than as a dwelling."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> From the terms of the agreement, there is prima facie evidence pursuant to Section 51(2)(a) that the premises were being used fordomestic purposes.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Section 51(2)(b) can apply if I find as a fact that the premises are now being used primarily for commercial purposes.

There is no doubt that an agent who is trusted with the management of an estateand who has authority to let and receive rents has general authority in respect of the tenancy and can give notice to quit. The powerof attorney here constitutes clear authority and it is of interest that the attorney entered into the agreement with the defendantacting for "the landlord". I am presented with the position, as is not uncommon in Hong Kong that the landlord's identity is undisclosedin the actual tenancy agreement. Accordingly the defendant commenced his contractual relations with the attorney and agent of thelandlord and these relations can be taken to have continued as between the attorney and the defendant at least up until the firstday of the trial when the registered landlord was substituted as plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The notice to quit, is on the face of it incorrect. The agent purports to be the landlord when in fact and in law he is not.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> A decision of considerable interest and importance is <u>Harmond Properties Ltd. v.

The facts of that case are of interest in that a Mr. Harvey, Director of the plaintiff's companyhad instructed solicitors who wrote "on behalf of your landlord Mr. R.P. Harvey, we hereby give you notice to quit". In the originalhearing evidence established that Mr. Harvey had carried out the letting and acted as if he was the landlord in every way. The CountyCourt Judge decided that Mr. Harvey was a general agent and could therefore give a valid notice to quit and as stated by RussellL.J. on appeal "..... I add it is quite plain Mr. Harvey had acted as if he were landlord in every way. The defendant always thoughtof him as the landlord ....." His Lordship went on to hold "I think it would be wrong to introduce in a case such as this so technicalan approach to the notice to quit in the present form which is in no way misleading and (which is the crucial point in the case).I have no doubt at all that the moment it was given it bound the true landlords Harmond Properties Ltd."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The views of Russell L.J. were concurred with by Fenton Atkinson L.J. and Willmer L.J. The later stated "on the main question asto the validity of the notice to quit I entirely agree with what Russell L.J. has said but I think it is desirable to emphasis asthe facts of this case are rather peculiar, and the decision is based on the particular facts of this case".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I am fully conscious of the facts in the decision referred to above and that the decision was based on the particular facts of thatcase.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In the instance case, it appears to me that the important facts are:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="4%">(i)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">the agent was acting under a power of attorney;</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="4%">(ii)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">the agent's relationship as agent was disclosed in the original tenancy agreement.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I entirely ignore the relationship between the landlord and the agent, i.e. the landlord being a wholly owned subsidiary as it isclear law that separate companies constitute separate entities.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I am of the view that the notice to quit at the moment, it was given bound the true landlord, namely Dah Luen Investment CompanyLtd. and accordingly following Russell L.J.'s views, I am of the opinion on the facts of this case that it would be wrong to introducein this case a technical approach to the notice to quit in the form as issued.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> On the views, I have formed the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the premises in question.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> As to ancilliary relief, there is one matter to which I drew the attention of counsel and that is the mesne profits at the rate assessedby Mr. Koo in evidence could be if the evidence was accepted between $5,710 per month and $7,994 per month, as from the 20th of Septemberlast. This should amount to a sum considerably in excess of $20,000 if the evidence of the plaintiff is to be accepted.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> In view of my finding that the user of the premises was commercial and that the notice to quit was properly issued the claim wasproperly presented in the prayer to the writ as unliquidated. The mesne profits, of course, are the rent and profits which the defendantas trespasser should have made during his occupation of the premises and which therefore, he has to pay to the true owner as compensationfor the tort which he has committed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The question of the date from which mesne profits run is of interest and it was held in <u>Elliott v. Boynton</u>, 1924 1 CH. page 236 that when an action is brought by landlord against the tenant for breach of covenant pursuing a claim for re-entryand an order for possession was made that mesne profits are assessable from the date of the writ in the action and not from the dateof the breach of covenant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Although Elliott's case is not on all fours, nevertheless, I take the view that the proper date is the date of the writ.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> The writ is dated the 29th of October and I would be prepared to assess mesne profits on the evidence before me at the rate of $5per sq. ft.
