I will, for thesake of convenience, call them D3 to D7. The application is brought under Order 18 Rule 19(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court,the main ground being that the Points of Claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. In the course of argument, other grounds wererelied upon, perhaps upon the implied invitation of the Bench: these are under sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph (1) of Order18 Rule 19; that is, that the pleadings as against D3 to D7 are vexatious, embarrassing and an abuse of process. However, littletime was taken up on these later points.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> All five defendant companies are registered in Hong Kong. D3 to D6 were incorporated on 21st August 1984. D7 was incorporated on7th December 1984. D3 to D6 were originally incorporated under different names and, in November 1984, the names were changed to thosenow appearing in the writ. The plaintiff is the Allied Arab Bank. The 1st defendant to the action is a Mr. Hajjar.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> It is alleged in the Points of Claim that D3 to D7 are part of a group of companies call the UTC Group: the pleading also avers thatthe Managing Director of D3 (a Mr. Kharouba) has denied this is so, but it is also alleged in the pleading that the denial was alie and was dishonestly made.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The Points of Claim is a formidable document, particularly to a Judge who comes to the matter raw for the first time. It covers 151pages and includes nine schedules. Paragraph 60 alone goes from page 58 to page 121. In essence, four causes of action are pleadedagainst D3 to D7; they are:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="89%">                (1) fraudulent misrepresentation,                <p>(2) conspiracy to defraud,</p>                <p>(3) an accounting on the basis of constructive trusteeship, and</p>                <p>(4) an action for discovery of the <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> type.</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I take a brief look first of all at what Mr. Wadsworth Q.C. (counsel for the plaintiff) calls the story in the case.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> At the foundation of the plaintiff's case is the allegation of a dishonest scheme concocted to defraud the creditors of the UTC Group,including the plaintiff bank.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> As averred in paragraph 39(i), it is as follows:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The corporate defendants and all other companies and/ or firms in the UTC Group and/or its associates and/or Hajjar and the individualslisted in Schedule One have dishonestly conspired together to defraud creditors generally and the plaintiffs in particular of theirproper entitlements to receive money from those persons or companies in or associated with the UTC Group with whom such creditorshave dealt."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>Schedule One referred to above contains a list of 51 names which includes D3 to D7.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The averments of fact pleaded in the Points of Claim span the time from about 1977 to about December 1986. Accordingly, the allegationsof conspiracy to defraud go back to 1977, long before the corporate defendants were formed. What is alleged in paragraph 39(ii) isthat D3 to D7 became parties to the conspiracy not later than the dates set out in Schedule 8; and when one reads Schedule 8, itgives the date as 21st August 1984. What is therefore alleged this: the defendants joined a pre-existing conspiracy, and thereafterassisted in its execution. To see what that conspiracy is, one must look at the averments of fact dealing with the period prior toAugust 1984.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In summary (and it can only be a very brief summary) the picture emerges as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="152%" colspan="2">                From about 1977, the plaintiff bank started lending money and providing banking facilities to certain customers,being companies in the UTC Group.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="10%"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="152%" colspan="2">                The pleading avers that the Group is ultimately owned by Mr. Hajjar, Mr. B.

In my judgment, they are not well-founded. In <u>SCF Finance</u>, there was a simple factual issue between the parties as to whether a sum of money belonged to the 1st defendant's wife beneficiallyor whether she was merely her husband's nominee. If the money belonged to her beneficially when a Mareva Order was made <u>ex parte</u> in relation to the disposal of that money, then the order must be discharged. She had the opportunity to deal with that issue. Shechose to let that opportunity go. It was held that the principle in <u>Yet Tung Investment</u> <em>[</em>1975<em>]</em> AC 581 applied, namely, (and here I quote from the judgment of Lord Justice Ralph Gibson at page 101) that "it would be an abuseof the process of the court to raise in subsequent proceedings matters which could and should have been litigated in earlier proceedings.Lord Kilbrandon giving the judgment of their lordships gave warning at page 590: 'The shutting out of a subject of litigation wasa power which no court should exercise but after a scrupulous examination of all the circumstances'."</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I cannot, sitting as a Judge in Hong Kong, conduct <u>any</u> examination of the circumstances of the English proceedings, not to mention the <u>scrupulous</u> examination mentioned by Lord Kilbrandon in <u>Yat Tung Investment</u>. I am a Hong Kong Court. It is not alleged that there have been proceedings between the parties in Hong Kong which could precludethe defendants coming to the Hong Kong Court to apply to strike out a Hong Kong pleading. But I go further. I see no inconsistencybetween the consent order of 10th April in England and the present application. Order 18 rule 19 of the Rules of the Supreme Courtsays that the court may <u>at any stage</u> of the proceedings order pleadings to be struck out. It follows that the rules do not preclude a defendant from applying to strikeout even after the Defence has been served. I cannot therefore see how by consenting to be given of time for the service of theirDefence in England the defendants can be prejudiced in the present application. I, therefore, proceed with the present applicationuninfluenced by the consent order made on the 10th of April 1987 in Action No. 1987 A114.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Before dealing with the four causes of action and seeing whether the pleadings are so hopelessly defective as to justify the strongremedy of a strike out, I should make some preliminary observations:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="82%">                What is alleged against Hajjar his associates and these corporate defendants is fraud and concealment of fraudulentconduct.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="82%">                Fraud by its nature is clandestine proof is not readily obtained.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="82%">                If a party has deliberately arranged his affairs so that a third party (be it a creditor or liquidator) will findit impossible to untangle the web he has created, and lay hands on real assets, then the averments of fraud cannot, by the very natureof the wrong complained of, be too precise. In saying this, I have in mind Mr. Lindsay Q.C.'s submission that fraudulent conductmust be distinctly alleged and as distinctly proved, and that it is not allowable to leave fraud to be inferred from the facts. (ThisI think is a quotation from the 19th century case of <u>Davy</u> v. <u>Garrett</u>). The facts of modern commercial life have however to be faced. There are instances known to modern courts of law (I do not say thatthis is necessarily one of them) where, through companies in different jurisdictions (and governed by different laws) and by inter-companyaccounting, nominee shareholdings and such-like devices, frauds become extremely difficult to uncover. Where therefore the Courtis asked to strike out a fraud claim of this kind, based upon a complaint that the pleading lacks particularity, the Court shouldlook upon the strike-out application with great care. And I have already noted the averment on page 58 of the pleading, paragraph60(i), that the UTC Group was set up deliberately as a web to frustrate the enforcement of judgment.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(4)</td>            <td width="82%">On the other hand, it should be noted that when an action like this goes to trial, it is bound to be extremely oppressive as regardsD3 to D7. Very many allegations are made in the pleadings with which D3 to D7 cannot remotely be concerned. I note, for example,the averments on pages 36 to 39, pages 42 to 56. The averments on pages 42 to 56 are said to be allegations of overt acts of conspiracyas against Hajjar and others; in fact as pleaded, they are allegations of fraud on other parties and not on the plaintiff bank. Forexample, a group of chicken exporters in Brazil are said to have become victims of Hajjar's fraud; this has been pleaded because,I am told, the plaintiffs invoke the 'Similar Facts' rule. It appears to me very odd that in a fraud case, the 'similar Facts' ruleshould be invoked. If evidence of injury to the plaintiff by the defendants' frauds is not strong enough to establish the plaintiff'scase against the defendants, I cannot see how the fact of someone else being defrauded can help to bolster up the deficient case.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> I say no more about that.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I come now to the four causes of action.

It would seem very odd that the plaintiff bank placed any reliance on anything said by the partners(and this would include Hajjar) at that stage, at least to the extent of suffering loss in reliance upon such representations.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(5)</td>            <td width="81%">                Then paragraph 35 of the pleading reads:                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="81%" class="quote">                The representations were made to the bank with the dishonest connivance of Shukri, <em>[</em>who was the Chief Executive and Managing Director<em>]</em> with the intent and by virtue of the bank's reliance upon them with the effect of persuading the bank to continue to offer and/orextend the overdraft and other banking facilities to the customers and/or to refrain from calling upon the customers and/or the guarantorsto repay the monies owed to the plaintiffs.                <p class="quote"> </p>                <p class="quote">To see what damage is allegedly suffered by the bank arising from such reliance, one has to move forward 99 pages, to page 122 ofthe pleading.</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(6)</td>            <td width="81%">                Paragraph 62 (page 122) as formulated is ungrammatical.

It is based upon at least two contingencies:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="82%">                that the bank would have or could have taken earlier action and                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="82%">that such action would have or could have been more successful than whatever actions were actually taken in pursuit of their claims.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The speculative nature of a claim will make a Court look more closely at the nexus between the alleged wrong and the loss, but itdoes not mean but in law the plaintiff cannot recover: See <u>Chaplin</u> v. <u>Hicks</u> <em>[</em>1911<em>]</em> 2KB 786; but the assessment of the loss will, of course, be a very difficult matter.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Now in these circumstances, Mr. Lindsay Q.C. (for the defendants) mounts his attack upon the pleadings thus: he make three points:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="82%" valign="top">                It has not been sufficiently averred that the fraudulent representations were those of D3 to D7, or any of them.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="82%">                It has not been sufficiently averred that the plaintiff altered its position in reliance upon such representations.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="82%">It has not been sufficiently averred that the plaintiff suffered consequential damage flowing directly and naturally from the tortpleaded.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It will be more convenient to deal with the three points together.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Now plainly, a general averment that Hajjar and others have made fraudulent representations to the bank as to the means, source ortiming of any possible repayment of indebtedness by the customers is not enough to found an action of deceit against these corporatedefendants. I therefore must look at the way the claim is particularized.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> From subparagraph (11) which I have already referred to above, it will be seen that what Hajjar allegedly did on 5th December 1984was to make an oral <u>agreement</u> with the bank. On the face of it, the oral agreement was made on behalf of those under liability to the bank, that is to say, thecustomers. From this primary averment of fact, I am not sure that it even follows as a matter of logic that Hajjar "thereby represented"that he "reasonably believed that the customers could and would pay. The averment is that there is a promise to pay US$1.2 million,the source being China. Assuming that it is a fair inference (and upon a striking-out that would be the proper approach) the questionI ask myself then is: For whom was that representation made? On the face of it, it was a representation made by Hajjar and if hewas acting in any representative capacity, it would have been on behalf of the <u>customers</u>. If subparagraph (ii) in the paragraph (11) is correct (and I assume it to be so) then on the face of it, the representation is arepresentation <u>concerning</u> the defendants; not, on the face of it, a representation <u>by</u> defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I cannot see how paragraph (12) can advance the matter much further. It merely says that Tabbaa (who apparently had held himselfout as the Group Chairman of the UTC Group) represented to the bank that Hajjar's promise to pay US$1.2 million would be honoured.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> As for the representations pleaded in paragraphs (13) and (14), the notion that they could be held to be representations on behalfof D3 to D7 would seem highly improbable. I do not base my decision on this ground, for I cannot see how it can be argued that any<u>damage</u> flowed from such representations. It is expr6ssly pleaded on page 122 that the loss and damage suffered "by reason of the foregoing"(that is to say, the false representations) was that the bank was unable to recover to the full extent claimed in <u>debt</u> the amounts as against the customers and the guarantors. But by the time of the telexes averred in paragraphs 13 and 14, the debthad been called in. So there could be no loss even if there had been reliance upon such telexes.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Now there is the general averment in paragraph 36(ii) of the pleading to the effect that "the said representations" (that is to say,the paragraphs 11 and 12 representations) were made on behalf of all the members of the UTC Group (which would include D3 to D7)as at the date of the representations in question. I then ask myself this question: Is this general averment sufficient to founda case based upon agency: that is, representations made by Hajjar on behalf of D3 to D7, so that a Court might hereafter hold thatthey were the representations of D3 to D7?</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In my judgment, the answer must be no. The averment in paragraph 36(ii) is a conclusion of law. Whether the conclusion is justifiedor not depends upon the averments of fact. In my judgment it is not sufficient to rely upon the averments of fact in paragraph 35alone. To see whether the case based upon agency has been made out, I must look elsewhere.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> What I shall now attempt to do is to summarize from the pleadings spread over many pages the averments of fact which might remotelybe said to be relevant to the issue of agency. They are as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%" valign="top" height="84"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" height="84">(1)</td>            <td width="83%" height="84" valign="top">Hajjar was the or a directing mind of the Group: but I would note that it is also averred that R.

What the pleader says is that <u>by reason</u> of what is said before, each representation was made on behalf of each member of the Group. When one sees what is pleaded before,it <u>pleads knowledge and permission</u> of each company. I cannot see how, as a matter of logic, <u>knowledge and permission</u> as regards representations made by an individual, Hajjar, can make such representations those of the company.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> The broad question I ask myself therefore is this: From the facts as I have recited above (I think I have enumerated all the mostrelevant ones) can it arguably be said that Hajjar was making the paragraph 11 representation on behalf of D3 to D1 I remind myselfthat the threshold is low: if it can be argued, then the point is good as far as the pleading is concerned. On this issue I placeno reliance on the case cited by Mr. Wadsworth: <u>The Ford Motor Credit Company</u> case reported in the Times newspaper of the 7th of July 1972. Mr. Wadsworth suggested in argument that the case established the propositionthat a man who has a control of a group of companies has actual as well as of ostensible authority to represent each and every memberof the group. I cannot see how that could be advanced as a proposition of law. Whether there is such authority or not is surely amatter of the internal arrangements within the group, and that is essentially a question of fact. I find the case of <u>Hampshire Land Company</u> <em>[</em>1896<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20Ch%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 Ch. 743</a> more helpful, where the court held that where one person is officer of two companies, his personal knowledge is not necessarily theknowledge of both companies.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Coming back to the averment in paragraph 11 (the particulars go paragraph 35 of the Points of Claim), I think that Mr. Lindsay isplainly right when he says that <u>prima facie</u> the representation is that of the <u>representor</u>. It is, on the face of it, a representation <u>about</u> the <u>customer</u> and affecting the <u>customer</u>. Assuming every fact that I have outlined above to be true, I do not think that a court could. reasonably conclude that the paragraph11 representation was made by D3 to D7. It follows therefore the paragraph 12 representation cannot have been made by D3 to D7 either.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> I look now at the question of damages flowing from the alleged wrong. Mr. Lindsay argues that the pleading on page 122 of <u>damage</u> is not enough; it is not plain from the pleading what loss is said go have flowed from the wrong alleged. The Plaintiff's loss isthe loss of opportunity to take prompt action go recover the money from the customers and guarantors; but it is not alleged whataction they would or could have taken if there had been no representations. These are Mr. Lindsay's arguments and I found considerableforce in them. Mr. Lindsay also argues that where no immediate and necessary consequence arises from the wrong alleged then all thefacts and circumstances giving rise to the loss must be pleaded. He cites the case of <u>Perestrello</u> v. <u>United Paint</u> <em>[</em>1969<em>]</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20WLR%20570" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 WLR 570.</a> That proposition seems to me to be right in the circumstances of this case. Page 122 cries out for particulars; if none are giventhen no evidence could be adduced at trial. However, I do not think that this <u>damage</u> point alone would suffice to permit me to strike out the averment based upon fraudulent misrepresentation. But having regard to myfinding as to <u>agency</u> and the clear view I have formed that the fraudulent misrepresentation as particularized cannot conceivably be said to have beenmade on behalf of D3 to D7, in my judgment the averments of fraudulent misrepresentation, and the reliefs based thereupon, must bestruck out.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> I come now to the 2nd cause of action, <u>conspiracy to defraud</u>. This is pleaded in Chapter M of the Points of Claim. I shall attempt to enumerate the averments:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="6%"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top">1)</td>            <td width="94%" colspan="2">                There is the general averment in paragraph 39(i) which I have already set out earlier;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%"></td>            <td width="1%" valign="top">2)</td>            <td width="94%" colspan="2">                There is the averment in paragraph 44(20)(a) to this effect: between 1984 and 1986 Hajjar and/or others cause newcompanies to be incorporated or acquired and to be operated so as to continue the UTC Group's activities (the companies includingD3 to D7).

He first of all takes a <u>date</u> point. In paragraph 39(ii) it is alleged that the corporate defendants joined and became parties to "the said conspiracy" not laterthan (in effect) the 20th of August 1984; but, he says, D7 was not incorporated until December 1984; so as far as D7 is concernedthe entire basis of a charge of conspiracy must go. Mr. Wadsworth answers the point by saying that the date of joining the conspiracyis not a material averment; what is material is what D7 did in execution of the conspiracy, whenever D7 joined.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> I think it would be helpful for me to go back to Mr. Wadsworth's formulation of the conspiracy as charged, as presented to me inhis opening. It is as follows:</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="81%">the unlawful obtaining of loans and facilities, this was achieved by massive bribes.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> But this did not go beyond 1983 and I cannot see how it can be alleged that D3 to D7 were parties to such unlawful obtaining; anyaverments to that effect must obviously be disregarded.</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="81%">The deliberate construction of the web, to make the Group and members of the Group-"judgment-proof".</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> These are of course <u>prima facie</u> allegations against the <u>promoters</u> of the companies. If it be alleged that later on D3 to D7 knowingly took part in hiding away assets, particularly proceeds of fraud,then of course, D3 to D7 would be accountable as constructive trustees, and the companies need not be conspirators in setting upthe web in order to be accountable: I say this in parenthesis.</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="81%">The way Mr. Wadsworth formulates it in this way: (i) the making of deliberately untrue statements in order to ward off inquiries andto cause the bank to forebear to sue: that of course is the charge of fraudulent misrepresentation which I have already ordered tobe struck out; but, (ii) in relation to statements made in order to ward off enquiries there is a second part to the case as developedby Mr. Wadsworth. It is also alleged in the pleading that there were <u>truthful</u> representations, and it is alleged that D3 to D7 took part in this aspect of the conspiracy. The plaintiff relies upon the representationspleaded in. 94 onwards; only two, as far as I can see, are of any particular relevance. They are the telex .of the 30th May 1985and that of the 25th November 1985.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The general averment, of which those telexes are particulars, is at the bottom of page 94. It says "from as early as August 1984monies arising out of projects of the UTC Group in China were being held out by Hajjar and/or Karjawally on behalf of the partnersand the corporate defendants and the UTC Group generally as being available to allay the fears of the creditors in the UTC Group... Further it was being held out that these defendants were members of the UTC Group and/ or that their trading was beneficiallythat of the UTC Group. And then particulars are given. And then on page 8, it is averred: "By the said representations, the corporatedefendants were parties to the fraud herein pleaded in that they knowingly assisted in causing the bank to forbear or grant timeto the customers and/or guarantors etc."</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top">(4)</td>            <td width="80%">And finally I come to Mr. Wadsworth's formulation, by way of summary, to the effect that the companies D3 to D7 were <u>formed</u> and <u>operated</u> for the purposes of receiving and holding assets, the proceed of fraud, for the partners.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Now, arising out of the four averments of conspiracy as I have attempted to summarise above, in my judgment it is only the secondpart of (3) and (4) which are arguably viable as averments of conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> As regard the second part of (3), I have to look at the particulars given under the averments on page 95. Let us look more closely.I add here in parenthesis that the pleader appears to have lost heart when he came to these later pages; it is almost impossibleto try to identify the paragraph numbers. Now, the factual matters are that Hajjar by telex said "we have completed all accountingof our first project in the PRC"; and the factual averment in the telex of the 25th November 1985 concerns "chinese prospects generally"(whateverthat menas) and "our full address (name and address given)".</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> I ask myself these questions: If these are particulars of overt acts, what wrong-doing is disclosed? The telex of the 30th May 1985says nothing about monies being available from any of the defendants D3 to D7. Assuming that the royal "we" in the telex is capableof referring to D3 to D7, then it merely is an averment to the.effect that those companies had completed all accounting. As far asthe telex of the 25th November 1985 is concerned, it is pleaded as an invitation to the bank to general discussions. I cannot seehow these can be relied upon as overt acts of any conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> I come therefore to the formulation in point. (4) of Mr. Wadsworth's summary, that the companies were formed and then were <u>operated</u> thereafter for the purposes of receiving and holding assets which were the proceeds of fraud. I focus attention in particular uponthe averment in paragraph 60(iii) on page 58 where it says that the plaintiffs will "rely on the matters set out below" in supportof the allegation that the corporate defendants were parties to conspiracy; and then moving on to page 93, the averment that thecompanies were operated for the purposes of receiving assets including the proceeds of fraud from the UTC Group and then holdingsuch assets as if such asset were not assets of the UTC Group, and holding them for the partners. For this purpose I ignore the avermentin the passage which says: "holding them for the purposes set out at M herein" which is far too wide, so wide as to be meaningless.I ask myself therefore if this is a sufficient allegation of conspiracy as formulated by Mr. Wadsworth against D3 to D7.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> In my judgment it is just enough. By the very nature of the case, it is unlikely that the plaintiff at this stage would be able toparticularize the allegations further. If the allegations in the Points of Claim against Hajjar and his associates be true then therehas been a massive fraud practised upon the bank over a number of years. The bank has been milked, on those averments, of tens ofmillions of pounds; loans so called have been extracted with the assistance of a corrupt chief executive - with presumably no intentionthat they be repaid. If the proceeds of such fraud have been channelled to members of the UTC Group (and it is specifically allegedD3 to D7 were formed and operated to receive such proceeds of fraud) and then through D3 to D7 channelled into the pockets of Hajjarand his associates, then these are serious allegations of fraud and conspiracy. It is sufficiently pleaded for evidence to be ledthereon. Such allegations cannot be likely brushed aside.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Now, Mr. Lindsay complains that the <u>damage</u> flowing from the execution of this particular aspect of the conspiracy has not been pleaded. I note, however, the prayer for reliefat page 127, which prayed for damages and <u>inquiry as to damages</u> and then (b) an enquiry as to what money of the plaintiff obtained by fraud has been received and or transmitted by each or any ofthe defendants etc. And I note the averment on page 122 to the effect that the plea of damages is in the alternative. Paragraph 62(on page 122) says "alternatively the plaintiffs are unable to particularize the loss and damages until after completion of the accountsand enquiries prayed for herein."</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> In my judgment that is a sufficient pleading as to damage flowing from the execution of this aspect of the conspiracy for the caseto proceed on that ground.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> I now come to the question of <u>constructive trusteeship</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> What has to be made out for the plea to be good is as follows:</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">1)</td>            <td width="81%">                that the defendants received trust property (the expression "trust property" is here used in the technical senseconnoting property for which a Court of Equity would hold the defendant accountable; and this must include the proceeds of fraudsand money extracted from a bank by bribery);                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">2)</td>            <td width="81%">                that it has been shown that the defendant had notice (actual or constructive) that it was trust property, and               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">3)</td>            <td width="81%">that the defendant had actual or constructive notice that transfer to him was in breach of trust.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Now, that is the first way in which Mr. Wadsviorth on behalf of the plaintiff formulates the case as regards constructive trusteeship.He also formulates it secondly as follows:</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> In the alternative even if the Defendant has not received trust property (again the expression "trust property" is used in the technicalsense) but knowingly has assisted in the fraudulent design of the trustee then he is equally accountable.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Now, as regards the primary formulation of the constructive trusteeship, Mr. Wadsworth relies upon the following averments:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top">a)</td>            <td width="81%">                that the defendant has received trust property: he relies upon paragraph 19.1 of the pleading which says: "each andevery facility and/or use thereof was procured by the fraud of Hajjar and Shukri in that on dates which the plaintiffs will hereafteras far as possible set out Hajjar paid or caused to be paid to Shukri between about 1978 to 1983 at least Â£3.5 million pounds asbribes, such monies being drawn from one or more accounts held by the customers". The purpose and effect of such bribes was "to procurethe payment to or on behalf of the cus-tomers of money".                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top">b)</td>            <td width="81%">                As to the receipt of trust money by the defendants, Mr. Wadsworth relies upon the paragraph 28, the averment whichI have already read, to the effect that D3 to D7 were operated for the purposes of receiving proceeds of fraud.               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top">c)</td>            <td width="81%">                On the question of notice Mr. Wadsworth relies upon the averments in pages 93 to 94 which say that the companieswere established and then operated for the purposes of receiving the assets including the proceeds of fraud, and plead the fact thatHajjar among others was a director of each of the defendants. And finally as regards the question of notice that the transfer ofproperty to the defendants was in breach of trust, Mr. Wadsworth relies upon the same averments.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> As I have said earlier, by the very nature of the wrong as pleaded (the operation of the companies for the purposes of receivingthe proceeds of fraud), evidence of such wrong would not be readily available. And in the circumstances, it seems to me that thepleading as I have enumerated above is a sufficient pleading of constructive trusteeship and breach thereof. As regards the alternativeway in which the case was formulated (that is to say, that the defendants have knowingly <u>assisted</u> in the fraudulent design of the constructive trustees) this is in effect another way of formulating the fraudulent misrepresentationplea and I do not propose therefore to repeat for what I said above.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The effect therefore of this part of my judgment is that the allegation of breach of constructive trusteeship succeeds in withstandingthe strike out attack.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> I come then to the last point, which is the <u>Action for Discovery</u>.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> This is pleaded, first of all, on page 124. Again I will have to read it slightly differently from the way it is actually writtenbecause (it is conceded) as written it is ungrammatical. Reading paragraph 66 grammatically it is as follows:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If contrary to the plaintiff's primary contention, any of the corporate defendants is not a party to the fraud herein-before setout, but has acted only as an honest agent of Hajjar or of any other partner or member of the UTC Group which is such a party thento the extent that each such corporate defendant is an unwitting participant in the execution by Hajjar and/or other defendants,the other partners, and the other members of the UTC Group of the conspiracy about set out, the plaintiff will claim against eachsuch innocent corporate defendant an order that such corporate defendant do within such time as the court may appoint serve uponthe plaintiffs a list of documents relating to all transactions between such corporate defendants herein and each of the partnersand members of the UTC Group for such period as this honourable court may deem just, and an order that such documents be producedby appointment to the plaintiffs for the purposes of the plaintiffs inspecting copying and making notes of the same to the extentthat such plaintiff may wish."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Now, that is pleaded as the material averments, <u>all</u> the material averments, of this cause of action. The relief is pleaded on page 130, and it claims "an Order requiring each defendantto make and serve upon the plaintiffs' solicitors and verify by affidavit served upon which solicitors a list of documents statingeach and every document which is now, or has any time been, in the possession power or control of that. defendant relating to eachand every matter set out in schedule 9 hereto", and then permitting inspection, the taking of copies etc. And then schedule 9 onpage 150 of the pleading sets out 9 separate classes of documents. I note in particular two items, item 5 which requires disclosureof any payment exceeding HKD$10,000 in value passing between "any defendant, their servants or agents and any of the parties listedin schedule 1"; and of course schedule 1 lists 51 parties including D3 to D7. I note also item 9 in schedule 9 which requires disclosureof "any document relating to any allegation made herein in the Points of Claim".</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> Now the claim for discovery of that very wide nature as set out in this pleading is based upon the case of <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> <em>[</em>1974<em>]</em> AC 133. In this regard, I make the following observations:</p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="4%" valign="top">1)</td>            <td width="94%" colspan="3">                In <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u>, by the time the case reached the House of Lords, every allegation that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise were themselves infringersof the plaintiff's patent had been abandoned. The case proceeded on the basis that the Commissioners were wholly innocent but they,in discharge of statutory duties, had in their possession names and addresses of undoubted infringers of the plaintiff's patent.The Commissioners were in a position to assist the plaintiff to vindicate its legal rights against third parties, by providing thenames and addresses of third party infringers. The questions in the case were (i) whether the Commissioners were under a duty togive the information sought and (ii) whether public policy or statute prevented the court from ordering disclosure.               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="4%" valign="top">2)</td>            <td width="94%" colspan="3">                I observe that in fact the only information sought in <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> was <u>identity</u>: that is to say, names and addresses' of infringers.

In Hong Kong the case of <u>Yew Seng Computer</u> v. <u>Computerland</u> <em>[</em>1986<em>]</em> Hong Kong Law Reports 233 deals with this issue. The Court of Appeal held that <u>Norwich Pharamacal</u> discovery was not confined to names and addresses and. that in proper cases other information could be sought. This is consistentwith the reasoning of the English Court of Appeal in <u>Bankers Trust</u> v. <u>Shapira</u> <em>[</em>1981<em>]</em> Weekly Law Reports 1274 where the plaintiff bank, a victim of fraud, sought discovery in order to trace the proceeds of the fraudagainst the Discount Bank, the 3rd defendant.

In these circumstances, a Court would clearly be very slow to allow a <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> claim to lie side by side with the action based upon the defendant's wrongdoings: this is clear from the judgment of Cons JA in <u>Yew Seng Computer</u> v. <u>Computerland</u> at page 286, where he says:                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I appreciate that in the banking cases ground was pleaded and relied on but the discovery that was given was not in support of theaction for fraud, it was in support of an equitable action to trace monies said to be the subject of constructive trust's."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I should perhaps add in parenthesis that in Vice-President Huggins' judgment on page 235 the reference to discovery being wider thandisclosure of <u>identity</u> in the case of <u>Radio Corporation</u> v. <u>Reddington</u> <em>[</em>1975<em>]</em> RPC 95 was wrong. Huggins, V-P probably was misled (as, I think, all of us were in this court at the beginning) by the actual formof the order apparently drawn up pursuant to the judgment of the Court in <u>Radio Corporation</u> v. <u>Reddington</u>. If one looks at the order as apparently drawn up on p. 97 of the report, one sees that it included, apart from names and addresses,the requirement that the defendant should make an affidavit exhibiting copies of all documents in his possession relating to thesupply to or by the defendant of certain material. This is plainly wrong because on p. 96, although that is what the applicant sought,this was in fact abandoned at the hearing, and at p. 96 line 8, Mr. Justice Goff said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is clear, and the plaintiffs accept, that, in any event, that is too wide and must be limited to names of persons and companiesknown to the Defendants."</p>        <p> </p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="5%" valign="top">6)</td>            <td width="95%">                Whatever the scope of <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> discovery, it is plainly based upon the proposition that the defendant is under a duty to assist the plaintiff to vindicate legalrights against third parties. In <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u>, Lord Kilbrandon at p. 203 said:                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The most attractive way to state an acceptable principle, intellectually at least, may be as follows: The dispute between the plaintiffand the defendants is of a peculiar character. The plaintiff is demanding what he conceives to be his right, but that right insofaras it has patrimonial substance is not truly opposed to any interest of the defendants; he is demanding access to a Court of Law,in order that he may establish that third parties are unlawfully causing him damage."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>And Lord Cross at P. 199 said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the course of the argument fears were expressed that to order disclosure of names in circumstances such as exist in this casemight be the thin end of the wedge, that we might be opening the door to fishing requests by would-be plaintiffs who want to collectevidence or the requests for names made to persons who had no relevant connection with the person to be sued or with the events givingrise to the alleged cause of action but just happened to know the name. I think that these fears are groundless. In the first place,there is a clear distinction between simply asking for the name of a person whom you wish to make a defendant and asking for evidence.This case has nothing to do with the collection of evidence."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> There is an echo of these sentiments in the judgment of Vice-President Huggins in <u>Yew Seng Computers</u> at p. 285(G).</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> Now if I am right in holding, as I do, that the duty of the defendant in a <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> case is the duty to assist the plaintiff in vindicating his legal rights against third parties, or perhaps as in <u>Banker's Trust</u> in tracing trust property in the hands of third parties, then the averments of fact giving rise to such duty must clearly be pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> Paragraph 66 of the Points of Claim is wholly deficient in this respect. The fact thst Hajjar and/or other parties have conspiredto harm the plaintiff, and D3 to D7 are "unwitting participants' in the execution by Hajjar and/or other parties of the conspiracyis of course pleaded. But this does not <u>per se</u> give rise to a duty, imposed by law upon D3 to D7, to give discovery. It appears very much to me as if what the plaintiff seeks todo is what Lord Cross enjoins a plaintiff should not do, that is to say, embark upon a "fishing expedition". The plaintiff has sueda total. 51 defendants in the English proceedings. Discovery would be massive. They have not alleged in the Point of Claim beforeme that any discovery given by the defendants on the <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> claim will lead, or is likely to lead, to further tortfeasors being discovered. Far less have they averred that such discovery isnecessary for the vindication of their legal rights against third parties.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> In this Action, since the cause of action based on constructive trusteeship still survives, and likewise the averments as regardsthe conspiracy to hide away assets, the defendants will have to give discovert in any event.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> In my judgment the pleading as to discovery is wholly bad. There are no sufficient averments for the court to give relief in theway prayed for. The action for discovery as constituted cannot proceed. No reasonable cause of action is shown on the averments andthe relief based thereon must be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> Now I come then to the summons before me. The summons asks for the <u>whole</u> of the Point of Claim to be struck out and the action to be dismissed. The power under Order 18 Rule 19 is for the court to strikeout the whole or part of the pleadings and to order that the action be either stayed or dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Now to give effect to my order, there will obviously have to be massive re-amendment of the pleadings. It is not appropriate forme to attempt to identify the particular passages in this 151-page document which requires to be struck out. This is a task whichwill have to be left to the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> To make sure that there is no misunderstanding, it might be helpful for me to summarize the effect of the order:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="2%" valign="top" colspan="2">1.</td>            <td width="102%" colspan="2">                The pleading as to damages for fraudulent misrepresentation must be struck out.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="14%"></td>            <td width="2%" valign="top" colspan="2">2.</td>            <td width="102%" colspan="2">                The pleading as to damages for conspiracy must be struck out except as to the claim for conspiracy as particularizedon p. 93 to the extent I have indicated; that is to say, what then stands is as follows:                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" colspan="2"></td>            <td width="11%" colspan="2"></td>            <td width="78%">The companies were established or acquired or operated by Hajjar for himself and the other partners for the purpose of receiving assetsincluding the proceeds of the fraud pleaded from the U.T.C.

I express the hope that when the occasionto re-form the pleadings arises, the pleader would heed the requirements in Order 18 Rule 7 of the Rules of the Supreme Court whichsay that the statement of material facts should be in as brief a form as the nature of the case admits.
