On 28 September 1990, Sun Asiaassigned all benefits under this agreement to a company which changed its name to Allson Classic Hotel (Hong Kong) Limited ("Allson").On 26 October 1990, the owner sold the hotel to Abundance Assets Limited ("Abundance"), and, on the same day, the owner, Sun Asia,Abundance and Allson subscribed to a deed amending the management agreement. Hereafter, I will refer to the management agreementand the deed amending it as "the management agreement"</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> On 20 November 1993, Abundance service a notice on Sun Asia and Allson purporting to terminate the management agreement. Two dayslater, Allson issued a generally endorsed writ in action 1993: CL 179 ("Action 179") claiming a declaration that the management agreementwas still subsisting and injunctions to restrain Abundance from interfering with its rights under the agreement and to prevent Abundancefrom selling, assigning or otherwise deposing of the hotel.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Pressure followed from Abundance to persuade Allson to serve its points of claim culminating in an "unless order" granting Allsonuntil 24 January 1984 to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> On 19 January 1994, Abundance sold the hotel.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> On 24 January 1994, Allson filed a notice of discontinuance in Action 179.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On 27 January 1994, Allson filed a complaint by which it commenced civil proceedings in Hawaii ("the Hawaiian action") seeking reliefin respect of breaches of the management agreement. The defendants cited in that action were Abundance, Sukamto Holding Corporation("SHC") and three Sukamto brothers, Sukarman Sukamto, Sumitro Sukamto, Sutarman Sukamto.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> On 16 February 1994, Abundance issued a generally endorsed writ in Hong Kong in action 1994: CL 19 ("Action 19") against Sun Asiaand Allson claiming declarations in relation to the termination of the agreement, an account and damages. The points of claim inthis action were filed on 24 March 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On 4 March 1994, Abundance moved the Hawaiian court to dismiss Allson's complaint for lack of jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> On 7 April 1994, Sun Asia issued a summons in Action 19 asking for an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of forum non conveniensand lis alibi pendens.

No points of claimwere ever served, but the endorsement on the writ stated that the plaintiff's claim was for -</p>    <p>1. A declaration that the management agreement was valid, subsisting and in full effect and would so remain until 30 September 2010.</p>    <p>2.

It was commenced by writ on 16 February 1994.Abundance claims a declaration that the management agreement terminated on 20 November 1993 by Abundance's acceptance of Sun Asia's"and/or" Allson's repudiation. In the alternative, it claims declarations that Abundance was entitled to and did terminate the agreementby notice given on 20 November 1993. Abundance also claims a declaration that it is entitled to repayment of certain money receivedby Sun Asia "and/or" Allson as agent, an account, and damages for breach of contract and fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It is in respect of this action that, on 7 April 1994, Sun Asia and Allson issued a summons asking for an order staying the proceedingson the grounds of forum non conveniens and lis alibi pendens. This summons is one of those before me.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>The Hawaiian Action</em></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> This action is by Allson as plaintiff against Abundance, SHC, Sukarman Sukamto, Sumitro Sukamto, Sutarman Sukamto and a multiplicityof John Does and Doe Entities as defendants. Allson alleges a breach of the management agreement for which it claims compensatorydamages, a tortious breach of the management agreement for which compensatory and punitive damages are claimed, fraud in respectof which compensatory and punitive damages are claimed and negligent misrepresentation for which Allson claims compensatory damages.The action was commenced by filing a complaint on 27 January 1994.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Action 108</em></p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> This is an action by Allson against Abundance commenced by writ issued on 17 June 1994 in which Allson claims declarations that theHawaiian action constitutes "proceedings" for the purpose of the Transfer of Business (Protection of Creditors) Ordinance, Chapter49, and that the notice of transfer of business is deemed to be incomplete pending the final determination of the Hawaiian action.The action also claims damages "and/or" punitive damages on much the same basis as it claims this relief in the Hawaiian action.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In a letter to Abundance served with the writ, and in a similar letter to the purchaser of the hotel, Allson said ". . . the writhas been issued to preserve our client's rights under the Transfer of Business Ordinance pending determination of the rights in theproceedings . . . in Hawaii" and that ". . . in these circumstances we propose to seek a stay of these proceedings pending determinationof the proceedings in Hawaii".</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> On 6 July 1994, Allson filed a summons claiming a stay of proceedings in this action on the ground of lis alibi pendens. This isthe other summons before me.</p>    <p class="heading">The Summons in Action 19</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> It is convenient, I think, to consider firstly the summons issued in Action 19. Sun Asia and Allson ask me to stay this action onthe grounds of forum non conveniens and lis alibi pendens.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> One starts an inquiry of this nature, I believe, from the premise that a person is entitled to litigate a dispute in our courts whereour courts have clear jurisdiction over the matter. No one doubts that our courts have jurisdiction in Action 19, if for no otherreason than that the management agreement provides that they do. In order to persuade our courts to refuse to exercise that jurisdictionand to order a stay of proceedings, the party asking for that relief must show that it is entitled to it.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>The Law</em></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The basis on which such relief may be granted is now clearly established. The principles are set out in <strong>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v. Consulex Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20AC%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] AC 460.</a></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Reading the speeches in that case, I was impressed, with respect, by the words of Lord Templeman at 465C -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I hope that in future the judge will be allowed to study the evidence and refresh his memory of the speech of my noble and learnedfriend Lord Goff of Chieveley in this case in the quiet of his room without expense to the parties; that he will not be referredto other decisions on other facts; and that submissions will be measured in hours and not days."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The speech of Lord Goff (commencing at page 466) approved at 474C the fundamental principle as stated by Lord Kinnear in <strong>Sim v. Robinow</strong> (1892) 19 R. 665, at 668 -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"the plea [of forum non conveniens] can never be sustained unless the court is satisfied that there is some other tribunal, havingcompetent jurisdiction, in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Amongst other statements, Lord Goff made the following remarks, which I have found useful and have applied in this case -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">At 474E ". . . I doubt whether the Latin tag forum non conveniens is apt to describe this principle. For the question is not one ofconvenience, but the suitability or appropriateness of the relevant jurisdiction."</p>        <p class="quote">At 476D ". . . in general the burden of proof rests of the defendant to persuade the court to exercise its discretion to grant a stay. . .. each party will seek to establish the existence of certain matters which will assist him in persuading the court to exerciseits discretion in his favour, and that in respect of any such matter the evidential burden will rest on the party who asserts itsexistence. . . . if the court is satisfied that there is another available forum which is prima facie the appropriate forum for thetrial of the action, the burden will then shift to the plaintiff to show that there are special circumstances by reason of whichjustice requires that the trial should nevertheless take</p>        <p class="quote">At 476F to 477 Lord Goff discusses whether the English courts will lightly disturb jurisdiction founded as of right in accordancewith the law, and goes on at 477E to say - "In my opinion, the burden resting on the defendant is not just to show that England isnot the natural or appropriate forum for the trial, but to establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctlymore appropriate than the English forum.

So it is for connecting factors in this sense that the court mustfirst look; and these will include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as availability of witnesses), but alsoother factors such as the law governing the relevant transaction . . . and the places where the parties respectively reside or carryon business.

In this inquiry, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case,including circumstances which go beyond those taken into account when considering connecting factors with other jurisdictions.

I, of course, must accept this as establishing that, at this stage,the Hawaiian court is another available forum having competent jurisdiction. It must be said, however, that, although no one doubtsthe jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts, the jurisdiction of the Hawaiian court is being challenged. The decision of the Hawaiiancourt is not final. It may yet hold, on an investigation into the facts, that it does not have jurisdiction.

The parties to that agreement were Abundanceon the one hand and Allson and Sun Asia on the other. On the face of the documents, no other legal <em>persona</em> were involved. The agreement governed the relationship between the parties regarding the management of a hotel in Hong Kong. Themanagement agreement is governed by Hong Kong law. The assignment by Sun Asia to the company that became Allson is governed by HongKong law. The sale and purchase agreements relating to the hotel are governed by Hong Kong law. Whether or not the termination waslawful will be governed by Hong Kong law, and depends on disputes concerning factual events taking place or having effect in HongKong. The businesses of the parties as far as they concern the agreement were in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> On the face of it, without more, all this would lead one very firmly to the conclusion that the natural or appropriate forum forthe litigation of the dispute would be undoubtedly the courts of Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Although the parties submitted to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts, the fact that this was a non-exclusive submission indicates,Mr Griffiths argues, that the parties envisaged the possibility of litigation in another jurisdiction.

In other words, I propose to consider the matter, in the first instance,without bringing into play the undesirability of having the same matter litigated concurrently in different proceedings in differentjurisdictions.

Sun Asia is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. It has submitted to jurisdiction of Hong Kongcourts. It had a place of business in Hong Kong at all material times. It was a party to the management agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Abundance is a company registered in the British Virgin Islands with a place of business in Hong Kong. It has not been disclosedwho owns the shares in Abundance, but during the existence of the management agreement only five persons acted on its behalf: Thethree Sukamto brothers, two of whom are resident in Hawaii, Clement Chan, the financial controller, who is also in Hawaii, and SHC,a Hawaiian company. So, it is said, the supervision and control of the hotel business was exercised from Hawaii. The heart and mindof the business was there.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> So, the parties to the management agreement have strong connections with Hong Kong. Others, who are not parties to that agreement,but directed Abundance, are associated with Hawaii.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> This factor does not clearly favour a conclusion that Hawaii is the natural or appropriate forum with claims superior to those ofHong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Location of Witnesses</em></p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Allson says that, in the Hawaiian action, four potential witnesses on the Abundance/Sukamto side: Sukarman and Sumitro Sukamto, ClementChan and Howard Kam are living in Hawaii. The three major witnesses on the Allson side: Patrick Allante, Joji Otomo and Paul SunAsia Chung Li have agreed to testify in Hawaii for deposition and trial. The Sun Asia witnesses, other than one who is no longerconnected with Sun Asia, have agreed to give evidence in Hawaii.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> There are only four potential material witnesses in Hawaii. There is a potentially greater number of witnesses outside Hawaii. Themajor witnesses within Allson are not in Hawaii. The material witnesses connected with Sun Asia do not reside in Hawaii. There maybe witnesses relating to the "due diligence" review by Abundance before purchasing the hotel who are probably in Hong Kong; or, atleast not in Hawaii. There are several witnesses who may be called to relate their knowledge regarding business dealings at the hotelwho are not in Hawaii.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The location of the witnesses does not show that there would be less inconvenience and expense if the matter were litigated in Hawaii.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Location of Documents</em></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> One side tells me that most of relevant documents are in Hong Kong. The other side says the important documents are in Hawaii. Abundancesays that the initial production of documents for the Hawaiian proceedings took place in Hong Kong. Clearly, some documents are inHawaii; some are in Hong Kong. Whatever the situation may be, documents, wherever the source documents are situated, are as availablein one jurisdiction as the other.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The courts of Hong Kong and those of Hawaii share, to a large extent, a common language, so no translation problems arise.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> Allson argues that discovery, which will be important, would be best policed in Hawaii, which has personal jurisdiction over threedefendants</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> This factor is, from Allson's point of view, at best neutral.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Location of Commission of Unlawful Act</em></p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Allson contends that the decision to terminate the agreement was made in Hawaii, and that the tort was planned and executed in Hawaii,although there is some vagueness about this in the allegations in Allson's case in Hawaii. No allegation is made as to where thealleged misrepresentations were made.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Mr Griffiths argues that although the management agreement is subject to Hong Kong law and should be construed accordingly, thereis no suggestion the Hawaiian court, another court of common law jurisdiction, would have any difficulty with this. The real issue,he says, is a factual one, which should present no unusual problems for the Hawaiian court. Although the making of the contract andits performance are connected with Hong Kong, he says that the central issue is more closely connected with Hawaii because the heartand mind of Abundance is in Hawaii</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The fact that, if this is the case, that the conspirators plotted in Hawaii to bring about the downfall of Allson and Sun Asia, isof little moment. The bullet may have been fired in Hawaii, but the victim died in Hong Kong. There is no doubt that the agreementwas terminated in Hong Kong, and the justification, or otherwise, for this will be the main concern of any court trying the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> It may be that a Hawaiian court will be able to make a workman-like job of applying Hong Kong law to the matter, but there can beno doubt that it is far more natural and appropriate that the task of applying Hong Kong law should be left to Hong Kong courts.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> There is nothing here that leads me to favour Hawaii as clearly the natural venue.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Are the Parties Identical?</em></p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In Action 19, only Abundance, Sun Asia and Allson are parties.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> In the Hawaiian action, Abundance and Allson are parties. Sun Asia is not a party, although both Allson and Sun Asia clearly regardSun Asia as very much involved in the business of the hotel. There are four (or three) other parties in the Hawaiian litigation whoare not parties in Action 19.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> Abundance has not counter-claimed in Hawaii, nor joined Sun Asia. If it counterclaims, it fears it may be held to have submittedto the jurisdiction, although the applicable law seems to be that counter-claiming in respect of the same subject matter is not takenas a submission.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> Sun Asia, which Abundance has described as an indispensable party, has agreed to submit to US jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> This is clearly not a case where the parties in the litigation in the two different jurisdictions will be the same. Mr Griffiths,with his usual skill, has sought to turn this to his advantage by arguing convincingly that it is better that all the issues betweenall the parties be decided in one set of proceedings. This may be so, but it is not my function to oblige Abundance to join in theHawaiian litigation to achieve this by staying Action 19 where otherwise such an order would not be justified.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Are the Issues Identical?</em></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Certainly, the principal dispute in both actions will be the conduct of the parties leading up to the purported termination of themanagement agreement. In Action 19, Abundance will be seeking to show that the conduct of Allson "and/or" Sun Asia justified termination.In the Hawaiian action, Allson will be attempting to establish that there was no such justification, and that Abundance and the otherparties plotted to get rid off Allson and Sun Asia so that they could sell the hotel for an enhanced price unencumbered by the managementagreement.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> The dispute between Allson and Sun Asia on the one hand and Abundance on the other, as far as the issues between them are concerned,can be as well litigated in Hong Kong as Hawaii. It is true that, in Hong Kong, it may be that Allson will not be able to join theother parties in the Hawaiian action, but that is a procedural disadvantage, not a point that goes towards showing that the connectionsto Hawaii are more natural or appropriate. In any event, if it is so that the other Hawaiian parties conspired unlawfully with Abundanceto bring about the termination of the management agreement, I cannot believe that Hong Kong law does not provide a remedy. The contractualrelationship is between Allson, Sun Asia and Abundance. I see nothing unnatural or inappropriate in saying to a party to a contractthat is most closely associated with Hong Kong that he must litigate in the jurisdiction where he can sue only the other party tothe contract, if this is only what the Hong Kong law provides,.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Conclusion at This Stage</em></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> In my judgment, without considering the concurrent proceedings point, the factors indicate overwhelmingly that Abundance has institutedits proceedings in the most natural and appropriate jurisdiction. Without more, in my view, the Hawaiian court comes a very poorsecond. Certainly, Allson and Sun Asia have nowhere near demonstrated that Hawaii is clearly or distinctly the natural or appropriateforum to be favoured over Hong Kong. The only significant factor pointing to Hawaii is the presence within that jurisdiction of somelegal persona who are the directing hands of Abundance, but not parties to the agreement in dispute. That factor, in my opinion,does not begin to move the balance against the weight of all the other factors that favour Hong Kong as the natural forum.</p>    <p class="heading">The Foreign Proceedings and Multiplicity of Actions</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> I consider now the effect of the existence of foreign proceedings on the exercise of my discretion.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>Comparative State of Litigation</em></p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> Allson says the Hawaiian action is considerably more advanced than Action 19, and there can be doubt about this. Answers have beenfiled by Abundance, Sukarman Sukamto and SHC. A fair number court documents have been filed. Documentary discovery is well advanced.Oral discovery will commence with witness Howard Kam on 1 December 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> Abundance, on the other hand, points out that the pleadings have not been closed, and that one of the parties, Sumitro Sukamto, hasnot even been served.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> I do not attach much weight to this aspect of the matter. The state of the proceedings in Hawaii cannot make it clearly or distinctlythe natural or appropriate forum if it is not so. In any event, on Allson own arguments, if the factual issues are much the samein the two jurisdictions, most of the work will not need to be done twice; the Hong Kong proceedings will have the advantage of thework done in respect of the Hawaiian action.</p>    <p class="heading"><em>The Law</em></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> I set out below extracts from the authorities on this aspect of the matter -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In <em>The Abidin Daver</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 AC 398</a>, Lord Diplock said at 410A ". . . not only was [the foreign jurisdiction] the country with which the matter litigated had the closestconnections, but also the natural and appropriate forum from the point of view of convenience and expense has, from the outset, beenand still remains [the foreign court]. . . .

Clearly, the court must guard against giving this factor too much weight. If it were regardedas anything approaching decisive, it would not be the court that decides which is the most natural or appropriate forum, but thelitigant who commences the action in the foreign jurisdiction. This approach would lead to, and encourage, an unseemly rush for litigantsto commence proceedings in the jurisdiction of their choice so that they would have a strong argument to prevent the opposition fromlitigating in a jurisdiction the winners did not like. Put crudely, why should Allson have a decisive edge over Abundance becauseit commenced the Hawaiian action some three weeks before Abundance commenced Action 19? On the other hand, I make nothing of thefact that Allson itself commenced earlier proceedings in Hong Kong because the relief sought in those proceedings essentially concernsHong Kong. Nevertheless, Allson is not confined to proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction. It is entitled to counterclaim in theproceedings by Abundance, although, in those proceedings, and perhaps in other proceedings, it will be limited in its choice of theparties against whom it may seek relief, and may be limited in the type of relief available.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> It seems to me that the conclusion to be drawn from the authorities is that the fact that a litigant has commenced proceedings ina foreign jurisdiction cannot make, of itself, a natural or appropriate jurisdiction out of what is not a natural or appropriatejurisdiction, but what is a natural or appropriate jurisdiction may become one which is clearly or distinctly so because there arealready proceedings pending there. This factor may, I believe, tip the balance in favour of the foreign jurisdiction where otherconsiderations make the choice between the two jurisdictions otherwise a close one.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> The conclusion I reached earlier in this judgment that Hong Kong was overwhelmingly the natural or appropriate forum, and that, certainly,it had not shown to me that Hawaii is clearly or distinctly the natural or appropriate forum, cannot, in my view, be disturbed bythe existence of the Hawaiian action. The scale is not so balanced that the foreign proceedings make any appreciable difference tothe weight in favour of Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> Of course, I accept that it is undesirable that there should be two sets of proceedings, but, if Allson is right in believing thatit can obtain peculiar relief against legal persona in Hawaiian not available to it in Hong Kong, then the Hawaiian action is nota duplication of Action 19. Allson is not litigating to same ends in two different jurisdictions, and, if it successful, then, fromits point of view, the exercise will be worthwhile.</p>    <p class="heading">Personal or Juridical Advantage</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> This aspect only becomes relevant if the court has found that the foreign jurisdiction is the natural or appropriate forum, but thepersonal or juridical advantages of allowing the proceedings to continue in the home jurisdiction are such that substantial justicecannot be done if the party is confined to that foreign jurisdiction. This does not arise on my findings.</p>    <p class="heading">Overall View</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> For the avoidance of doubt, in case it should be thought that by examining the factors individually I have lost sight of the needto have regard overall to the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice, and to favour the jurisdiction in which the disputebetween the parties may be litigated with substantially less inconvenience or expense, I say that this is not the case. However imperfectly,I have tried to keep these ideas, and the authorities that state them, in my mind during my inquiry.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion on Action 19</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> Accordingly, I refuse the stay in this action.</p>    <p class="heading">Action 108</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="pseudopara" id="p78">78.</a> There remains the summons filed by Allson on 6 July 1994 to stay of its own proceedings in Action 108 on the ground of lis alibipendens.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> As I have said, this is an action designed to protect Allson's position under Chapter 49. Allson never had any intention of proceedingwith the action concurrently with the Hawaiian action, and made this quite clear to Abundance and the purchaser of the hotel by lettersat the time of the issuance of the writ. The idea is that these proceedings will lie dormant, incurring no expense or inconvenience,until the rights of the parties are settled. In a sense, Allson is seeking to hold onto some form of security in Hong Kong whileit litigates a dispute elsewhere. As I understand the authorities, the courts tolerate this, and I see no reason why I should notdo so.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="pseudopara" id="p80">80.</a> Quite different considerations arise here to those relevant to the summons in Action 19. It would indeed be strange if I were tofind in Action 19 that Hong Kong is the natural and appropriate forum, but here Allson is not entitled to invoke a remedy that isavailable only here.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="pseudopara" id="p81">81.</a> Accordingly, I grant the stay in this action.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="pseudopara" id="p82">82.</a> There seems no reason why Allson and Sun Asia should not pay the costs of the summons in Action 19, and I make an order <em>nisi</em> accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> In Action 108, Allson sought a discretionary order from the court, and should pay the costs of the summons itself. I have found,however, that the stay in this action should be granted. On the face of it, I think Abundance should pay the costs occasioned byopposing the stay, and I make an order <em>nisi</em> in those terms.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <div style="text-align:center">        <center>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="33%"></td>                    <td width="33%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="60%">J.K.
