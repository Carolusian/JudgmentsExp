They have diverted the business opportunities of Bowdex and its subsidiaries to their company the 4th defendantand its subsidiaries.  They acquired the 4th defendant on 18 February 2005.  They have excluded her from the management of Bowdex.

However,Bowdex in 2001 and 2002 had become a holding company of various subsidiaries in the mainland.  Its annual report for the year ended31 December 2003 stated its principal activities as letting properties, investment holding and trading of motor vehicles.

The legal representative was Wu Hui. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In about October 2005, another shareholder of Yuande, one Yang Shu Hui offered to sell 9% of Yuandeâs shares to Bowdex for whichBowdex had a pre-emption right.  The 2nd defendant purportedly acting for Bowdex caused Bowdex to forgo the pre-emption right andnot to take up the 9% shares. The 4th defendant then purchased five of the 9% shares and Li Wei Wei the remaining four.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In 2006, the net sales profit of Yuande was RMB3,209,279.55.  On 11 October 2006, one Haodebao Automotive Services Company Limited(âHaodebaoâ) was established.  The 4th defendant held 56% of the shares of Haodebao.  The total shareholding of the 4th and 8thdefendants in Yuande was also 56%. Haodebaoâs directors, legal representative, scope of business and retail shop premises werethe same as those of Yuande.  The net sales profit of Yuande went down to RMB494,384.10 in 2007.  Haodebao, however, achieved netshares profit at RMB1,877,176.88 in 2007.  In late 2007, Yuande advanced RMB2,637,634.25 to Haodebao, its apparent competitor, withoutany obvious reason.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In December 2008, the 1st to 3rd defendants caused Yuande to enter into liquidation.  On 13 August 2009, Yuande was removed fromthe Companies Registry in the mainland.  On 19 August 2009, Haodebao expanded its scope of business to include import and retailof BMW vehicles.

Its retail shop is the same as that of Ningde.

On 23 November 2009, the plaintiff received from Bowdex a notice of a board meetingto be held on 10 December 2009 to consider the intended liquidation of Ningde on the ground that Ningde had lost the BMW licencefrom the manufacturer.  But there was no explanation for the loss. There was also no mention of the filing of the memorandum of liquidationcommittee.</p>    <p>Hangde</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  At the time of the deceasedâs death, Bowdex owned 60% of Hangde.

The plaintiff then received a letter from the 2nd defendantpurportedly on behalf of Bowdex that advised the plaintiff that the board meeting would not be held as there was already a paperresolution by four members of the board approving the sale of the 60% shares of Hangde to Jin Chang.  The sale was completed pursuantto a contract dated 22 August 2009.  Jin Chang then owned 80% of the shares of Hangde and Shan Qing Guarng 20%.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The 4th defendant had also by a contract dated 22 August 2009 sold its 65% shares in Baohu to Jin Chang.

The 2nd defendant and Mao also vacated the board of Baohu on 1 September 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Jin Chang on the other hand sold its 35% shares in Baorong to Shanghai Fande on 27 September 2009.  Shanghai Fande was the jointventure partner of Bowdex in Huide and was in the control of the 1st to 3rd defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  After these shares transactions, Jin Chang became the 80% owner of Hangde and Bowdex ceased to have any interest in it. The 4thdefendant also relinquished its interest in Baohu to Jin Chang.  The 1st to 3rd defendants then obtained complete control of Baorongthrough the 4th defendant and Shanghai Fande.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The price of 60% of the shares of Hangde was supported by a valuation report dated 17 July 2009.  However, the plaintiff and hermainland lawyers pointed out that the valuation was made on the basis of the assets and liabilities without taking into account the60% shares being the controlling shares and the goodwill or future profits of Hangde.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Furthermore, before Hangde was divested from Bowdex, it had in 2007 jointly with Shanghai Fande provided a guarantee to one JieJiang Jin Hu Electronics Limited (âJie Jiang Jin Huâ) for RMB116,000,000.  Jie Jiang Jin Hu was a competitor of Hangde and therewas no obvious reason for the provision of the guarantee.  The amount of the joint guarantee was increased to RMB132,000,000 in 2008.</p>    <p class="heading">Huide</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  It was set up on 9 February 2002 as a joint venture of Bowdex and Shanghai Fande.  Its business was the provision of spare parts,repair and maintenance and technology consultation for vehicles.  Both Huide and Shanghai Fande operated in premises owned by Huide. Shanghai Fande had to pay rent to Huide for the joint use of the premises.  The directors of Huide were the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants,Tang Xiao Xiong and one Wu Yuan Shun.  The 2nd defendant was its legal representative since 11 March 2005.  In about December 2005,Shanghai Fande increased its scope of business to include the import and sale of BMW and mini vehicles.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In mid-June 2010, the plaintiff received a notice of a board meeting of Bowdex dated 7 June 2010 in which the directors were askedto consider passing a resolution to lease the factory and repair and operating assets of Huide to Fande for the reason that Huideas a â2Sâ shop was no longer competitive with â4Sâ shops.  It could also no longer carry out repair service from June 2010onwards as it could not obtain the relevant authorisation from BMW.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1st Defendantâs Opposition</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The 1st defendant made an affirmation on behalf of the 1st to 7th defendants to oppose the application.  She criticized the reportby the plaintiffâs accountant by saying that his reliance on turnover figures in commenting on the performance of a company wasmisleading as the bottom line of performance lies in net profit/loss after tax.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Regarding the business of Bowdex, she referred to a change of policy of the mainland government in the first quarter of 2005 whichallowed foreign carmakers to set up business in the mainland to sell their cars directly to mainland car dealers.  The BMW Grouptook advantage of the new policy and set up a wholly owned business in the mainland in around September 2005.  There was then noneed for Bowdex to issue letter of credit for the car dealers to the carmakers and its business came to a standstill. Its turnoveralso took a nosedive from 2005.  Since the policy change, there were also new companies springing up to provide sale of BMW carsand system service in addition to the repair and maintenance services and sale of spare parts for BMW cars.  She gave the names ofa number of such companies.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Regarding the 4th to 7th defendants, she said these defendants owed no duty to the plaintiff and she declined to comment on theplaintiffâs allegation that the 4th defendant was used to set up new companies to take over the business of Bowdexâs subsidiaries.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  She refused to explain why Bowdex had declined to purchase the 9% shares of Yuande from Yang Shu Hui and then liquidated Yuande. She said these related to the decisions of Bowdexâs board and none of the defendants was liable to account to the plaintiff forthe boardâs decisions of which the plaintiff was a member.  But she did not refute the plaintiffâs case of the plaintiffâsignorance about these matters. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  She, however, did say that the boardâs decisions were made in the light of the new policy of the mainland government that allowedcarmakers to set up business in the mainland.  Nevertheless, she did not say a word on why Haodebao could thrive and prosper underthe new policy but Yuande did not when both companies had the same management, scope of business and retail premises.  More importantlyshe did not say a word on why they had to set up Haodebao which was apparently to compete with Yuande.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  She referred to the loan of RMB2,637,634.25 advanced by Yuande to Haodebao in late 2007 and said that was the account payable byHaodebao to Yuande for purchase of some assets.  She did not disclose anything more about this on the same ground that it was thedecision of the board of Bowdex or Yuande and the defendants were not liable to account the same to the plaintiff.  She also saidthis account payable had been settled by 2008 and that Yuandeâs account had been audited after liquidation.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Regarding the loan of RMB23,441,538.78 by Ningde to Ningbao and the liquidation of Ningde in late 2009, she again refused to giveany explanation on the same ground that these were decisions of Bowdexâs board.  She did say that the loan was part of the accountpayable by Ningbao to Ningde for the purchase of its operating assets.  She also said the decision to liquidate Ningde was made inthe light of the new policy of the mainland government.  She also said Ningdeâs assets had been sold at book value before liquidation. It is thus clear that Ningde has also been liquidated.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Regarding the sale of the 60% shares of Hangde to Jin Chang, she again refused to give any explanation on the same ground that itwas a decision of Bowdexâs board.  She also referred to the valuation report and said that the sale was at market value.  I havealready referred to the plaintiffâs criticisms on this report above.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Finally, she said that Bowdexâs business including those of its subsidiaries had no significant business activities since 2009.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffâs Reply</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The plaintiffâs accountant, Mr Yiu made an affirmation to refute the 1st defendantâs criticism on his reliance on Bowdexâsturnover rather than the net profit/loss after tax.  He said turnover in this case should provide a more reliable and accurate indicatorof Bowdexâs performance and market trend.  It was derived from invoiced value of goods sold less discounts and returns.  It reflectedthe sales and hence the market size and demand potential the best.  He also said that the net profit/loss is subject to adjustmentand provision as a matter of accounting exercise and the result might be illusory.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  He also referred to an alleged reduction of HK$47,000,000 trade payables in 2006.  He said this sum was repayment to a shareholder,but the alleged shareholderâs loan and repayment were not substantiated.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The plaintiff also made a reply affirmation.  She referred to the report of her investigators in the mainland and said that the1st to 3rd defendants had diverted the business of Bowdex to the 4th defendant.  Bowdexâs turnover was reduced from HK$1,305,732,646.77in 2004 to HK$488,739,017.92 in 2005, but the 4th defendant replaced Bowdex in the sales to Nanjing Fande Automotives Sales CompanyLimited (âNanjing Fandeâ) and achieved sales of RMB75,253,023.50 in 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The plaintiff also challenged the decision of Bowdex, which she was precluded from taking part, to liquidate Yuande rather thanto upgrade it to a â4Sâ company and continue its business.  She said with Yuandeâs previous experience and status in providingmaintenance and repair service, it could have been upgraded and expanded to a â4Sâ company easily.  There was also no evidencefrom the defendants on why this could not be done.  She was therefore shocked to see Yuande being replaced by Haodebao.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  She made the same comment on why Ningde was not upgraded to a â4Sâ company.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  She also referred to what happened to Huide and said that the 1st to 3rd defendants wanted to destroy the business of Huide by expandingShanghai Fande at the expense of Huide.  She made the same comment on why Huide was not upgraded to a â4Sâ shop but ShanghaiFandi was upgraded and operated as such in Huideâs premises.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Finally, she also referred to two doubtful loans of RMB65,000,000 and RMB50,000,000 extended by Baode in Shanghai to Nanjing Fandeand Jie Jiang Jin Hu respectively.  She said these were competitors of Baode.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Summary of the plaintiffâs allegations</i></p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  She summed up her allegations by saying that the 1st to 7th defendants had a <i>modus operandi</i> to deplete the value of the estate.  That was obviously to benefit the 1st to 3rd defendants.  They used the 4th defendant to establishnew businesses to compete with the subsidiaries.  The new businesses were upgraded to â4Sâ businesses and expanded their scopeto include sale of BMW vehicles.  The new businesses were managed by similar personnel and operated in the same premises.  They thenclosed down the business of the subsidiaries. </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  On the evidence, the turnover of Bowdex was reduced from over HK$1,305 millions in 2004 to over HK$488 millions in 2005 and to justunder HK$2 million in 2006. Yuande and Ningde have been liquidated though the 1st defendant alleged that Ningdeâs assets had beensold per book value.  The Bowdexâs 60% interest in Hangde had been sold at a valuation that did not appear to have included thevalue of a controlling interest and goodwill of the business.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Huide is not in a position to do business because it has not been upgraded and has lost its authorisation from BMW.  The only thingknown about Baode is that it had extended some doubtful loans to its competitors and has no significant business activities since2009.  The subsidiaries had also been procured to provide financial assistance to their competitors as set up by the 1st to 3rd defendantsthrough the 4th defendant and others. </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The businesses set up by the deceased in Bowdex and its five subsidiaries have more or less come to an end in 2009 whilst the 1stand 3rd defendants are in one way or another continuing and upgrading similar businesses through companies that the estate has nointerest whatsoever.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Though some of the plaintiffâs allegations including those of her accountant, Mr Yiu were made in their affirmations in reply,they were filed on 26 July 2010 and the 1st to 7th defendants could have applied to respond to the new allegations, but they hadnot done so.</p>    <p class="heading">The Submissions and Discussions</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Mr Fung, leading counsel for the plaintiff reminded me the statement of Mason J made in <i>Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%2d1985%5d%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984-1985] 156 CLR 41</a> at 102 on the scope of the fiduciary duty:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[t]he categories of fiduciary relationships are infinitely varied and the duties of the fiduciary vary with the circumstances whichgenerate the relationship.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  I am also referred to <i>Peskin v Anderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20BCLC%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] BCLC 372</a> where Mummery J held at para. 34:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ Fiduciary relationships, such as agency, involve duties of trust, confidence and loyalty. Those duties are, in general, attractedby and attached to a person who undertakes, or who, depending on all the circumstances, is treated as having assumed, responsibilityto act on behalf of, or for the benefit of, another person. That other person may have entrusted or, depending on all the circumstances,may be treated as having entrusted, the care of his property, affairs, transactions or interest to him. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The plaintiffâs case initially as advanced in counselâs written submissions relied on certain misrepresentation as allegedlycontained in an agreement dated 24 May 2005 (â24 May Agreementâ) and a partition agreement (âthe Partition Agreementâ) bothmade between the plaintiff and the 1st to 3rd defendants.  The misrepresentations were to the effect that the 1st to 3rd defendantshad undertaken to âpromote and developâ the deceasedâs businesses including Bowdex and to update the plaintiff in respect ofthe estate.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The plaintiff further argued that the 1st to 3rd defendants are constructive trustees because they have exercised fraud on the plaintiffand they should hold the property acquired by such fraud on constructive trust.  The plaintiff also relied on the tort of deceitby reason of the alleged misrepresentation.  However, on the first day of hearing, these issues were given secondary importance. Mr Fung focused his attack on the 1st to 3rd defendants as intermeddlers of the estate and executors <i>de son tort</i>. <i>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate</i>, 19<sup>th</sup> &amp; 7th Ed., para. 17 states how a person can become an executor <i>de son tort</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTwo principles are involved in making a person accountable as an executor <i>de son tort</i>. The first (and most frequently emphasised) is that no one should be permitted, by refraining from taking out probate or administration,to obtain possession of the deceasedâs property free from his liabilities. The second is that where a person acts characteristicallyof an executor, and is not a complete stranger, the natural inference to be drawn is that he is named as executor in a will whichhe has not yet proved; and third parties should be able to rely on this inference.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Mr Fung also referred to paras. 61-02 and 61-03 of <i>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks</i> which discussed the appointment of a receiver to protect the estate of a deceased:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>Appointment pending grant of administration</b></p>        <p class="quote">61-02 The Chancery Division may, before probate or letters of administration have been granted, interfere on behalf of a creditoror beneficiary in case of need to protect the estate of the deceased by the appointment of a receiver or manager or both.</p>        <p class="quote"><b>Grounds for appointment</b></p>        <p class="quote">61-03 Where any misconduct, waste or improper disposition of assets by the representative was shown, the Chancery Division would instantlyinterfere and appoint a receiver, â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Mr Fung further submitted that this is not a company matter.  The 1st to 3rd defendants have been handling the estate matters. They have also been handling the assets of the estate especially Bowdexâs shares and subsidiaries.  It is just intermeddling whetherthe businesses were held by the deceased as a sole proprietorship before his death or by limited companies owned and controlled byhim.  Though the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants are directors of Bowdex and some of the subsidiaries, they are also beneficiaries ofthe estate.  The estate owns 99.8% of the shares of Bowdex. They have, in administering the affairs of Bowdex and the subsidiariesin these circumstances, taken possession of the estateâs property in Bowdex and the subsidiaries and had acted characteristicallyof an executor.  They have therefore intermeddled with the estate and are executors <i>de son tort</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Mr Wong, leading counsel for 1st to 7th defendants however submitted that the plaintiff has no proprietary right in the estate andthus has no ground to complain.  I am referred to para. 2-06 of <i>Snellâs Equity</i>, 31<sup>st</sup> edition:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAccordingly, the whole ownership is held to be vested in the personal representatives; and until an assent is made in respect ofany particular asset, the beneficiary prospectively entitled to it has no greater interest in it than what may perhaps be describedas a âfloating equityâ, which may or may not crystallise. In such cases equity protects the beneficiaries, not by giving themequitable interests, but by ensuring the due administration of assets by the personal representatives.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  However I do not think that that would mean that the beneficiary of an estate will have no redress if the personal representativeis guilty of breach of trust.  The court may appoint a receiver under its inherent jurisdiction as an interim measure pending theappointment of new trustee.  A receiver may also be appointed on the application of a beneficiary if the executor is of bad character(see <i>Lewin on Trusts</i>, 18<sup>th</sup> edn., paras. 38-28, 38-30 and 38-34).</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Mr Wong further submitted that the 1st to 3rd defendants had not intermeddled with the estate.  Their dealings with the businessof Bowdex and the subsidiaries were carried out by them as directors of these companies.  They dealt with the assets of the companies,not that of the estate.  A company should also not be equated with a sole proprietorship. A sole proprietorship has no independentlegal personality and is run by the owner who is exposed to an unlimited liability.  The company law and reflective loss principledo not apply to it.  However, a company is an independent legal person despite it may be wholly owned by one shareholder.  It isrun by a board of directors.  The shareholder is not exposed to the companiesâ liability.  I bear all these in mind.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  However, I am of the view that the obvious reason for the 1st to 3rd defendants to have been able to deplete Bowdex and divert itsbusiness and the businesses of its subsidiaries to their companies is not simply because they were directors of Bowdex and the subsidiaries. I do not think any shareholder of Bowdex who has not allied with them would have allowed them to do so.  They could have been soacted because they have usurped the estateâs rights and powers as Bowdexâs 99.8% shareholder.  They have taken possession ofthe rights and powers pertaining to these shares and have exercised such rights and powers purportedly as directors of the companies,but characteristically of executors of the estate.  On the evidence before me, I hold that they are intermeddlers and executors <i>de son tort</i>. </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Mr Wong further submitted with emphasis that the properties of a limited company belong to the company and not its shareholders. Whatever loss that had been suffered by Bowdex and/or the subsidiaries, they are the loss of these companies and are for these companiesto pursue, if need be.  The shareholderâs loss in the diminution in value of his shares or loss of dividend is a reflective lossof that of the company.  It is not open to the shareholder to recover such loss.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  As a matter of principle Mr Wong is correct. The properties of a limited company do not belong to its shareholders.  There are alsomany authorities saying that a shareholder cannot sue for reflective loss.  If he should be allowed to do so, he may recover at theexpense of the company, its creditors and other shareholders.  Alternatively, if both the shareholder and the company are allowedto sue for such loss, there will then be double recovery (see <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co. (a firm)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 1</a> at 61G to 63G and <i>Waddington Ltd v Chan Chun Hoo</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282008%29%2011%20HKCFAR%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2008) 11 HKCFAR 370</a> at paras. 81 to 88).</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  However, apart from not allowing the estate to claim against the 1st to 7th defendants for reflective loss, it does not mean thatthe law will provide no remedy to the estate or the plaintiff, being the only beneficiary who suffers from the acts and conduct ofthe 1st to 3rd defendants.  Though Bowdex has an independent legal personality, the court is alert to the reality that the estateand the plaintiff suffer from the depletion of Bowdex by the 1st to 3rd defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The plaintiff is only a director of Bowdex. Despite she had entered into the 24 May Agreement and the Partition Agreement with the1st to 3rd defendants under which she would be distributed $1,247,500 Bowdex shares, she cannot exercise any right as a holder ofsuch shares until they are registered in her name.  She is not yet a member of Bowdex (see <i>Yan Kwok Jin Julian v Yan Kwok Kee Gay</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%203%20HKC%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 3 HKC 237</a> at 240B-C).  She therefore has no right to bring a derivative action on behalf of Bowdex.  This is so whether it is under the commonlaw or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s168bc.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 168BC</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>.  Nor can she petition for relief under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s168a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 168A</a> of the Ordinance on the ground that the affairs of the Bowdex are conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to her as a member ofthe company.  She therefore cannot obtain any redress in the meantime.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In these circumstances, Mr Fung drew my attention to <i>Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd &amp; Ors v National Australia Bank Ltd &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%201%20ASCR%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 1 ASCR 445.</a>  Headnotes 1 and 2 of the report state:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(i) The appointment of a receiver, like any another equitable remedy, is to be had only where the remedies obtainable at law areinadequate to meet the ends of justice. The inadequacy of legal remedies is a condition for the proper exercise of equitable jurisdictionrather than the foundation of the jurisdiction itself.</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) There is no principle that a receiver may be appointed only on the application of a person who asserts some proprietary interestin the property concerned. What the applicant must show is that he has some legal or equitable right which will be protected or enforcedby the making of the order sought and that no other available remedy is adequate for that purpose.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Though the plaintiff is not a shareholder of Bowdex and cannot bring a derivative action for it, she no doubt has some rights andinterests in the estate that has been described as a floating equity in <i>Snell</i>.  The evidence also shows that her rights and interests need protection.  The appointment of a receiver appears to be the appropriateremedy at this stage (see also <i>Kerr &amp; Hunter on Receivers &amp; Administrators</i>, 18<sup>th</sup> edn., paras. 2-13 to 2-14).</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In answer to the argument of the 1st to 7th defendants that the loss of the estate is merely a reflective loss and there is thereforeno serious question to be tried, I disagree and hold that there is a serious question to be tried on whether the estateâs lossand hence the plaintiffâs loss, though reflective, still deserves protection by the appointment of a receiver.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Mr Wong further submits that there is no real danger of dissipation of assets as there is no impending real risk of dissipation. Nevertheless, judging from the glaring deeds done by the 1st to 3rd defendants on Bowdex and the subsidiaries, there is an obviousrisk that they may damage the estate further by depleting whatever that is still left in the estate.  There is not much known aboutthe remaining assets of Bowdex and in particular the subsidiaries.  There is also a sum of HK$47,000,000 shareholders loan that hasbeen queried by the plaintiffâs accountant, Mr Yiu.  Judging from their conduct, the 1st to 3rd defendants cannot be trusted withthe assets of the estate in particular the assets of Bowdex and its subsidiaries.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Mr Wong further submitted that on a balance of convenience, no receiver should be appointed as the plaintiffâs loss may be adequatelycompensated with damages.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  I do not accept this.  Though Yuande and Ningde have been liquidated and the interests in Hangde have been sold to Jin Chang, thereare still the businesses of Huide and Baode.  Huide has allegedly lost the authorisation of BMW, but it is still there.  There islittle known about Baode save that it had made some doubtful loans to its competitors.  There are also the assets of Yuande and Ningdeand the proceeds of sale of Hangde that should be protected.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr Fung for the plaintiff has also referred to <i>Wong Chung Ming Development Fund Co. Ltd v Profit Surplus Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%20HKLRD%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] HKLRD 514</a> at para. 21 where Li Pichon JA said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âMr Yuen submitted that any repair or renovation required would be quantifiable and therefore reducible into a monetary sum. Hisapproach was that so long as the loss can be quantified, it is compensatable in damages, such as would render damages an âadequateremedyâ. In my view, Mr Yuenâs approach does not reflect the principles laid down by Lord Diplock. It confuses the ability toassess damages at common law with the question whether such damages would be an âadequate remedyâ. The one does not follow fromthe other. While common law damages may be assessed for all kinds of loss, whether it constitutes an âadequate remedyâ is a differentquestion. The key consideration is whether an award of damages would adequately compensate the defendant. In <i>American Cyanamid</i> <i>Co v Ethicon Ltd</i>, the loss of a business opportunity (i.e. the chance of continuing to increase total market share in a particular pharmaceuticalproduct) was not a loss where an award of damages was considered adequate, although such a loss could be assessed at common law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Mr Wong also argued that the appointment of a receiver to the estate may cause irreparable loss to the defendants.  He referredto <i>Re Niceline Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20HKLRD%20726" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 HKLRD 726</a> at paras. 71 and 72 where Kwan J (as she then was) cited <i>Bond Brewing</i> at 456 to 457:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>71ï¼ I was asked to heed the words of caution in <i>Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd &amp; Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%201%20ACSR%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 1 ACSR 445</a> at p. 456 which are as follows:</p>        <p class="quote">âThe appointment of a receiver is one of the oldest remedies of the Court of Chancery, and a very useful remedy it is. But its veryefficacy means that a corresponding caution must attend its employment. â¦ The appointment of a receiver which is, so to speak,at the expense of the defendantâs possession and without his consent is a step never to be taken without proper consideration ofthe defendantâs position â¦ Where a receiver is sought, not merely of a particular asset of the defendant, but of all his assets,particular caution is required and where, as in the present case, the receiver is to possess himself of and to manage the assetsand undertaking of a collection of companies which, whether they are solvent or not, are in a very large way of business, very greatcircumspection is required. Of course in a strong enough case the court might, without warning to a trading company, divest it ofcontrol of its undertaking and assets. But it must always be borne in mind that the appointment of a receiver in such a case authorisesan irresistible invasion and that even if the army of occupation is withdrawn after only a short time things may never be the sameagain. Rights of property and the companyâs privacy are violated. â¦ And in addition to the legal consequences there was the commercialconsideration that, as <i>Picarda, Receivers and Managers</i> p. 4 has observed, the receiver is often seen not as the company doctor but as the undertaker, so that a blow is struck to the standingand credit of the defendants.â</p>        <p>72. I also note the <i>dicta</i> in <i>Jaber v Science &amp; Information Technology Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20BCLC%20764" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] BCLC 764</a> at p. 789H and <i>Re Mountforest Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20BCC%20565" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] BCC 565</a> at pp. 571E to 572A that it would be difficult for those in the outside world to distinguish between receivers appointed on groundsof insolvency and receivers appointed for other reasons and the inevitable slur which a receivership would cast on the assets ofa company and its business, and that these are factors which would weigh with the court against appointing receivers.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  However, judging from what the 1st to 3rd defendants have done to Bowdex and the subsidiaries on the purported ground of the newpolicy of the mainland government, if there is no intervention by a receiver, it is likely that Bowdex and the remaining subsidiarieswill go out of all their businesses soon.  The 1st defendant has in fact said that Bowdex and the subsidiaries have no significantbusiness activities since 2009.  Mr Wong has also said in the written submissions that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[t]here is no dispute that business of Bowdex (and its subsidiaries) had been closed down and its turnover dropped as a result.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  I am fully alerted to the risks and warnings about the appointment of a receiver.  But in these circumstances, I do not think the1st to 7th defendants can say that there is much that can be harmed by the appointment of a receiver.  I would rather think thata receiver should be appointed to save whatever that remains and to protect the estate from further depletion.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Finally, Mr Wong submitted that there is no evidence of the plaintiffâs ability to meet her undertaking as to damages.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The schedule of property issued by the Estate Duty Office of the Inland Revenue Department and dated 12 June 2007 stated the netprincipal value of the estate at $95,656,492.  The plaintiff is entitled to Â¼ of this when the estate is duly administered lessthe 15% estate duty payable.  No reason has been suggested that the plaintiffâs entitlement will be reduced.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Mr Wong does not accept this entitlement as sufficient evidence of the plaintiffâs ability to meet her undertaking.  His groundis that the plaintiff currently has no proprietary interest in the assets of the estate.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  I would take a realistic approach.  I take the view that the plaintiffâs entitlement to the estate is sufficient to back up herundertaking as to damages.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  There are also some arguments about who should be appointed as the interim receivers.  The plaintiff has proposed two accountantsfor appointment.  The 1st to 7th defendants have proposed other candidates.  The plaintiff alleged conflict of interests in the defendantsâcandidates.  The 1st to 7th defendants asked for time to resolve this question if I should decide to make the appointment.  Theyhowever have not questioned the suitability of the plaintiffâs candidates.  In order to save time and costs, I will not adjournthe matter to resolve the alleged conflict of interest.  I accept the plaintiffâs candidates for appointment.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In the premises, I accept the plaintiffâs application.
