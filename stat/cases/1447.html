Mr Lin was the sole authorized signatory on DEX'sAccount, but he had resigned as a director on 29 September 2006 with immediate effect, and DEX contends his authority to sign onDEX's behalf had also been withdrawn. However, formal amendments to the bank mandate had not been completed by 9 October 2006 whenhe gave the disputed instruction.  The US$3,250,000 was paid initially to another account with DBS in the name of BBMF, the 1<sup>st</sup> third party.  On 20 October 2006, that sum was paid out by DBS to a BBMF account with HSBC.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In the Main Action, DEX claims against DBS for repayment of the US$3.25 million on several main bases.  First, the disputed instructionwas not valid and authorized, particularly in the absence of DEX's chop.  Second, the payment was made in breach of contract andmandate in that DBS knew that Mr Lin's authority had been withdrawn, and as a result knew he was not authorized to give the instruction,or must have been put on enquiry as would cause an ordinary prudent bank to make enquiries on whether the instruction in fact representedDEX's true intentions.  Third, DBS held the sum of US$3.25 million in the BBMF account (which was in credit) as constructive trusteefor DEX, and DBS ought not to have allowed that money to be paid out to HSBC.</p>    <p>                   The pleaded claims for breach of fiduciary duty (apart from constructive trustee) and for dishonest assistanceand knowing receipt were not pursued.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  DBS relies on several main points.  First, the strict terms of the mandate.  When the disputed instruction was given, Mr Lin wasthe sole authorized signatory for DEX's account, and the Bank was entitled and indeed obliged, to act upon his instruction.  At thattime, DEX had a mere <i>intention</i> to change the account signatories, but this was not completed.  Second, DEX received a âpractical benefitâ from the transferof the US$3.25 million to BBMF, which precludes DEX from claiming against the Bank because the transfer was to repay a loan in thesum of US$3.25 million clearly due and owing by DEX to BBMF.  Third, DEX's loss was caused by its own conduct because it should reasonablyhave applied for an injunction against BBMF, to prevent the Bank from paying the money to BBMF, or from following BBMF's subsequentinstruction to pay the money out of BBMF's DBS account into the HSBC account.  Fourth, DBS is not liable under any trust, or as constructivetrustee.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  DEX initially sued both Mr Lin and DBS, but subsequently discontinued against Mr Lin, who was said to reside overseas.  However,the Bank issued a contribution notice against Mr Lin, and hence he remains party to the proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Bank also issued third party notices against BBMF, and its directors Messrs Lian and Ip.  Those proceedings were heard concurrentlywith the Main Action, but there is a distinction between the 2 sets of proceedings.  There is no direct <i>lis</i> between DEX and BBMF, i.e. there are no fourth party proceedings brought by BBMF against DEX.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The overlap between the proceedings relates to DBS' defence that DEX obtained a âpractical benefitâ by the payment of the US$3.25million to BBMF, as this was repayment of a loan in that sum by BBMF.</p>    <p class="heading">The Third Party proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  As stated earlier, DEX's parent company is DEXJ which wholly owns DEX, and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  DEX's primarypurpose was to give effect to a joint venture agreement (âJVAâ) between the BBMF group of companies and DEXJ, to exploit theâmobile contentâ business (i.e. the business of providing content such as music, data, photos, services etc., to mobile telephones). DEX was to facilitate this business primarily by acquisition of other companies operating in that business.  The JVA was apparentlyconcluded in November 2005, in the Japanese language, and subject to Japanese law.  I have not seen a copy of the JVA, or any translationof it.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  As appears from DEXJ's Press Release dated 7 March 2006 concerning âIssuing of new shares and share warrants through third partyallocationâ to facilitate the joint venture, BBMF through an associated company SCD Swiss Content and Design Holding Gmbh (âSCDâ)took a 9.9% shareholding in DEXJ and further Share Warrants which when exercised, would result in funds being available to DEX tofund its acquisition of businesses.  In return for the provision of those funds, BBMF would be issued further shares under the ShareWarrants, such that ultimately BBMF would own up to 49.9% of DEXJ's equity.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  At the time of the joint venture, Mr Lin was a BBMF employee, although he describes himself as an independent contractor.  He isa cousin of Mr Lian.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  DEX's opened its bank account with DBS on about 7 June 2006.  By Mandate dated 17 June 2006, Mr Lin became the sole signatory onthe bank account.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  DEX made several acquisitions in China, and by about June 2006, further funds were apparently required to continue this businessdevelopment.  For instance, DEXJ's email of 16 June 2006 to Mr Lin and Mr Lian stated :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ will you consider BBMF to provide DEX with a bridge loan, USD3.28 million, until the warrant is exercised or other financeis materializedâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p>DEX says that BBMF realized around this time that if it exercised its share warrants, it would hold more than 10% of DEXJ's equityand would therefore be obliged to disclose that fact to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  DEX says that BBMF did not want this, and to fundcontinued activities, BBMF advanced US$3,250,000 to DEX as a loan.  However, DEX says that such advance was in fact, part of BBMF'songoing obligations under the JVA.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Despite the JVA between DEXJ and the BBMF Group as to investment by BBMF, BBMF was slow to invest.  Mr Lin says this was due tochanging investment conditions on the Tokyo Stock markets, and BBMF preferred not to make the investments they were meant to make,but decided to wait and see until stock prices stabilized.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Both Mr Lin and BBMF maintain the US$3.25 million loan was a short term bridging or emergency loan because DEXJ was unable to raisefunds in the financial markets to fund the acquisitions which DEX wished to make.  There is no dispute about the <i>form</i> of the loan, in a Loan Agreement dated 30 June 2006, and advanced on 2 July 2006.  However, there is a dispute between DEX and BBMFas to its <i>substance</i>.  That dispute will have to be resolved between BBMF and DEX.  It will depend among other things, on the nature and terms of theJVA, and the way in which that Joint Venture was operated.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It is clear the joint venture between the BBMF Group and DEXJ did not go well.  Relationships between the 2 parties were strainedearly on, due to lack of communication, and as a result of BBMF's delayed investment.  Relations deteriorated substantially in August2006.  On about 11 August 2006, DEXJ terminated the JVA, as stated in a Press Release that day.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  As a result, Mr Lin emailed DBS' Mr Sung on 24 August 2006, and informed him that he had stepped down as President and directorof DEXJ, and wanted to have the signatory of the DBS bank account changed over to the new President, Mr Masaki Ishibe.  Mr Lin askedMr Sung how this should be done, and asked for it to be executed â<i>as soon as possible</i>â.  In a further email dated 29 August 2006, copied to DEXJ's Mr Moriya, Mr Lin informed Mr Sung that the new contact person forthe changes would be Mr Moriya.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  By email dated 29 August 2006, Mr Moriya informed Mr Sung that âfrom now on, I will be in charge of banking activities with regardsto [DEX's] accountâ; the authorized signatory of the bank account would be changed from Mr Lin to Messrs Moriya, Ishibe, and MrKiyoto Omori (âMr Omoriâ); that they hoped to visit the Bank âas early as next weekâ to make these changes; and further requestedthe ânecessary documents to register our signatures as authorized signaturesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In the 1 month period between 29 August 2006 to late September 2006, there were further emails between Mr Sung, and Mr Moriya andother representatives of DEX and/or DEXJ.  DEX contends it is clear from such emails that : (1) DEX wished to change the signatoryof the bank account with DBS, (2) Mr Lin no longer had authority to represent DEX's true intentions, and (3) Mr Lin would step downas DEX's sole director, to be replaced by at least Mr Ishibe, if not also Messrs Moriya and Omori.  Nonetheless, DBS reminded DEXby email that on its records, Mr Lin was the sole authorized signatory, and that DEX may wish to update this as soon as possible. I refer to Messrs Tang's and Sung's emails of 12 and 13 September 2006 respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Meanwhile, a dispute was developing between DEXJ and BBMF concerning the US$3.25 million advanced.  On 29 September 2006, DEXJ'sMr Ishibe write to BBMF's Mr Lian :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ we are currently undertaking negotiations to terminate the agreement in place for the transfer of shares.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Accordingly, we are considering <i>filing a claim against you for compensation of monies already paid by the Design Exchange Group â¦ As it is possible that creditobligations will arise</i> between you and Design Exchange and/or the Design Exchange Group, payment of the monies borrowed by [DEX] and any compounding interest<i>will be withheld</i>â [Emphasis added]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Messrs Moriya, Ishibe, and Omori visited Hong Kong from Japan to attend a meeting at DBS on 28 September 2006, and to change DEX'sbank account signatory.  They met with DBS' Messrs Chan and Woo.  It is common ground the purpose of the meeting was to deal withthe change of signatories for DEX's bank account.  The Bank required certain formal documents to be completed.  The Japanese gentlemendid not have that documentation, and so the following day went to see Ms Lo of EC Com Corporate Services Limited (âECCâ), thecompany that organized DEX's corporate formalities.  She was contacted by DBS via telephone on 29 September 2006, and asked whatwas necessary to effect the change in director and signatory of DEX.  She advised that she would need : (1) a resignation letterfrom Mr Lin as sole director, and (2) a replacement director.  Mr Lin's resignation letter, and the written resolution that Mr Linwas replaced by Mr Ishibe as director with immediate effect, were both handwritten by Mr Lin, dated 29 September 2006, and signedby him (collectively âthe 2 handwritten documentsâ).  These 2 documents were faxed to her office on 29 September 2006 (at around12:50 p.m.).  She handed a copy of these documents to Mr Moriya and Mr Ishibe when they went to her office that day.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Later on 29 September 2006 after lunch, there was a further meeting between Messrs Moriya and Ishibe, and DBS.  There is a factualdispute about what happened at this meeting.  DEX says the 2 handwritten documents dated 29 September 2006 and signed by Mr Lin whichthey were given by Ms Lo, were handed to DBS.  However, DBS' witnesses say these 2 documents were never received, although it wasinterested to see the resolution of change of directors, but not Mr Lin's resignation letter.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  It is not disputed :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     the purpose of the visit to the Bank by Messrs Moriya, Ishibe, and Omori was to change and update the authorized signatoryof DEX's bank account.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     DBS was informed at the meeting on 28 September 2006 that Mr Lin has resigned, and that Mr Ishibe had replaced him.  However,the corporate documents had not been updated to reflect this.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     At the first meeting (on 28 September 2006), Mr Chan assisted Messrs Moriya, Ishibe, and Omori to complete and sign 2 documents,namely : (a) a new Mandate for Limited Company and (b) Change of Specimen Signature/Company Chop.  The first document was left undated,but the 2<sup>nd</sup> document referred to a Board meeting that day.  Both documents were in the form of a board resolution of the company.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr Chan says he informed Messrs Moriya, Ishibe, and Omori that the changes would only become effective on receipt of 3 corporatedocuments : (1) a certified register of members list, (2) a certified register of officers list, and (3) a registered certificateof incumbency (collectively âthe 3 requested documentsâ).</p>    <p>In his witness statement, he says he told them the changes would ânot be effective and would have no legal effect at all unlessand until all the requisite corporate documents of [DEX] are provided to [DBS].â</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The 3 requested documents were provided to DBS on 12 October 2006, by fax and courier.  Upon receipt, the long requested changeswere officially effected by DBS, such that Messrs Moriya, Ishibe, and Omori became the authorized signatories of DEX's account thatday.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  However, 3 days earlier on 9 October 2006, following BBMF's Elaine Kwok (âMs Kwokâ) demand letter of 6 October demanding repaymentof the US$3.25 million and all accrued interest by 9 October 2006, Mr Lin gave DBS the disputed instruction by fax to transfer UD$3,250,000from DEX's account to BBMF's account, also with DBS.  The transfer was effected the same day.  The instruction did not bear DEX'scompany chop, and states it was to repay a loan.  The transfer coincided with a National Holiday in Japan.</p>    <p>It is not disputed DBS did not make enquiries with anyone before making the US$3.25 million transfer, whether with Mr Lin, any ofthe 3 Japanese gentlemen above, with the Relationship Manager Ms Sung, or ECC's Ms Lo as to : (1) whether Mr Lin was still authorizedto give the instructions notwithstanding the emails, documents, and meetings referred to above, and (2) the absence of DEX's companychop, although appearing in its Mandate.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On 10 October 2006, Mr Moriya contacted DBS and stated that Mr Lin's transfer instruction was made without DEX's authority.  Afterreceiving this complaint, DBS froze the funds in BBMF's account.  DEX maintains it was unaware that the monies were in BBMF's accountwith DBS until 17 October 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  On 13 October 2006, Mr Sung emailed BBMF's solicitors, and said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ in view of these conflicting intentions, as a prudent bank we had no choice but to hold the funds, until we are able to ascertainour obligations in respect of the payment instructions received on 9 October 2006.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  On 17 October 2006, DBS' Mr Sung wrote to DEX stating that the Mandate of 17 June 2006 and the TT instruction were both valid, andinforming it that as there were competing claims to the monies by DEX and BBMF, DBS would have to consider interpleader proceedingsto protect the bank's interest.  DBS was informed the following day by DEX's solicitors' email that this course of action was appropriate. And that DEX regarded DBS as a constructive trustee, under a duty to safeguard the monies.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Various correspondence followed between DEX and the Bank, culminating in a âvery urgentâ letter from the Bank's solicitors dated20 October 2006 (faxed around 9:38 a.m.) informing DEX's solicitors' that if DEX did not obtain an injunction by 3 p.m. that dayagainst BBMF, that the Bank would release the funds to BBMF.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  On 20 October 2006 (but unknown to DEX until afterwards) BBMF applied <i>ex parte</i> for an injunction at a hearing at 2:30 p.m. that day before the Hon Hartmann J in HCA 2348 of 2006 (âthe 1<sup>st</sup> Actionâ or âthe Injunction Proceedingsâ) for an injunction ordering DBS to unfreeze the funds in BBMF's account.  Mr Lian'ssupporting Affirmation that day stated (at para. 23) that the US$3.25 million as loan repayment, would be used for the operationalcash needs of BBMF Group Inc, and âthere would be irreparable damage if monies are frozen by the intended Defendant.â</p>    <p>DBS did not contest the injunction application nor attend the hearing, apparently due to insufficient notice, the fact the applicationwas <i>ex parte</i>, and that they had not received any documents filed for that application.  By letter that day, DBS' solicitors informed BBMF's solicitorsthat DBS had received an âadverse claimâ by DEX, and attached correspondence with DEX's solicitors.  It appears DBS releasedthe funds to BBMF just after 3:00 p.m. that day, before the Court order later that afternoon.  The money was transferred that dayto BBMF's account with HSBC.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  On 24 October 2006, DBS's solicitors wrote to DEX's solicitors stating :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ our client has <i>no legal right and basis</i> and/or under <i>no legal obligation</i>, to withhold the release of the money standing in the credit of the recipient's bank account.â [Emphasis added]</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">III.     The Parties'</i> Contentions</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The parties contended as follows.</p>    <p class="heading">DEX's contentions</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  DEX had 3 main points :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     DBS had no authority to pay the sum of US$3.25 million from DEX's account because :</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)      There was <i>no</i> valid contract between DEX and the Bank concerning remote instructions;</p>            <p>(b)     In any event, the disputed instruction was invalid as the Mandate required the signature of one authorized signatory togetherwith the company's chop, but the Instruction had no chop; and</p>            <p>(c)     In any event, in all the circumstances, DBS had actual knowledge that Mr Lin had no authority to operate DEX's account (irrespectiveof the terms of the Mandate), since 29 September 2006 at the latest.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(2)     If there was no actual want of authority, in the circumstances, no reasonably prudent banker would have acted on the instructiongiven the circumstances.  Even if the Bank did not know that Mr Lin no longer had actual authority to represent DEX's intentionsin banking transactions, DBS knew enough to put a reasonably prudent banker on inquiry that any instruction from Mr Lin did not infact represent DEX's true intentions.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     Alternatively, irrespective of the position on 9 October 2006, by 10 October 2006, the Bank was put on inquiry.  DBS was informedthere was a dispute as to Mr Lin's authority and DBS froze the fundâas any prudent banker would have done.  DBS became a constructivetrustee for the rightful owner.  Upon investigation, by 13 October 2006 DBS became fully aware of all the facts, and ought to havepassed the US$3.25 million to DEX, as it was or ought to have been clear by then that DEX was the rightful owner.  DBS should atleast have interpleaded, but chose to do nothing and ultimately before any court order, released the funds to the wrongful owner.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  There is also an issue between DEX and BBMF whether the US$3.25 million received by DEX from BBMF was a loan, or a capital contribution. DEX contended the former, and maintained it received no practical benefit by DBS paying that sum to BBMF as such payment was neitherauthorized nor ratified and DEX received no benefit, but a detriment by that payment.</p>    <p class="heading">DBS' contentions</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  DBS made the following contentions in essence :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     DEX owed a sum of US$3.25 million to BBMF.  By 9 October 2006, despite the fact the Japanese management of DEX might havewanted to withhold payment, that sum was clearly due and payable by DEX to BBMF.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     Despite the fact that prior to 9 October 2006, the Japanese representatives of DEX had indicated an intention to change theauthorized signatory of DEX's account at DBS, that process had not been completed by 9 October 2006.  Even DEX's Japanese representativesknew that it had not been completed by that date.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     On the true construction of the Mandate and the other contractual documents between DEX and DBS, DBS was entitled to act onthe instructions given by Lin on 9 October 2006, and transfer the US$3.25 million from DEX's account to BBMF's account.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     Also, since DBS was entitled to act on Lin's instructions to effect the transfer on 9 October 2006, DBS was also entitledto transfer US$3.25 million from the BBMF Account to BBMF's HSBC Account on 20 October 2006.  No constructive trust arises.  Norshould DBS be required to account as trustee.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     If for whatever reason, DBS is entitled to claim against BBMF, then it should not be liable to DEX because DEX will have acquireda practical benefit in not having to repay a valid and subsisting loan to BBMF, and hence DEX should not recover against DBS.</p>        <p>(6)     If which is denied, DBS is liable to DEX, then :</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)      DBS is entitled to recover the US$3.25 million against BBMF as the payment of 9 October 2006 and/or 20 October 2006 to BBMFwould be a payment under mistake.</p>            <p>(b)     Also, DBS is entitled to recover against BBMF and Ip on the contractual documents executed by these parties.</p>            <p>(c)     Further, DBS is entitled to recover against Lin for breach of warranty of authority or the contractual documents executedby Lin.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">BBMF's and Mr Ip's contentions</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  BBMF contended :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The payment from DEX's bank account of US$3.25 million was not made under any mistake of law or fact.  Any misprediction ordeliberate risk taken by DBS was not a mistake;</p>        <p>(2)     BBMF is not liable to DBS under the contractual documents; and</p>        <p>(3)     DBS is precluded from claiming against BBMF by virtue of an alleged discontinuance undertaking given in the 1<sup>st</sup> Action.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Mr Ip took similar points to BBMF :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     DBS is precluded from claiming against him by virtue of an alleged discontinuance undertaking given in the 1<sup>st</sup> Action.</p>        <p>(2)    DBS is not entitled to compensation nor an indemnity from Mr Ip pursuant to clause (b) of the letter of undertaking dated 16September 2005.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">IV.

In the formercase, the question is whether a bank is aware of the <i>possibility</i> of the mandate being revoked : <i>Sierra Leone Telecommunications Co. Ltd v.

In the case of a bank,the relevant circumstances include those identified in <i>Barclays Bank v. Quincecare Ltd</i>, <i>per</i> Steyn J (at 377aâb) :</p>        <p class="quote">âEverything will no doubt depend on the particular facts of each case.  Factors such as the standing of the corporate customer,the <i>bank's knowledge of the signatory</i>, the <i>amount involved</i>, the need for a prompt transfer, the <i>presence of unusual feature</i>s, and the <i>scope and means for making reasonable inquiries may</i> be relevant.â [Emphasis added]</p>        <p>(2)     At the same time, caution must be exercised concerning statements in the authorities on relevant factors in deciding whethera bank fails to exercise reasonable care.  This depends on the facts of the particular case on what would put a bank on enquiry,and are not principles of law.  In the well-known English Court of Appeal decision in <i>Lipkin Gorman v. Karpnale</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20WLR%201340" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 WLR 1340</a>, Parker LJ said (at 1376BâC) :</p>        <p class="quote">âIn my view such cases must be approached with caution, for essentially they are <i>no more than decisions of fact</i>, i.e. of the application of the law to an endless variety of circumstances.  Expressions in them, such as that a paying bank mustpay under its mandate save in extreme cases, or that a bank is not obliged to act as an amateur detective, or that suspicion is notenough to justify failing to pay according to the mandate, or other like observation which are to be found in the cases, are no <i>more than comments on particular facts</i> or situations and embody in my view <i>no principles of law</i>.  Furthermore what would or might have been held to be a breach of duty at one time may not be a breach of duty at another.â [Emphasisadded]</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">When a bank is entitled not to comply with a customer's instruction</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Depending on the particular circumstances, a bank may be justified in not complying with its customer's instructions if the bank:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)     Has notice of any fraud <i>or</i> irregularity : <i>Lipkin Gorman v.

On the otherhand, to impose liability whenever speculation might suggest dishonesty would impose wholly impractical standards on bankers.  Inmy judgment the sensible compromise, which strikes a fair balance between competing considerations, is simply to say that a bankermust refrain from executing an order if and for as long as the banker is âput on inquiry' in the sense that he has <i>reasonable grounds (although not necessarily proof)</i> for believing that the order is an attempt to misappropriate the funds of the companyâ [Emphasis added]</p>        <p class="quote">(3)     Is put on enquiry that the customer <i>might</i> be defrauded (or of an irregularity, or improper and extraneous purpose) : <i>Lipkin Gorman v.

That, at least, the customer must establish.  If it is established, then in my view a reasonable banker would be in <i>breach of duty if he continued to pay cheques without inquiry</i>.â [Emphasis added]</p>        <p class="quote">(4)     As an honest and reasonable banker, would be put on enquiry, until it receives answers to enquiries that would satisfy anhonest and reasonable banker : <i>Baden Delvaux and Lecuit v.

But in that case no answer wasgiven to the inquiry and unless information is received from another source which dispenses with the need to persist in the inquiry,the <i>duty to refuse to comply with the customer's instructions continues to subsist</i> just as the <i>duty of inquiry subsists</i>.  In the circumstances of the present case Mr Price submits that none of the inquiries which he says ought to have been made couldhave satisfied the honest and reasonable banker.</p>        <p class="quote">In my judgment therefore a bank when put on inquiry remains under a duty not to comply with its customer's instructions either ifit acquires knowledge of the intended misapplication of moneys which it holds or <i>whilst it is pursuing its inquiries</i>.  It ceases to be under such duty when it receives information, whether in answer to its inquiries or from another source, that the<i>honest and reasonable banker would accept without further inquiry</i>.â [Emphasis added]</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Hence, situations where a bank may be put on enquiry are not limited to situations when it is put on enquiry of possible fraud ormisappropriation by a signatory.  There may be situations for instance, when a bank is put on enquiry, i.e. has reasonable groundsfor belief (although not necessarily proof) that a particular transaction may be irregular, unauthorized, or for a private purposeas opposed to the customer's best interests.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  If an honest and reasonable banker would be put on enquiry, but the bank does <i>not</i> make enquiries, then it would be negligent : <i>Lipkin Gorman</i> (above) (C.A.)

The bank argued it was entitled to debitthe plaintiff's account for the amount of this payment because the payment had partially discharged the claimant's debt.  The courtrejected this argument and Pill LJ stated (at 923Gâ924G) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn the absence of evidence that the bank's payment has been made on the customer's behalf or subsequently ratified by him, thepayment to the creditor will not of itself discharge the company's liability to the creditor â¦ In the <i>absence of authorization or ratification</i> of the payment, the bank must <i>in my judgment meet this claim and recoup the sum paid, if they can, from the third party</i> to which it was paid.â [Emphasis added]</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Applying the principlesâMain Action</p>    <p class="heading">(a)     Issues A.1, 2, 3âwhether breach of mandate; breach of implied terms or negligence; whether strict construction given toMandate</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Having considered all the documentary and other evidence and counsel's submissions, in my judgment DBS acted outside its mandatein transferring the sum of US$3.25 million on 9 October 2006 to BBMF, for any or all of the 3 main reasons relied upon by DEX's counsel:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     DEX's Remote Channel Authority was not authorized by any board resolution and meeting.  Nor did that document have DEX's companychopâin spite of the chop appearing in DEX's Mandate, and Customer Information Sheet.</p>        <p>(2)     In any event, the disputed instruction of 9 October 2006 did not have DEX's chopâin spite of the Mandate, and Clause 6 ofthe Standard Terms referred to above (para. 51(1) above).</p>        <p>(3)     I also consider that by 29 September 2006, the date of Mr Lin's formal written resignation letter, and as a result of the3 meetings with the 3 Japanese gentlemen on 28 and 29 September 2006, DBS had actual knowledge that Mr Lin did not have authorityto operate DEX's bank account.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  As to the absence of the chop in (1) and (2) above, having considered DBS's Standard terms, and DEX's Mandate, a chop was not merelyoptional, but was part of the Mandate :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)      It is well known that certainty is of great importance in commercial agreements.  Here, if a chop was merely optional, thesituation would be unclear and uncertainâwhich would not be consistent with certainty in this commercial agreement.  There is nothingin any of the contractual documents to show that the presence of a chop was merely optional in DEX's Mandate.</p>        <p>(b)     As Mr Manzoni rightly submitted, a chop was necessary because as appears from Clause 32 of the Standard Terms (para. 51(4)above), if it was lost or stolen, the âcustomer <i>shall</i> <i>immediately</i> notify the Bank in writingâ.  If a chop was optional in the Mandate, it is unclear why the bank would require notification, letalone immediately, and in writing.</p>        <p>(c)     Moreover, the Mandate certifies that DEX's chop was âcorrect and genuineâ.  Again, if a chop was merely optional, suchcertification would be superfluous.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Although the Standard Terms (at clause G1) refer to fax instructions from a customer with a signature, without expressly referringto a chop, such terms must be read with DBS' contractual documents as a whole.  These include the Mandate here for a limited company,with a chop next to the signing instruction.</p>    <p>                   At the very least, the absence of a chop on the 9 October 2006 instruction should have put DBS on enquiry.  Indeed,on the evidence, Ms Wat <i>was</i> put on enquiry by the absence of a chop, but one of her superiorsâMr Chung Wai Sing (âMr Chungâ) authorized payment withoutmaking any enquiries concerning the absence of a chop.  Regrettably, the bank's staff appear to have considered the question of paymentas more of a mechanical transaction without taking proper care to make enquires (e.g. with the Relationship Manager, Mr Sung), orto apply their minds to the significance of the absence of the chop.  Not surprisingly, on the evidence, DEX's chop was in fact lockedin DEXJ's safe in Japan.  DBS staff may have thought the transaction was authorized as it was âconfirmed by Ms Kwok (DEX Asia)âas recorded by hand on the disputed instruction.  However, Ms Kwok was neither an authorized signatory, nor DEX's personnel.  DEX'schop was part of the Mandate to provide : (a) protection to DEX, and (b) certainty to both parties.  DBS was not entitled to unilaterallyoverride the requirement of a chop.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In my judgment, DBS also had actual knowledge by 29 September 2006, well before the date of the disputed instruction on 9 October2006, that Mr Lin was no longer authorized as a signatory to DEX's bank account.  At the very least, DBS was aware of the <i>possibility</i> the Mandate had been revoked by those dates :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     Mr Sung was informed by Mr Lin of his resignation as a director by email of 24 August 2006, and knew that Mr Ishibe was tobecome the signatory, which Mr Lin wanted done âas soon as possibleâ.</p>        <p>(2)     Mr Sung was also informed by Mr Lin's email of 24 August 2006 that Mr Moriya would represent the company in all banking transactionsfrom that date.</p>        <p>(3)     On 30 August 2006 by email, Mr Sung confirmed with DEX that Mr Lin had left.</p>        <p>(4)     DEX had tried to remit US$248,000 out of the Account, but when it was pointed out that Mr Lin was the only signatory, theywithdraw the request and said that it would be done out of the DEXJ account.</p>        <p>(5)     The Japanese gentlemen travelled from Japan to Hong Kong for the purpose of changing the signatories on the account.  Mr Sunghad told them by email of 13 September 2006 that because Mr Lin had resigned, they may wish to change the signatories as soon aspossible.</p>        <p>(6)     Mr Sung told them by email of 14 September 2006, that : (a) âIn your case Mr Lin has resigned and a new signor will replacehis designationâ, and (b) the â<i>formality</i> to arrange the update of the account signatory had to be completed <i>before</i> a new transaction takes placeâ [my emphasis].  This would suggest that DBS knew a change of signatories was in process, and wouldrequire the change to be completed <i>before</i> any payment was processed on the accountârather than afterwards.</p>        <p>(7)     By Mr Sung's email of 26 September 2006, it is clear he knew the purpose of the meeting on 28 September 2006, and told theJapanese gentlemen what they needed to bring to effect the change.</p>        <p>(8)     At the 3 meetings on 28 and 29 September 2006, DBS was told again that Mr Lin had resigned, and that the new directors wantedto change the signatories. They even signed a resolution on 28 September 2006 at their first meeting, to update the Mandate.  Theupdated Change of Specimen Signature form was also signed in full (para. 32(3) above).</p>        <p>(9)     Mr Chan confirmed in evidence that as far as he was concerned, DEX had a new mandate as at 28 September 2006.  He knew DEXhad changed its authorized signatory as at that date.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The argument on the updated Mandate and specimen signature also involves a consideration of whether DBS had or saw a copy of MrLin's resignation letter, and of DEX's resolution of change of Director both handwritten and dated 29 September 2006 (paras. 30 to31 above).  Although these 2 documents did not expressly deal with change in signatory, as opposed to change of director, on thedocumentary and oral evidence, the 2 matters went hand in hand, to DBS' knowledge.  I refer for instance, to Mr Lin's first email(of 24 August 2006) notifying DBS that he wanted the signatory of DEX changed, âas soon as possibleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  DEX contends that Mr Moriya brought the copies which he had been provided by Ms Lo to DBS on the afternoon of 29 September 2006,and showed it to Mr Chan, but Mr Chan was not interested, saying that he had already received copies of the documents from Mr Lindirectly.  Mr Chan denies this.  This is a conflict of evidence to resolve.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  It is not disputed : (1) Ms Lo gave copies of these 2 handwritten documents signed by Mr Lin to Mr Moriya, (2) he told her he wouldreturn to the Bank that afternoon and hand it over, and (3) he indeed returned to the Bank that afternoon.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  As a matter of inherent probability, I prefer Mr Moriya's version of events to DBS' case :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     He and his colleagues had come from Japan for the primary purpose of changing the signatories on the DEX account.</p>        <p>(2)     They had been told they needed to prove that Mr Lin had resigned, and was replaced by Mr Ishibe.  For that purpose, they telephonedMr Lin in Shanghai, and apparently had several telephone calls because of weak mobile phone reception.</p>        <p>(3)     They procured Mr Lin to write and sign the 2 handwritten documents, and fax these to Ms Lo.  It was obviously a fair amountof effort and involvement over a few days.  As Mr Moriya said in evidence (Day 2, pg. 42 (12â15)), which I accept :</p>        <p class="quote">âIf it is not the required documents by the bank â¦ there is no reason I can see that we have been running around bringing thedocuments for the bank.â</p>        <p>(4)     It is almost inevitable Mr Moriya would take the handwritten documents back to the Bank on the afternoon of 29 September,whatever other reason he may have had for going to the Bank that afternoon.  It would make sense for him to at least show DBS thehandwritten documents so the formalities for change of signatories could be completed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The Bank contends the handwritten document were not required by them, but by Ms Lo.  With respect, this is not easy to understand:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     Whatever Mr Chan says, what the Bank needed to know was whether Mr Ishibe was entitled to sign the bank documents and resolutionsthat he signed on 28 September 2006.  The letter and resolution from Mr Lin would confirm that.</p>        <p>(2)     It is apparent that Mr Moriya and his colleagues were led through this process by the Bank and Ms Lo.  It was the Bank's owninternal procedure, and Mr Moriya and colleagues were doing what they reasonably could to ensure the Bank was sufficiently satisfiedto effect the intentions that Mr Moriya himself had expressed.  For that purpose, the overwhelming likelihood is that Mr Moriya wouldshow the Bank all documents which came into his hands that were relevant to this purpose.  It is unlikely as a matter of common sense,that he would draw the fine distinction that the Bank now draws between documents required primarily by Ms Lo, and documents requiredprimarily by the Bank.  Instead, he would show all relevant documents to DBS.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  It is of course, possible that Mr Chan was not interested in the handwritten documents :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     Mr Chan wanted to follow the Bank's internal procedure, which apparently requires the 3 requested documents (para. 33 above)to be provided.  These corporate document were the documents Mr Chan said he wanted to see.</p>        <p>(2)     Thus, it is quite possible Mr Chan was not interested in the handwritten resolution and resignation letter because as faras he was concerned, they would not justify him under DBS' internal guidelines, from effecting the change in signatories.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In those circumstances, it is quite likely in my view, Mr Moriya offered the 2 handwritten documents to Mr Chan, but Mr Chan did nottake them.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The important point is and I find, that Mr Moriya offered the handwritten documents to the Bank on 29 September 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  If as I have found, DBS had sight of the handwritten documents on 29 September 2006, the Mandate was validly changed.  DBS had allit required under clause 7 of the Mandate (para. 52(4) above).  The Bank had a valid resolution changing the Mandate (the new mandateitself), and <i>knew</i> it had been signed by the new director.  The Bank had a reasonable opportunity to act on that before 9 October 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  At the very least, the bank was unquestionably aware by 9 October 2006 of the <i>possibility</i> the previous Mandate had already been revoked.  Without authority or ratification of that payment by DEX, DBS made the transfersto BBMF on 9 and 20 October 2006 as principal, and not as agent.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Even if I am wrong, and Mr Lin was still an authorized signatory on 9 October 2006, in my opinion, having regard to all the contemporaneousdocuments and other evidence, the circumstances were such that a reasonably prudent banker would have been put on enquiry.  DBS wasin fact put on enquiry for the reasons above (paras. 66 to 76 above).</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The mere fact of an existing mandate, even if valid, does not exclude DBS's obligations : (1) to exercise reasonable skill and careas a matter of contract and tort and (2) not to act on the Mandate if a reasonably prudent banker would be put on inquiry, or hadreasonable grounds for believing the instruction given ostensibly under the Mandate did not represent DEX's true intention.</p>    <p>                   Mr Shieh SC argued with the great force that any duty to make enquiry was excluded by clause 7 of the Mandate. However with respect, clause 7 neither expressly nor by implication excludes a duty of enquiry.  More fundamentally, it is difficultto see how DBS can be admittedly under a duty to take reasonable care (as admitted in DBS' pleading, and as set out for instanceat clause 24 of the Standard Terms)âand yet have no duty to make enquiries when appropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In my opinion, DBS was put on enquiry for the reasons above, and because :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The transfer of USD3.25 million was a very substantial sum, from a bank account which was essentially inactive.</p>        <p>(2)     The absence of DEX's company chop on the 9 October 2006 fax instruction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Either or both of these factors should have put the Bank on enquiry.  <i>If</i> the Bank made the enquiries they should have made, it is quite likely they would have discovered the disputed instruction did notrepresent DEX's true intention.</p>    <p>Instead, Mr Sung accepted in evidence that he did not look at the fax instruction carefully or at all (Day 5, pg. 11.1).</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  As appears from the authorities, a bank may have notice of âirregularityââwhich is not the same thing as fraud : <i>Lipkin Gorman v. Karpnale</i> (C.A.) (above) (at 1354C).  Second, the question is not whether the instruction is unauthorized as a matter of probability but whetherthere is a serious or real possibility the instruction <i>might</i> be unauthorized, or for an improper or extraneous purpose : <i>Lipkin Gorman</i>(above) (at 1378BâC).  As Mr Shieh SC accepted in argument, the fact a person is an authorized signatory does not necessarily meanthat <i>all</i> his instructions are necessarily authorized.  There will be cases for instance, when a bank is put on enquiry of possible fraud ormisappropriation, or in all the circumstances (e.g. para. 79 above).  This will depend on the facts of each case.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Mr Shieh SC asked rhetorically : who should the bank make enquiries with? It is not disputed that on 9 October 2006, the bank didnot make enquiries with Mr Lin, with any of the Japanese gentlemen who had been corresponding and meeting DBS, with ECC's Ms Lo asDEX's corporate agent, nor with the Relationship Manager for DEX, Mr Andy Sung.  With respect, the fact no enquiries were made inthese circumstances when DBS was put on enquiry, leads to the conclusion that the bank failed to exercise reasonable care in allthe circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  I am aware of the 2 interlocutory decisions in this action when on DBS' application for security for costs, the court has been ofthe preliminary view that the merits favoured DEX.  In the Court of Appeal in CACV 247 of 2007 unrep., 6 December 2007, Cheung JAsaid (at Â§29, 30) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âmy view is that this approach [by DBS] is too restrictive.  While the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the sole signatory under the mandate given to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, events had developed to such a stage that in my view that the plaintiff has put forward a strong case that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant <i>must be put on inquiry</i> as to whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant still had authority to transfer the fund when he gave the instructions.  The plaintiff had by correspondence informed the1<sup>st</sup> defendant of its intention to replace the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the authorized signatory.  Representatives of the plaintiff had come to Hong Kong and met the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for the <i>purpose of amending the bank records</i> â¦</p>        <p class="quote">Certainly the correspondence starting from 29 August 2006 showed that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was corresponding with these representatives instead of with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  In these circumstances an ordinary prudent bank <i>ought to make enquiries with the plaintiff</i> to see whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant still had the authority to transfer the fund before his instruction was to be complied with.  There were <i>sufficient reasonable grounds for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to consider whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was misusing his authority</i> for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff or otherwise <i>defeating its true intention</i>.  The situation went beyond âmere suspicion or unease' on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  The simplest way for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was to make inquiries with the plaintiff before carrying out the instruction of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  This was not done by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.â [Emphasis added]</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Although I am not bound by this judgment made at the interlocutory stage, without discovery and oral evidence, I respectfully agreewith Cheung JA.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  DBS argues that on a strict construction of the Mandate in particular clauses 4 and 7, DEX cannot complain of any alleged breachof duty by DBS, or lack of authority by Lin.  With respect, I disagree.  Whether the contractual documents are strictly construed,or given their proper construction, DBS cannot have it both ways :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     On a strict or proper construction, in my view the chop being part of the Mandate, the bank was in breach by paying withouta chop on the transfer instruction of 9 October 2006.</p>        <p>(2)     Under clause 7 of the Mandate, DBS had by 29 September 2006, the amending resolution, duly certified by Mr Ishibe as the newsole director.</p>        <p>(3)     The required documents set out in clause 6 of the Mandate did not include the 3 required documents (para. 33 above) for instance,the register of members, and certificate of incumbency.  <i>If</i> the Bank wished to make these 3 documents necessary for a change of mandate, it could and should have provided for these contractually,for instance in the Standard Terms, or in the Mandate.  Indeed, Mr Sung's email of 26 September 2006 referred to additional documentswithout suggesting they were necessary documents.  Moreover, it is trite that a contract is construed at the time it is concluded,and not by reference to subsequent conduct, absent any agreed variation or estoppel, neither of which are alleged here.</p>        <p>(4)     Clause 4(a) of the Mandate provides that DBS is âentitledâ to act upon any requests or instructions by an authorized signatoryunless modification is completed under clause 7â and not that the Bank is âboundâ to so act.  The latter would make littlesense, and would be inconsistent with the Bank's duty to exercise reasonable care in all the circumstances.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  It follows on my construction of the contractual documents that DEX <i>is</i> entitled to complain of breach of mandate and negligence by DBS.  And it was not seriously suggested by Mr Shieh SC that Mr Lin wasauthorized on 9 October 2006, to operate the account (see DBS' Opening at para. 65, and Closing Submissions at para. 117(1)).  EitherMr Lin was authorized to operate the account on 9 October, or he was not.  He had no actual authority.  And any apparent authoritywas withdrawn to DBS' knowledge, during the course of numerous emails exchanged with DBS since the third week of August 2006, andat the 3 meetings with the bank on 28 and 29 September 2006.  It is trite that in general, apparent authority arises when a representationis made by the principal (DEX), and not merely by the agent, that the agent has authority.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  DBS also raises these arguments :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     That DEX merely informed DBS of its <i>intention</i> to change the mandate, and not that the mandate was being or had been changed.</p>        <p>(2)     DEX did not inform DBS that Mr Lin ceased to have authority.</p>        <p>(3)     A signatory need not be a director.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  With respect, the evidence and inherent probabilities do not support any of these points, which I deal with in the same order :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     This point is inconsistent with the evidence, and my findings above.</p>        <p>(2)     It was clear from all the emails to DBS, and in any event at the meetings on 28 and 29 September 2006, that Mr Lin's authorityas signatory was changed.  Even if I am wrong and the position was not express, it was implicit.</p>        <p>(3)     See (2) above.  With respect, DBS' position in this respect is too dogmatic, and unrealistic.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(b)     Issue A.4âwhether Mr Lin in breach of fiduciary duty</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Although Mr Lin formally resigned as a DEX director by 29 September, he had no actual nor apparent authority to give the disputedinstruction on 9 October 2006 to DBS.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  By 9 October, he knew or must have known :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     He had resigned as a director by 29 September, and the signatories were being or had been changed.  And he did not ask orconfirm with any representative of DEX and DEXJ whether he still had authority to operate DEX's bank account.  He should have knownthat if he had asked, the answer would clearly have been âNoâ.</p>        <p>(2)     In his email to DBS of 24 August 2006, he made clear he wished to change the signatory â<i>as soon as possible</i>â.</p>        <p>(3)     It is extraordinary that his email on 9 October (at 5:29 p.m.) states he âsees no reason in not repaying the loanââwhenhe had <i>already</i> given the fax instruction to DBS that morning, around 10:08 a.m.  He did not tell DEX or DEXJ that he had already given payment instructionsto DBS.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(c)     Issues A.5 to A.7âwhether DBS in breach of fiduciary duty</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  In view of my findings above, it is unnecessary to find an exceptional case where DBS was not merely in the position of debtor andcreditor, but was also a trustee, with fiduciary duties which it breached : the requirements of certainty and speed for commercialtransactions are such that I should be slow to recognize the bank owed duties as a fiduciary or trustee.  As already stated, DEXhas abandoned its allegations of knowing receipt and dishonest assistance.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  I do however, consider DBS could and should (as it initially proposed) instituted interpleader proceedings when the dispute arose. See <i>Baden Delvaux</i> (above) <i>per</i> Gibson J (at Â§281) (para. 61 above).</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  I also consider that when BBMF applied for an injunction, DBS as DEX's agent and banker, should at least have appeared at that hearingalbeit at short notice, to fairly put the position before the courtârather than rely on BBMF's counsel to inform the court of thefull and frank position.  At the hearing for security for costs, Saunders J said (at Â§15) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHad they attended the hearing, and it had been made plain, as it ought to have been, to the judge, that the <i>fund was in dispute</i>, and the fact that the transfer had been made in reliance upon the signature of a person whose <i>authority had been withdrawn</i>, and whom the Bank apparently <i>knew had an association with BBMF</i>, had been made clear to the judge, it <i>may well have been that the injunction would not have been granted</i>.â [Emphasis added]</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I respectfully agree.</p>    <p class="heading">(d)     Issue A.8âEffect of clause (a) of Remote Channel Authority and Indemnity</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Without prejudice to my conclusion that this document did not bind DEX as it was not authorized by any board resolution and meeting,and did not have DEX's chop as required by the Mandate, this document does not assist DBS.  It does not expressly nor impliedly,exclude liability for negligenceâindeed clause (c) expressly relies on the bank's âterms and conditionsâ.  Nor do I considerthat the payment by DBS on 9 October was such that it concerned a matter âbeyond [DBS'] controlââit was within DBS' controlwhether to make proper enquiries when put on enquiry, and to exercise reasonable care.</p>    <p class="heading">(e)     Issue A.9âLoan or capital contribution; practical benefit</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  In view of my findings on the third party proceedings, I need not spend too long on this issue.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  I accept that on the contemporaneous documents I have seen, in particular the Loan Agreement dated 30 June 2006, the transfer ofUS$3.25 million from BBMF to DEX was by way of loan rather than capital contribution.  It also appears that the Joint Venture Agreementwith the BBMF Group was concluded with DEXJ, not DEX.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  However, having carefully considered the matter, it is unnecessary for me to finally determine the issue whether the transfer ofUS$3.25 million was by way of loan, or was a capital contribution, for 2 main reasons.  First, in general, when a third party e.g.a bank, pays a customer's debt for the customer, the customer is not bound, absent its authority or ratification.  Neither of theseis alleged nor supported by the evidence.  Second, I do not have all relevant documents and facts before me, and am therefore reluctantto try this matter on the material before me.  I do not for instance, have a copy of the JVA apparently concluded in November 2005,in the Japanese language, and governed by Japanese law.  Third, Mr Shieh SC has submitted that if I find for his client on the questionof mistake of law and/or fact, he would not be pressing the issue of DEX receiving a practical benefit</p>    <p class="heading">(f)      Issue A.10ârelief</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Although DBS has alleged that DEX's loss was caused or contributed to by its failure or refusal to take any reasonable steps toprevent BBMF from obtaining the US$3.25 million from BBMF's account, DBS has not alleged contributory negligence, as opposed to causation.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  I am not persuaded that DEX caused its own loss, as alleged.  Before the transfer to BBMF on 20 October, it appears from the contemporaneousdocuments that it was unclear to DEX's solicitors whether the US$3.25 million was still in a bank account with DBS, or with anotherbank.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  DBS' Solicitors gave notice to DEX's solicitors by a fax on 20 October (at 9:38 a.m.) to ask it to obtain an injunction by <u>3:00</u><u> p.m.</u> that day.  I accept Mr Manzoni's submission that there was insufficient time and it was impractical, particularly with DEX's directorsresident overseas (as the Bank knew) for DEX to apply within a few hours for : (1) an urgent injunction, and (2) service out of thejurisdiction on BBMF in Nevada, and with the requisite Skeleton Argument and research.  Instead, DBS could (and should) have institutedinterpleader proceedings (para. 9 above) under Order 17 as they had previously proposed (to the approval of DEX's Solicitors) and/orpaid the disputed sum into court.  DBS could not be criticized if it had done either or both of these things, and would have soughtto step out of the picture, or to limit its role in the proceedings.</p>    <p>I deal later with the relief I grant to DEX.</p>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">VI.

There is no possible suggestion that any claim by BBMF against DEX is time barred within the 6 year period forcontract claims.</p>        <p>(3)     If the issue should arise in proceedings brought by BBMF whether the natural and appropriate forum is Hong Kong or Japan,this issue can be ventilated, and the Hong Kong Court can decide where the dispute between DEX and BBMF should be tried, or summarilydetermined as the case may be.</p>        <p>(4)     I accept Mr Shieh SC's submission that BBMF could and should have â<i>closed the loop</i>â by instituting 4<sup>th</sup> party proceedings against DEX, as a result of the 3<sup>rd</sup> party proceedings instituted.  BBMF could not assume it would necessarily succeed against DBS.  It should as a matter of prudence,have instituted 4<sup>th</sup> party proceedings against DEX.  Without such proceedings, there is no direct <i>lis</i> between DEX and BBMF to be addressed in pleadings between them, which would determine the scope of their discovery, and witness statements. As a result, I am conscious I have not seen all relevant documents between DEX and BBMF on the issue of loan or capital contribution,for instance the JVA in the Japanese language, governed by Japanese law.</p>        <p>(5)     I am also troubled by the fact the transfer of monies between DEX and BBMF on 9 October 2006 occurred in suspicious circumstances. It happened on a Japanese public holiday when DEX and DEXJ personnel in Japan were unlikely to be alerted.  On the evidence, MrLin with the assistance of BBMF's Ms Elaine Kwok, engineered a situation on 9 October for DEX to pay BBMF without authority, whenMr Lin must have known he had resigned as a director, and his authority as a signatory had either ended, or would very soon end. Mr Lin was clearly aware of a dispute between the DEX Group and BBMF, but failed to consult DEX's other directors and personnelbefore sending DBS the disputed instruction by fax.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  As to BBMF's Remote Channel Authority and whether it is liable to compensate and/or indemnify DBS, I accept this document concernsthe operation of BBMF's account, not DEX's account.  Nonetheless, since BBMF repeatedly demanded that DBS unfreeze its account, andmake the transfer from DEX, BBMF can hardly complain that DBS carried out its instructions, thereby suffering loss.</p>    <p>I accept DBS' submission that where DBS is liable to DEX by reason of the transfers to BBMF's account on 9 and 20 October 2006, thisarose and was a consequence of DBS' compliance with BBMF's instructions concerning its account.  As such, DBS is entitled to be compensatedor indemnified by BBMF.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  BBMF counterclaims on the basis that DBS consented to the discontinuance of the Injunction Proceedings in the 1<sup>st</sup> Action, and DBS is therefore precluded from bringing the present case on the basis of <i>res judicata</i> and/or that DBS is in breach of an undertaking given to deputy judge.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  However, the principle of <i>res judicata</i> operates only where a <i>final</i> judicial decision on the merits of the case has been pronounced : <i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> (4<sup>th</sup> ed., 2003) Vol. 16(2) Â§978.</p>    <p>Here, there was no adjudication of the merits of the issues raised in the Injunction Proceedings.</p>    <p>Nor did DBS give an undertaking that the issues raised in the Injunction Proceedings would not be raised in other proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  In my view, DBS is also entitled to rely on <i>R.H.C. O. 21 r.4</i> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSubject to any terms imposed by the Court in granting leave under rule 3, the fact that a party has discontinued an action or counterclaimor withdrawn a particular claim made by him therein <i>shall not be a defence to a subsequent action</i> for the same, or substantially the same, cause of action.â [Emphasis added]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  Although BBMF sought to rely on the belated plea of estoppel by conduct, this was not pleaded.  In the absence of such plea, letalone dealt with in the witness statements, or cross-examination, BBMF cannot rely on this argument.  Moreover, a representationto found an estoppel by conduct must be clear and unequivocal, and I fail to see how this can sensibly be satisfied.</p>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">VIII.   DBS' case against Ipâthird party proceedings (Issue D.14)</i></p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  DBS is not precluded from claiming against Mr Ip because of any alleged discontinuance undertaking, for the reasons in paras. 119â120above.  Mr Ip was not party to the 1<sup>st</sup> Action, and cannot enforce the alleged discontinuance undertaking.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  However, I am not persuaded that Mr Ip is or should be personally liable under the Letter of Undertaking dated 16 October 2005 althoughhe signed the fax instruction to DBS dated 12 October 2006 (to transfer US$3.8 million from its BBMF's DBS account to its HSBC account),for 2 reasons :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     He signed that fax instruction â<i>for and on behalf of</i>â BBMF.  It is well known that these words exclude an agent's personal liability.  In these circumstances, he should not be personallyliable in the third party proceedings.</p>        <p>(2)     The subsequent solicitors' letters were sent on BBMF's behalf by W.I. Cheung &amp; Co., rather than his behalf.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  In assessing contribution, under <i>s.</i><i> </i>4 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377">Cap. 377</a>, the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court âto be just and equitable havingregard to the extent of that person's responsibility for the damage in questionâ.  Applying that section and having regard to allthe relevant circumstances, I consider :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     DBS should repay to DEX the entire sum of US$3.25 million wrongly transferred.</p>        <p>(2)     BBMF should pay DBS the same sum which DBS is adjudged liable to pay DEX.</p>        <p>(3)     It is inappropriate to apportion responsibility between DBS and BBMF towards DEX, and there was no serious suggestion to thecontrary.</p>        <p>(4)     I decline to hold Mr Lin personally liable in the third party proceedings.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">IX.     Credibility</i></p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  For the avoidance of doubt, in the Main Action in general, I found the plaintiff's case to be more consistent with the contemporaneousdocuments and inherent probabilities than DBS' case.  Insofar as there was any conflict of evidence between their witnesses, I preferredthe plaintiff's version of events, on the balance of probabilities.  I intend no disrespect to DBS' witnesses who as busy bankerssuffered a lapse in proper communication and coordination, and failed to properly appreciate all the ramifications of the contemporaneousdocuments and meetings.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  Insofar as DBS' case against BBMF and Lin is concerned, for the avoidance of doubt, I find that DBS' case was more consistent withthe contemporaneous documents and inherent probabilities.  Where there is any conflict of evidence between DBS and the third parties,I prefer DBS' case on the balance of probabilities.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Although there is no direct <i>lis</i> between BBMF and DEX, Elaine Kwok of BBMF was not called, did not make a witness statement, and has provided no explanation nor evidencealthough she was a material witness in :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     sending the written demands to DEX for loan repayment, with interest;</p>        <p>(2)     on DBS' evidence, pressurising it by at least <i>3</i> phone calls on 9 October 2009 (two to Ms Wat, and one to Mr Sung); and</p>        <p>(3)     on DBS' Mr Sung's evidence, complaining on 9 October 2006 that Ms Wat had failed to process the payment promptly.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>As a result, it appears DEX's disputed instruction to DBS was approved as it was marked â<i>urgent please</i>â.  It is unclear whether Ms Kwok misled DBS by stating she represented â<i>DEX Asia</i>â (as recorded in the payment instructions), or this was DBS' own mistake.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  In these circumstances, although there is no direct <i>lis</i> between BBMF and DEX, I am entitled to draw an adverse inference against BBMF from the absence or silence of Ms Kwok as a witnesswho may be expected to give material evidence on the circumstances surrounding the transfer of US$3.25 million from DEX to BBMF. Such inference would tend to strengthen the evidence adduced by DEX and DBS against BBMF, and to weaken BBMF's evidence.  I am satisfiedthere is evidence before me that the transfer was effected in circumstances where Mr Lin was plainly in breach of warranty of authorityand/or fiduciary duty, assisted by BBM's Ms Kwok.  There has been no reason put forward for Ms Kwok's absence and silence.  BBMFmay have thought they were saving time and costs by recovering a debt in dispute, which they considered was plainly due and owing. However, any debt recovery should be done properly through the court if necessary, and not by unorthodox or unilateral means.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Although DEX discontinued its claim against Mr Lin, his credibility is suspect to say the least :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     He maintains that DEX did not specifically explain to him that his position as a signatory had come to an end (his statementÂ§33).  However, this is contradicted by his own stance in his email of 24 August 2006 that the signatories were to replaced, âassoon as possibleâ.  He also admits he knew that the change of signatory was in process (his statement Â§34).</p>        <p>(2)     As Mr Manzoni pointed out, the 9 October 2006 disputed instruction which he signed has an indicated time of around 10:08 a.m. However, that afternoon his email sent around 17:29, stated that he saw no reason for this payment not to be paidâwithout statinghe had <i>already</i> approved the payment.</p>        <p>(3)     He states that as a sole signatory, he believed he still had proper authority (his statement Â§34).  However he must havebeen put on inquiry at the very least, or could not care less that his authority had or would shortly come to an end, with the stepstaken to change signatories. Moreover, all BBMF directors on the board of DEXJ were asked to resign, and did so in August 2006â2months before the transfer on 9 October 2006.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i style="text-transform: uppercase">X.      Conclusion</i></p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  In the circumstances, I make the following order in the Main Action in entering judgment against DBS in DEX's favour with the followingrelief :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     DBS is ordered to return the USD3,250,000 wrongfully transferred from the plaintiff's bank account on 9 October 2006 withoutthe plaintiff's authority.</p>        <p>(2)     A declaration that DBS wrongly debited DEX's bank account with the sum of UD$3,250,000 on 9 October 2006, and that the saidamount is due and owing by DBS to the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I decline to order or declare that DBS is liable as constructive trustee or for breach of fiduciary duty, or that it was subject tofiduciary duties.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  I enter judgment in DBS' favour against Mr Lin in the sum of UD$3,250,000 which DBS has been adjudged liable to pay DEX.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  I also enter judgment in DBS' favour against BBMF for the same sum of US$3,250,000 which DBS has been adjudged liable to pay DEX.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  I dismiss the third party proceedings against Mr Ip.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  As to costs, having considered all the evidence and the circumstances leading up to and prior to the litigation, with respect toDBS, its conduct prior to 9 October and at the time of payment on 20 October 2006 was such as significantly added to legal costs,and the length of these proceedings.  If it had instituted interpleader proceedings as it had itself suggested, time and costs couldhave been significantly reduced.  Moreover, if it had informed Hartmann J in writing or otherwise at the hearing on 20 October 2006of the full and frank position concerning the dispute between the 2 customers, His Lordship may not have been inclined to grant theinjunction.  Put another way, the Bank has at least to some extent, brought these proceedings upon itself.  At the same time, itis fair to point out the Bank had an arguable defence such that the matter was suitable for trial as opposed to summary determination.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  Having considered all the circumstances, I make the following costs order <i>nisi</i> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     DBS is to pay DEX the costs of the action, to be taxed if not agreed, on a party and party basis, with certificate for 2 counsel(all parties at trial having appeared by 2 counsel).</p>        <p>(2)     DBS is awarded half its costs against Mr Lin and BBMF of defending the Main Action, and of the contribution and third partyproceedings, on a party and party basis, with certificate for 2 counsel.</p>        <p>(3)     DBS is to pay Mr Ip's costs on a party and party basis, with certificate for 2 counsel.  Such costs will need to be apportionedsince Mr Ip and BBMF both appeared by the same counsel and solicitors.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  As to interest, I award DEX interest from 9 October 2006 until judgment at a commercial rate, and from judgment until payment infull at the judgment rate.  I award DBS interest against BBMF at a commercial rate from 20 October 2006 until judgment, and thereafterat judgment rate until payment in full.
