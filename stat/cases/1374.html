He described to me how a bag from he 5th layer of bags - standing at about a man's height on the lorry - felltowards him, how he tried to catch it with his hook, but in view of its weight he was unable to control it and instead he fell fromhis position on the vehicle to the ground. He sustained a fractured wrist and possibly a fractured humerus and claims compensationfor temporary incapacity and for permanent partial incapacity under the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees Compensation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/287">Cap. 287</a> [The Ordinance].</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The point for my decision is short, since the Respondents have agreed the amount of, and the rate at which compensation should beassessed if the Applicant brings himself within the framework of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282">Cap. 282</a>. That short point is whether the Applicant is an "Employee"within the meaning assigned to the word by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.2(1)</a> of the Ordinance. If he was an "employee" and in the employment of the Dependants he has a night to claim compensation for his injuriesby virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.5(1)</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> In brief and general terms an "Employee" in so defined as a person working under a Contract of Service but there is a proviso to<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.2(1)</a> - proviso (b) which reads as follows:-</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Provided that the following persons are excepted from the definition of "employee".</p>    <p> </p>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left">                <p style="text-align:right">    (b)   </p>            </td>            <td valign="top" align="left">any person whose employment is of a casual nature and who is employed otherwise then for the purposes of the employers trade on business.....</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> This applicant was on the evidence a casual worker as a coolie and so only the second limb of the proviso to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.2(1)is</a> in issue, that is to say was he employed otherwise then for the purposes of the employers trade on business?</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Then to answer that question, and before doing so, I must find out who the Applicants employer was, and when I say the Applicantwas a Coolie at the material time, some of the legal peculiarities attaching to that reducing breed of men, are I suspect instantlyapparent.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> But then even the term "Coolie" is not I find truly a term of art such that an instant impression of the general relationship betweenhim and these he serves - using that word in an ambiguous sense to embrace either services or service - arises in any lawyars mind,but in view of the authorities recording the heroic struggles of previous judges and academics to pigeon hole the status of a coolie,I must first turn to the facts and record them as I find, then because all those facts historically helping to point the way to alegal definition are in issue. I have not had much assistance on this score from the witnesses, who have understandably not had EnglishCommon Law concepts of the relationship of master and servant in the forefront of their minds.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The Applicant described how he had worked over a period for one CHAN Ming and said that he would wait for jobs at Shamshuipo witha group of colleagues until a head coolie - such as CHAN Ming contacted them and told them of a job. He described how the job mightbe one calling for 10 coolies and carrying a fee of $100 so that each man would receive $10.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The Respondents are importers of Salt and the Applicant said he had worked for various "Salt Godowns", as he called them includingthe Respondents. He said that on the 12th January, 1982 he received instructions from CHAN Ming about a job for the next day, andacting on these instructions - on the day of his accident - he took a tunnel Bus and went to the Hong Kong side to Sai Cheung Streetand there he met a group - he was not sure how many but usually it was 10-12 - and he was given his instructions, by CHAN Ming, tocarry, as he said, bags of salt firstly from a lighter to a goods vehicle then later, these bags were to be carried back to Shamshuipo.The accident then occurred, and he lost consciousness, until he awoke in Hospital, where he was later visited by CHAN Ming and others.He said that he worked under this arrangement 5 or 6 times a month, "working for CHAN Ming" as he said. The Applicant said he understoodthat the lorry from which he fell was owned by one Siu and had on its side the Chinese characters "Yim Yip", which was conceded bythe Respondents to represent their name, and then Mr. Siu, who later gave evidence for the Respondents, agreed that he was the registeredowner of the vehicle but had put the Respondents name on the side doors as the "Correspondence address" as he said. Whether or notthis complies with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III</a> of the Road Traffic (Construction and Use) Regulations made pursuant to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic Ordinance</a> is not for me to adjudicate upon here, but it does seem unnecessarily convoluted for one person to be the owner of a vehicle withanothers name and address on it, and I shall revert to this when I have to assess the worth and weight of the Respondents evidence.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The Applicant said that when he was working at the Respondents place of business he received instructions only from CHAN Ming, andhe described how, after the accident, CHAN Ming brought him $100, from which he meant me to infer as I do that it was his wages forthe day of the accident, and then said that CHAN Ming lent him $100 and made a further gift of $50, and told him to "chase" the Respondentsif he wanted any more. The Applicant did so and received a further $200 from the manager Mr. HO Lok - "on a friendly basis". Nothingturns on this: Mr. HO Lok giving evidence confirmed a loan of this amount and I do not feel able to draw any inference either wayfrom the mere fact of payment whether by way of a gift or loan of this amount.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> And so the picture the Applicant presented was of himself working on this occasion under the instructions of CHAN Ming at the Respondentspremises, but without any direct contact with any of the Respondents employees for supervision, instruction, or even renumeration;then and to underline his insistence that he worked under CHAN Ming the Applicant described how the renumeration for a coolie gangof say 7 was split into 8 shares and the ganger received an extra share: this he said was CHAN Ming's practice and perquisite, butthen, right at the end of the cross-examination, he said.</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"No I do not think I worked for Chan - the goods belonged to Yim Yip - we worked for "Yim Yip" - my employer is the goods owner. "</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The last piece of testimony contained a contradiction in terms that only became apparent later in the evidence, when I heard thatsometimes the Respondents carried their own (salt) Goods, and sometimes others collected their purchases but that they used the samelorries and that coolies could and did load these lorries whichever system was in operation. The Applicant described to me how onany particular day he would make perhaps 2 journeys with lorries he had helped to load across to Kowloon and would be paid in Kowloonat the end of the last journey.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> When CHAN Ming, a coolie of 69 years of age, was called to give evidence for the Applicant he denied any suggestion that the Applicantworked for him, and said "he was working, like me, for Yim Yip". He described how he dealt with Mr. Siu at the Respondents and thatthe lorries belonged to Mr. Siu but stressed that "we worked for Yim Yip CHAN Ming" ALSO denied any suggestion that he received anyextra share, but said that Mr. Siu personally paid each coolie at the time of finishing the job. He denied strongly that any supervisionwas given to the Coolie gang and said no instructions were given as none were needed - the remark no doubt of a professional, proudof his skill. He said however that he only worked for Yim Yip nowadays in view of his age and only worked for them 1 or 2 times permonth, and the day of the accident was one of those have occasions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Now I find the significance of CHAN Ming's evidence to lie not in his contradiction of the Applicant's evidence - which I find tobe reconcilable on material points without inpugning either witness honesty - but in his assertion that on the material date he wasworking, as was the Applicant, for the Respondent, having been paid at the end of the job by Mr. Siu, of the Respondent firm at thelighter at the Hong Kong Waterfront.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Siu the Respondent's storekeeper who treated with the coolies also owned the only 2 lorries used by the Respondents. He was thefirst person in authority at the Respondent to be told of the accident to the Applicant; in fact he was answering a telephone callwhen it happened, having been called off the lighter to do so. It is significant that he was on the lighter, supervising the "offloading" which was part of the operation continuing without break, the off-loaded bags being loaded immediately on to the Respondentslorry - albeit Mr. Siu's lorry hired for the day. Mr. Siu must have been in a position to exercise, should the need arise ultimateor residual control over the operation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Siu said his duties did not include paying coolies, but under cross-examination admitted that "if our company employed them theywould come back to collect pay, I paid them on 8/10 occasions in a year".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I am satisfied on the evidence that this was one of those occasions when the goods were being carried for the Respondents own purposesand that whether as carrier or owner  is immateral to the Applicant's case. The lorry had the Respondents name on the side and evenif the lorry was carrying goods already sold to a customer, the evidence of CHAN Ming about payment tips the sealy in favour of theApplicant's contention that at the material time he was working for the Respondent firm, and was not employed by their customer simplyto collect goods from the Respondents premises whether warehouse, or lighter.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Having found that the Applicant was, in neutral terms, working for the Respondent I have next to decide the difficult and vital questionof whether he worked "under a Contract of Service". My finding that he worked for the Respondent merely brings the Applicant outof the excepted class of person described in proviso (b) to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.2(1)</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The statusin law of the Hong Kong Coolie has, I think I can fairly say, after reading the authorities cited to me, caused great difficultyand concern to the Courts over the years. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.5(1)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> of the Ordinance, which creates the Employers liability, contains two elements material to this case, and (truncated) it reads asfollows:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">    "5(1) </p>            </td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" class="quote">if in any employment, personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to an employee hisemployer shall ...... be liable to pay compensation ..... and for the purpose of the Ordinance an accident shall be deemed to ariseout of and in the course of the employment notwithstanding ..... that he was acting without instructions from his employers if suchact was done by the employee for the purposes of and in connexion with his employers trade or business".</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The significance of the second limb of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.5(1)</a> above is that the evidence here, which I shall have to return to, shows clearly and indisputably that the coolie gang worked withoutclear instructions. They knew the work required of them without being told more than the number of bags to be loaded; no one toldthem to adjust or align the bags, and so the effect of the proviso is that this Applicant in not on risk for defeat solely by hisown witness evidence that no orders were given by the Respondents as to the manner of performance of the Applicant's work, whichotherwise would be a weighty matter for my consideration.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Of the authorities cited to me, that of the Full Court in 1973 in the case of <u>WONG Po-sun v. New Universal Paper</u><sup>(1)</sup> (reviewing the previous authorities) is most helpful, even if I say, with the greatest respect, that the judges were really demonstratingthat the distinction between a master and servant relationship, and a contract for services must depend on the facts of each case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Blair Kerr, S.P.J., as he then was, quoted from Mr. P.S.

Hong Kong Wah Tung Stevedore Co.</u>)<sup>(2)</sup> Pickering J. Drew heavily on the old English Workmen's Compensation case of <u>Scanlon v. Hartlepool Seatonia Steamship Co. Ltd. (No. 2)</u><sup>(3)</sup> and I find that the facts of the present case are even more closely resembling Scanlon's case than were the facts in Kwong Man Luen'scase. I suppose it is tempting to regard coolies, who appear it seems to me, as miraculously as the Genies of Arabian denomologyto do a "mastem" bidding but in their own way, and then disappear whence they came, as truly independant contractors, but perhapsa better comparison is with underwriting members of Lloyds, (even if such is not instantly physically obvious) to demonstrate thata body of men acting apparently and in effect in concert are nevertheless individuals engaging only their several liability for theirshare of the risk and premium but with no joint liability for the obligations of each other and each, significantly, engaging onlyhis own liability but through an agent (who may well be a fellow underwriter on risk) authorised in that behalf; whilst the underwriteraccepting his share of a risk would clearly not be engaging in a contact of service, the significance of the comparison that I havechosen lies in the fact that men can act in law in concert, yet without engaging their liability jointly and I do not feel obligedto find that simply because all the gang were engaged through one of their members who was their agent spokesman and medium of communication,that the ultimate or residual right to control their manner of work was not reserved to the Respondents through their employee onthe lighter Mr. Siu.
