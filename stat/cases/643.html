As the name suggests, this is a magazine typetelevision programme aimed predominantly at women. The programme is conducted by two women comperes, and guest speakers are frequentlyinvited to participate as experts in their particular fields. The format is flexible and is intended to cover all subjects of interestto housewives. One segment of the programme is devoted to news about local television and film stars and concentrates both on theirsocial life and on films in which they are likely to appear in in the near future. Other segments include physical fitness demonstrations,palm reading, interviews with famous people and such like.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Since its inception the programme has proved extremely popular and, as the viewing audience is composed principally of young to middleaged housewives, it has become increasingly attractive as an advertising medium to business enterprises specialising in domesticgoods and products that would be of use to housewives. Although the average viewing figure for each segment of the programme is approximately300,000, one segment that is broadcast on Fridays attracts as many as 460,000 viewers.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> An example of the popularity enjoyed by the programme is that the Hong Kong Family Welfare Society has invited the plaintiff to lendsupport to the Society in running a "Good Parents" Campaign by using the programme as a medium of cooperation. An exhibition is tobe held at the New World Centre in connexion with this joint campaign and banners and posters bearing the characters Fu Nui Sun Tszhave been produced for display purposes at the exhibition.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In January 1981 the defendant firm commenced publishing a magazine entitled Yee Gar which means Suitable for the Family In fact,however, the English title used by the magazine in conjunction with its Chinese title is "Home Guide". The distributors of the magazinehave informed the plaintiff that its circulation is minimal. The plaintiff assumes that this means that the circulation figures arein the region of 10,000 copies per month. This has not been disputed by the defendant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In its March 1982 issue "Yee Kar" contained an announcement that commencing with the April issue the publishers proposed changingthe name and format of the magazine, and that the new Chinese and English titles would be "Fu Nui Sun Tsz" and "Lady" respectively.The Chinese characters are identical to the Chinese characters in the title used by the plaintiff for its television programme.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> From the date of its first publication Yee Kar has concentrated on subjects similar to those featured in the television programmeand the defendant's intention is that this policy will continue after the proposed change in title.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> It is not disputed that the plaintiff has been considering the idea of forming a club bearing the title Fu Nui Sun Tsz and that oneof the benefits of membership of the proposed club would be that members would be able to obtain discounts on various items includinghousehold products. It is also not disputed that the plaintiff has been contemplating the publication of a magazine to be issuedin conjunction with its television programme. In this connexion there have been meetings among the relevant members of the plaintiff'sstaff to consider the feasibility of such a venture but the idea has been temporarily shelved.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff alleges that the proposed publication by the defendant of its magazine under the new title Fu Nui Sun Tsz is nothingbut a deliberate attempt to capitalise on the reputation that has been gained by the plaintiff's television programme in order toboost the magazine's minimal circulation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> There is further evidence that the plaintiff produces a magazine entitled K-100 in conjunction with a programme of the same nametelevised on TVB Jade channel. The plaintiff contends that not only does the public associate with television programmes magazinespublished under the same name as those programmes, but it expects authorised magazines to be produced in conjunction with certainof the plaintiff's programmes. The plaintiff contends therefore that unless an injunction is granted restraining the defendant fromusing for its magazine the title "Fu Nui Sun Tsz" confusion will inevitably arise, not only in the minds of those members of thegeneral public who view the programme, but also in the minds of potential viewers.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiff contends that as it will have no control over the quality or subject content of the defendant's magazine it is likelythat the excellent reputation enjoyed by its television programme will be placed in jeopardy with consequent financial loss.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The defendant, in an affirmation filed on its behalf, claims that its reason for deciding to change the name of its magazine is thatthe present name Yee Kar wrongly conveys the impression that its subject matter relates to furniture and interior design and thatthe name "Fu Nui Sun Tsz" is more descriptive of and suited to its actual content.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> While admitting that it proposes to start a club of a similar nature to that contemplated by the plaintiff, with the object of enablingits readers to obtain discounts on purchases of products from certain designated shops, the defendant states that it does not intendto charge a club membership fee but proposes that as soon as a reader enters into a contract for a fixed term subscription to themagazine she will automatically become a club member with discount entitlement.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The defendant has informed its existing advertisers of the proposed change of name. Some of these advertisers have agreed to continueto advertise in the magazine after its change in name but others have indicated that they will suspend their advertisements untilthey have had an opportunity to see the first issue under the new name. The defendant has been able to attract some new advertisersfor the magazine under the proposed new name but other prospective advertisers have indicated that they will defer their decisionuntil after they have seen the first issue of the magazine under its new name. In this connexion the plaintiff claims that it hasalready obtained a number of fixed term advertising contracts for its magazine under the new name and that it will lose the benefitof these contracts if the name of the magazine cannot be changed as proposed. The actual number or value of these contracts has notbeen specified. The plaintiff however claims that the income from advertisements for the first issue is expected to be in the vicinityof $70,000 and that, if publication cannot proceed as intended, not only will this sum be lost but the defendant will become liablein damages to its advertisers for breach of contract. How all this will come to pass is not specified.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Arrangements have been made to distribute the new magazine abroad and the defendants claim that approximately $100,000 has alreadybeen incurred in launching the first issue of the magazine under the new name. No indication has been given, however, as to whatproportion of this sum is directly attributable to expenses relating to publication under the new name. Since the items listed bythe defendant cover those that would normally be expected to relate to the production of the magazine irrespective of whatever nameis used, I do not think that it can reasonably be argued that the defendant is likely to suffer any more than a very minor loss shouldI be persuaded to grant an interim injunction.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It is submitted on behalf of the defendant that if publication is allowed to proceed there is little likelihood of confusion betweenthe plaintiff's television programme and the defendant's magazine. The reasons advanced in support of this cortention are</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="83%" valign="top">                that the magazine aims at a female readership aged between 15 and 40 including not only housewives but also workingwomen and students.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="83%" valign="top">that the defendant's Chinese name will appear at the bottom of the cover of the magazine and underneath the stated price of $5.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Having seen the cover of the proposed first issue I must say that I cannot conceive that this device is likely to attract the attentionof any purchaser or potential purchaser and that even it did, it is highly unlikely that it would have any impact on her mind asto the source of the magazine.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="11%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="83%" valign="top">that the plaintiff's logo is displayed at the top of the cover of its magazine K-100 whereas the defendant's proposed cover does notdisplay that logo.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> In this regard the defendant seeks to draw the inference that any purchaser or potential purchaser of its new magazine would detectthe absence of the plaintiff's logo and thus deduce that the magazine is not produced by the plaintiff. I consider that the averageperson is highly unlikely to arrive at any such conclusion.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(4)</td>            <td width="83%" valign="top">                that the four characters "Fu Nui Sun Tsz" on the defendant's proposed cover will be in plain print whereas the samecharacters that appear on the television screen to represent the plaintiff's programme appear in fancy print.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(5)</td>            <td width="83%" valign="top">that such magazines as may be produced by the plaintiff in connexion with any of its drama series such as "K-100" are not periodicalsbut merely promotional magazines published before the commencement of the series.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> While conceding that nothing has appeared in previous issues of the defendant's magazine published under the name "Yee Kar" whichsuggests that the defendant has been guilty of poor taste or anything that would justify the plaintiff in making any criticism, Mr.Peter Garland, counsel for the plaintiff submits that since the plaintiff has no control over the editorial policy of the magazine,its content, features, taste and general production, and the effect that such might have on any viewer or potential viewer of theplaintiff's television programme, the plaintiff is likely to suffer unquantifiable financial loss. He contends that the defendant'sproposed course of action is a blatant example of passing off and that damage is inferred in such a case. It is his submission thatit fanciful to suggest that the defendant arrived at the decision to use the title "Fu Nui Sun Tsz" entirely uninfluenced by theplaintiff's well known title to its television programme and that the only reasonable conclusion that one can reach is that the choiceof this title was the result of a deliberate decision on the part of the defendant to pass off its magazine as that of the plaintiffand so exploit the goodwill and reputation meritoriously earned and justly enjoyed by the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Counsel referred to the five characteristics that Lord Diplock in Warnink v. Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd. <i>[</i>1979<i>]</i> AC 731 at 742 identified with approval as being those which earlier cases had indicated must be present in order to create a validcause of action for passing off, namely, (1) a misrepresentation (2) made of a trader in the course of trade, (3) to prospectivecustomers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwillof another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably forseeable consequence) and (5) which causes actual damage to a businessor goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought on (in a quia timet action) will probably do so.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> While accepting Lord Diplock's admonition that one must be particularly careful to beware of the logical fallacy of the undistributedmiddle by assuming that all factual situations which present these five characteristics necessarily give rise to a cause of actionfor passing off, counsel contends that all five characteristics are present in this case and that the fallacy as to which Lord Diplocksounded his warning does not arise. He also referred to Lord Diplock's observation that the increasing recognition by Parliamentof the need for more rigorous standards of commercial honesty is a factor which should not be overlooked by a judge confronted bythe choice whether or not to extend by anology to circumstances in which it has not previously been applied a principle which hasbeen applied in previous cases where the circumstances although different had some features in common with those of the case he hasto decide.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Garland submits that the misrepresentation that arises in the present case is the adoption of a title identical to that givenby the plaintiff to its highly popular and successful programme by a magazine of fifteen months standing with a minimal circulationand which features topics substantially identical to those forming the subject of the plaintiff's television programme. He contendsthat the reasonably ferseeable consequence of the defendant's adoption of the plaintiff's title is that readers of the magazine willassume that the defendant's publication is connected in the course of business with the plaintiff's programme and that this is likelyto lead to damage to the business and goodwill of the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Counsel thus contends that there is a serious question to be tried and that accordingly the plaintiff has surmounted the first hurdlethat it must clear in establishing its claim for interlocutory injunctions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Mr. Garland contends that since goodwill and reputation are unquantifiable assets it follows that any damage that the plaintiff mightsustain as a consequence of the defendant's proposed action would not be susceptible to financial assessment and that since the defendanthas not yet embarked upon publication of the proposed new magazine the balance of convenience weighs heavily in favour of grantingthe injunctions. If, however, the court is not so satisfied, then he submits that it should preserve the status quo and that thiscan only be maintained by granting the interlocutory relief sought.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Philip Li for the defendant submits that there is no serious question to be tried. He argues that the plaintiff has not establisheda distinctive reputation and that if it is to succeed it must show that the public would conclude that the defendant's proposed magazineand the plaintiff's television programme have a common origin. He contends that it is essential that the plaintiff must establishthat the title "Fu Nui Sun Tsz" is distinctive of the plaintiff's programme exclusively and that the defendant's use of that titlewill be likely to deceive.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> It is Mr. Li's submission that the four Chinese characters that form the title are not distinctive but merely descriptive and thatthe mere fact that the plaintiff has used them does not therefore prevent the defendant from also using them. He contends that thefour words are so common and so descriptive that no reasonable person would associate them with the television programme. In essenceit is his contention that they simply describe the content of the magazine.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The defendant also submits that the Plaintiff must establish that both it and the defendant are engaged in a common field of activity.In support of this contention Mr. Li cited Derek McCullock v. Lewis A. May (Produce Distributors) Ltd. <i>[</i>1947<i>]</i> 65 PPC 58 (The Uncle Mac case), Wombles Limited v. Wombles Skips Limited <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i> FSR 488 and Tavener Rutledge Ltd. v. Trexapalm Ltd. <i>[</i>1975<i>]</i> FSR 479 (The Kojak Case).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> That these cases embody this trite proposition of law cannot be in doubt. To my mind, however, there is a distinct danger in usingthe facts of those cases in an attempt to decide whether the parties in the present litigation are engaged in a common field of activity.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Mr. Li was at pains to emphasise that although the name "Uncle Mac" was a fancy name and not a mere descriptive name the plaintiffthere failed. Since the title in the instant case is merely descriptive Mr. Li argues that, a fortiori, the plaintiff must fail.I do not agree. The Uncle Mac case was resolved in favour of the defendant on the ground that there was no common field of activity.The fact that Uncle Mac was a fancy name has therefore irrelevant to the decision.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> In developing his argument that there is no common field of activity in the instant case Mr. Li submitted that the defendant's proposedmagazine is both factual and informative and therefore is of an entirely different character to the plaintiff's magazine ??K-100which he contends, is merely promotional. It is his submission that the public will readily distinguish the difference between thesubject matter of the two magazines and as a consequence will not conclude that that published by the defendant is in any way connectedwith the plaintiff. As I understand it, however, this argument, although bearing obliquely on whether there is a common field ofactivity, focuses more on whether there is a real likelihood of confusion in the minds of members of the public that the defendant'spublication is connected in the course of business with the plaintiff's programme.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> While conceding that the television programme and the proposed magazine superficially aim at a common market, Mr. Li contends thatin reality there are two fundamental differences between the two in that, first, the magazine is aimed at the literate market whereasthe television programme is directed at both literate and illiterate members of the public, and secondly, the programme is broadcastfor an afternoon audience whereas the magazine can be read at any time. I must say that these subtle distinctions do not appeal tome.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Mr. Li submits that because the four Chinese characters in the title are so commonplace it is only natural that a publisher wouldseek to use them as a title for a magazine dealing with subject matter such as that appearing in the defendant's magazine and thattherefore the defendant's proposed use of the title cannot reasonably be construed as an attempt to deceive the public.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I disagree. Bearing in mind the defendant's decision to use these four words in that combination for a magazine title so soon afterthe acknowledged success and popularity of the television programme using the same title, and the undisputed fact that both the magazineand the programme are concerned with very similar if not identical material, I am of the view that any court would be entirely justifiedin coming to the conclusion that the defendant's intention is indeed to deceive the public into thinking that both are linked, andthat by marketing his magazine he will thus be able to capitalise on the widespread popularity enjoyed by the television programme.I think a court might well ask itself in these circumstances the same question posed by Lindley LJ in Sla??enger v. Feltham <i>[</i>1889<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=6%20RPC%20531" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">6 RPC 531</a> at 538 - Why should we be astute to say that (the defendant) cannot succeed in doing what he is straining every nerve to do?</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It seems to me that there is a significant association between the plaintiff's and defendant's fields of activities sufficient tomake it highly likely that the general public would be confused into thinking that the defendant's magazine has something to do withor is associated with the plaintiff's business. In this regard I think it is relevant to cite a passage in the judgment of Power,J. of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Fletcher Challenge Ltd. v. Fletcher Challenge Pty. Ltd. &amp; Others <i>[</i>1982<i>]</i> FSR 1 at 11.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="16%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="84%" colspan="2" valign="top" class="quote">                It is true that, in a context relating to traders competing in the same line of business, Lord Diplock, in ErvenWarnink BV v.

Limited v. The Pub Squash Co.Limited <i>[</i>1981<i>]</i> R.P.C. 429 - the test I then applied appears to have been approved by the Privy Council (see 32 A.L.R. at 393)) that if he is tosucceed in an action for passing off, a plaintiff must establish:</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="16%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">a.</td>            <td width="78%" valign="top" class="quote">                that his goods have, or his business has, acquired a certain goodwill or reputation;                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="16%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">b.</td>            <td width="78%" valign="top" class="quote">                that the actions of the defendant have caused, or in all probability will cause, the ordinary purchasers of the plaintiff'sgoods, or the ordinary customers of the plaintiff's business, to believe that the defendant's goods are those, or that the defendant'sbusiness is that, of the plaintiff;                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="16%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">c.</td>            <td width="78%" valign="top" class="quote">that, in consequence, the plaintiff has suffered, or is likely to suffer, injury in his trade or business.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Mr. Li also submits that the plaintiff has not proved that there was a likelihood of damage to his business from the defendant'sproposed publication of the new magazine. No doubt he has in mind the words of Wynn-Parry J. in the Uncle Mac case.</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is of the essence of an action for passing off to show, first, that there has been an invasion by the defendant of a proprietaryright of the plaintiff, in respect of which the plaintiff is entitled to protection, and secondly, that such invasion has resultedin damage or <u>that it creates a real and tangible risk that damage will ensue</u>. (emphasis mine).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Mr. Li argues that although it is not contested that the plaintiff has been contemplating the publication of its own magazine inconjunction with its television programme, it has not yet done so, and that even should it eventually do so it is not likely thatthe defendant's magazine would lead to the plaintiff losing revenue or audience. On the contrary, he maintains that the defendant'smagazine would have the effect of publicising the plaintiff's programme and stimulate interest in those topics that form the subjectmatter of the programme and the magazine and thus increase audience ratings for the programme.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> The argument that the magazine would have the effect of publicising the plaintiff's programme seems to me to bear out the plaintiff'scontention that publication of the magazine under the same title as that used by the programme will inevitably lead the public toconclude that the magazine is published by or with the approval of the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> I do not think that the plaintiff's failure to carry into prompt effect the publication of a magazine in association with the televisionprogramme is a matter that weighs in the defendant's favour. By stealing a march on the plaintiff the defendant would be likely tocapture part of the plaintiff's potential readership market.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Moreover, the defendant intends to form a club in association with its proposed magazine. It concedes that it proposes that the membershipof its club would, like that of the club proposed by the plaintiff, be obtained by subscribers paying a subscription for a fixedterm which will entitle them to obtain discounts on purchases from designated outlets. It requires no flight of the imagination toconclude that by setting up a club bearing the title of the plaintiff's television programme there is a strong likelihood that theplaintiff's proposed club will lose potential members.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> As to the question of goodwill and reputation, it seems to me that the words of Evatt CJ and Myers J in Henderson &amp; Others v.Radio Corporation Pty. Ltd. <i>[</i>1969<i>]</i> RPC 218 at 236, a decision of the High Court of New South Wales in its appellate jurisdiction, are particularly relevant:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Without the permission of the respondents, and without any other right or justification, the appellant has appropriated the professionalreputation of the respondents for its own commercial ends. It claims that a court of equity has no power to restrain the appellantfrom falsely representing that the respondents recommend its products, unless the respondents can prove that their professional reputationhas thereby been injured, or that in some other way their capacity to earn money by the practice of their profession has therebybeen impaired. We do not think that is the law.</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>        <p class="quote">It is true that the coercive power of the court cannot be invoked without proof of damage, but the wrongful appropriation of another'sprofessional or business reputation is an injury in itself, no less, in our opinion, than the appropriation of his goods or money."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In that case the plaintiffs who were well known professional ballroom dancers alleged that the unauthorised publication of a photographof them dancing and featured on the cover of a gramophone record of strict tempo music which was manufactured and distributed bythe defendant company, amounted to passing off and that they were entitled to an injunction and an enquiry as to damages. The courtaffirmed the order for an injunction made in the lower court.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established that there is a serious question to be tried and that the material before me doesnot fail to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for permanent injunctions at the trial.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> I am not satisfied that the defendant would be in a financial position to pay the unquantifiable damages that the plaintiff mightsustain in the event that the injunctions are not granted. There is no evidence from which I can reasonably conclude that it wouldbe able to meet an award of damages. Certainly the limited circulation of its magazine does not suggest any such ability on its part.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> On the other hand, although there was no specific evidence as to the plaintiff's financial resources, bearing in mind the scale ofits operations and the evidence that it is the more successful television station of the two operating in Hong Kong and has viewingfigures greatly in excess of those of its competitor, I find it difficult to imagine that it would not be in a financial positionto compensate the defendant for any damage the latter may suffer as a consequence of the grant of injunctions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> I do not consider that it would be reasonable to assume that anything more than a small part of the sums stated in paragraph 16 ofthe affirmation filed on behalf of the defendant relate directly to the proposed change in the name of the magazine. It seems tome that it is reasonable to assume that such damages as may flow from the matters referred to in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the affirmationare entirely within the financial power of the plaintiff to meet. Furthermore even if I were in any real doubt as to the adequacyof the respective remedies in damages available to the parties I would be disposed to grant the injunctions in order to preservethe status quo.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> On the usual undertaking as to damages I therefore order that until trial on further order, the defendants, whether acting by theirdirectors, officers, servants or agents, or otherwise howsoever, be restrained from printing, publishing or for the purposes of tradedistributing magazines or other printed matter under or by reference to the Chinese title (Fu Nui Sun Tsz) or any other characterswhich so closely resemble it as to be likely to cause confusion, or from authorising or causing any of the aforesaid acts or fromotherwise howsoever passing off or attempting to pass off their business as being in any way connected in the course of trade withthe business of the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> I further order that until trial or further order, the defendants, whether acting by their directors, officers, servants or agentsor otherwise howsoever, be restrained from parting with possession, power, custody or control, other than to the plaintiff, of anymaterials the use of which would be a breach of the foregoing injunction.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Finally, I order that the costs of this application be the plaintiff's costs in the cause.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(Neil Macdougall)<br />                Judge of the High Court</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. Peter Garland instructed by Deacons for Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr. Philip Li instructed by Edward C.T.
