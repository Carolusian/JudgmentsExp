On 11th November,the application for compensation came before the same District Judge. At the conclusion of that hearing, at which the former sub-tenantand his wife both gave evidence and at which the appellant was present, the Judge awarded as compensation under section 70B(3) $5,000for what he called âgeneral inconvenienceâ and a further $15,000 in respect of loss of profits suffered by the wife, who hadbeen, with her husband, living in the premises concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Subsequently, on 21st November, Mrs. Chan entered a notice of appeal in which she sought leave to appeal against the order of compensationbut not against her conviction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> At the outset of the hearing before us today, Mr. Christopher Smith, appearing on behalf of Mrs. Chan, sought leave to appeal outof time against the conviction, a notice to such effect having been entered on 8th June, 1987. We refused an extension of time, beingof the view that where such a very long period has elapsed after the decision against which leave to appeal is sought, an extensionshould only be granted in unusual circumstances. In effect, the substantive ground for the application was that the applicant, whohad riot been represented before, had only received legal advice in May of this year. In our view, this was an insufficient reasonto justify such a very long extension as that which was sought.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The hearing before us, therefore, has been concerned solely with the award of compensation made by the Judge on 11th November lastyear.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Compensation</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Section 70B of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap. 7</a> reads as follows -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â70B. (1) Any person who unlawfully deprives a tenant or sub-tenant of occupation of any premises commits an offence and is liableon conviction on indictment to a fine of $500,000 and, in addition, on a second or subsequent conviction, to imprisonment for 12months.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2) Any person who, with intent to cause a tenant or sub-tenant -</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(a) to give up occupation of any premises or part of premises; or</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(b) to refrain from exercising any right or pursuing any remedy in respect of any premises or part of premises.</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">does any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of the tenant or sub-tenant or members of his household or persistentlywithdraws or withholds services reasonably required for occupation of the premises as a dwelling commits an offence and is liableon conviction on indictment to a fine of $500,000 and, in addition, on a second or subsequent conviction, to imprisonment for 12months.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(3) Where a person is convicted of an offence under sub-section (1) or (2), the court, in addition to passing sentence, may orderthe person convicted to pay to the tenant or sub-tenant such sum as it thinks fit by way of compensation for damage, loss or inconveniencesuffered by the tenant or sub-tenant by reason of the acts constituting the offence and to forfeit to the Crown a sum not exceedingthe equivalent of the difference at the date of the contravention between the market value of the premises with vacant possessionand the market value of the premises with the former tenant or sub-tenant in possession.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> This section was only added in 1983, and we know of no Hong Kong cases in which this section has so far been invoked.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> We were, however, referred to a number of English authorities, which dealt with the application of section 35 of the Powers of CriminalCourts Act 1973, which has certain similarities to section 70B(3) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/7">Cap. 7</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The approach which the English Courts have adopted in the application of that section is exemplified by the case of <u>R. v. Vivian<a>[1]</a>,</u> in which the Court of Appeal commented that compensation orders were introduced as a âconvenient and rapid means of avoiding theexpense of resort to civil litigationâ but added a caution that the powers should not be used -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âunless the sum claimed by way of compensation is either agreed or has been proved.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> A section of this nature is intended to do no more than provide a form of quick relief. It is not meant to involve the court in thesort of detailed examination of damages which is normally undertaken, for example, in a full claim in contract or tort. Indeed, whenapplying the section, the court should bear in mind the possibility that, in appropriate cases, the victim may resort to civil proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The sections purpose is more limited, enabling some immediate compensation to be paid to an injured party for obvious loss causeddirectly by the acts which have been the subject of the charge, and for what is described in the section itself as âinconvenienceâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In this case, it cannot be said that the Judge reached the award which he gave without any evidence. The complaint which Mr. Smithadvances is that the evidence was misread by the Judge in the sense that the figures which he neither justified within the properadopted as the measure of loss were neither justified by the evidence that was before him nor sphere of the section.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The Judge gives no reason for arriving at a figure of $5,000 for âinconvenienceâ. Such an award is by its nature not relatedto any quantifiable loss or damage and we would only have interfered with it if we thought that it was clearly excessive, which wedo not. We see no reason why that part of the award should not stand.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The bulk of the award is derived from the Judgeâs assessment of the income which Madam Chan Yin Miu, who lived in the premiseswith her husband, had lost in consequence of the appellant's acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Her evidence, which the Judge accepted, was that she was unable, as a result of the electricity being switched off from the premises,to carry on with her business of sewing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> She said that she had earned $1,800 a month sewing umbrella tops and that â âbecause I had no electricity for my machine I couldnot workâ. She added that she could not take the machine with her to the relatives with whom she was staying.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The Judge accepted that she earned $1,500 a. month from her work, and found that she was deprived of the means of earning that sumfor a period of 20 months, from the switching off of the electricity in December 1984 until the sub-tenants vacated the premisesin September 1986.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In conducting an examination of loss of earnings in this way, the Judge performed the task which we think ought not to be undertakenin applying this summary remedy. Claims of this kind ought to be pursued by the usual methods of recovering damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> However, even if it had been correct to assess damages for loss of profits, and not merely to compensate for obvious loss, we cannotthink that it was correct for him to have multiplied the assessed monthly loss of earnings by a figure of 20.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Section 70B(3) empowers the court to order the payment of a sum by way of compensation âfor damage, loss or inconvenience sufferedby the tenant or sub-tenant by reason of the acts constituting the offenceâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The charge of which Mrs. Chan was convicted was of withholding a service, that is to say, the supply of electricity, with intentto cause the tenant to give up occupation between 6th December, 1984 and 3rd July, 1985.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Since the offence, as charged, did not continue after 3rd July, 1985, we do not consider that it can be said that any subsequentloss could have been caused by that offence. That is not to say that there may not be other circumstances, and it is not difficultto think of them, in which it would be proper to award compensation for damages suffered after the conclusion of the period duringwhich the offence charged was committed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> We should, perhaps, deal briefly with one argument relating to the interpretation of section 70B(3) which allows for compensationby reason of âthe acts constituting the offenceâ. In sub-section (2), the offence can be committed if a person, with the necessaryintent, either does an act âcalculated to interfere with peace or comfortâ or âpersistently withdraws or withholds servicesâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The view we take is that sub-section (3) is intended to cover both situations. Where services are withdrawn or withheld this is achievedby a series of acts, so that sub-section (3) will apply, just as it would to a direct act calculated to interfere with peace or comfort.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> We considered whether it would be proper to award any compensation to Mrs. Chan Yin-mui, on the ground that the section providesfor compensation to a "tenant or sub-tenant", and the record was insufficiently clear as to whether she fell within that jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> This was not a point taken by counsel for the appellant and, not without some hesitation, since the record is incomplete as to this,we have come to the conclusion that, in reality, the wife and husband were probably joint sub-tenants and that the Judge has notbeen shown to have been wrong in taking her loss and inconvenience into account in assessing compensation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Having decided that we should not attempt to assess damages in the full civil claim sense, we are left with the task of attemptingto find a simple and understandable formula which will give appropriate compensation to sub-tenants who were undoubtedly badly treatedby the landlord.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The rent which was paid throughout the period of the offence, which was about seven months, was $514.80 a month. That rent was paidfor premises which were of very much less value to the sub-tenants than they would have been had electricity been available. It wouldbe unfair to say that, even without the electricity, the premises were worthless, because they were used by the sub-tenants to storegoods throughout this period.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> We, therefore, think that it would not have been unreasonable for the Judge to have found that the value of the premises, by virtueof the removal of the electricity, was greatly reduced and that about $400 a month of the rent was thrown away; or $2,800 for theperiod of seven months. To that figure should be added $5,000 for general inconvenience, making a total of $7,800, to be paid bythe appellant, instead of the earlier figure of $20,000. To that extent, therefore, the appeal succeeds and the compensation ordershould be varied accordingly.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> No order as to costs.</p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Christopher Smith (D.L.A.) for Appellant.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Winston Leung, Senior Crown Counsel, for Respondent/Crown Prosecutor.</p>        <hr style="text-align:left" width="33%" />        <p><a><font size="2">[1]</font></a><font size="2">   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20291" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 W.L.R. 291</a></font></p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/1987/183.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
