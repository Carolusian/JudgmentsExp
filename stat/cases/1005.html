By a written contract of employment dated 7th August 1991, the Plaintiff agreed to employthe Defendant and the Defendant agreed to serve the Plaintiff for an initial period of 2 years, subject to earlier determinationas therein provided, as Manager of Matheson PFC Indonesia. Clause 20(c) of the contract provided :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"You will be employed initially in Indonesia as Manager of Matheson PFC Indonesia, but the Company shall have an absolute discretionto require you at any time and from time to time to work in any other place or country in any part of the world, to vary the natureof your duties and to require you to carry out duties with any subsidiary of Associated Company."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Although no evidence was adduced on this point, it seems that the contract was made in Hong Kong and it certainly contains a HongKong choice of law clause. The contract contained a package of benefits usual in this sort of contract. In due course, the contractwas determined and by writ dated 9th December 1992, the Plaintiff claims against the Defendant $358,544.00 allegedly due and owingby the Defendant to the Plaintiff under the terms of this contract of employment.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> By summons dated 19th May 1992, the Defendant took out a summons seeking to set aside a default judgment which had been entered againsthim. In due course, the Master set aside the judgment. In seeking the setting aside of the judgment, the Defendant also sought anorder that the Statement of Claim be struck out and the action be dismissed or stayed "on the ground that the Plaintiff's claim iswithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal". The Master refused to strike out dismiss or stay the action and the Defendantnow appeals from that decision.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal can be found in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> which provides :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" (1) The tribunal shall have jurisdiction to inquire into, hear and determine the claims specified in the Schedule.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Save as is provided in this Ordinance, no claim within the jurisdiction of the tribunal shall be actionable in any court in HongKong."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Schedule 1 provided as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <div style="text-align:center">            <center>                <table border="0" width="90%">                    <tr>                        <td width="33%" class="quote">"</td>                        <td width="33%" class="quote">SCHEDULE</td>                        <td width="34%" class="quote">[s.7]</td>                    </tr>                </table>            </center>        </div>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1.

Put simply, the Ordinance provides that the contracts of such workersshould be in writing and should contain certain particulars set out in the Ordinance. There is a provision for attestation beforethe departure of the employee from Hong Kong and certain penalties are provided if the contract is not in writing or is not attestedas provided in the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Both counsel have agreed the following facts.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The Plaintiff's claim is "a claim for a sum of money which arises from ... the breach of a term, whether express or implied, ofa contract of employment";</p>        <p>(2) The contract of employment in question was actually performed (up to the time it was terminated) by the Defendant in Indonesia;</p>        <p>(3) The contract of employment in question was not one under an overseas contract as defined in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts for Employment Outside Hong Kong Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78">Cap. 78</a>).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Mr. Cheung has, as usual, set out in his very helpful skeleton that the disagreement between the parties boils down to :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Whether the phrase "whether for performance in Hong Kong or under an overseas contract as defined in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts for Employment Outside Hong Kong Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78">Cap. 78</a>)" is part of the <u>jurisdictional requirement</u> of the Labour Tribunal. In other words, if the contract of employment was not for performance in Hong Kong and was not one within<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78">Cap. 78</a>, does the Labour Tribunal have the jurisdiction to hear the claim?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) If the answer is no, whether the present contract of employment was "for performance in Hong Kong".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It has to be said that this is an unfortunate piece of drafting. The definition of "contract of employment" includes the words "whereverthe services are to be rendered". This cannot relate to whether the services are to be performed in one part of Hong Kong or another.It can only relate to whether they are to be performed within or without Hong Kong. It seems to me that one has to give considerableweight to the words used in the definition section.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Do the words used in the schedule require me, as it were, to strike down or limit the words used in the definition section. Afterhaving given this matter long and careful consideration, I think not. I believe that the wording in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 1(a)</a> was used in order to make perfectly plain that service carried out under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78">Cap. 78</a> was covered by the Ordinance. I think it most likelythat the draughtsman had forgotten about the words "wherever the services are to be rendered" in the definition of "contract of employment",and he was anxious to spell out the fact that such a claim came within the jurisdiction of the tribunal wherever the services underthe contract would be performed. The reference in Schedule I(a) to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78">Cap. 78</a> could well have been a mistaken assumption by the draughtsmanthat reference to a contract to which <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78">Cap. 78</a> applied was equivalent to performance outside Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I do not believe that the words in the second line of (a) in para. 1 of the Schedule commencing with the word "whether" were intendedto be words of limitation because surely they have to be read with the rest of the Ordinance which includes the definition section.One way of testing this is to substitute in para. 1(a) of the Schedule for the words "contract of employment" the words "an agreement... wherever the services are to be rendered". If that is done, para. 1(a) of the Schedule then reads as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A claim for a sum of money which arises from -</p>        <p class="quote">(a) the breach of a term, whether express or implied, of an agreement ... wherever the services are to be rendered, whether for performancein Hong Kong or under an overseas contract ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Paraphrasing the Schedule thus one can see, in my judgment, that the phrase commencing with the word "whether" is not there to cutdown the preceding phrase. Further, if the phrase beginning with the word "whether" did provide a geographical limitation, then thephrase "wherever the services are to be rendered" in the definition section would indeed be rendered superfluous. I would be mostreluctant, unless forced to do so, to find the words in the definition section of an Ordinance rendered superfluous by the wordingused in a Schedule, albeit, I accept, a Schedule which is intended to set out the claims in respect of which the tribunal will havejurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> If the Ordinance does not apply to cases where employees carry out work outside of Hong Kong certain absurdities arise. For instance,an employee could sue in the Labour Tribunal a foreign employer and vice versa, but he could not sue a local employer. I doubt thatit was ever the intention to make available this inexpensive and expedient means of dispute resolution to cases involving a foreignemployer hiring someone to work overseas but not to cases involving a local employer hiring someone to work overseas.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I have read the explanatory notes to the Bill which became the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a> and I have read the debates on the Bill in Hansard. I have also read three articles by Robert Ribeiro in (1978) HKLJ. However, noneof these materials assist me in divining the intention of the legislature.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> As I said, this is not an easy point of construction, but I have come to the conclusion that the claim made in this action by thePlaintiff against the Defendant is one within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal and I propose to declare accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It was agreed the costs will follow the event and therefore I propose to make a costs order nisi in favour of the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> This case was extremely ably argued by both counsel and I have found Mr. Cheung's thoughtful written submissions of great assistance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <div style="text-align:center">        <center>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Neil Kaplan)</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the High Court</td>                </tr>            </table>        </center>    </div>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. Erik Shum instructed by Baker &amp; McKenzie for Plaintiff/Respondent.</p>        <p>Mr. Andrew Cheung instructed by Siao Wen &amp; Leung for Defendant/Appellant.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1994/130.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
