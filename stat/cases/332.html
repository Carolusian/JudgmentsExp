For example</i> <i>âpsychosisâ, ten years ago it was never heard of, now everyone knows and apparently seems to be commonly used. Recently, the famoussongwriter Lam Jik (âAlbert Leungâ) has made an appearance to say that chronic diarrhoea may not be explained simply by a gastro-intenstinalinfection, but may be an anxiety disorder instead. If not properly treated, the mental disorder may worsen anytime. As to psychiatricillnesses which they are generally so called, it could be said that âthere is always one nearbyâ. Every now and then there isa crazy man or crazy woman wreaking havoc</i> <i>here and there, playing suicide by jumping off buildings or into the sea, or else they are chopping up their father, killing their</i> <i>mother, murdering their children; just thinking about it</i> <i>making one hairâs stand.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>                        With so many psychiatric illnesses, shouldnât the Hospital Authority be handling them carefully?  Of coursethey should, and in fact Kowloon Hospital opened up a Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment Centre this July; putting it nicely, itâsfor increasing the services to the mentally ill, receiving patients with acute psychiatric illness from Queen Elizabeth Hospital,United Hospital and Tseung Kwan O Hospital.  The Centre is equipped with four isolation wards, each room providing forty-five beds,seems like there should be no problem.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>                        Damn!  Thereâs actually a really big problem!  Some nurses have exposed the truth, the Centre had been overflowingsince it opened, every ward constantly over-admits up to seventy-something patients, raising the utility rate to 150%.  Every wardhas been forced to open up to thirty extra canvas cots, eight cots in the corridors are placed in front of the lavatory doors, thetelevision rooms in the patientsâ canteen is instead situated inside patientsâ rooms, which itself is crammed with eight to tencots.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>                        With overcrowded public housing, we always hear news that the cramped living space drives the occupants crazy,causing them to bicker and quarrel often, escalating to violence in more serious situations. Yet, even the psychiatric wards haveovercrowded households.  As each of the inmates already has mental problems, wouldnât the over-crowdedness add madness on top ofmadness!</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>                        In âTai Yat Dingâsâ</i> <i>opinion, the craziest must be the Hospital Authority, simply crazy in their planning.  Back when the Hospital Authority planned forpsychiatric services in the Kowloon Hospital network, other than taking in patients from Kwai Chung Hospital, they were only responsiblefor Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui and Kowloon Cityâs acute psychiatric illness patients, but the hospital management only cared aboutexpanding their departments and receiving greater funding allocations, they were willing to accept the Kowloon East population too;originally Kowloon Hospital was to care for half a million people, suddenly exploded up to 1.46 million people, gee, the HospitalAuthority unexpectedly allowed it.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>                        Hey, itâs bad enough being crammed until bursting, the canteen lacks emergency medical facilities, whatif something happens to a patient, when saving them will they spill my bowl of congee?  Even more absurdly, the hospital has recently</i> <i>âlet the cat out of the bagâ, that every ward may take up to eighty patients, almost eighty percent in overcapacity, even if youârecrazy you canât be so ridiculously insane!</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>                        Hospital Authority Chief Executive Shane Solomon is an Australian, his homeland is spacious and sparsely populated,with more kangaroos than people, no way would he tolerate such overcrowding in a hospital.  So why are the psychiatric wards crammedfull to bursting?  Tai Yat Ding could think of two reasons, one is âWhen in Rome, do as Romans doâ, he thinks that you guys inHong Kong have sparse land and a large population so you should already be accustomed to the cramped conditions, thereâs no harmin cramping it up a bit when treating illnesses; or else, as people âwould be stained red by staying near red dyeâ, he had rubbedoff madness by being near the mad.  He might have become crazy as a result of handling an increasing number of issues relating tomental illness.

It tends to give an ordinary reader the impressionthat mental patients are violent lunatics who would injure or kill other people at will, and thus stimulates in the reader fear orhatred towards persons with mental illness or heightens those feelings.  As to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Statement, the Plaintiff says that the word âç²â (madness) and the phrase âç²ä¸å ç²â (add madness on top of madness)are insulting descriptions of mental patients.  Reading in conjunction with the 1<sup>st</sup> Statement, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Statement encourages a contemptuous and degrading opinion towards persons with mental illness.  Finally, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Statement, which is the concluding sentence of the Article, tends to give an ordinary reader the incorrect impression that mentalillness is infectious.  It dissimulates the message that persons with mental illness can adversely affect people around them by turningthem insane.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Statement also has the effect of stimulating in the reader fear and hatred towards mental patients.  Overall, the Plaintiff claimsthat the 3 Statements depict a seriously degrading impression of mental patients, and have the effect of encouraging or enhancingthe publicâs misunderstanding, hatred and exclusion of persons with mental illness.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  According to Mr. Grossman SC, counsel for the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff is claiming the sums of $100,000 and $50,000 as damages forinjury to feelings and aggravated damages respectively as a result of the alleged disability vilification on the part of the Defendants.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The law</i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>(i)      The statutory provision</i></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  As this is the first case of its kind in Hong Kong, I would try to set out the legal principles relating to disability vilificationclaim in some details.

Hence, for the purpose of construingthe meaning of our s. 46, I will focus on the statutory provisions and the case law in NSW.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  After reading the relevant statutory provisions, one can immediately notice the similarities between s. 46 of the DDO and  s. 20C(1)of the NSWâs Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (âthe ADA 1977â), the latter of which reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âIt is unlawful for a person, by a public act, to incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of, a person orgroup of persons on the ground of the race of the person or members of the group.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  S. 20C(1) of the ADA 1977 deals with racial vilification.  There are also similar provisions relating to transgender vilification(s. 38S), homosexual vilification (s. 49ZT) and HIV/AIDS vilification (s. 49ZXB) in other parts of the ADA 1977.  Although the statutoryprovisions in NSW are related to other kinds of vilification, there is no reason why the case law relating to these provisions isnot applicable for the purpose of construing the meaning of our s. 46.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(ii)     Elements of vilification</i></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  According to the case law in NSW and the plain meaning of s. 46, there are 3 elements of the statutory tort of disability vilification:the plaintiff must be able to prove that the defendant committed: (i) a public activity; (ii) which incites; and (iii) hatred towards,serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of, another person with a disability or members of a class of persons with a disability(<i>Burns v Dye</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2002/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] NSWADT 32</a> at paragraph 14).</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  At the commencement of the trial, Ms. Tam SC, counsel for the Defendants, concedes that the publication of the Article in the Sunconstituted a public activity, and so I do not propose to deal with such element in the judgment.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(iii)    The meaning of âinciteâ</i></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  According to the case law in NSW, the word âinciteâ is to be given its ordinary natural meaning which is to âurge, spur on,stir up, animate, prompt, or to stimulate actionâ.  It is not unlawful if the words merely convey hatred or express serious contemptor severe ridicule.  There must be something more than an expression of opinion, something that is positively stimulatory of thatreaction in others (<i>Burns v Dye</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at paras. 19 and 20, <i>Veloskey v Karagiannakis</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADTAP/2002/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] NSWADTAP 18</a> at para. 21<i>,  Burns v Radio 2 UE Sydney Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2004/267.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] NSWADT 267</a> at paras. 32 &amp; 33, <i>Trad v Jones</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2009/318.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] NSWADT 318</a> at para. 161).</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It is well established that the conduct of incitement in this context is to be judged objectively.  The court is concerned withthe likely effect as opposed to the actual effect of the alleged conduct of incitement.  What is significant is the capacity of theconduct to stir up hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule; not whether it did, or was intended to.  It follows that proof ofintention on the part of the defendant is not necessary, nor is the fact that a person or persons were actually incited by the publicactivity to respond in a requisite manner (<i>Western Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd v Jones</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2000/102.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] NSWADT 102</a> at para. 93, <i>Burns v Dye</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 21, <i>Veloskey v Karagiannakis</i>, supra<i>.</i>, at paras. 24 &amp; 25, <i>Burns v Radio 2 UE Sydney Pty Ltd</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at paras, 12 &amp; 13).</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In deciding who must be incited for the purpose of the tort of vilification, the concept of the âordinary reasonable personâin the law of defamation is borrowed for the purpose of applying the aforesaid objective test.  According to the established caselaw, such a person is not immune from susceptibility to incitement nor holding prejudiced views.  He or she is of fair average intelligence,who is neither perverse, nor morbid or suspicious of mind, nor avid for scandal.  He or she does not live in an ivory tower but canand does read between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs.  He or she is describedas being representative of âa substantial and respectable group of the communityâ (<i>Western Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd v Jones</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at paras. 95-99<i>, Burns v Dye</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 22, <i>Veloskey v Karagiannakis</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 26).</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The court then has to ask the question: could the ordinary reasonable reader understand from the statements that he or she is beingincited to hatred towards or serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or persons on ground of disability?  The questionis not whether the ordinary reasonable person could reach such a conclusion after his or her own beliefs have been brought into playby the public activity (<i>Veloskey v Karagiannakis</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, at para. 28, <i>Burns v Dye</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 22, <i>John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Kazak</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADTAP/2002/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] NSWADTAP 35</a> at para. 16, <i>Collier v Sunol</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2005/261.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] NSWADT 261</a> at para. 42).  Hence, the test requires the purpose and the intent of the statements to be understood and appreciated objectivelyby the ordinary reasonable person, despite the fact that the subjective intention of the maker of the statements being irrelevant.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(iv)     The meanings of âhatredâ, âserious contemptâ and âsevere ridiculeâ</i></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  As to the meanings of the words âhatredâ, âserious contemptâ and âsevere ridiculeâ, the case law is also rather settled. Firstly, the words âhatredâ, âcontemptâ and âridiculeâ are to be given their ordinary dictionary meanings, but the lattertwo are qualified by the adjectives âseriousâ and âsevereâ respectively.  The use of these adjectives calls for an evaluativejudgment on the part of the tribunal of fact, within a broad discretion (<i>Veloskey v Karagiannakis</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 29).</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  âHatredâ means intense dislike; detestation, a feeling of hostility or strong aversion towards a person or thing; and activeand violent dislike (<i>Kazak v John Fairfax Publications Ltd</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 40, <i>Western Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd v Jones</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 100<i>, Burns v Dye</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 23).  Mr. Grossman concedes that the Plaintiff is not relying on the allegation that the 3 Statements would have the effectof inciting the public to have hatred towards mental patients.  He would therefore focus on the latter two of âserious contemptâand âsevere ridiculeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  âSeriousâ means important, grave or weighty.  âContemptâ means the action of scorning or despising, the mental attitudein which something or someone is considered as worthless or of little account; the feeling with which one regards anything consideredmean, vile or worthless (<i>Kazak v John Fairfax Publications Ltd</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 40, <i>Western Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd v Jones</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 100<i>, Burns v Dye</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 23).</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  âSevereâ means rigorous, strict, harsh or extreme.  âRidiculeâ means subject to ridicule or mockery; make fun of, deride,laugh at; or words or actions intended to excite contemptuous laughter at a person or thing.  âSevere ridiculeâ means harsh orextreme mockery or derision (<i>Kazak v John Fairfax Publications Ltd</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 40, <i>Western Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd v Jones</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 100<i>, Burns v Dye</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 23, <i>Burns v Radio 2 UE Sydney Pty Ltd</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 42).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(v)      The relevance of the content, style and context of the public activity</i></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In the case that the public activity complained of is the publication of certain statements, then the contents of the statements,the style of communication and their context, including the social and historical context, are relevant in determining whether thestatements incite hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule (<i>Kazak v John Fairfax Publications Ltd</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 71).</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The context of the communication must also be considered.  In determining whether conduct by a person has the relevantly inflammatorytendency, the circumstances in which the conduct took place are as important as what was said or done (<i>Trad v Jones</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 161).  In the case of the publication of an alleged offending article, 3 kinds of contexts have been identified as beingrelevant (<i>Kazak v John Fairfax Publications Ltd</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at paras. 45 &amp; 46):</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   the context of the particular words or phrases complained of in the article as a whole;</p>        <p>(ii)   the context of the article in the publication in which it appears; and</p>        <p>(iii)  the broad social context.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In determining the effect of the statements on an ordinary reasonable person, the publication must be taken as a whole, not theoffending passage isolated from the rest.  Those statements made in the same piece of message should be read in conjunction withone another (<i>Western Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd v Jones</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 101, <i>Burns v Radio 2 UE Sydney Pty Ltd</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at para. 34, <i>Collier v Sunol</i>, <i>supra.</i>, at paras. 43-45).</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  A complainantâs evidence on how the audience was affected is not relevant.

By reason of the insufficient resources, the Article blamed the HA for theescalation of the problems relating to persons with mental illness.  As I see it, the Article was not targeted towards people withmental illness.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  At the trial, Mr. Wong Yeung Kit, the Deputy Controller of the Chief Writersâ Office of The Sun and The Oriental Daily News, testifieson behalf of the Defendants.  Although his subjective understanding of the meaning of the Article is quite irrelevant, his evidenceabout the background and the context in which the Article was published is highly material for the court to consider the followingquestion: having regard to the content, style of communication and relevant context of the 3 Statements, whether the ordinary readerwould have understood that he or she is being incited to hate, or to have serious contempt for or severe ridicule of, any personor persons with mental illness.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The Article was published in a column titled âå¤ªä¸å®â (Tai Yat Ding)(âthe Columnâ) in The Sun.  It was a column devotedto commentary on current affairs and social issues.  According to Mr. Wong, the articles were often published in the Column withsharp criticism of government policies and government bodies, and on many occasions the subject of the criticism was the HA.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr. Wong also testifies that the style of the language commonly used in the Column was one of satirical commentary of current affairs. The writerâs opinion on the subject current social phenomenon was expressed in fiery, sarcastic and humorous language to achievethe effect of ventilating dissatisfaction and strong criticism on various social issues, government policies and government bodiesin a light-hearted manner from the point of view of an ordinary member of the public.  A colloquial style of language was employedto identify with the sentiment of the readers and to bring the publication closer to its readers.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>   Reading the Article as a whole, I agree with Ms. Tam that the writer was trying to make the following points in the Article:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   there are many people in Hong Kong with mental illness, as shown in some hair-raising incidents widely reported from time totime;</p>        <p>(ii)   these mental patients need medical attention, short of which their conditions would deteriorate;</p>        <p>(iii)   however, the hospital spaces provided by the HA are far from sufficient;</p>        <p>(iv)   the over-crowdedness in hospital wards provided for mental patients has reached an alarming level; and</p>        <p>(v)   this reflects a gross incompetence on the part of the management of the HA in terms of its assessment of the extent of the needfor such kind of services, and its judgment and planning.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The Article also has to be read in the broad social context.  Firstly, according to Mr. Wong, prior to or around the publicationof the Article, there were from time to time news reports from local press about incidents involving acts of physical violence, suicideor murder committed by persons suffering or suspected to be suffering from mental illness.  Not only incidents happened in Hong Kongwere reported but also incidents happened in the Mainland and Taiwan.  Secondly, around the time of the publication of the Article,it was also revealed by the local press and became widely known to members of the public that due to the ill-conceived planning andmisallocation of resources on the part of the HA, the psychiatric wards of Kowloon Hospital were extremely crowded with the utilityrate hitting 150% of their capacity and that some mental patients had to sleep outside the wards on canvas beds placed along thecorridors.  Even before that, news articles had been published by the local press reporting on the lack or shortage of medical treatmentsoffered to those patients suffering from mental illness.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr. Wong has produced numerous newspaper articles to substantiate his evidence about the broad social context.  Based on such material,I accept that members of the public, at the time of the publication of the Article, were generally aware of the numerous violentincidents involving mental patients, and there were social issue and concern as to whether the HA had devoted sufficient resourcesfor the treatment of mental patients.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  By reason of such concern, there was a news article on page A1 of the Main News Section of the 9 September 2006 issue of The Sunwith the title âèµ°å»å°å»ææºæ»¿å¸å¸åº ä¹é¾é«é¢é¼ç çäººçé£¯å â (Corridors Lined with Canvas Beds Extendingto Toilets â Kowloon Hospital Overcrowding â Patients Sleep in Canteen) (âthe News Reportsâ).  The following facts were revealedin the News Report:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   there was over-crowdedness (150% of its capacity in Kowloon Hospital), under-staffing and lack of basic facilities and resourcesin the psychiatric wards of public hospitals;</p>        <p>(ii)   mental patients had suffered considerably by reason of the above conditions;</p>        <p>(iii)   the aforesaid negative conditions had aggravated the mental conditions of these patients; and</p>        <p>(iv)   the underlying causes of the problems were the under-estimation of the need of the service, and the ill-conceived policy inplacing patients in over-crowded hospital wards without allocating additional recourses to cope with the increasing number of patients.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Obviously, the Article was published in the Column as a commentary corresponding to the News Report.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In my judgment, taking into account the contents of the Article, the style of communication commonly used in the Column and thebackground and the relevant context of the publication of the Article, an ordinary reasonable reader would have understood that thecommentary in the Article was written in response to the facts of great public concern in the News Report.  He or she would haveread the 3 Statements in the context of the Article and would have understood the content as neither targeting nor ridiculing personswith mental illness, but to ventilate dissatisfaction, anger and criticism on the problems engendered by what the writer perceivedas incompetence and poor judgment on the part of the HA, with a underlying sympathy for the plight of mental patients in Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(ii)    The effect of the 3 Statements</i></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In support of the claim, Mr. Grossman submits that the 1<sup>st</sup> Statement depicts most, if not all, people with mental illness in a global sense as being mad, disturbed, crazy, violent and generallya dangerous class of person.  This is not true and the 1<sup>st</sup> Statement is therefore calculated and deliberately inflammatory to vilify people with mental illness.  On the other hand, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Statement is clearly capable of leading ordinary reasonable person to hate or to be fearful of people with mental illness.  By publishingthis statement, in particular the use of the distasteful and derogatory label âç²â (mad), the Defendants were making fun ofpeople with mental illness and were inciting the readers to laugh at them.  Finally, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Statement conveys a meaning that those who associate with people with mental illness may well be affected by such illness.  Further,when read in conjunction with the 1<sup>st</sup> Statement, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Statement conveys an additional meaning that those associate with people with mental illness may therefore, as a consequence, behavein evil and wicked ways as described in the 1<sup>st</sup> Statement.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr. Grossman further says that the Article is capable of adversely affecting an ordinary reasonable person to think that peoplewith mental illness are worthless and vile, with the effect of destroying their personal autonomy and inherent dignity.  This amountsto serious contempt for those with mental illness.  Insofar as the Defendantsâ contention that the Article was written in a humorousstyle to criticise the HA and itâs then Chief Executive, Mr. Grossman says that this argument is only a camouflage under whichan unlawful purpose, namely disability vilification, was promoted. It is simply not humorous to jeer at incapacitated people. Ina nutshell, Mr Grossman submits that the distasteful Article is vulgar and demeaning, and insofar as it is meant to be humorous,it does no more than jeer and poke fun at those unfortunate enough to be incapacitated by a mental illness.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  With the greatest respect, Mr. Grossman has exaggerated the effect of the Article and the 3 Statements contained therein. As I havementioned above, one must look at the contents of the Article, the style of communication and its context, including the social andhistorical context, in determining whether the 3 Statements contained therein would have the capacity to incite an ordinary reasonablereader to have hatred towards, serious contempt for or severe ridicule of persons with mental illness.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In the 1<sup>st</sup> Statement, it was mentioned that mental illness is much more common nowadays and there would be lot of mental patients who are inneed of medical care in Hong Kong.  It also referred to a number of hair-raising incidents involving violence by persons with mentalillness.  However, ordinary reasonable readers would have been aware of these incidents by the reports in various news media.  Rightlyor wrongly, they might have certain views about these incidents, and I have grave doubt whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Statement would heighten whatever negative feelings it might have in these readers about people with mental illness.  As I have mentionedabove, the main theme of the Article was a satirical criticism of the HA in respect of its policy in allocating resources for treatingmental patients.  The underlying object of the Article was to urge the HA to devote more resources for the treatment of mental patientsin public hospitals. Mental patients were not the main targets in the Article, and so I do not accept that the 1<sup>st</sup> Statement would have the effect as contended for by Mr. Grossman, at least not to a significant extent.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Statement referred to the over-crowdedness in the psychiatric wards in public hospitals.  It advances the point that such alarmingenvironment for mental patients would be double jeopardy to them and could only worsen their conditions, hence the words âç²ä¸å ç²â(add madness on top of madness).</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  For the 3<sup>rd</sup> Statement, as admitted by the Plaintiff in his own evidence, no one would seriously believe that mental illness is a contagious illnessand that Mr. Solomon had contracted mental illness because he was closely involved in the administration of the HA.  I agree withMs. Tam that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Statement, being the concluding statement in the Article, only summarises the fiery criticism, which characterises the style of theColumn, directed solely at the Chief Executive of the HA.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Statement also has to be read in the context of the whole Article.  The first attempt of an âexplanationâ for Mr. Solomonâsunsatisfactory policies sets the tone: it is not to be taken seriously.  The writer conjectured light-heartedly that it could bethat Mr. Solomon, having come from Australia where there are more kangaroos than people, took the view that Hong Kong people wereused to extremely crowded conditions. Hospital inmates would therefore not be affected by over-crowded conditions. The second attemptedexplanation, equally light-hearted, plays on the double meaning of the word âç²â (mad), which is equivalent to âçâ (crazy),and loosely borrows from the Chinese idiom of âè¿æ±èèµ¤ï¼è¿å¢¨èé»â (literally translated as âone would be stainedred by staying near red dye, and stained black near black inkâ).  As I see it, this idiom would mean to an ordinary reasonableChinese reader that âoneâs morals and conduct would be influenced by oneâs friendsâ.  It is then used satirically, in a literarilyincorrect way, to string together with the phrase âè¿çèç²â (literally meaning âone who stays near the insane would becomeinsaneâ).</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Taking into account such background, I accept that an ordinary reasonable reader would understand that the statement is meant asa mockery of the incompetence of the Chief Executive of the HA alone.  Despite the satirical use of the Chinese idiom, no reasonablesuggestion could have arisen that Mr. Solomon could have contracted or ârubbed offâ mental illness from mental patients he hadto handle administratively as the illness is somehow contagious.  The final sentence, in which the writer called Mr. Solomon âé»ç·â(crazy), which is an equivalent of âçâ (crazy) in colloquial Cantonese, would have been understood by the ordinary reasonablereader as the writerâs indictment of him for his gross lack of judgment, and not targeting nor ridiculing persons with mental illness.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(iii)    The use of derogatory labels and distasteful words</i></p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In this regard, I must agree that the use of certain words in the Article is distasteful.  Certain derogatory labels and words wereused to describe people with mental illness and to comment on the problem of over-crowdedness in public hospitals, in particularthe use of the words âç²â (mad), âçâ (crazy), âç²ä¸å ç²â (add madness on top of madness), âè¿çèç²â (onewho stays near the insane would become insane) and âé»ç·â (crazy).  It is not too difficult to understand why the Plaintiffwas so upset by the contents of the Article. Despite that the subjective feeling of the Plaintiff is not particularly relevant indetermining whether the Defendantsâ conduct was to amount to disability vilification, it showed that the writer of the Articlewas insensitive to the feelings of people with mental illness.  Even Ms. Tam does not seek to argue otherwise.  While I myself condemnthe use of such words, having taken into account all the circumstances of the case, I nevertheless have some reservation whetherthe distasteful Article was capable of inciting hatred towards, or serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of people with mentalillness.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>   Since the word âinciteâ is used in s. 46 and the words âcontemptâ and âridiculeâ are qualified by the adjectives âseriousâand âsevereâ respectively, there is a threshold for the tort of disability vilification.  In this regard, the case law in NSWprovides some assistance as to how the court should draw the difficult line for the purpose of characterising conduct as vilification. In the cases referred below, despite the use of offending words in the public activities, the New South Wales Administrative DecisionsBoard (âNSWADTâ) dismissed the relevant vilification complaints.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In <i>Burns v Dye</i>, <i>supra.</i>, the applicant Mr. Burns made complaints of homosexual vilification against the respondent Mr. Dye.  One of the complaints was thatMr. Dye had on various occasions called him offensive names in front of the neighbours or in some public places like supermarket. The offensive names were derisory terms used for homosexual males.   Mr. Dye was usually drunk on these occasions.  While the NSWADTaccepted that Mr. Dyeâs language and behaviour were not only highly offensive but also an unwelcome and threatening intrusion intoMr. Burnâs life, it was not comfortably satisfied that the offending abuse constituted homosexual vilification.  According to theTribunal, it had to take into account the circumstances in which the abuse occurred, including the context in which the abuse occurred,the tone of the voice used by the alleged vilifier and the observable relationship between the vilifier and his or her victim.  Inthe opinion of the Tribunal, a section of the community would have dismissed Mr. Dyeâs conduct as the rantings of a drunken, possiblymentally-ill individual, and so the Tribunal was not comfortably satisfied that the abuse would have incited the feelings of hatredand serious contempt in third parties.  The Tribunal, nevertheless, upheld some other complaints of Mr. Burns.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Another example is the case of <i>Veloskey v Karagiannakis</i>, <i>supra.</i>  In this case, the complainants identified themselves as the descendants of an Aegean Macedonian population.  They complained thatthe newspaper article written by the respondent had incited hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of Aegean Macedonianson the ground of their race.  Whilst the NSWADT found that the language in the article overall was pejorative and strident, in partsderisory, and the article as a whole expressed hostility towards, contempt for and ridicule of those who identified themselves asMacedonian, the Tribunal was not persuaded to the requisite standard that the contempt and ridicule warranted the description ofâseriousâ or âsevereâ.  In the opinion of the Tribunal, the ordinary reader, unaffected by ethnical prejudices, would bemore likely to treat the article as a political harangue.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The qualification of the words âseriousâ and âsevereâ had also been discussed in the decision of the NSWADT in <i>Burns v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In this case, the same Mr. Burns complained that there was homosexual vilification in a television programme, and so he lodgeda complaint against the television station and the two presenters of the programme.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In deciding the meaning of the words âsevere ridiculeâ, the NSWADT referred to the debates in the legislature during the passingof the statute.  By that time, there was a concern that the ambit of the provision was too wide.  In reply, the Attorney Generalof NSW said â[it was] not the intention of the Government to cover matters of a trivial natureâ, and he dismissed suggestionsthat the vilification laws would âstop the telling of Irish or Hungarian jokesâ (see para. 38 of the decision).  I can only assumethat the legislature in Hong Kong, being the only few jurisdictions which enacted laws on disability vilification, was also intendings. 46 to cover only the more serious cases.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The NSWADT then went on to say the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â39.    It is clear from the debates in relation to both the racial vilification and homosexual vilification provisions that theParliament was concerned to âachieve a balance between the right to free speech and the right to an existence free from â¦ vilificationand its attendant harmâ (Hansard Legislative Assembly, 10 May 1989, p7489-90; and see McNamara L, Regulating Racism Sydney Instituteof Criminology, 2002, at 127-130).  We must have that consideration in mind when deciding where the line is to be drawn for purposesof characterising conduct as vilification.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>40.    We consider the ordinary meaning of the term âsevere ridiculeâ having regard to the guidance given by the parliamentarydebates, by common dictionary definitions (see eg Burns v Dye; John Fairfax Publications Limited v Kazak), and by our own understandingof the ordinary meaning of the words.  A distinction can be drawn between âmild ridicule, mere mockery or derisionâ, and âharshor extreme mockery derisionâ (see eg Burns v Dye at [23]).  The Appeal Panel in Voloskey &amp; Anor v Karagiannis &amp; Ors. At[29] said that âsevere ridiculeâ equates with âextreme derisionâ.  But while these views refine the meaning of âsevereridiculeâ by describing different degrees of severity, they do not greatly assist in being able to say when conduct has crossedthe âsevere ridiculeâ line.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>41.    Qualifiers such as âmildâ and âharshâ are relative measures of degree, and cannot be understood in the abstract anymore than the wrong that parliament means to address through this legislation exists in the abstract.  The parliamentary debatesmake clear that that wrong is the causing of, at worst, physical harm, and, at least, offence and distress, to people on the groundof a characteristic, in this case homosexuality.  To identify ridicule that is âmildâ on the one hand and âharshâ on theother could involve a judgment as to the possible impact of the ridicule on the type of person to whom it is directed. An indicatorthat conduct is âsevere ridiculeâ could therefore be an assessment that it could reasonably cause distress or offence to a personwith that characteristic.  But conduct can be severe ridicule without that assessment being made.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>42.    We understand âsevere ridiculeâ to be âharsh or extreme mockery or derisionâ.  As a tribunal of fact, we make an evaluativejudgment within a broad discretion as to whether the conduct amounts to âsevere ridiculeâ (see Veloskey &amp; Anor v Karagiannakis&amp; Ors at [29]).â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  As I see it, the theme of the Article was so clear that it contained a satirical criticism of the policy of the HA.  As the Articlewas not targeted towards mental patients, it would, to a great extent, minimise the impact of the distasteful words.  In fact, theArticle seemed to suggest that mental patients were in need of help and as a result more resources should be devoted for the treatmentof these patients.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Furthermore, I have reminded myself of the danger of reading the Article in the context of an anti-discrimination litigation.  Isuppose if I ask someone to read the Article and tell him or her that this Article is the subject matter of a disability vilificationclaim, one can then easily pick up the distasteful words in the Article used to describe mental patients.  However, this was notwhat happened when the readers read the Article which was published on 9 September 2006.  When the readers read the Article, theywould treat it as a commentary on social issues and affairs.  They would take into account the broad social context, the News Reportin A1 section of The Sun and the style of the Column.  After reading the Article, the readers would have sensed the strong and satiricalcriticism against the management of the HA.  This became the main theme of the Article, and as a result it would lessen the impactof the distasteful words used in the Article about mental patients.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Finally, Mr. Grossman submits that as The Sun was a widely circulated newspaper in Hong Kong, the Article would be rather influentialin shaping the public opinion.  However, I am of the view that such argument cannot take the Plaintiffâs case any further.  Inmy judgment, one must not lose sight of the fact that mental patients were not the targets of the Article and the contents of theArticle would have been understood by ordinary reasonable readers to be a commentary to ventilate dissatisfaction, anger and criticismon the unsatisfactory policy on the part of the HA.  The opinion advocated by the Article was certainly to call for more resourcesto be allocated for the treatment of mental patients, and not targeting nor ridiculing persons with mental illness.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid, despite that I condemn the use of the distasteful and insensitive words in the Article, I am not comfortablysatisfied that the publication of the 3 Statements would have the capacity to incite the ordinary reasonable readers to have thefeelings of hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of persons with mental illness, or that any of the Statementshas crossed the âserious contemptâ or âsevere ridiculeâ line.  I therefore dismiss the Plaintiffâs claim of disabilityvilification.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Liability of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</i></p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The aforesaid reasons would have been sufficient to dispose the case.  However, since the parties have devoted considerable timeat the trial to deal with other related issues, I feel obliged to give my views on these issues as well.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The first of these issues is that, assuming that the publication of the Article was to amount to disability vilification, whetherthe 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, being the holding company of the Oriental Press Group, should be held liable for such wrong under s. 46 of the DDO.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is and was the registered proprietor, printer and publisher of The Sun under the RLNO.  Despite that, the Plaintiff seeksto argue that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant should also be liable for the publication of the Article because it was the actual proprietor of The Sun.  So far as theevidence is concerned, the Plaintiff is relying on the following facts:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant wholly owns The Sun News (Holding) Ltd. (âSHNLâ), which in turns wholly owns The Sun News Ltd. (âSNLâ), which inturn wholly owns the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant;</p>        <p>(ii)   the only director of SNHL, SNL and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is one Mr. Lam Shun Chuen, who has been the executive director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant since October 1999 and is currently the Chief Executor Officer of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, and SNHL, SNL and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant have the same company secretary and the same address of registered office;</p>        <p>(iii)   the business of The Sun was extensively mentioned in the Annual Report of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, in particular the advertising revenue of The Sun and the two adjustments of the retail price of the Sun were stated tohave boosted the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs overall income; and</p>        <p>(iv)   according to the website of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is described as the owner of The Sun and the copyright owner of the contents of The Sun, and The Sun is also describedas the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs second daily.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In the light of the above, Mr. Grossman submits that it would be to fly in the face of reality to hold that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, a shell company with a nominee director and no asset or operational function, could be the proprietor of The Sun simplybecause of the fact of registration.  Further, Mr. Grossman relies on the cases of <i>Secretary for Justice v Oriental Press Group Ltd. &amp; Ors.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKLRD%20123" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKLRD 123</a> and <i>Oriental Daily Publisher Ltd. &amp; Anor. v Ming Pao Holdings &amp; Ors.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%204%20HKC%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 4 HKC 354</a> and submits that registration as proprietor and publisher under the RLNO is not conclusive as to the true identities of the proprietorand the publisher of a newspaper, and that it is only a factor to be taken into account when the court considers all the evidenceplaced before it on the issue.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Mr. Grossman further relies on the presumption in s. 15 of the RLNO which reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âOn the trial of the proprietor, printer, publisher</i> <i>or editor of any local newspaper, or the printer of any other document, for any offence in which an ingredient is the publicationof matter contained in any issue of such local newspaper or in such document, the accused person shall be presumed to have publishedall matter contained in such issue or in such document, as the case may be, unless he proves that the publication was made withouthis authority, consent or knowledge, and that the publication did not arise from want of the due care or caution on his part.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  However, one must first understand the nature of a vilification claim under the DDO.  According to s. 72(1), the nature of a causeof  action under the DDO is one of tort. Since both Defendants are alleged to be the primary tortfeasors in the pleading, in orderto make the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant liable, the Plaintiff has to show that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant took part in an activity in public which had incited hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of personswith disability.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In this regard, Mr. Lai Kam Wa Kenneth, the Assistant to the Chairman of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, confirms at the trial that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was not involved in the publication of the Article.  Further, Mr. Wong, the said Deputy Controller of the Chief WritersâOffice of The Sun and The Oriental Daily News, confirms in his testimony that he did not need to report to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in respect of the materials published in the Sun.  In such circumstances, there is simply no evidence to support that the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was involved in the publication of the Article.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The Plaintiff seeks to make good his case by demonstrating that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was the ultimate parent company of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and that part of the profit made by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was channelled up to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  However, the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants were still two separate entities in law.  There is no evidence before the court about the actual operation of the Sun,for example, whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had kept a separate financial account of the business of the Sun.  In such circumstances, the fact that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was the ultimate indirect owner of The Sun is, without more, insufficient to show that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was directly involved in the publication of the Article.  That was the reason why Chu J, in <i>Apple Daily Ltd. v Oriental Press Group Ltd. &amp; Ors.</i>, unreported, HCA 1396/2009 &amp; HCA481/2009 (decision on 30 November 2010), dismissed the alleged infringement of copyright claimagainst the parent company of the Oriental Press Group for the alleged infringement committed by the âon-lineâ publication ofthe Group.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Further, the two cases relied upon by Mr. Grossman cannot assist the Plaintiffâs case.  The court in <i>Secretary for Justice v The Oriental Press Group Ltd.</i> had to deal with a case of criminal contempt in respect of certain articles published in a newspaper.  Under the common law, theproprietor of a newspaper is responsible for the contempt of court committed by the publication in its newspaper, and so the courthad to ascertain the identity of the real proprietor for the liability under the contempt.  On the other hand, the court in <i>Oriental Daily Publisher Ltd. v Ming Pao Holdings Ltd.</i> had to ascertain the proper plaintiff for the purpose of a defamation claim.   In such case, the subsidiary company might not bethe party being defamed in the context of that particular claim.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Neither can the Plaintiff rely on the presumption contained in s. 15 of the RLNO.  The said provision clearly states that the presumptiononly applies to the trial of the proprietor for an âoffenceâ, and âoffenceâ is defined in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap. 1</a> to include âany crime and any contravention or other breach of, or failure to comply with, any provision of any law, forwhich a penalty is providedâ. The remedies provided under the DDO are not âpenaltiesâ, and so the presumption does not applyto a civil action like the present one.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid, even if the Plaintiff can establish a case of disability vilification, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would not be liable for such wrong committed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Statutory defence</i>s <i>under the DDO</i></p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In the Defence filed by the Defendants, it is contended that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Statement was a fair report of the overcrowding problem in the psychiatric wards in public hospitals and a fair comment of its consequencesor potential consequences, and that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Statement was a fair criticism of the management of the HA in relation to its planning for the provision of facilities and servicesfor mental patients.  By raising such averments, it is not certain whether the Defendants are relying on the statutory defences in<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 46(2)</a> of the DDO.  However, Ms. Tam does not seek to pursue such defences at the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  On the other hand, the Defendants rely on the statutory defence under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 50(b)</a> of the DDO.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 50</a> reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âNothing in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III</a>, IV or V shall render unlawful an act that is reasonably intended to â</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i> â¦ â¦ â¦</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>(b)  </i> <i>afford persons with a disability or a particular disability, goods or access to services, facilities or opportunities to meet theirspecial needs in relation to â</i></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"><i>(i)   employment, education, clubs or sports;</i></p>            <p class="quote"><i>(ii)   the provision of premises, goods, services or facilities; or</i></p>            <p class="quote"><i>(iii)   their capacity to live independently;</i> <i>â¦ â¦ â¦â</i></p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  According to Mr. Wong, the said Deputy Controller of the Chief Writersâ Office, the central message and the underlying purposeof the Article was to criticise the HA and its Chief Executive for their ill-conceived planning and their failure to provide sufficientfacilities and satisfactory services for the treatment of mental patients.  In such circumstances, it is argued that the 3 Statementswere reasonably intended by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to afford persons suffering from mental illness access to adequate and appropriate hospital services and facilities, therebyentitling the Defendants to rely on the statutory defence in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 50(b).</a></p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  It seems that there has been no legal authority, whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere, relating to such statutory defence.  Despitethat, I have great reservation whether the Defendants can rely on such defence if the court were to conclude that the publicationof the 3 Statements was to amount to disability vilification.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  If the Defendants have to rely on such statutory defence, the court has already concluded that the contents of the 3 Statementswere capable of inciting ordinary readers to have serious contempt for or serious ridicule of persons with mental illness.  TheseStatements also amounted to harsh or extreme mockery or derision of persons with mental illness.  As it was not absolutely necessaryfor the Defendants to use these derogatory descriptions in order to report or comment on the problem of over-crowdedness in the psychiatricwards in public hospitals, it is very difficult for the Defendants to say that the inclusion of the 3 Statements in the Article wasâreasonablyâ intended by the Defendants to fight for more resources for mental patients.  Hence, such defence should not be availableto the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  As I have mentioned above, my view on the availability of the statutory defence is purely academic.  To a certain extent, my discussionon such subject is rather unrealistic, because I do not share the view of the Plaintiff that the publication of the 3 Statementswould have had such drastic effect as alleged by him.  Despite that, I also express my view on such defence so that one can havea whole picture of the issues that have been canvassed at the trial.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>The appropriate package of remedies</i></p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The last related issue is remedy.  The Plaintiff claims the sums of $100,000 and $50,000 as damages for injury to feelings and aggravateddamages respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In my judgment, in the case that liability is established, it is not appropriate to award damages to the Plaintiff in the circumstancesof the present case.  As I see it, it does make a difference whether the disability vilification was targeted towards an individualperson or a class of persons with disability.  In the former, the court should focus on the damages suffered by an individual andtry its best to assess his or her damages resulting from the vilification.  In the case of the latter, vilification was not targetedtowards an individual but to a class of persons.  In such case, the effect of the vilification on an individual plaintiff would bemore indirect.  Further, in extending the ambit of the vilification claim to cover a class of persons, it seems that the focus ofthe legislature is to try to stop such unlawful act rather to redress the loss of each individual person.  As the number of potentialplaintiffs for such kind of claim can be enormous, the potential liability would far out-weight the culpability of the wrong committedby the defendant.  Hence in the circumstances of the present case, I am of the view that an apology order would be a more appropriateremedy.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  In this regard, I have taken note of the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Ma Bik Yung v Ko Chuen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282006%29%209%20HKCFAR%20888" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2006) 9 HKCFAR 888.</a>  According to the said case, the District Court has a wide range of remedies at its disposal in dealing with anti-discriminationclaims, and it is for the court to fashion the remedies that are appropriate for the case in question.  In deciding on the remedyor the package of remedies, the court should consider the matter in the round and take a global approach.  The remedies granted shouldensure respect for the legislation and its purpose.  In fashioning the remedies, the court should be prepared, where necessary, tobe innovative.  At the same time, it should be flexible and pragmatic.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The Court of Final Appeal also confirmed that the court has power under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 72(4)(b)</a> of the DDO to make an apology order against an unwilling defendant.  However, as the making of an apology order may arguably infringethe defendantâs guaranteed freedom of thought and conscience, it is only in a rare case with exceptional circumstances that thecourt should consider making an apology order against an unwilling defendant and when it does so, it has to proceed with great circumspection. The court should also carefully consider the partiesâ representations in this regard.  Before an apology order can be made againstan unwilling defendant, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 72(4)(b)</a> requires the court to be satisfied that an insincere apology: (a) would redress the plaintiffâs loss and damage to some extent;and (b) is a reasonable act for the defendant to perform in the circumstances of the case.  Li CJ had also listed out the appropriateprocedure for the making of an apology order, which includes the making of a provisional order with an opportunity to the partiesto make submissions before the making of the final order.  In the case that the court declines to make a final apology order, thecourt may substantially increase the quantum of damages in order to fill the deficiency of the lack of the apology order.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  After considering the judgment in <i>Ma Bik Yung</i>, I am still of the view that an apology order would be a more appropriate remedy in the present case than an award of damages. Asthe 3 Statements were directed towards a class of mental patients as a whole rather than to the Plaintiff as an individual, orderingthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (as I am of the view that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant should not be liable in any event) to pay damages to one particular plaintiff may not be appropriate. Further, orderingthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to apologise would also be a clear message to the community that such kind of conduct is unlawful under the DDO.  Hence,in the case that liability is established, I would not award any damages to the Plaintiff but to make a provisional apology order. In the case that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is still unwilling to offer an apology and the court decides to omit the same in the final order, the court will then followthe approach as laid down by the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Ma Bik Yung</i> and consider how to fill such deficiency in the final package of remedies.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Conclusion</i></p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid, the Plaintiffâs complaint of disability vilification is unsubstantiated and I therefore dismiss thePlaintiffâs claim.  There are special costs provisions relating to DDO claim in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s73c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 73C(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>.  Unless the provisos apply, the normal rule is that each party to such claim shall bear its own costs of the legal proceedings. I therefore make an order <i>nisi</i> that there be no order as to costs of this action, which shall be made absolute 21 days after the date of the handing down of thisjudgment.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to all the counsel for the assistance that they have rendered to this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">(David Lok)<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr. Clive Grossman SC and Ms. Kay Seto, instructed by the Equal Opportunities Commission, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Ms. Winnie Tam SC and Mr. Anson Wong, instructed by Messrs.
