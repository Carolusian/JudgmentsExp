class="pseudopara" id="p2" name="p2">2.</a> This is an interlocutory appeal arising from the arrest of a ship "Resource 1" (ex Tiansheng No. 8) pursuant to an action in rembrought by cargo-owners against the shipowner. The shipowner seeks the discharge of the bail bond which had been posted consequentupon the release of the ship. It does so upon one ground: That the court had no jurisdiction to issue the warrant of arrest in thefirst place. The history of the litigation is fully set out in Mr Justice Bokhary PJ's judgment and needs no repetition.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p3" name="p3">3.</a> The litigation has, from the outset, been bedevilled by procedural entanglement. As Mr Justice Bokhary PJ has noted in his judgment,the proceedings started with a summons issued on 25 April 1998 by the present shipowner for an order that the warrant of arrest (issuedon 9 February 1997) be set aside, and the bail bond be returned. The cargo-owner's riposte to that summons was to take a preliminarypoint: That it was out of time under Order 12 rule 8 of the Rules of the High Court<sup><sup><sup>1</sup></sup></sup> and therefore must fail <em>in limine</em>. Hence, when the summons went before Waung J for determination in January 1999, the "time issue" was treated as something standingon its own. The application of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12B(4)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a>, to the circumstances of this case - "the jurisdiction issue" - was treated by the judge as a separate issue. Having decidedthe "time issue" against the shipowner, he said it was not necessary for him to decide the "jurisdiction issue": But "for the sakeof completeness" he resolved it against the shipowner as well.</p>    <p class="heading">The issues</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p4" name="p4">4.</a> In reality, "time issues" seldom stand alone, divorced from the context in which the matter is raised. There were before the judgetwo undisputed facts :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(1) The cargo-owners had issued a writ in rem on 23 November 1996 against the ship "Tian Sheng No. 8" which, they themselves averred,was registered in Panama.</p>        <p align="justify">(2) The Panamanian registry showed that, at the time the writ was issued, Tiansheng Shipping Inc. ("TSI") was the registered ownerof the ship.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p5" name="p5">5.</a> Pausing here, what legal consequences flow from these two facts? Obviously, if TSI were "the person who would be liable on the claimin an action in personam" in terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12B(4)</a>, the fact that the ownership has since changed and the present shipowner - International Resources Investment Inc. ("IRI") - hadacquired ownership of the vessel after the writ was issued is irrelevant: An action in rem can still be brought against the ship:Under para (i) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12B(4)</a><sup><sup><sup><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">2</a></sup></sup></sup>   the relevant time for considering ownership is "the time when the action is brought": To this extent, as Mr Sussex SC counsel forthe shipowner conceded, "the sins of the forefathers" can be visited upon the new shipowner. So the crucial issue is this: Was TSIthe person "who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam"?</p>    <p class="heading">Admiralty Jurisdiction</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p6" name="p6">6.</a> The cargo-owners invoked the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court because their claims came within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12A(2)(g)</a> and (h) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a>: claims for loss of or damage to goods carried in the ship, and claims arising out of agreements relating to the carriage of goodsin the ship. But they were not suing upon bills of lading issued by or on behalf of TSI; their causes of action were based upon billsof lading issued by or on behalf of Tiansheng Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd ("Ocean") as carrier. On the face of their own case, it didnot come within the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12B(4)(b)</a> regulating the mode of exercise of the admiralty jurisdiction, unless Ocean was "the owner" of the ship when the cause of actionarose and when the action was brought, in the sense of being "the beneficial owner as respects all the shares in it" in terms of<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12B(4)(b).</a></p>    <p class="heading">Warrant of Arrest</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p7" name="p7">7.</a> The affidavit sworn by the cargo-owners' solicitor (Mr Eyre) in support of the application for the warrant of arrest said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The property to be arrested is the ship or vessel 'Tian Sheng No. 8' now named 'Resource 1' <em>of the port of Panama.</em> The ship ... is the ship in connection with which the claim arose."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a> The affidavit went on to say that a search made at the Panamanian registry showed that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"throughout the period from 1 August 1996 to 5 December 1996, being the period when both the cause of action arose and the proceedingsin this action were commenced, the vessel was in the ownership of Tiansheng Shipping Inc, a Panamanian company."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a> Upon these facts it is clear that the warrant of arrest was issued beyond the jurisdiction of the court: Unless "owner" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12B(4)(b)</a> means something other than "registered owner", in relation to a ship which is actually registered in one of the recognised shippingregistries of the maritime world.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p10" name="p10">10.</a> In Mr Eyre's affidavit he went on to say that there was "some uncertainty concerning ownership" and referred to the September andDecember 1996 supplements to Lloyd's Register of Ships as showing Ocean to be the owner: The affidavit went on to say that Oceanwas "a company based in Hainan Island, PRC". Correspondence between Mr Eyre and the Information Administrator of Lloyds Registerwas exhibited. This shows that the information published in the Register was "obtained from sources believed to be reliable", butLloyd's Register of shipping was "unable to guarantee the accuracy of all details" and Lloyd's Register did not accept liabilityfor inaccuracies. The last communication from the Register's Information Administrator said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The information which Lloyd's Register used to publish notification that the above vessel had changed to the ownership/control ofHainan Tiansheng Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd appears to have come from information published by Registro Italiano ... which was her ClassificationSociety at the time in question."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p11" name="p11">11.</a> The affidavits do not reveal whether any inquiry was pursued with the Italian Classification Society concerning ownership.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p12" name="p12">12.</a> There was other material put before the court which shows that Ocean was part of a group comprising TSI and another company calledHainan Tiansheng Transportation and Rent Co. ("T&amp;R") and that Ocean played an active role in managing the ship. In particularthere was the following: (1) A bare boat charterparty dated 12 November 1995 whereby TSI chartered the vessel to T&amp;R for oneyear from 16 November 1995. (2) A time charterparty dated 8 September 1996 whereby T&amp;R chartered the vessel to Ocean. Under thischarterparty Ocean was responsible for providing the crew. (3) A voyage charterparty dated 9 September 1996 whereby Ocean charteredthe vessel to Royal Pacific Lines Ltd for the carriage of bagged cement from a northern Chinese port to Bangladesh: It was pursuantto this voyage that the cargo-owners' action in rem against the ship arose.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p13" name="p13">13.</a> When the shipowner's summons was heard by Waung J in January 1999 (nearly a year after the arrest) the cargo-owners took the "preliminarypoint", as mentioned earlier, that the application was out of time: That was the focus of the proceedings before the judge. On the"jurisdiction issue", the cargo-owners' contention was that the person liable in personam on their claim for damages - Ocean - wasalso the owner at the time the cause of action arose and when the writ was issued: A contention which went against the material theyhad put forward showing that TSI was the registered owner.</p>    <p class="heading">Registered owner</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p14" name="p14">14.</a> It is common ground that a ship like "Resource 1" which plies the high-seas from port to port, for the purpose of trade, must beregistered at a recognised registry and carry the flag of that jurisdiction: Otherwise it would not be able to enter port, dischargeand load cargo and generally utilize its facilities. When ships are registered under the names of one-ship companies - as most shipsare - the inference must be, as a matter of common-sense, that the company is the legal and beneficial owner of all the shares inthe <em>ship</em>: There is no reason for it to be otherwise: The <em>shares</em> in the <em>company</em> which is the registered owner might well be owned by different persons, or held in trust for others, but that does not alter thefundamental proposition that the registered owner is the legal and beneficial owner of all the shares in the <em>ship</em>. As Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR remarked in <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20WLR%201090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 WLR 1090</a> at 1096 E-F:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"... in real commercial life ... registered owners, even when one-ship companies, are not bare legal owners. They are both legal andbeneficial owners of all the shares in the ship and any division between legal and equitable interests occurs in relation to theregistered owner itself, which is almost always a juridical person. The legal property in its shares may well be held by A and theequitable property by B, but this does not affect the ownership of the ship or of the shares in that ship. They are the legal andequitable property of the company."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p15" name="p15">15.</a> It is possible that registration is, as a matter of law, not conclusive on the issue of ownership; conceivably, there are circumstanceswhere it might be shown that the registered owner was in fact not the legal and beneficial owner of all the shares in the ship: Thefraudulent procurement of registration would be an example. But, in the general run of things, registration would be virtually conclusive,and it would take a wholly exceptional case for it to be otherwise. In this regard, I note the references in Mr Justice Bokhary PJ'sjudgment to <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> at p.1095H to 1096E and to Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ's judgment in <strong>Haji Ioannou v. Frangos</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 2 Lloyd's Rep 337</a> at 353: There the English Court of Appeal was not dealing with a situation such as ours where the judge was invited to disregardthe ship's register altogether</p>    <p class="heading">The courts below</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> In approaching the summons in the way he did, Waung J in effect inverted the burden of proof. He said that the weakness of the ship-owner'scase was "its heavy reliance on internal documents" and referred to (1) the bare-boat charterparty from TSI to T&amp;R dated 12 November1995 and (2) the time charterparty between T&amp;R and Ocean, spanning the relevant period. The suggestion seems to be - though thejudge did not expressly say so - that these documents were fabricated for the purpose of disguising Ocean's real ownership of thevessel: The judge could not in fact have made such a finding because there was no cross-examination of any of the deponents to theaffidavits; hence the judge categorised it as no more than a "weakness" in the shipowner's case. He considered it significant that"vital non-internal documents such as the Bill of Sale to TSI (the alleged owner), the payment by TSI for the purchase of the vesselwere never shown to the court." However, the ship-owner was <em>not</em> relying upon those documents: It was relying upon the plaintiffs' own averment, supported by the provisional <em>patente</em> issued by the Panamanian registry, that at the material time the ship was registered in Panama; this was the <em>only</em> registration of this ship; it showed TSI as the registered owner, not Ocean. The judge criticized the unsatisfactory way the Panamanianauthorities set about the procedures for registration: That they proceeded on the say-so of a lawyer; that they required no documentationor proof of ownership; that the registration was merely a <em>provisional</em> one. This is all beside the point. The weaknesses in the Panamanian procedures may be a matter which the maritime nations of theworld would need one day to take up and redress: It cannot affect the rights and liabilities of the parties before the court.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p17" name="p17">17.</a> The judge contrasted the suspect documents (which he categorised as "internal documents") with an "undoubtedly genuine document",the voyage charterparty between Ocean and Royal Pacific Lines Ltd dated 9 September 1996 (referred to earlier) and came to the conclusionthat, in truth, Ocean was at all material times the owner of the vessel. In this regard the judge appears to have overlooked thefact that all 3 documents came from the same source: Mr Chi, who described himself as "General Manager and Legal Representative"of Ocean, and had exhibited all three documents, in proceedings which were, in fact, unrelated to the challenge to jurisdiction.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p18" name="p18">18.</a> In my judgment there was no material before the judge to displace the conclusion that, at the time when the causes of action arose,TSI being the registered owner was "the owner" of the ship in terms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12B(4)(b)</a> and hence the exercise of jurisdiction in rem over the ship was misconceived. Subject, therefore to the question whether the judgeshould in these circumstances have given an extension of time to enable the challenge to jurisdiction under Ord. 12 r. 8 to succeed,the shipowner was in an unassailable position on its challenge.</p>    <p class="heading">Another procedural twist</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p19" name="p19">19.</a> So far, what is set out above is straightforward. Unfortunately, in the courts below, there was another procedural twist. Mr SussexSC sought to by-pass the time limit in Ord. 12 r. 8(1) by arguing that Ord. 75 r. 13<sup><sup><sup>3</sup></sup></sup> gave the shipowner an alternative procedure for challenging jurisdiction and seeking the release of the bail bond. In this regard,I have read in draft Sir Anthony Mason NPJ's judgment and agree with it. Where a specific provision appears in the Rules to governa matter such as this - here Ord. 12 r. 8(3)(a) dealing specifically with challenges to jurisdiction in admiralty actions in rem- it would be very odd that the Rules should permit the party mounting the challenge to take a different route: thereby circumventingthe imposition of the time limit. In fairness to Mr Sussex it is worth mentioning that there was in fact a summons (without any supportingaffidavit) returnable before Waung J for an extension of time but the judge indicated at an early stage that he would not countenancean extension, so the shipowner was left with no alternative except to pursue the Ord. 75 r. 13 point.</p>    <p class="heading">The Court of Appeal</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p20" name="p20">20.</a> The question of an extension of time under Ord. 12 r. 8 was not pursued in the Court of Appeal. That court, in essence, followedthe approach taken by Waung J. There is no mention of <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> in its judgments. Mayo JA (who gave the leading judgment) said that the trial judge was "impressed by the fact that the defendants'case to a large extent was dependent upon internal documents". The other two judges agreed: Thereby, in effect, endorsing Waung J'serroneous approach.</p>    <p class="heading">This Court's task</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p21" name="p21">21.</a> This being the unusual background to the present appeal, this Court finds itself in the position of having to exercise an originaljurisdiction, to consider extending time under Ord. 12 r. 8 (1) and to deal with the application for the discharge of the warrantof arrest and release of the bail bond. In this regard I fully agree with Mr Justice Bokhary PJ's careful analysis. It is true thatthe shipowner has acknowledged the service of the writ and must therefore, in terms of Ord. 12 r. 8(7), be treated as having submittedto the jurisdiction of the court in the proceedings. But the shipowner has no quarrel with that. It says that, on the face of theplaintiff's own claims, it has no liability in personam on those claims; it is content for the plaintiffs to proceed with their claimsagainst Ocean and obtain judgment in personam for damages against Ocean; its challenge is simply to the in rem jurisdiction of thecourt; all it seeks is discharge of the warrant of arrest and release of the bail bond on that ground. The shipowner is plainly rightin this regard.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a> There being no possible answer to the shipowner's challenge, and as no injustice can be caused by granting an extension of time,we must in my judgment exercise our discretion in the shipowner's favour.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> I would allow this appeal and make the orders proposed by Mr Justice Bokhary PJ.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ:</strong></p>    <p class="heading">Introduction</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p24" name="p24">24.</a> This is an interlocutory appeal arising out of an admiralty action <em>in rem</em> which has not yet been tried. It is an action in which cargo owners claim damages against shipowners for loss of cargo due to unjustifieddeviation of the ship. For reasons which will become apparent, it will be convenient to refer to her as "the Ship" rather than byany name. Her present owner is a company named International Resources Inc. ("the present shipowner") which acquired her after thewrit was issued but before it was served. The present shipowner is the appellant. The cargo owners are the respondents.</p>    <p class="heading">Cargo lost</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p25" name="p25">25.</a> The cargo which was lost consisted of 30,000 metric tons of bagged cement. In or about October 1996 this cargo was shipped on boardthe Ship, then named "Tian Sheng No. 8", at Rizhao in the Mainland for sea carriage to Chittagong and/or Mongla in Bangladesh. Thereoccurred a deviation to Haikou in the Mainland. The cargo was discharged and eventually sold at Haikou pursuant to an order of theHaikou Maritime Court. In the result, the cargo owners say, they have suffered loss in excess of US$2 million. And they seek recoveryin contract, tort and bailment.</p>    <p class="heading">Vessel arrested and then released on bail bond</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p26" name="p26">26.</a> On 23 November 1996 the cargo owners' writ in rem was issued. On 6 December 1996 the Ship was purchased by the present shipownerand re-named "Resource 1". On 9 February 1997 the cargo owners served the writ on the Ship and arrested her in Hong Kong. On 24 February1997 the then solicitors for the present shipowner entered an appearance. On 18 March 1997 the cargo owners obtained an order forthe sale of the Ship <em>pendente lite.</em> On 1 April 1997 the present shipowner put up a bail bond in the sum of US$1.01 million, thereby avoiding the sale of the Ship andobtaining her release.</p>    <p class="heading">Application for setting aside of warrant of arrest and return of bail bond for cancellation</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p27" name="p27">27.</a> One year later, on 25 April 1998, the present shipowner launched the application which has led eventually to the present appeal.It was an application for the setting aside of the warrant of arrest and the return to the present shipowner of the bail bond forcancellation. The application was made in reliance on Order 75 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 13.</a> (All of my references to Orders and rules will be to those of the Rules of the High Court.)

Such evidence was to the effect (i) that TSIhad been the owner of the Ship at the material times and (ii) that Ocean had never been her owner. But the present shipowner doesnot have to prove that TSI had owned the Ship. It would be enough for the present shipowner's purposes if the cargo owners fail toprove that Ocean had been the owner of the Ship at the material times. Indeed, if the present shipowner is right on the point whichit takes on the strength of the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20WLR%201090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 WLR 1090</a>, it would be enough for its purposes if the Ship was a <em>registered</em> ship and Ocean was not its registered owner at the time when the cause of action arose.</p>    <p class="heading">Application dismissed by judge on two bases</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p31" name="p31">31.</a> By a judgment handed down on 15 February 1999, Waung J dismissed the present shipowner's application. He did so on two bases.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p32" name="p32">32.</a> In the absence of an extension of time for it to serve its defence, the present shipowner's application was undoubtedly out of timeif it had to be made under Order 12 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 8.</a> The cargo owners' points of claim had been served on 3 October 1997. Under Order 18 rule 2(1) the present shipowner had 14 days fromthen to serve its defence unless it obtained an extension of time for doing so later than that. And Order 12 rule 8 provides in paragraph(1) that a defendant who wishes to dispute the jurisdiction of the court must make the appropriate application after giving noticeof intention to defend and within the time limited for service of a defence. The first basis on which the judge dismissed the presentshipowner's application is one which he described as concerning "time". He said that the present shipowner was disputing the court'sjurisdiction, that it was out of time for doing so under Order 12 rule 8, and that it was not open to it to do so in any way otherthan under Order 12 rule 8.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p33" name="p33">33.</a> The second basis on which the judge dismissed the present shipowner's application is his finding that the Ship had been owned atthe material times by Ocean (as the cargo owners contended before him and have contended ever since) and not by TSI (as the presentshipowner contends and has always contended). <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> was cited to the judge, but was not dealt with in his judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">Court of Appeal affirmed dismissal on both bases</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p34" name="p34">34.</a> On 12 November 1999 the Court of Appeal (Nazareth VP, Mayo JA and Suffiad J) dismissed the present shipowner's appeal against WaungJ's decision, holding that he was correct on both of the two bases on which he had decided against the present shipowner. <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> was cited to the Court of Appeal, but was not dealt with in its judgment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p35" name="p35">35.</a> On 26 January 2000 the Court of Appeal refused the present shipowner leave to appeal to this Court.

Order 75 rule 13 provides the basis for the present shipowner'sapplication for the setting aside of the warrant of arrest and the return to it of the bail bond for cancellation. This is becauseOrder 75 rule 13 is the admiralty proceedings rule which deals specifically with the release of property under arrest. And as BrandonJ pointed out in <strong>The Cap Bon</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1 Lloyd's Rep 543</a> at p.547, in an admiralty action <em>in rem,</em> bail for the release of an arrested ship is the res.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p37" name="p37">37.</a> But then there is Order 12 rule 8. I have read in draft and agree with what Sir Anthony Mason NPJ says in connection with Order 12rule 8.</p>    <p class="heading">Extension of time</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p38" name="p38">38.</a> The present shipowner has moved this Court for an order that, in the event that we take the view - which we do - that its applicationfor the setting aside of the warrant of arrest and the return to it of the bail bond for cancellation is caught by Order 12 rule8, the time limited for it to serve a defence be extended until 25 April 1998. That is the date on which the present shipowner launchedthe application which has led eventually to the present appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p39" name="p39">39.</a> Paragraph (7) of rule 8 of Order 12 provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Except where the defendant makes an application in accordance with paragraph (1), the acknowledgement by a defendant of service ofa writ shall, unless the acknowledgement is withdrawn by leave of the Court under Order 21 rule 1, be treated as a submission bythe defendant to the jurisdiction of the Court in the proceedings."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Can such a deemed submission to the jurisdiction, once it has taken place, be overcome or displaced by an extension of time subsequentlygranted under Order 3 rule 5? This rule provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(1) The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, by order extend or abridge the period within which a person is required or authorizedby these rules, or by any judgment, order or direction, to do any act in any proceedings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(2) The Court may extend any such period as is referred to in paragraph (1) although the application for extension is not made untilafter the expiration of that period.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(3) The period within which a person is required by these rules, or by any order or direction, to serve, file or amend any pleadingor other document may be extended by consent (given in writing) without an order of the Court being made for that purpose.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(4) In this rule references to the Court shall be construed as including references to the Court of Appeal and a single judge of thatCourt."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">Clearly enough, in the ordinary course an extension can be granted after the expiration of the period initially fixed for the doingof an act. But where a rule fixes a time-limit and treats non-compliance therewith as a submission to the jurisdiction, can an extensionbe granted and operate to undo that legal consequence after it has ensued?</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p40" name="p40">40.</a> The answer is that the power to extend time is conferred in very wide terms. Its purpose is to ensure that the legal consequenceswhich ordinarily flow from non-compliance with time limits fixed by the rules do not apply in cases where an extension is appropriate.And in the context of an extension of time, there is no reason to differentiate between a deemed submission to the jurisdiction andother legal consequences.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p41" name="p41">41.</a> Extending time in the present case would not involve the reception of any evidence or the entertaining of any argument on the <strong>Evpo Agnic</strong> point which has not already been fully deployed in this Court and in the courts below. That removes an obstacle which would otherwisehave stood in the way of the application for an extension.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p42" name="p42">42.</a> Next, I come to whether it is too late to grant the extension. When an application for an extension is regarded as coming too latefor a court to exercise its discretion to grant the extension, that is generally either because what has happened in the meantimemilitates against an extension or because an extension would cause undue delay. Neither of those considerations apply in the presentcase. Nothing has happened in the meantime which militates against an extension. The courts below dealt with what they thought theposition would be if the present shipowner's application were not time-barred. And this Court has heard full argument on what thatposition would be. As for whether an extension would cause delay, the answer is plainly that it would not. Once an extension hasbeen granted, the Court would proceed to give a judgment which would finally resolve the question of whether this admiralty action<em>in rem</em> survives against the Ship in new ownership.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p43" name="p43">43.</a> This leaves the hurdle which presents itself in the following way. It appears that the present shipowner had taken out a summonsreturnable before the judge for an extension. Such summons does not appear to have been supported by a grounding affidavit. It appearsthat the judge indicated that he was not prepared to grant an extension. Unfortunately the present shipowner did not appeal to theCourt of Appeal against that refusal. So if this Court were to grant an extension, it would do so by way of an original step albeitin an appellate process.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p44" name="p44">44.</a> That presents a hurdle calling for careful consideration. I have given it such consideration. And, for the reasons which I am aboutto state, I regard the hurdle to be one which can be overcome.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p45" name="p45">45.</a> This Court's powers include those conferred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484" class="autolink_findacts">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484">Cap. 484</a>, which provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"For the purpose of disposing of an appeal, the Court may exercise any powers of the court from which the appeal lies (including thepower to order a retrial), or may remit the case to that court."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">It would be worse than a waste of time and costs if, instead of ourselves determining the application for an extension on which wehave already heard full argument, we were to remit the case to the Court of Appeal for it to entertain such an application. By virtueof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(2)</a> of our Ordinance we were acting within our jurisdiction when we invited the application for an extension as a means of reaching the<strong>Evpo Agnic</strong> point and when, that invitation having been accepted, we entertained that application. Similarly we would be acting within our jurisdictionif we were to accede to such application.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p46" name="p46">46.</a> Acceding to it would not run counter to saying that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that Order 12 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 8</a> governs the present shipowner's application for the setting aside of the warrant of arrest and the return to it of the bail bondfor cancellation. On the contrary, it is only on that basis that an extension is needed.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p47" name="p47">47.</a> As I have said, we invited and entertained an application for an extension as a means of reaching the <strong>Evpo Agnic</strong> point. I see no reason to assume that the Court of Appeal would not have done the same if it had regarded, as we regard, the <strong>Evpo Agnic</strong> point worthy of consideration. In granting an extension we would, as a matter of substance and reality, be differing from the Courtof Appeal on one matter only, namely the <strong>Evpo Agnic</strong> point.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p48" name="p48">48.</a> To proceed to decide that point would be to decide the case between the parties on its merits in accordance with the law pertainingto its merits. Moreover it would be to decide an important point which has been fully argued before us and on which it is in thepublic interest to have this Court's decision.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p49" name="p49">49.</a> In my view, the extension is a just and proper one to grant in the exceptional circumstances of the present case, and I would grantit in order to reach the merits of the <strong>Evpo Agnic</strong> point - to which I now turn.</p>    <p class="heading">Evpo Agnic point</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p50" name="p50">50.</a> There is no suggestion by the cargo owners that Ocean is the <em>registered</em> owner of the Ship. And there can be no doubt that the Ship was a <em>registered</em> ship. The writ itself calls her a registered ship. It says that she was registered in Panama. If that were not enough, the Panamanianlawyers retained by the cargo owners have, in a letter dated 31 January 1997 to the cargo owners' solicitors here, said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"According to our search at the Shipping and Consular Bureau, [the Ship] was in the ownership of [TSI] throughout the period from1st August 1996 to 5 December 1996."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">It is accepted by the cargo owners that that bureau, since re-named the Panama Maritime Authority, is the Panamanian shipping registry.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p51" name="p51">51.</a> The <strong>Evpo Agnic</strong> concerned the true construction of s.21(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (on which our s.12B(4) is obviously modelled) and whichreads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"In the case of any such claim as is mentioned in section 20(2)(e) to (r), where - (a) the claim arises in connection with a ship;and (b) the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam ('the relevant person') was, when the cause of actionarose, the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in control of, the ship, an action in rem may (whether or not the claim givesrise to a maritime lien on that ship) be brought in the High Court against - (i) that ship, if at the time when the action is broughtthe relevant person is either the beneficial owner of that ship as respects all the shares in it or the charterer of it under a charterby demise; or (ii) any other ship of which, at the time when the action is brought, the relevant person is the beneficial owner asrespects all the shares in it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p52" name="p52">52.</a> At pp 1095H-1096A Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR, in a judgment with which the other members of the court agreed, posed this question:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"It is common ground that the plaintiffs' claim falls within section 20(2)(g) of the Act of 1981, being a 'claim for loss of or damageto goods carried in a ship' and that the ship concerned - ' the particular ship' in Convention terminology - was the <em>Skipper I.</em> The first issue to be confronted and decided is therefore who is 'the relevant person' for the purposes of section 21(4)(b). Sucha person has to meet two criteria. First, he must be the (or possibly a) person who would be liable on the claim in personam. Second,he must, at the time when the cause of action arose, have been the owner or charterer of, or in possession or control of, the ship.'Charterer' in this context, which includes the Convention, must I think mean demise charterer and the words 'or in possession orin control of, the ship' must refer to a person who is in the position of a demise charterer, albeit not under a demise charter -a salvor might be such. However, for present purposes, what is in issue is what is meant by 'owner'. Does it refer to the registeredowner, who necessarily is the legal owner, or to someone who has only an equitable property in the ship?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p53" name="p53">53.</a> At p.1096 B-E the Master of the Rolls gave this answer:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"In answering this question I bear in mind three important considerations. First, it is a basic rule of construction that where astatute employs different terminology in different provisions, prima facie a different meaning is intended and this is particularlythe case if the differing terminology occurs within a single subsection. 'Owner' in paragraph (b) of section 21(4) thus falls tobe contrasted with 'beneficial owner' in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii). Second, all maritime nations maintain registers of shippingwhich record the names of the owners. These registers are of fundamental importance as establishing the flag of the vessel, therebymaking it for some purposes part of the floating territory of that country and subjecting it to the laws of that country. I wouldtherefore regard the concept of a registered owner as being a nominal owner as a contradiction. Third, the Convention clearly looksto ownership and registered ownership as one and the same, although as Robert Goff J pointed out in <em>I</em> <em>Congreso del Partido</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20QB%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] Q.B. 500</a>, 541, the 'trust' concept involving a dichotomy between legal and equitable ownership may be unknown to some, and perhaps most, otherjurisdictions. My conclusion is that, in relation to a registered ship, 'owner' in section 21(4)(b) means 'registered owner'."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">The Convention to which the Master of the Rolls referred is the International Convention Relating to the Arrest of Seagoing Vessels(Treaty Series No. 47 (1960) (Cmnd. 1128)).</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p54" name="p54">54.</a> Mr Michael Bunting SC for the cargo owners advances two lines of argument on <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong>. The first is that the English Court of Appeal did not really mean what it said when it said that, in relation to a registered ship,"owner" means "registered owner". And the second, which is in the alternative to the first, is that if the court really meant that,then it was wrong in so holding.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p55" name="p55">55.</a> On the first line of argument, Mr Bunting submits that the Master of the Rolls was dealing with whether "owner" included a purelyequitable owner, and spoke of registered owner merely on the working assumption that the registered owner was in fact the owner.That, Mr Bunting's submission continues, is made explicitly clear by two things which the Master of Rolls said. The first is thereference (at p.l1096 A-B) to "the registered owner, who is necessarily the legal owner". And the second is the statement (at E-Fof the same page) that: "registered owners, even when one-ship companies, are not bare legal owners. They are both legal and beneficialowners ...". I do not think that either that reference or that statement bears out Mr Bunting's submission.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p56" name="p56">56.</a> Mr Bunting also submits that his first line of argument is borne out by the following passage in the judgment of the English Courtof Appeal delivered by Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ in <strong>Haji-Ioannou v. Frangos</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 337</a> at p.353 (2nd column):</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"As a result of this choice of language, it has now for a long time been accepted law that ownership of a ship for the purposes ofthe Convention and for the purposes of the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court means legal ownership, except in those provisionswhere the word is qualified by the adjective 'beneficial': see <em>The I Congreso del Partido</em>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20536" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 536</a> at p.562, col. 2; [1978] 1 Q.B.500 at p.541, and <em>The Evpo Agnic</em>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 411</a> at pp 414-415. In the latter case Lord Donaldson, M.R. observed that the Convention clearly looked to ownership and registered ownershipas one and the same. Even if the legal property in the shares of a one-ship company is held by A and the equitable property by B,he said that that distinction does not affect the ownership of the ship or the shares in the ship."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">I do not read this passage or any other part of the judgment delivered by the Lord Chief Justice as support for Mr Bunting's firstline of argument. I read what the Lord Chief Justice said as being to the effect that "owner" in s.21(4)(b) means legal owner (asopposed to beneficial owner), and that, where the ship is a registered ship, the registered owner is the legal owner. I will revertto this case later on.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p57" name="p57">57.</a> Finally on that line of argument, Mr Bunting relies on the statement of Judicial Commissioner Selvam sitting at first instance inthe Singaporean High Court in <strong>The Opal 3</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20SLR%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 SLR 585</a> at p.590 C that: "The word 'owner' in this text means the legal owner who in most cases would be the registered owner". I do notregard that statement as a good reason for saying that the Master of the Rolls did not mean what he said.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p58" name="p58">58.</a> It is instructive to look at the reasons which the Master of the Rolls gave (in the passage from p.1096 B-E of his judgment quotedabove) for concluding (at the end of that passage) that "in relation to a registered ship, 'owner' in section 21(4)(b) means 'registeredowner'." The giving of those reasons run counter to the notion that he did not mean what he said. So does the giving of the reasonscontained in the passage (from p.1096 E-G of his judgment) which I quote below when dealing with Mr Bunting's second line of argument.As for his first line of argument, I reject it for the reasons which I have given.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p59" name="p59">59.</a> In arguing that, alternatively, the English Court of Appeal was wrong in holding that, in relation to a registered ship, "owner"means "registered owner", Mr Bunting submits that such a conclusion would open the way for shipowners - what he calls "true shipowners"- to evade s.12B(4)'s operation simply by registering their ships in the names of nominees. A comparable submission had been madeto the English Court of Appeal. Immediately after the passage from his judgment quoted above, the Master of the Rolls said (at p.1096E-G)this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Mr Rokison, appearing for the plaintiffs, submits that this cannot be right because, if it were, even the particular ship could notbe arrested if it could be shown that the registered owner was not the beneficial owner of all the shares in the ship. If this isso, it is an understandable casus omissus, because in real commercial life, thus far at least, registered owners, even when one-shipcompanies, are not bare legal owners. They are both legal and beneficial owners of all the shares in the ship and any division betweenlegal and equitable interests occurs in relation to the registered owner itself, which is almost always a juridical person. The legalproperty in its shares may well be held by A and the equitable property by B, but this does not affect the ownership of the shipor of the shares in that ship. They are the legal and equitable property of the company."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">(Counsel spoke of "even the particular ship" because the admiralty action in rem in which the <strong>Evpo Agnic</strong> was arrested was an action in which the cargo owners there were pursuing a claim for the loss of cargo resulting from the sinkingof an alleged sister ship, the <em>Skipper 1</em>.)</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p60" name="p60">60.</a> There is nothing to show that the evasion of which Mr Bunting spoke is being resorted to in practice. If the time were ever to comewhen such evasion poses a real problem, it would be for the maritime nations of the world to react collectively by a fresh treatyand individually by domestic legislation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p61" name="p61">61.</a> The other basis on which Mr Bunting questions the correctness of <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> decision is this. He submits that reading "owner" to mean "registered owner" involves rewriting the statute by adding a word whichis not there. I am unable to accept this submission. Words take their meaning from their context. There is more than one sense inwhich a person can be the owner of something. Thus there is such a thing as legal ownership; there is such a thing as beneficialownership; and there are different manifestations of each. Sometimes a particular reading of a statute may appear at first sightto involve qualifying an expression used in the statute by adding another expression which is not in the statute. But it will turnout upon closer analysis that the latter expression is used merely to indicate the sense in which the former expression is used inthe statute. Discovering that sense is a matter of interpretation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p62" name="p62">62.</a> It is clear that the process by which the English Court of Appeal reached its conclusion that, in relation to a registered ship,"owner" meant "registered owner" was one of interpreting the statute, and not of rewriting it.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p63" name="p63">63.</a> I turn now to two other cases cited by Mr Bunting.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p64" name="p64">64.</a> In <strong>The Ohm Mariana</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20SLR%20698" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 SLR 698</a> at pp 709-710 the Singaporean Court of Appeal took the view that the statement in the Evpo Agnic that, in relation to a registeredship, "owner" meant "registered owner" was a dictum, and declined to follow it. In my view, the conclusion which the Master of theRolls expressed on the point, for which conclusion he gave full reasons, is not to be dismissed as if it was something in the natureof an aside. In <strong>The Iron Shortland</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20131%20ALR%20738" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 131 ALR 738</a> Sheppard J sitting at first instance in the General Division in Admiralty of the Federal Court of Australia, said (at p.749) thatthere were "difficulties in taking the simple view that 'owner' in [the provision with which he was concerned] meant only 'registeredowner'." But as Mr Bunting concedes, that Australian provision is materially different from the United Kingdom provision in <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> and the Hong Kong provision in the present case.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p65" name="p65">65.</a> It is worth noting that the matter is treated as a straightforward one in the two leading texts to which our attention has been drawn.In "Dicey &amp; Morris on Conflict of Laws", 13th ed. (2000), Vol. 1 at p.458 para. 13-016 it is said in regard to s.21(4)(b) ofthe Supreme Court Act 1981 that: "Here 'owner' means 'registered owner'." And <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> is cited in support. In "Nigel Meeson: Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice", 2nd ed. (2000) at p.87 para. 3-037 it is said in regardto "owner" in s.24(4)(b) of the 1981 Act that: "This means the registered owner". Again <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> is cited in support.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p66" name="p66">66.</a> In my judgment, the reasoning in <strong>The Evpo Agnic</strong> is wholly convincing, and that, in relation to a registered ship, "owner" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12B(4)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a> means "registered owner". Another way of putting it, incorporating the way it was put in <strong>Haji-Ioannou v. Frangos</strong>, is as follows. In the internal, linguistic context of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 12B(4)(b)</a> "owner" means legal owner (as opposed to beneficial owner) where a registered ship is concerned. And in the wider, real world contextof the subsection, the registered owner of a registered ship is her legal owner. Both ways of putting it come to the same thing inthe end where the ship is a registered ship. The second way has the merit of explaining itself more fully, while the first has themerit of brevity. Whichever way it is put, the cargo owners' claim is not within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12B(4)</a> since the Ship was a registered ship and there is no suggestion that the person liable <em>in personam</em> was ever her registered owner. As a closing caveat, I would say this. If a registration is fraudulent, there would be room for anargument that the fraudulent registration should be ignored and that the person registered as owner by fraud should not be regardedas the registered owner. But that is not this case. I have read Mr Justice Litton PJ's judgment and find myself in agreement withit.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p67" name="p67">67.</a> In the result and with an expression of thanks to counsel on both sides for their assistance, I would allow this appeal so as to(i) order the setting aside of the warrant of arrest and the return of the bail bond to the present shipowner for cancellation and(ii) direct that, unless they reach agreement on costs, the parties lodge with the Registrar of this Court within 14 days of todaywritten submissions on costs (it having been accepted at the hearing by the parties that costs, unless agreed, would be dealt withon written submissions after the result of the appeal, save as to costs, has been made known).</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"><strong>Mr Justice Silke NPJ:</strong></p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p68" name="p68">68.</a> I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgments of Mr Justice Litton PJ, Mr Justice Bokhary PJ and Sir Anthony MasonNPJ.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p69" name="p69">69.</a> On the matter of Order 12 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 8</a>, I agree with Sir Anthony Mason NPJ that this Order and rule provides a complete code when the exercise of the courts' statutoryjurisdiction in Admiralty arises.

Central to these two ways of putting the appellant's case is the broad proposition that a court cannotexceed its jurisdictional limits, that such limits cannot be waived and that they cannot be overcome by consent of the parties.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p74" name="p74">74.</a> Section 12A(1)(a) of the Ordinance confers Admiralty jurisdiction on the Court of First Instance (the High Court) to hear and determinecertain questions and claims. For the purposes of the present case, we are concerned with the claims mentioned in s.12A(2)(g) and(h); that is, with jurisdiction conferred by s.12A(1)(a) to hear and determine :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(g) any claim for loss of or damage to goods carried in a ship"; and</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(h) any claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p75" name="p75">75.</a> Section 12B deals with the mode of exercise of Admiralty jurisdiction. Section 12B(1) provides that, subject to s.12C, "an action<em>in personam</em> may be brought in the Court of First Instance in all cases within the Admiralty jurisdiction". Section 12B(2), (3) and (4) then providethat actions <em>in rem</em> may be brought in certain classes of case within the Admiralty jurisdiction. Section 12B(4), on which the appellant's argument onjurisdiction depends, is in these terms :</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(4) In the case of any such claim as is mentioned in section 12A(2)(e) to (q), where -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(a) the claim arises in connection with a ship; and</p>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(b) the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam ("the relevant person") was, when the cause of action arose,the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in control, of the ship,</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">an action in rem may ... be brought in the Court of First Instance against -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">(i) that ship, if at the time when the action is brought the relevant person is either the beneficial owner of, that ship as respectsall the shares in it or ..."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p76" name="p76">76.</a> Section 54(1) of the Ordinance enables the Rules Committee, constituted under s.55, to make rules of court :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"regulating and prescribing the procedure ... and the practice to be followed in the High Court in all causes and matters whatsoeverin or with respect to which the High Court has jurisdiction ... and any matters incidental to or relating to that procedure or practice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p77" name="p77">77.</a> Order 12 rule 8, under the heading "Dispute as to Jurisdiction", prescribes a procedure according to which such disputes are to beresolved. This procedure requires a defendant who wishes to dispute the jurisdiction of the court <em>on any ground</em> to give notice of intention to defend the proceedings and, within the time limited for service of a defence, to make an appropriateapplication to the Court (r.8(1)). The critical element in the procedure is that, except where the defendant makes such an applicationas prescribed, the acknowledgment by a defendant of service of a writ shall, unless the acknowledgment is withdrawn by leave of theCourt, be treated as a submission by the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Court in the proceedings (r.8(7)).</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p78" name="p78">78.</a> Order 12 rule 8(3), by specifically providing that an application under rule 1 must be made in an Admiralty action <em>in rem,</em> makes it impossible to read rule 8 as having no application to Admiralty actions in rem or to objections to jurisdiction in Admiraltyactions <em>in rem.</em> Rule 8(3) makes it clear that, as a matter of interpretation, the rule is intended to be a comprehensive and exclusive code for thetaking of jurisdictional objections, applying to Admiralty actions <em>in rem</em> as well as actions <em>in personam,</em> save perhaps objections on the ground that the Court of First Instance has no Admiralty jurisdiction at all. If the appellant's argumentsare to prevail, it can only be on the footing that rule 8(7), lies beyond the scope of the rule making power conferred by s.54, becauseits effect is to preclude a defendant from contesting jurisdiction otherwise than in accordance with the rule 8 procedure.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p79" name="p79">79.</a> So the substantial question is whether the rule making power extends to the prescription of a procedure which, in its applicationto Admiralty actions <em>in rem,</em> precludes the defendant from taking an objection to jurisdiction based on the limits stated in s.12B(4), unless it is taken withinthe time limited by order 12 rule 8.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p80" name="p80">80.</a> In considering whether the scope of the rule making power extends to regulating in the manner prescribed a dispute about the applicationof s.12B(4), it is necessary to classify that provision, in particular to determine whether it goes to jurisdiction and, if it does,what type of jurisdictional provision it is. In these respects, it is important to note that sections 12 and 12A are the sectionswhich confer jurisdiction on the Court of First Instance, s.12 conferring the civil and criminal jurisdiction, s.12A conferring theAdmiralty jurisdiction. Significantly, section 12B is not expressed to be a section which grants jurisdiction to the Court of FirstInstance. The heading is "Mode of exercise of Admiralty jurisdiction". That is an accurate description of what the section does becauseit provides how the Admiralty jurisdiction, already conferred, is to be exercised.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p81" name="p81">81.</a> What is of particular significance is that s.12B(4) is not expressed in terms of jurisdiction at all. The word "jurisdiction" isconspicuous by its absence. The sub-section in terms confers upon a litigant a right to proceed in a particular way by bringing anaction <em>in rem</em> upon conditions. I am quite unable to see how such a provision can be characterised as one which goes to the existence of the Admiraltyjurisdiction.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p82" name="p82">82.</a> Section 12B(1), (2), (3) and (4) provide that both actions <em>in personam</em> and actions <em>in rem</em> may be brought in cases within the Admiralty jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance. Actions <em>in personam</em> may be brought in all cases within the Admiralty jurisdiction, but in the case of actions in rem, there are limitations and theyvary with the nature of the claim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p83" name="p83">83.</a> The point is that s.12B(4) goes not to the existence of jurisdiction at all, but to the exercise of jurisdiction, limiting the situationsin which <em>in rem</em> actions may be brought, notwithstanding that the Court will be exercising jurisdiction in <em>in personam</em> actions when the <em>in rem</em> limits are exceeded. The distinction between the existence and the exercise of jurisdiction is to be equated to the existence ofjurisdiction to entertain a matter at all and what may be done in the exercise of that jurisdiction.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p84" name="p84">84.</a> References are to be found in the cases to counterparts of s.12B(4) which speak of the provisions as going to jurisdiction; see,for example, <strong>Republic of India v. India Steamship Co.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%203%20WLR%20818" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 3 WLR 818</a> at 823, per Lord Steyn. In my view, these references should be understood, at least in the context of Hong Kong, as references tothe exercise of Admiralty jurisdiction rather than to the existence of that jurisdiction.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p85" name="p85">85.</a> The conditions which apply to the bringing of an action <em>in rem</em> should be seen as matters to be determined by the Court of First Instance in the exercise of its jurisdiction, not as matters uponwhich the existence of the Court's jurisdiction is conditioned. This conclusion gains added strength from two circumstances. Oneis that the conditions stipulated in s.12B(4) turn on matters of fact (and law) which the Court itself must determine. The otheris that the Court of First Instance (the High Court) is presumed to be a court of general or unlimited jurisdiction.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p86" name="p86">86.</a> Indeed, in the case of such a court, even if the statutory provision relating to jurisdiction were cast in a form which might besaid to go to the existence of jurisdiction, it would be for the court itself to determine the existence of jurisdiction. Such acourt, unlike an inferior court, is necessarily the arbiter of its own jurisdiction. In other words, the existence of jurisdictionwould depend upon the court's determination of the events, facts or circumstances on which the existence of jurisdiction was madeto depend. (<strong>Canada Trust Co v. Stolzenberg</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 1582</a> at 1589, per Millett LJ.) And, in any event, ordinarily limitations relevant to the jurisdiction of such a court will be regardedas going to the exercise of jurisdiction rather than its existence, unless a contrary intention is clearly expressed (See <strong>Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v. Whyte</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2059%20CLR%20369" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 59 CLR 369</a> at 391, per Dixon J; <strong>The Queen v.

The rule prescribes a procedure which is appropriate for the resolution of issues, even if they are "jurisdictional",which are, to be determined in the exercise of jurisdiction. Although some criticism has been made of sub-rule (7) which states thatthe acknowledgement of the service of the writ shall-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"be treated as a submission by the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Court in the proceedings",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">the meaning is clear. Unless a defendant makes an appropriate application within the time limited to give effect to a jurisdictionalobjection, he is to be regarded as accepting the exercise of jurisdiction and is shut out from taking the jurisdictional objectionat a later stage in the litigation. In passing, I make the point that the statutory provisions are to be interpreted in their ownlight, not by reference to the Rules or any assumptions made by the Rules Committee as to the meaning of the statutory provisions.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p88" name="p88">88.</a> A power to regulate by rules the practice and procedure in actions generally in a superior court must extend to the prescriptionof time limits within which, and procedures by which, objections on various grounds, including jurisdiction, are to be made. Indeed,in the case of jurisdictional objections, there are powerful reasons for thinking that they should be resolved, as far as possible,at an early stage of an action. It is not right that a court should be venturing upon the merits or substance of an action withoutdetermining at the threshold of the action, if it can conveniently do so, that there is jurisdiction to proceed. The prospect ofa defendant raising a jurisdictional objection at a very late stage of an action, perhaps after a lengthy hearing and just beforethe delivery of judgment, is one not readily to be contemplated. Accordingly, in the absence of any compelling contrary consideration,there are strong grounds for holding that the rule making power extends to prescribing a time and method by which a jurisdictionalobjection is to be taken, at least an objection of the type raised here, in default of which jurisdiction will be exercised.</p>    <p align="justify"><a class="pseudopara" id="p89" name="p89">89.</a> The conclusion which I have reached is generally in accord with the judgment of Fuad VP in <strong>Wo Fung Paper Making Factory Ltd v. Sappi Kraft (Pty) Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 346</a> at 352 and with the view expressed by Robert Goff J. in <strong>I</strong> <strong>Congreso del Partido</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20QB%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] QB 500</a> at 535-536. There his Lordship treated R.S.C. Order 12 rule 8 as having a valid application to a case in which there was an issuewhether the court had jurisdiction to try an Admiralty action <em>in rem</em> and refused to allow the issue to be tried in the action; instead, he insisted that it be tried on the motions.

The objection (which was overruled) was that the Court had no Admiralty jurisdictionat all. This was an objection which went to the very existence of jurisdiction, not simply to its exercise, and it did not dependupon the determination of any facts. It is therefore distinguishable from the facts of the present case.
