The question at issue is which of the parties to these proceedings should bear responsibilityfor the loss.</p>    <p class="heading">The undisputed facts</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiff ("Trafigura") is the parent company of a Dutch trading conglomerate. It is a substantial player in the world of physicalmetals trading. These proceedings involve a cargo of 159 bundles of copper cathodes, one of a number of shipments in nominal 500tonne tranches made pursuant to a contract entered into between the plaintiff and Mount Isa Mines Limited of Brisbane, Australia("Mount Isa"). The precise details of this contract do not greatly matter. Suffice to say that two such earlier Mount Isa shipmentsof about 500 mt each had been the subject of onward sale to a Chinese state entity, China Minmetals Materials Import and Export Co.Ltd, Beijing (referred to throughout this case as 'Minmetals'). Perhaps the only relevance of these two earlier contracts with Minmetals(Nos.309-98-12535001-S and 12535002-S) was that both such onward sale contracts had been concluded, and letters of credit duly issued,<em>prior to</em> the arrival in Hong Kong of the particular vessel carrying these shipments of copper.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> This was not the situation in the present instance. Although negotiations were ongoing between the plaintiff and Minmetals for thesale of this particular lot, no contract had been concluded - there is in the papers a draft Contract No.309-98-12535.003-S, bearingthe date 30 April 1998 - and no letter of credit had been arranged by Minmetals to finance this purchase. In the event this cargoof 159 bundles of copper cathodes, gross weight 498.10 mt, had been shipped on board the vessel "<em>Explorer</em>" on 17 April 1998 at Townsville, Australia under a New Guinea Pacific Line bill of lading No.PTSV/HKG 008, which is accepted by MrSussex SC, on behalf of the defendant herein, as a China Navigation bill. The Shipper is named as 'Mount Isa Mines Limited', theConsignee is 'To Order', and the Notify Party under this bill of lading is Harvest Fortune Shipping Limited, the Third Party herein.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The evidence is that the "<em>Explorer</em>" was due to arrive in Hong Kong from Townsville on 1 May 1998, but in fact she came in two days earlier, on 29 April. What happenedshortly thereafter provides the key element in this case. As the result of that which Mr Sussex has accepted was a complete error,Swire Shipping (Agencies) Limited, the Hong Kong representative of the defendant shipping line, misdelivered the plaintiff's cargoof copper cathodes to the Notify Party under the bill of lading, the Third Party herein, Harvest Fortune Shipping Limited. The provenanceof the error is not important, albeit it appears to have arisen due to crossed wires between Swire Shipping (Agencies) in Hong Kongand its Sydney counterpart. In any event, such delivery was made not against production of an original bill of lading but againsta Letter of Indemnity signed for and on behalf of Harvest Fortune. This Letter of Indemnity is undated, although Ms Grace Li of SwireShipping (Agencies), who gave evidence on the point, believes that it was obtained on 28 April or on the morning of 29 April 1998,given that the cargo would not have been released if this indemnity had not been provided. Ms Li further gave evidence that the cargocarried under bill of lading PTSV/HKG 008, which was break bulk cargo, was discharged midstream directly from the "<em>Explorer</em>" into a barge, the "Sui Gang Bo 14", arranged by Harvest Fortune; according to the relevant tally sheets, such discharge commencedat 1530 hours on 29 April and was completed at 0100 hours on 30 April 1998.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Knowledge that the cargo had been thus discharged to Harvest Fortune was not something that was discovered by the plaintiff until4 May 1998, Ms Li recalling a telephone conversation with an officer of the plaintiff on that date during which she informed herof the release of the cargo. This in turn generated a stream of urgent fax correspondence, Ms Jessica Lichsteiner of the plaintiffwriting to Ms Li by fax of the same day :-</p>    <blockquote>        <div align="left">            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="10%" valign="top" class="quote">"Ref.</td>                    <td width="80%" valign="top" class="quote">MV 'Explorer V02' from Townsville to Hong Kong P.R.C.<br />                    B/L No.PTSV/HKG 008 dd April 17th, 1998<br />                    497.872net MT / 498.190 gross MT / 159 Bundles of ISA<br />                    Brand Copper cathodes</td>                </tr>            </table>        </div>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">We understand, according to our telcon with Mrs. Grace Li, that you Swire Shipping Agencies Ltd.

A Harvest Fortune bill of lading dated 2 May 1998 records the transhipment, in 17 twenty foot containers, of the plaintiff's159 bundles of copper cathodes. On the face of this bill of lading the Shipper is named as one 'S.K. Trading' (whose provenance andsignificance in this whole saga continues to escape me), the Port of Discharge is named as Lian Hua Shan, China, and the Consigneeis named in Chinese characters, which, I am told, represents the name of the Panyu Bonded Warehouse (the business licence of whichgives its full name as 'Bonded Warehouse of External Affairs of Panyu City'), wherein this cargo was indisputably stored upon completionof its journey up the Pearl River to Lian Hua Shan.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> There can be no doubt, on the face of the internal correspondence, that so far as the plaintiff was concerned the situation thathad arisen was most unhappy; one internal e-mail of 4 May 1998, addressed, <em>inter alia,</em> to Mr Mike Yue of the plaintiff's Beijing office, records simply :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"This is a disaster. Please urgently find out immediately exactly where the cargo is and in case cargo on a barge we need to stopthe barge. We need to have the material immediately put into a warehouse and under HC [Holding Certificate]",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">whilst later that same day, 4 May, a Mr Peter-Marc Waszkis of the plaintiff's head office in Lucerne further writes :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"According to Mike material is in Minmetal's warehouse in Huangpu right now. We need to get proper warehouse receipt for this material- stating clearly that we are the owners of sme - and we need to get an SGS surveyor in there to inspect the cargo and confirm itis per warehouse receipt and Trafigura's."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> This court has heard extensive evidence from Mr Mike Yue, who until recently worked as a metals trader for the plaintiff and wasbased in the plaintiff's Beijing office. To Mr Yue fell the task of sorting out the problem that had arisen as the result of themisdelivery of this cargo in Hong Kong. I accept Mr Yue's evidence, and refer to various aspects thereof later in this judgment.For narrative purposes, however, suffice to say that Harvest Fortune appears to have been acting upon the instructions of Minmetalswhich, so far as the plaintiff was concerned, was a prospective purchaser of the 159 bundles of copper which were now stored in thePanyu Bonded Warehouse. Accordingly, notwithstanding the misdelivery that had occurred, Mr Yue continued his negotiations with Minmetals.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> What followed next is not a matter of contention. Mr Yue was permitted to inspect the cargo in the Panyu warehouse on 13 May 1998,and was able to verify its existence and condition during that visit. He was also able finally to negotiate a contract for the saleof this cargo with Minmetals, which contract, whilst bearing the date of 8 May, was actually signed by Minmetals on 12 May, and inturn was countersigned by the plaintiff on 25 May 1998.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In addition, Mr Yue was able to obtain from Minmetals two further documents : first, a "Holding Certificate of Contract No.309-98-12535.003-P"signed and stamped by Minmetals which, <em>inter alia,</em> purported to confirm that the goods held in the Panyu warehouse belonged to and were held for the benefit of the plaintiff - in particular,paragraph 3 of this Certificate held out that Minmetals "shall not part with possession of the goods except in accordance with theinstructions of Trafigura". And second, a Letter of Undertaking addressed to the plaintiff and signed on behalf of Minmetals wherebyMinmetals undertook to open an irrevocable letter of credit through an acceptable opening bank, negotiable at 90 days sight againstpresentation of shipping documents, by 5 June 1998.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In fact, no letter of credit was ever opened by Minmetals, and the plaintiff was neither paid for the copper pursuant to the concludedcontract nor was it able to recover possession of this cargo. After the passage of the 5 June date for the opening of the credit,Mr Yue chased Minmetals on the telephone, and sent fax messages to Minmetals on 15 June asking that the letter of credit be immediatelyopened, the plaintiff at this juncture even offering to give a one month extension for the price selection period under the contractif the letter of credit were to be issued within the week. In fact, on learning that Minmetals, Beijing were having difficulty inopening the credit because Minmetals did not have the cash at hand to provide the necessary funds to the bank to underpin the issuingof the credit, Mr Yue even flew to Shanghai on 16 June to collect funds from Minmetals Shanghai to enable Minmetals Beijing to openthe credit. Despite returning with a draft, the credit was not opened, and on 17 or 18 June Mr Yue began to receive indications thatthe credit would not be forthcoming. Further fax messages were sent on 19 June in an attempt to press Minmetals to change its stance,but to no avail.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Yue's evidence was that the first time he became aware that the cargo might be lost was on 17 or 18 June, when he was led to understandduring a telephone conversation that the cargo had been moved from the Panyu warehouse to somewhere in Shanghai, albeit he had noidea where, even though he then made enquiries of various Shanghai warehouses. What appears to have occurred - although neither theplaintiff nor the defendant is in a position precisely to know, even today - is that the cargo was moved from the Panyu warehousein or about mid-June, and that subsequently it had been seized by the Public Security Bureau of the Chinese State.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> This confiscation led to meetings in Guangzhou on 7 August and in Panyu on 18 August, which meetings also included representativesof the PSB and of the defendant's solicitors. These meetings were unsuccessful. Notwithstanding presentation to the PSB of all relevantdocumentation in a bid to establish the plaintiff's ownership of the goods so seized, the PSB apparently refused to permit the plaintiffto recover its cargo. Nor were the considerable efforts on the part of both the plaintiff and the defendant to find alternative buyerssuccessful, in this regard Mr Yue observing, no doubt correctly, that as the result of this cargo of copper having been seized bythe PSB apparently as the result of it allegedly having been smuggled into China, the copper was perceived as tainted and potentialbuyers were nervous about becoming involved.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Be that as it may. The efforts on the part of both the plaintiff and the defendant to remedy the situation ultimately failed to bearfruit, with the result that proceedings in the head action were formally commenced by the plaintiff on 17 July 1998. So far as theThird Party action is concerned, third party proceedings were issued on 23 September 1998, with Points of Claim in those proceedingsissued on 27 January 1999 and Points of Defence being filed one month later. The Third Party defaulted on a discovery order madeby this court dated 10 June 1999, and having failed to file any list of documents has taken no further part in these proceedings.Its solicitors of record were permitted to cease to act by consent order dated 14 May 1999, and Harvest Fortune has not attendednor been represented at the trial of this action.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiff's claim</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Whilst there is considerable disagreement on the question of primary liability to pay other than nominal damages, in itself the issueof the quantum of the plaintiff's claim has attracted little comment.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The plaintiff pursues its claim for misdelivery in terms of contract, conversion and bailment, and quantifies its primary loss inthe sum of US$953,037.47, representing the agreed value of the cargo (US$1,913 per metric tonne x 498.190 tonnes) as at 29 April1998, the date of the misdelivery.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> There is a secondary claim pleaded in the sum of US$43,362.08 representing the loss, damage and expense incurred "including legalfees, disbursements and other costs involved in taking steps to mitigate loss". In this regard, counsel have indicated, absent agreementbetween the parties upon the figures, that in so far as liability be established in the head action, the appropriate course is forthe assessment of this subsidiary claim to be adjourned for assessment on a reference to a Master. I concur with this approach.</p>    <p class="heading">The issues</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Mr Sussex SC, for the defendant, contended that this case could not simply be categorised as a "classic misdelivery", as the plaintiffhad asserted. Notwithstanding the primary admission that the cargo had been delivered without presentation of an original bill oflading, it did not automatically follow, he said, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover substantial damages. To the contrary.Whether analysed in terms of contract, conversion or bailment, the defendant's position was that the plaintiff was not entitled torecover any more than nominal damages at best. Pursuant to this submission, Mr Sussex advanced arguments under a number of headswhich in some instances overlap, and I adopt the following sub-headings for ease of reference.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Ratification</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The key here, submitted Mr Sussex, lay in the entry by Trafigura into the contract of sale with Minmetals on 25 May 1998. This basicfact led to alternative arguments : <em>first</em>, that the conclusion of the contractual arrangements with Minmetals amounted to a constructive repossession of the cargo, and infact constituted a transaction akin to recovery of the cargo; <em>second</em>, and alternatively, that by the entry into the contract with Minmetals, the plaintiff effectively ratified the misdelivery to Minmetals,so that Trafigura could not on the one hand contract with Minmetals and on the other seek to complain of the misdelivery.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> I take the 'ratification' aspect first. In this instance, said Mr Sussex, the plaintiff could not approbate and reprobate, and whatthe plaintiff had in fact done was to waive the tort : see <strong>Verschures Creameries Ltd v. Hull and Netherlands Steamship Company Ltd</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1921%5d%202%20KB%20608" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1921] 2 KB 608 (CA).</a></p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In my view, this argument fails. I entertain no doubt that in entering into the contract with Minmetals, the plaintiff was in nosense ratifying the misdelivery, nor did the entry into the contract constitute a binding election serving to foreclose a suit inconversion.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> <strong>Verschures Creameries</strong>, <em>op.cit</em>, upon which Mr Sussex relies in this part of his argument, does not give him the support he would wish. In <strong>United Australia Ltd v. Barclays Bank Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1941%5d%20AC%203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1941] AC 3</a> at 31, Lord Atkin (who had delivered one of the judgments in the Court of Appeal in <strong>Verschures Creameries</strong>) explained this case thus :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"A firm of carriers being authorized by the plaintiffs to carry goods to A delivered them to B. The plaintiffs invoiced the goodsto B, sued him for the price, recovered judgment and took bankruptcy proceedings against him. They afterwards sued the carriers formisdelivery. It was the plainest case of ratification of an act done by the carriers purporting to deliver on behalf of the plaintiffs;..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> There is no question in the present case of a suit to judgment by Trafigura against Minmetals, and I decline Mr Sussex's invitationto consider entry into a new contract as being "akin to suing someone to judgment". Nor do I consider that he is right to suggestthat "only on a strained analysis" can the entry into a new contract be considered "any form of mitigation". To the contrary. Inmy view this is precisely what the plaintiff was doing. Having lost control of the goods, and having had to chase them up the PearlRiver to their repository in the Panyu Bonded Warehouse, the plaintiff in effect was having to play a constant game of 'catch-up'.From the plaintiff's standpoint, the pursuit of the cargo and subsequent entry into the Minmetals contract in the circumstances amountedto little more than 'Hobson's choice', and I see no basis for suggesting that what occurred constituted a waiver of the tort by theplaintiff. I am satisfied on the evidence that the plaintiff's entry into the Minmetals contract was perceived as the best availableoption in an entirely unexpected and unwelcome situation; as Trafigura expressed the position in its Letter of Claim dated 8 May1998 to Ms Grace Li of Swire Shipping :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"We now understand that the cargo has come into the possession of Messrs. Minmetals. In order to mitigate any potential loss, andwithout prejudice to any other rights we may have against you, we are in the process of concluding a sale to Messrs. Minmetals. Youwill understand that we are entering into this contract in a good faith attempt to avoid and/or mitigate losses, compared to thefrankly extremely unpalatable alternatives of attempting to take possession of the cargo for re-export or for an unpredictable saleon the domestic market.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Directly as a result of your actions the cargo is already under the control of Messrs. Minmetals and they have been unable to dateto provide satisfactory credit support, although they have undertaken to issue a letter of credit by 5 June 1998. We therefore putyou on notice that we shall look to you for recovery of any costs or consequences to which this forced sale may give rise, not limitedto any credit exposure, including failure by Minmetals to pay the full purchase price, and any other survey, inspection, documentary,collection or related costs. ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Nor, it must be said, did those acting for the defendant apparently then consider that entry into the Minmetals contract constitutedany form of ratification or binding election on the part of Trafigura, Messrs Richards Butler, in a letter dated 24 June 1998, notingthat :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Our clients' position, without prejudice to liability, is that they might be prepared to work with your clients to negotiate a three-waysettlement under which they pay an amount towards the difference between the figure China Minmetals are willing to pay and the amountyour clients are willing to accept. We should be grateful if you could let us know as soon as possible whether an arrangement ofthat sort would be a possibility as far as your clients are concerned. If that is a possibility, the prices quoted on the LondonMetals Exchange could probably be used as the basis for pricing under any negotiated arrangement.",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">whilst by letter of the following day, they observed further :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"We appreciate that your clients wish to resolve things quickly and that is also our clients' intention. Our clients will do whatthey can to enable a prompt solution to be reached but, as you may know, it has appeared for about the last two months that yourclients had reached or were about to reach a satisfactory solution with China Minmetals and it would be unfortunate if that possibilitywas not pursued. Our clients are making efforts to find out whether an arrangement with China Minmetals is still possible and, asstated, might be prepared to contribute to an overall solution."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Against this background, therefore, the ratification contention now put forward strikes me as not only legally unsustainable, butin the circumstances somewhat rich.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Nor in the circumstances do I accede to the alternative argument under this head, namely that the contract with Minmetals was akinto recovery of the cargo, thereby permitting the argument that where a defendant in an action for conversion demonstrates that theplaintiff has recovered the property so converted, whilst the conversion is not purged, nevertheless return of the goods stands indiminution of damages.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Mr Sussex here relied upon <strong>Hiort v. London and North Western Railway</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281879%29%204%20ExD%20188" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1879) 4 Ex.D. 188</a>, a case in which the defendant warehouseman, charged with storing the plaintiffs' corn, were induced by the plaintiffs' agent topart with sixty quarters of that corn against the promise of a delivery order from the plaintiffs. As it happened, a third partysubsequently contracted with the plaintiffs to purchase the like quantity of corn as had been improperly obtained by the agent, andhaving obtained a delivery order from the plaintiffs for this transaction, the purchaser endorsed it over to the agent, who thereuponforwarded it to the defendant as the delivery order he had promised to send. The third party purchaser could not pay for the corn,and the agent never accounted to the plaintiffs for the price of the corn he had obtained.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> The plaintiffs sued the defendant in conversion, seeking to recover the value of the corn which had been predelivered to the agent,and failed, the Exchequer Division giving judgment for the defendant. On the plaintiffs' appeal, it was held by a majority that althoughthere had been a conversion of the sixty quarters of corn supplied to the agent against the promise of a delivery order, the plaintiffwas entitled to nominal damages only. Thesiger LJ observed (<em>op.cit.</em> at 199) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"There was an act of conversion which gave the plaintiffs a right of action, and subsequent to that act of conversion there was avalid transfer of the property in the goods from the plaintiffs to some other person, who was entitled to hold the goods and boundto pay their price to the plaintiffs; then the plaintiffs clearly had no dominion over these goods, no property in them which theywere able to transfer to the defendants upon the judgment being satisfied. It is true that the plaintiffs had a property in the goodsbetween the time of the act of unauthorized delivery and the time when they did authorize the delivery, that is, transferred theproperty in the goods to the third person. It appears to me, therefore, to follow from the ordinary rules which are applicable toactions of trover that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages only for the deprivation of their control over the goods fromthe time of the unauthorized delivery; but inasmuch as it is admitted that during that period the plaintiffs sustained no damagethey can only recover nominal damages. ...",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">whilst Bramwell LJ was of the view that the third party's endorsement to the agent of the <em>bona fide</em> delivery order, which was then forwarded by the agent as the promised order against the unauthorized initial advance, was</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"... equivalent to a return of the goods. I do not mean to say it is a return, but it is in the nature of a return of the goods, andthe same reason for reducing the damages to a nominal amount applies ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> I do not think that <strong>Hiort</strong>, upon which Mr Sussex "primarily relies" in this context, provides the support for which he contends. It is a curious case on itsfacts, and far removed from the present situation. In this argument Mr Sussex placed considerable reliance upon the obtaining byTrafigura of the Holding Certificate in respect of the cargo, which enabled him to argue that constructive possession of the cargowas thus resumed, and accordingly that there has been concluded a transaction akin to the recovery of the cargo. On the evidence,however, this contention does not succeed. I accept Mr Yue's evidence that the Holding Certificate as issued was plainly unsatisfactoryin its terms in that, inter alia, Trafigura had no power to remove the cargo from the bonded warehouse and send it elsewhere, neitherwas it permitted to survey the cargo by its chosen surveyor, SGS, nor, for that matter, was it permitted any form of warehouse receipt.So that in the circumstances that prevailed, I find it difficult to accept the disarming submission that what had occurred was akinto 'recovery' of the cargo, since at no time did Trafigura regain (to adopt the term used by both Thesiger and Bramwell LJJ in <strong>Hiort</strong>) "dominion" over the goods in question. To the contrary, as Mr Kerr submitted, the plaintiff had never regained control of the cargosubsequent to the misdelivery - on the facts there was no question, for example, of Trafigura being in a position to move the goodsfrom the warehouse - and, as he put it, "everything flowed" from this loss of control.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> It follows from the foregoing, therefore, that I reject the defendant's assertion, persuasively though it was broached, that theMinmetals contract, as signed and countersigned on 12 and 25 May 1998 respectively, served to negate the effects of the admittedact of misdelivery in Hong Kong, thereby enabling the recovery of nominal damages only. In my judgment the plaintiff's actions subsequentto the misdelivery fall squarely within the ambit of making all reasonable efforts to mitigate their loss; in my view Mr Kerr's pointis well-made that his client had never at any stage treated the goods as having rightly come into the hands of Minmetals. It is,perhaps, a wry reflection on events that had the plaintiff simply done nothing to attempt to rescue the position, and, without more,had stood simply on its cause of action in conversion and issued its writ forthwith, doubtless the contention then forthcoming wouldhave been of the plaintiff's failure to mitigate - which, as the correspondence reveals, was one of the matters exercising the mindsof the defendant's solicitors subsequent to receiving the plaintiff's notice of its claim.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Causation</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> A further significant plank within the defendant's attack on the plaintiff's claim is that of causation, the thrust of the argumentbeing that the loss of the plaintiff's cargo arose not as the result of the misdelivery but as the result of Minmetals moving thecargo from the Panyu Bonded Warehouse, and its consequent confiscation by the PSB on or about 12 July 1998. This was, submitted MrSussex, "a classic case of intervention by a third party", and he maintained that there could be no doubt that the confiscation bythe Chinese state agency must be considered the immediate or proximate cause of the loss.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> An important element of this particular argument was that, for all practical purposes, the misdelivery itself made no differenceto the cargo destination, and that it was plain in all the circumstances that the plaintiff was going to permit the cargo of copperto go into China, notwithstanding the absence of contractual agreement and absent a covering letter of credit in place, so that insistenceupon production of an original bill of lading in Hong Kong would have made no difference whatever. In fact, Mr Sussex went so faras to argue that in the circumstances the plaintiff had received the "windfall" of a cause of action for misdelivery, and as at 13May the plaintiff was in the same position as if the control mechanisms contemplated by the plaintiff (a transshipment bill of ladingin its name, an SGS survey, and a warehouse receipt) had eventuated, so that at bottom the misdelivery had had no causal impact uponthe loss at all. The control mechanisms were largely "window-dressing" for the financing bank, asserted Mr Sussex, the defendant'sposition being that they were "illusory", and he asked that the case be regarded with "a degree of commercial cynicism". The plaintiffwas willing to turn a "Nelsonian" eye to the smuggling that was obviously going on, he suggested, maintaining that there was littledifference between taking a warehouse receipt from a suspect warehouse in Panyu when compared with the position on 13 May, when theplaintiff was able to obtain a Holding Certificate from a "trusted client". A contract with Minmetals was inevitable, said Mr Sussex,the principal cause of the earlier impasse being interest-free periods, and on 13 May the plaintiff was in no worse a position thanif a contract had been concluded prior to the misdelivery, or if delivery had occurred in proper course against presentation of avalid bill of lading.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> I reject to this submission. I am unwilling to accept the defendant's invitation, in effect, to use a crystal ball and to re-runthe sequence of events in order to decide what would or would not have occurred if the cargo had not been so misdelivered by thedefendant. Mr Yue's evidence, which I accept, was that towards the end of April 1998 he was not only considering the position ifthe cargo indeed was to go into China, accompanied by the various acceptable and necessary protective mechanisms that the plaintiffdesired (given that under existing licensing arrangements, the plaintiff was under constraint not to trade within nor import intoChina), but that at the same time he was also mulling over the question of sale to another prospective purchaser, namely, Hutterbirds,or alternatively a possible sale of the cargo on the Shanghai metals market. I further reject the unsubstantiated submission thatthe plaintiff was, in effect, prepared to be privy to the smuggling of this cargo absent a customs declaration, which the uncontrovertedexpert evidence on the point established had to be made before the cargo went into the bonded warehouse.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In my judgment, the defendant's causation argument cannot be sustained. I have earlier observed that, subject to argument as to failureto mitigate, the plaintiff need have done no more than stand upon its cause of action consequent upon the admitted misdelivery, andI have held, also, that in the circumstances there has been neither election nor ratification of the position by the plaintiff. Had,for example, the cargo remained unseized, albeit unpaid for by Minmetals, no causation argument consequent on the actions of thePSB would have arisen, and in this sense, absent the plaintiff's ratification of the misdelivery, the actions of the PSB do not strikeme as other than a curious incident within the matrix of facts in this case.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In my view, the loss in this case was caused by and consequent upon the misdelivery, the cause of action vesting the plaintiff wasnot a "windfall", and the plaintiff is entitled to recover therefor. Nor do I consider there is any question of the loss being tooremote, which was the other plank suggested by the defendant consequent upon the PSB's actions.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Accordingly, I reject the causation line of argument.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Conversion</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Mr Sussex ran two arguments in relation to conversion. The first is that which was based on <strong>Hiort</strong>, <em>op.cit.</em>, which I have earlier considered.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The second argument related to the plaintiff's title to sue in conversion. Mr Sussex accepted that since the plaintiff has in itspossession the three originals of the bills of lading relating to this cargo, the plaintiff therefore has title to sue in contractby virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/440/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/440" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Lading and Analogous Shipping Documents Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/440">Cap.440</a>. He maintained, however, that the plaintiff had failed to prove its entitlement to a claim in conversion because all thatthe plaintiff had done was to produce the original bills of lading endorsed in blank, and that there had been no evidence about thefinancial arrangements for this shipment given that there were clearly financing banks involved. It was established that title tosue in conversion accrues only if a person had, at the time of the conversion, actual possession or the immediate right to possession,so that if the goods were pledged - as, for example, when bills of lading are delivered to a bank as security - the pledgee has theexclusive right to take possession, and consequently the sole right of action.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> However, in this case, said Mr Sussex, this did not seem to be the plaintiff's position in that it appeared that three original billsof lading relating to this cargo were in the hands of the Swiss Bank Corporation throughout the time that the "<em>Explorer</em>" called at Hong Kong, with another bank subsequently appearing to become involved, namely BNP Basle, which was named in the HoldingCertificate signed by Minmetals. Accordingly at the time when the conversion occurred - that is, between 3.30 pm on 29 April and1.00 am on 30 April 1998 - it appeared likely, argued Mr Sussex, that SBC was a pledgee of the bills, and thus had immediate rightto possession of the cargo, and it could be inferred that the bills were transferred to the plaintiff only when the pledge was redeemed.Without, therefore, explanation of the financing arrangements pursuant to which SBC and BNP Basle became involved, it could not beinferred in the plaintiff's favour that the plaintiff had the immediate right to possession at the time of the conversion.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> This point achieved no profile in the pleadings, being buried within a non-admission (at paragraph 2 of the Defence), and Mr Kerrfor the plaintiff was taken somewhat by surprise. In my view it is devoid of merit, and smacks somewhat of scraping the barrel. Interms of the oral evidence, Mr Yue knew little about the financing arrangements, albeit Mr Kerr pointed out that on the papers inevidence before the court his client was clearly the owner of this cargo, having had the purchase price of US$897,655.26 debitedfrom its SBC current account; in point of fact, said Mr Kerr, references to the financing were to monies advanced against the <em>on-sale</em> pending payment from the anticipated letter of credit, and the fact remained that SBC was perfectly prepared to make available abill of lading for discharge purposes in Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> This is an unsatisfactory situation, and serves to reinforce the view that it is necessary in commercial litigation to require pre-trialpreparation of an agreed list of issues to be ventilated at trial. In any event I am not prepared to accept the submission that theplaintiff has no <em>locus</em> to sue in conversion. On the evidence before the court the plaintiff had paid for these goods and had the right to, and was preparedto, present an original bill of lading to obtain delivery of this cargo, and I have no intention of speculating upon the plaintiff'sfinancial arrangements with either SBC or BNP, nor of making the adverse inferences the defendant now invites the court to make.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> To the foregoing I would add that I presently remain unpersuaded that it necessarily follows a party would not have a sufficientinterest to maintain an action for a conversion even in a pledge situation. The case of <strong>Bristol and West of England Bank v. Midland Railway</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1891%5d%202%20QB%20693" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1891] 2 QB 693</a>, to which Mr Sussex very properly drew my attention, tends to suggest that a transferee from a pledgee is entitled to sue in conversion,even though at the time of the conversion the immediate right to possession was vested in the transferor. Mr Sussex purported todistinguish this case on the facts as concerning a transfer by way of assignment by one pledgee bank to another, but in the circumstancesand without evidence of the precise position - for which the plaintiff in my view is not to be criticized, given the way the pointhas emerged - I do not propose to take this issue further. The plaintiff has demonstrated payment for and ownership of the cargo,which in normal course attracts the usual incidents of ownership, and was clearly prepared to take delivery against production ofan original bill of lading, and if the defendant had wished to raise a specific issue in rebuttal, the point should have been flaggedon the pleadings.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> I find that on the evidence before the court the plaintiff has <em>locus</em> to sue in conversion, and further that, on the facts of this case, the plaintiff is entitled to succeed in that cause of action.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Contractual exemptions</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The last significant line of attack on the plaintiff's claim involved contractual exemptions. In this regard Mr Sussex placed relianceon two clauses, Clause 5 and Clause 7(5)(b) of the bill of lading.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Under the sequential headings "Carrier's Responsibility Port-to-Port Shipment", <em>Clause 5</em> provides, <em>inter alia</em>, that <em>"the Carrier shall be under no liability whatsoever for loss of or damage to the goods, howsoever occurring if such loss or damagearises prior to loading onto or subsequent to discharge from the vessel"</em>.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Whilst under the heading "Sundry Liability Provisions", and the sub-heading "Scope of Application", <em>Clause 7(5)(b)</em> provides :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(b) The rights, defences, limitations and liberties of whatsoever nature provided for in this Bill of Lading shall apply in any actionagainst the Carrier for loss or damage or delay, howsoever occurring and whether the action be founded in contract or in tort andeven if the loss, damage or delay arose as a result of unseaworthiness, negligence or fundamental breach of contract."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Mr Sussex SC relied upon both clauses in his argument. He submitted, in terms, that "the combined effect of clauses 5 and 7(5)(b)results in an exclusion of liability for the consequences of misdelivery". For his <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/440#p1000r" class="autolink_findacts">part Mr</a> Kerr, on behalf of the plaintiff, argued that clauses of this nature do not apply to instances of misdelivery of goods by the carrier,a principle he asserted was recently reaffirmed by the English Court of Appeal decision in <strong>Motis Exports Ltd v. Dampskibsselskabet AF 1912 &amp; Anor</strong>.,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 Lloyds LR 211</a> - and that, in any event, Clause 5 specifically applies only to events after discharge, and in the present case misdelivery (andhence the loss) took place either when the delivery order was handed over to Harvest Fortune on 28 April or when the cargo crossedthe ship's rail, citing in this context the observations of Clarke J (as he then was) in <strong>The Ines</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 Lloyds LR 144</a> at 152.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Mr Sussex responded by arguing that <strong>Motis</strong>, <em>op.cit.</em>, was no authority for the proposition that liability for misdelivery cannot be excluded by a suitably worded clause or clauses, andthe only question in the present case, wherein Clause 7(5)(b) extended Clause 5, was whether these words were clear enough to achievethe result his clients sought.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> To this question the answer, in my view, must be 'No'. I have no doubt that the words are <em>not</em> clear enough. However many times these clauses be read, and whether read singly or together, I cannot attain a construction servingto exclude the liability of the contractual carrier for the misdelivery of the goods it has been engaged to carry.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> With regard to the ambit of Clause 5, I have earlier rejected Mr Sussex's primary submission that the loss in this case occurredafter discharge and as a consequence of the confiscation of the goods by PSB, whilst I am quite unable to ascribe to Clause 7(5)(b)the meaning the defendant now seeks to achieve. When read as a whole and in context, this clause does no more than to confirm theapplicability of the provisions of the bill of lading to any carrier assailed with a suit for loss, damage or delay occurring tothe goods transported. This seems to me to be a far cry from the result suggested by Mr Sussex, whether in conjunction with Clause5 or otherwise. In my view the court's approach to this type of submission should be one of considerable caution. As Rix J at firstinstance observed in <strong>Motis</strong>, <em>op.cit.,</em> when considering a clause not dissimilar to the present Clause 5 and in a case involving misdelivery against a forged bill of lading:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"I do not see why a natural reading of this language should regard it as including the misdelivery of the goods by the defendantsout of their possession, whether such misdelivery lie in the absence of any bill of lading or in the absence of an original or genuinebill of lading. If that alternative were a possible reading, it is not one which should lightly be adopted against the backgroundof the fundamental importance of the shipowner's promise to deliver up only against an original bill of lading. If that was whatthe defendants had intended to provide, they could so easily have done so. ...",</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">a view with which the Court of Appeal in that case agreed, Stuart-Smith LJ stating (op.cit. at 215) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"In my judgment cl.5(3)(b) is not apt on its natural meaning to cover delivery by the carrier or his agent, albeit the delivery wasobtained by fraud. I also agree with the Judge that even if the language was apt to cover such a case, it is not a construction whichshould be adopted, involving as it does excuse from performing an obligation of such fundamental importance. As a matter of constructionthe Courts lean against such a result if adequate content can be given to the clause. In my view it can ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> I reject the defendant's contentions under this head also.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Bailment</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> The plaintiff also advances a cause of action in bailment. Mr Sussex submitted that this added nothing to its claim in contract,and in any event contended that it was questionable whether there was any bailment in this case. The defendant was merely a contractualcarrier, he said, and it was not suggested that the defendant ever had physical possession of the cargo. And <em>if</em> it was a bailment, it was a bailment for reward on the terms of the bill of lading. In reply, Mr Kerr submitted that his client wasperfectly entitled to sue in bailment, in that it had the immediate right to physical possession of the goods immediately prior tothe misdelivery, here citing the recent Court of Appeal decision in <strong>Hong Kong Hua Guang Industrial Co. (a firm) v. Midway International Ltd &amp; Coastrand Shipping Ltd</strong>, CACV 207 of 1999. Mr Kerr suggested that the reason the defendant was anxious to avoid bailment was because the bailee effectivelybecame the insurer of the chattels and had the burden of showing why it was not liable for the full cost of the goods - and thisthe plaintiff manifestly could not do in this case.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> In the event, Mr Sussex reserved to the appellate court the issue of whether a high degree of control could give rise to bailment,and the issue was not developed further. In a sense, perhaps, the question is academic, since I have held earlier in this judgmentthat the plaintiff is entitled to succeed in this case in both contract and conversion. However, if I be wrong in these conclusions,I find in any event that on the facts of this case the plaintiff is entitled to succeed in bailment also.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Limitation</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> This line was no longer pursued by the defendant. Mr Sussex accepted the application of the Hague-Visby Rules, the effect of whichwas to preclude the taking of a package limitation point in terms of the carriage of this cargo.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> The result of the foregoing, therefore, is as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(1) There is to be judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of US$953,037.47;</p>        <p align="justify">(2) Interest is to run on such sum at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of the issue of the writ, 17 July 1998 to the date ofjudgment, and thereafter on such sum at the judgment rate from time to time prevailing, until payment;</p>        <p align="justify">(3) The defendant is to pay the plaintiff the costs of this action, to be taxed if not agreed; and</p>        <p align="justify">(4) The plaintiff's claim in terms of the recovery of expenses incurred in the mitigation of its loss be adjourned to a Master forassessment at a date and time to be fixed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Third Party Proceedings</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> As noted earlier in this judgment, subsequent to the default by the Third Party upon a discovery order of 10 June 1999, Harvest Fortunehas taken no further part in this action, nor has it appeared or been represented at this trial.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In the proceedings issued by the defendant against Harvest Fortune, the defendant in its Third Party Points of Claim seeks to passon to Harvest Fortune by way of "an indemnity and/or damages and/or a contribution" the liability, if any, of the defendant to theplaintiff.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> In his final address, Mr Sussex SC prayed in aid the terms of the Letter of Indemnity which had been issued by Harvest Fortune toSwire Shipping (Agencies) Ltd against which delivery was effected, which on the evidence of Ms Grace Li, which I accept, was receivedat the time of the release of the cargo on 28 or 29 April 1998. This Letter of Indemnity, contains, <em>inter alia,</em> the following provisions :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"... we hereby request you to give delivery of the cargo to us or to our order without production of the bills of lading in orderthat we might arrange for the right and true delivery of the cargo to those having the proper title thereto:</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">in consideration of your complying with our above request we hereby agree as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(Para.1) To indemnify you, your servants and agents and to hold all of you harmless in respect of any liability, loss or damage ofwhatsoever nature which you may sustain by reason of delivering the goods to (us) in accordance with our request.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(Para.2) In the event of any proceedings being commenced against you or any of your servants or agents in connection with the deliveryof the goods aforesaid to provide you or them from time to time with sufficient funds to defend the same ...</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">(Para.4) As soon as all original bills of lading for the above goods shall have arrived or come into our possession, to produce anddeliver the same to you whereupon our liability hereunder shall cease."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> In the event of his client being held liable to the plaintiff, Mr Sussex sought corresponding judgment against Harvest Fortune toencompass not only the sums due from the defendant to the plaintiff, but also to include within such financial indemnity the defendant'scosts on the basis that the terms of the indemnity given were "all embracing".</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> In light of the terms of the indemnity, in particular paragraph 1 thereof, it is difficult to resist that conclusion. I have, ofcourse, heard nothing from Harvest Fortune, which I note has alleged (in its Points of Defence dated 26 February 1999) that a MrChoi of Harvest Fortune was told by Ms Grace Lee (<em>sic</em>) <em>"that the letter of indemnity is a formality only and will not be enforced"</em> (at paragraph 4(c)) and that <em>"Based on Swire's representation, the Third Party signed the letter of indemnity ... which shall be void and of no effect"</em> (at paragraph 5). This appears to be the only defence which is pleaded.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Ms Grace Li who gave evidence, has described this allegation as <em>"absolutely untrue",</em> and I accept her evidence on the point. I am, therefore, left with an indemnity in the broad terms in which it was given againstdelivery of this cargo absent production of an original bill of lading, and in the circumstances the court has little option butto accede to the submission made on behalf of the defendant in terms of the consequent third party liability of Harvest Fortune.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(1) There is to be judgment in favour of the defendant against the Third Party in the sum of US$953,037.47, together with such furthersums as the defendant is called upon to pay to the plaintiff in terms of interest and taxed costs; and</p>        <p align="justify">(2) The Third Party is to pay to the defendant its costs incurred in the defence of the plaintiff's action and the costs of the ThirdParty proceedings, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> If such be necessary, I will hear the defendant as to the form of the Order.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> I thank counsel for their assistance.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(William Stone)<br>                Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>            </tr>            </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">Mr John Kerr, instructed by Messrs Ince &amp; Co., for the Plaintiff</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Charles Sussex SC, instructed by Messrs Richards Butler, for the Defendant</p>        <p align="justify">The Third Party was not represented and did not attend</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->                <p align="justify"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2000/1374.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
