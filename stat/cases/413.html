The Applicants are the Incorporated Owners of theBuilding. The Building comprises 15 floors, with the top floor being the 14<sup>th</sup> floor, and above it the rooftop. On the ground that the Respondents were illegally occupying the rooftop, the Applicants appliedto the Lands Tribunal for the following orders:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)   an injunction compelling the Respondents to demolish the unauthorized structure that they had erected on the rooftop and moveaway from that location and to stop dumping litter on the staircase, and prohibiting them from stealing the public utilities of electricityand drinking water;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)   an order requiring the Respondents to pay compensation for the loss and damage arising from their unlawful trespass;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)   a costs order; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)   an order as to other damages.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On 12 June 2001, Presiding Officer Chow of the Lands Tribunal dismissed the Applicantsâ application. On 31 July 2001, after a reviewhearing, Presiding Officer Chow upheld the ruling. The Applicants now appeal against the ruling.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Amendment of the Respondentsâ names</u></p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In the Notice of Application submitted by the Applicants to the Lands Tribunal, the Respondent was named as âMr Lee or unlawfuloccupierâ. Subsequently, two persons, namely Lee Kai Kong and Lo Hung Cheong, filed a Notice of Opposition. The Written Rulingof Presiding Officer Chow indicates that, upon his return to Hong Kong from Taiwan in January 1990, Mr Lee Kai Kong of the Respondentbegan to occupy the rooftop of the Building with the assistance of one Mr Chan Ming Fai (a director of one Ying King Trading Co Ltd)of the 14<sup>th</sup> Floor of the Building, and also erected a small house on the rooftop as residence. Mr Lee did these acts without the approval ofany of the owners of the Building, and he was not the owner of the rooftop, and hence he was an unlawful occupier of the rooftop.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The Presiding Officer said that he would not amend the Respondentâs name as no application had been made on behalf of the Applicantsfor such amendment. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 11</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/17A" class="autolink_findacts">Lands Tribunal Rules</a> provides that, at any stage of proceedings and either on or without the application of a party, the Tribunal may add or substitutethe name of any person as a party or strike out the name of any party. Mr Chan, Counsel for the Applicants, submitted that the Applicantsdid, at the review hearing, request the Presiding Officer to amend the Respondentâs name. In our judgment, as Mr Lee Kai Kong andMr Lo Hung Cheong had both admitted that they were the occupiers of the rooftop, the Presiding Officer should have considered amendingthe Respondentâs name even in the absence of an application by the Applicants for amendment of the Notice of Application, so asto ensure that both of the occupiers would be bound by the Presiding Officerâs ruling.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The Applicants now apply to amend the Respondentâs name, and we allow the application and amend the Respondentâs name to âLeeKai Kong and Lo Hung Cheongâ.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Common parts</u></p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The Building falls within the purview of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> (hereinafter âthe Ordinanceâ). <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> of the Ordinance provides that, when the owners of a building have been incorporated under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8</a>, the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the owners in relation to the common parts of the building shall be exercised and performedby the owners incorporation to the exclusion of the owners.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The Applicants submitted that the rooftop of the Building is a common part. Schedule 1 to the Ordinance defines âcommon partsâto include the roof, i.e. the rooftop. The first issue before us is whether the rooftop of the Building is a common part. Under section2 (the interpretation section) of the Ordinance, âcommon partsâ means:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     the whole of a building, except such parts as have been specified or designated in an instrument registered in the Land Registryas being for the exclusive use, occupation or enjoyment of an owner; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)     unless so specified or designated, those parts specified in Schedule 1.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>On this definition, a part of a building is a common part if it has not been designated as being for the exclusive use of a particularowner. This includes the rooftop of the building.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Registered owner</u></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Applicants are not the registered owners of the rooftop of the Building.

Although the ownership of the rooftopby the abovenamed 4 persons has been registered in the Land Registry, Schedule 1 to the DMC does not set out the exclusive rightof those persons over the rooftop. Schedule 1 also shows that, save for the abovementioned three floors, each floor of the Buildingis owned by an individual owner. Schedule 2 to the DMC specifies the shares allocated to the owners of the Building: the owners of12 floors are each allocated 1/15 shares, another owner is allocated 2/45 shares, and the abovenamed 4 persons are allocated 7/45shares.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> As the rooftop is not included in Schedule 1 to the DMC which details the exclusive right over individual floors, the title allocatedto the abovenamed 4 persons under Schedule 2 does not extend to the rooftop. In other words, the rooftop has not been allocated anyshare.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Jumbo King Ltd.</u></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In <i>Jumbo King Ltd. v.

This principle has been applied by the Court of FirstInstance in a number of cases, such as: <i>Modern Sino Ltd. v. Art Fair Co.

Nevertheless, on the authority of <i>Jumbo King</i>, as the 4 owners of the rooftop owned undivided shares to the Ground Floor, 4<sup>th</sup> Floor and 14<sup>th</sup> Floor of the Building, they enjoyed the right to the exclusive possession of the rooftop when they registered as owners of the rooftopin 1957.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The above 4 owners sold the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor and the 14<sup>th</sup> Floor in 1957 and 1960 respectively. They sold the remaining units on the Ground Floor in 2000. One of them had passed away by then,and the relevant shares were sold by the administrator of the deceasedâs estate. Upon sale of the Ground Floor units, the 4 ownersno longer owned any undivided share in the Building and, accordingly, no longer had the right to the exclusive possession of therooftop. It follows that the rooftop had become a common part of the Building latest by 2000.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Ordinance</u></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> As the rooftop is a common part, the Applicants are entitled to exercise the rights in relation to the common part in accordancewith section 16 of the Ordinance, which provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p><b>Rights etc. of owners to be exercised etc. by corporation</b></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>When the owners of a building have been incorporated under section 8, the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the owners in relationto the common parts of the building shall be exercised and performed by, and the liabilities of the owners in relation to the commonparts of the building shall, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, be enforceable against, the corporation to the exclusionof the owners, and accordingly â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     any notice, order or other document which relates to any of the common parts of the building may be served upon the corporationat its registered office; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)     any proceedings in the tribunal in respect of any of the common parts of the building may be brought and pursued by or againstthe corporation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Section 34I of the Ordinance prohibits any person from converting any part of the common parts of a building to his own use. Thefull text of that section is set out below:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)        No person may â</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)     convert any part of the common parts of a building to his own use unless such conversion is approved by a resolution of theownersâ committee (if any);</p>            <p>(b)     use or permit to be used the common parts of a building in such a manner as â</p>            <blockquote>                <p>(i)      unreasonably to interfere with the use and enjoyment of those parts by any owner or occupier of the building; or</p>                <p>(ii)     to cause a nuisance or hazard to any person lawfully in the building.</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>Section 34I</u></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Although Presiding Officer Chow accepted that the rooftop is a common part of the Building, he refused to grant any relief to theApplicants on the ground that the term âpersonâ in section 34I referred to a person bound by the DMC; the Respondents merelyoccupied the rooftop unlawfully and, not being owners of the Building, were not bound by the DMC, and therefore section 34I did notapply to them.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> With respect, we do not agree. The word âpersonâ under section 34I simply refers to any person who occupies the common parts.The Ordinance empowers an owners incorporation to manage the common parts, and this certainly includes granting the incorporationthe power to take legal proceedings against any person who occupies the common parts. What the Presiding Officer said means thatthe incorporation would not be able to take legal action against those persons because they were not bound by the deed of mutualcovenant. This would run against the legislative intent of empowering the incorporation to manage the common parts.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The Presiding Officer cited section 34I(2) of the Ordinance, which states that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be deemed to be in breach of an obligation imposed on him by the deed of mutual covenantin respect of the building.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In fact, this provision does not serve to support the Presiding Officerâs interpretation of section 34I(1). The meaning of thisprovision cannot be simpler and clearer. Any person who contravenes section 34I(1) shall be deemed to be in breach of the deed ofmutual covenant even if that person is initially not bound by it. At the same time, the provisions of section 34I are deemed to bepart of the deed of mutual covenant.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Section 34I is under Part VIA of the Ordinance. Section 34C of that Part provides that Part VIA only applies to a building in respectof which a deed of mutual covenant is in force. As the DMC of the Building is in force, the Applicants may rely on section 34I. Althoughthe existence of a deed of mutual covenant is a pre-condition to the application of section 34I, this does not mean that the wordâpersonâ under that section is to be confined to a person bound by a deed of mutual covenant.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Furthermore, the Respondentsâ defence was that since 1990 they had, by means of various connections, resided at the rooftop, whichmeant they had been residing there for more than 10 years. Whatever form they took in occupying the rooftop, they were bound by theDMC: see <i>Incorporated Owners of Man Hong Apartment v. Kwong Yuk Ching and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%203%20HKC%20116" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 3 HKC 116.</a> For this reason, even if section 34I were to be interpreted in the way the Presiding Officer Chow did, the Applicants could stillrely on that section as their cause of action against the Respondents.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Tort</u></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> As a matter of fact, apart from section 34I, the Applicants may rely on the common law of tort as their cause of action against theRespondents in claiming back the rooftop that they have occupied. Section 45 of and Schedule 10 to the Ordinance confers upon theLands Tribunal the jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings founded on tort.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Public utilities: water and electricity</u></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Under Schedule 1 to the Ordinance, common parts include âwater tanks, ducts, downpipes, cablesâ. If the Respondents steal publicelectricity and water from public electric wires and water pipes, the Applicants must be entitled to restrain them from doing so.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Clause 2 of the DMC</u></p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Clause 2 of the DMC defines the extent to which the owners of the Building are entitled to enjoy the common parts:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Each of the parties hereto shall have the right in common with the others of the parties hereto and all others having the like rightto use for the purpose of access to and egress from the Floor or Floors so allotted to each of them the entrance hall lifts stair-casesand landings in the said building and such of the passages therein as are not included in any of the other floors of the said building<s>and to use the roof of the said building for lawful and usual purposes</s>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In his Ruling of 12 June 2001, the Presiding Officer pointed out that the phrase in the above clause which had been crossed out indicatedthat the common parts of the Building did not include the rooftop. In our view, although Clause 2 may be interpreted in the aforesaidmanner, we conclude upon analysis that a more reasonable interpretation is that the rooftop is part of the common parts.
