Customs and Excise Commissioners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 133 (HL).</a></p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Evergreenâs claims in these proceedings arose out of the business of Uniglory Marine Corporation (âUnigloryâ) whose rightsand liabilities Evergreen has assumed in a corporate merger in 2002.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Uniglory was the carrier of certain university uniforms (âthe Uniformsâ) from Shanghai, PRC to Um Qaser, Iraq under 52 billsof lading, variously dated between October and December 2000 (âthe Uniglory B/Lsâ).</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The Uniforms were sold and delivered to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Iraq (âMHESRâ) under theâoil-for-foodâ program established by the Security Council of the United Nations under Resolution 986 passed in April 1995 toallow Iraq to sell oil to finance, <i>inter alia</i>, the purchase of humanitarian goods in the midst of United Nations sanctions against Iraq following Iraqâs invasion of Kuwait in1990.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The supply of the Uniforms to MHESR went through a chain of contracts:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) MHESR awarded contracts for the supply of the Uniforms to El Hosan for Import &amp; Export (âEl Hosanâ) and El Farse El Arabi(âEl Farseâ), both companies based in Egypt, in July 2000 as well as to Fast Trading &amp; Contracting (âFast Tradingâ),a company based in Qatar, in September 2000.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) El Hosan, El Farse and Fast Trading then entered into sub-contracts with SMQ Enterprises Limited (âSMQâ), a company basedin Cyprus, for the supply of the Uniforms.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) SMQ in turn sub-sub-contracted the supply of the Uniforms to a Hong Kong company called Karimâs International (H.K.) Limited(âKarimâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) Lastly, Karim sub-sub-sub-contracted the supply of the Uniforms to Zhejiang Textile Import and Export Corporation (âZTIECâ),a PRC corporation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> BNP Paribas was the designated escrow bank for the âoil-for-food programâ and as such responsible for the issue of letters ofcredit for the purchase of humanitarian goods using the proceeds from oil sales.  In payment of the Uniforms, BNP Paribas (New YorkBranch) issued in favour of each of El Hosan, El Farse and Fast Trading a letter of credit (âthe BNPP L/Csâ).  The BNPP L/Csin favour of El Hosan and El Farse required the Uniforms to be of Egyptian origin and to be shipped from Egypt to Baghdad via UmQaser.  Evergreen does not have a copy of the BNPP L/C of which Fast Trading was the beneficiary but expects it to specify Qataras the origin of shipment.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> There is no evidence as to how El Hosan, El Farse and Fast Trading paid for the purchase of the Uniforms from SMQ.  SMQ itself arrangedfor Arab International Bank (El Tahrir Branch) (âAIBâ) to issue in favour of Karim irrevocable transferable letters of credit(âthe AIB L/Csâ) which Karim then transferred to ZTIEC though transferred letters of credit issued by HBZ (âthe HBZ L/Csâ)on 7 and 8 August 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The AIB L/Cs specified the ports of loading and discharge as Suez, Egypt and Um Qaser, Iraq respectively.  An amendment dated 11October 2000 added the conditions that âonly ocean-marine carrier bills of lading acceptable showing load port as Suez to Um Qasrwith freight prepaid B/Lâ and âthat no forwarders or short form bill of lading acceptableâ.  By an amendment dated 28 September2000, 31 October 2000 was fixed as the latest shipment date.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The HBZ L/Cs, as originally issued, also specified shipment from Suez to Um Qaser.  However, by an amendment dated 21 August 2000,the HBZ L/Cs were revised to allow shipment from Shanghai.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Uniglory was engaged to ship the Uniforms from Shanghai to Um Qaser through a chain of freight-forwarders.  The freight-forwarderwith whom Uniglory dealt was Vast Ocean International Transportation Co. Ltd (âVast Oceanâ).  According to Evergreen, in thecourse of the prior negotiation, Vast Ocean had requested Uniglory to state the port of loading as Suez in the bills of lading tobe issued by Uniglory.  Upon Unigloryâs refusal, Vast Ocean indicated that it would arrange for house bills of lading to be issued. Then, sometime around October 2000, Vast Ocean told Uniglory that it was no longer necessary for the port of loading to be statedas Suez and requested Uniglory to issue bills of lading.  Hence, the Uniglory B/Ls were issued.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Beginning from 21 October 2000, Uniglory carried the Uniforms from Shanghai to Dubai where they were transhipped to Um Qaser by SimatechShipping LLC (âSimatechâ), a liner operator providing a âfeederâ server to Iraq for Uniglory and a number of other carriersat the time.  The Uniforms were then delivered in Iraq by Simatech to the custody of the Iraq State Company for Water Transport (âSCWTâ)which had exclusive authority over all activities at Iraqi ports including Um Qaser and arranged and authorized the unloading ofcargoes and acted as marine agent for all carriers at such ports.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> SCWT, in turn, released the Uniforms to MHESR against âletters of undertakingâ issued by MHESR and not the Uniglory B/Ls.  Itis Evergreenâs case that this was in accordance with the working practice for release of goods prevailing at Iraqi ports at thetime and that Uniglory had advised Vast Ocean of such practice beforehand.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Apparently, El Hosan, El Farse and Fast Trading had all obtained full payment for the Uniforms under the BNPP L/Cs.  The evidenceadduced by Evergreen shows that El Hosan, El Farse and Fast Trading did so by submitting to BNP Paribas (New York Branch) bills oflading that were forgeries as none of the Uniglory B/Ls complied with the conditions as to the origin of shipment under the BNPPL/Cs.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> ZITEC also obtained payment but only for the Uniforms shipped under 31 of the Uniglory B/Ls (âthe Paid Uniglory B/Lsâ), for whichAIB had debited SMQâs account under the AIB L/Cs.  ZTIEC claimed to have been unable to obtain payment for the Uniforms shippedunder the remaining 21 Uniglory B/Ls (âthe Unpaid Uniglory B/Lsâ).  On the other hand, SMQ claimed to have been unable to obtainpayment from El Hosan, El Farse and Fast Trading for the Uniforms for which it had paid under the AIB L/Cs as aforesaid.  Both SMQand ZTIEC had taken legal actions against Uniglory on the premises of such non-payment.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Taking these actions in reverse order, in 2002, SMQ sued Uniglory in Egypt for compensation for wrongful release of the Uniformsfor which SMQ had paid under the AIB L/Cs without production of the original bills of lading.  The Egyptian courts dismissed thisaction and SMQâs appeal therefrom on the ground that SMQ was not a party to the Uniglory B/Ls.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Of greater relevance to this application is the action (âthe ZTIEC Actionâ) commenced by ZTIEC against Uniglory in the ShanghaiMaritime Court, PRC on 7 November 2001 for compensation for wrongful release of the Uniforms shipped under the Unpaid Uniglory B/Lswithout production of the original bills of lading.  On 25 December 2002, ZTIEC obtained judgment for the sums of US$2,602,562 beingthe value of the Uniforms shipped under the Unpaid Uniglory B/Ls and RMB3,393,537.44 being the amount of tax refund that ZTIEC wassupposed to receive for such uniforms.  Evergreenâs appeal and application for re-hearing were dismissed on 4 September 2003 and5 February 2007 respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Uniglory itself had also taken the offensive by suing BNP Paribas, BNP Paribas (New York Branch), HBZ, Simatech and ZTIEC in theShanghai Maritime Court on 1 December 2003 for compensation for the loss and damage that it had suffered from shipping fraud (âtheUniglory Actionâ).  The Shanghai Maritime Court dismissed the Uniglory Action on 23 February 2006, holding that the loss and damagesuffered by Uniglory was caused by its own wrongful release of the Uniforms shipped under the Unpaid Uniglory B/Ls.  Evergreenâsappeal was dismissed on 19 April 2007.</p>    <p class="heading">Purpose of these proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Evergreen intends to apply to the Supreme Court of the PRC for a re-hearing of the ZTIEC Action.  The present application is madewith a view to obtaining information that might assist Evergreen in overturning or, at least, reducing the judgment against Unigloryin the ZTIEC Action.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> There is no dispute that as a matter of general principle, a <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> order may, in an appropriate case, be made for discovery in aid of foreign proceedings or potential foreign proceedings : <i>Manufacturerâs Life Insurance Company of Canada v.

I will proceed on this basis.</p>    <p class="heading">Information expected to be revealed</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Evergreen seeks the aforesaid documents to confirm by what means and in what amounts ZTIEC had got paid for the Uniforms.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Evergreen wants such confirmation because it suspects that ZTIEC had</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) in fact obtained payment for some, if not all, of the Uniforms shipped under the Unpaid Uniglory B/Ls with the use of unauthenticshipping documents (as in the case of El Hosen, El Farse and Fast Trading); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) then proceeded to make a false or inflated claim against Uniglory in the ZTIEC Action. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Evergreenâs suspicion that ZTIEC had collected more payment for the Uniforms than it had disclosed is fueled by the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Firstly, sometime in 2001, the owner of Vast Ocean (âMr Ngaiâ) informed Unigloryâs Mr Li  Li (âMr Liâ) that he had beeninformed by an employee of ZTIEC called Luo Jia that the losses suffered by ZTIEC should be less than the amount it claimed in theZTIEC Action.  Then, sometime around 2003/2004, Mr Ngai himself indicated to Mr Li in a telephone conversation that the losses sufferedby ZTIEC should be less than the amount it claimed in the ZTIEC Action.  Evergreen takes these statements to mean that ZTIEC hadreceived payment for at least some of the Uniforms shipped under the Unpaid Uniglory B/Ls.  When Mr Tai Jiin-chyuan, Group ExecutiveOfficer, Legal Affairs of the Evergreen Group, contacted Mr Ngai in 2005 for assistance, Mr Ngai avoided his questions and said hedid not have a clear recollection of the relevant events which had taken place quite some time ago.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) Secondly, Evergreen cannot discern any logic as to why certain ZTIEC invoices were paid while others were not.  There is no patternwhether one goes by the dates of presentation of the invoices, the dates of issue of the corresponding bills of lading or the shippers(El Hosan, El Farse and Fast Trading).  Six of the invoices were paid just days before SMQâs letter before action to Uniglory. In the absence of an explanation, Evergreen believes that the selective payment of ZTIEC invoices was the result of arrangementsagreed between ZTIEC, Karim and/or SMQ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The bases upon which Evergreen surmises that ZTIEC had presented shipping documents other than the authentic Uniglory B/Ls are thatnone of the Uniglory B/Ls complied with the condition in the AIB L/Cs as to the port of loading and that 17 of the Paid UnigloryB/Ls were issued after 31 October 2000, the latest shipment date permitted under the AIB L/Cs.  Evergreen believes that ZTIEC hadnot presented the Uniglory B/Ls and had never intended to rely on such authentic shipping documents as a means to secure paymentby Karim.  This was so because Uniglory had advised Vast Ocean, the freight-forwarder who arranged shipment of the Uniforms for ZTIEC,of the procedure for the release of goods delivered in Iraq so that ZTIEC would have realized that it could not rely on the billsof lading to be issued by Uniglory to secure payment of the Uniforms from Karim.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> For the sake of completeness, I should also mention that</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) On about 20 November 2000, Vast Ocean inadvertently faxed to Uniglory a copy of an irrevocable transferable letter of credit No.DCD08209137 (âthe HSBC L/Câ) issued by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (âHSBCâ) in favour of Karimin respect of a total of 50,000 sets of university uniforms to be shipped from China to Dubai.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) This was used to ground an application in paragraph 1 of the Originating Summons against HSBC for disclosure of all letters ofcredit issued by HSBC for the purchase of university uniforms with Karim as beneficiary, in particular, the HSBC L/C, and all relateddocuments including those presented to apply for payment under such letters of credit.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) In short, Evergreen suspected that the HSBC L/C had been transferred by Karim in favour of ZTIEC or its affiliate(s) and thatthe latter had received payment under the HSBC L/C for some of the Uniforms, using documents that would not include any of the UnigloryB/Ls.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) As HSBC did not oppose Evergreenâs application, an order in terms of paragraph 1 was made by Mr. Justice Sakhrani against HSBCon 12 September 2007.  Such order has been complied with.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)    At the hearing before me on 5 May 2008, in answer to my question, Mr Jonathan Wong, counsel for Evergreen, was instructed toconfirm that the documents disclosed by HSBC had not yielded anything useful to Evergreen.  I take this answer to mean that thereis no or no adequate evidence that ZTIEC or its affiliate(s) had received payment under the HSBC L/C for any of the Uniforms shippedunder the Unpaid Uniglory B/Ls, as Evergreen has surmised.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Overview</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The suspected wrongs in respect of which Evergreen seeks <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery are :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) the forgery and the presentation of unauthentic bills of lading to obtain payment for the Uniforms shipped under the Unpaid UnigloryL/Cs; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) the making of a false or inflated claim in the ZTIEC Action against Uniglory despite such payment. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Evergreen makes the present application not to discover the identity of the wrongdoer.

He was told by the managing director of the defendant at 2 meetings that serious allegations had been madeagainst him by an unidentified external party.  The managing director, however, refused to disclose the source of the allegationswhich had asked not to be named or the contents of the allegations since to do so would identify the party making them.  The plaintiffwas then required to attend a disciplinary hearing to consider allegations of gross misconduct which had been made by an externalparty against him.  The plaintiff was given the opportunity to make representations but could not do so because again, the defendantdisclosed no detail of the allegations save the defendant conclusion that they were evidence of gross misconduct in the way in whichthe plaintiff had conducted himself with external contractors.  Sir Richard Scott VC described the disciplinary hearing as no morethan a farce.  The plaintiff was summarily dismissed at the conclusion of the hearing.  The plaintiff appealed his dismissal.  Theappeal hearing was as farcical as the disciplinary hearing as it was conducted in the same manner with the case against the plaintiffbeing withheld from him.  It had become known within the industry that the plaintiff had been dismissed for alleged impropriety. He was, however, unable to clear his name without knowing what the allegations against him were and who had made them.  He couldnot obtain another job and his career had been wrecked.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> In addition to pursuing the defendant for various relief for unfair dismissal, the plaintiff in <i>P v. T Ltd</i> also applied by motion for an order for disclosure to him by the defendant of the allegations made against him and their source withthe express intention of using the information to bring a claim against the source in defamation and/or malicious falsehood.  <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery was necessary because it was not possible for the plaintiff to know for certain whether he did or did not have a viablecause of action against the informant without knowing the information that was supplied.  He gave affidavit evidence that he hadnot committed any act justifying the description of gross misconduct.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In ordering <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery, Sir Richard Scotts VC said at p.1318C-F :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn that respect his position is not the same as that of the plaintiff in the Norwich Pharmacal case ... In the Norwich Pharmacalcase the plaintiff was able to demonstrate that tortious infringements of patent rights were being committed.  It did not know bywhom.  It did not know whom to sue.  But that there was tortious conduct against it was not in question.  In the present case, itis in question whether a tort has been committed against the plaintiff.  He believes that it has.  The purpose of any order I make,as I suppose of any order that a judge ever makes, is to try to enable justice to be done.  It seems to me that in the circumstancesof the present case justice demands that the plaintiff should be placed in a position to clear his name if the allegations made againsthim are without foundation.  It seems to me intolerable that an individual in his position should be stained by serious allegations,the content of which he has no means of discovering and which he has no means of meeting otherwise than with the assistance of anorder of discovery such as he seeks from me.  It seems to me that the principles expressed in the Norwich Pharmacal case, althoughthey have not previously been applied so far as I know to a case in which the question whether there has been a tort has not clearlybeen answered, ought to be applicable in a case such as the present.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> <i>P v. T Ltd</i> was considered and distinguished at first instance by Rimer J in <i>Axa Equity &amp; Law Life Assurance Society Plc v. National Westminster Bank Plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20PNLR%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] PNLR 433</a>, another instance of an application for <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery being put on the basis that it was required to confirm if the applicant had a case against an identified third party. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> In that case, the plaintiffs were investors who had subscribed for some Â£19 million of mortgage debenture stock issued by a listedcompany which owned and managed hotels.  The company defaulted in payment of the interest due on the stock and eventually went intoadministrative receivership.  The managing director was subsequently convicted of a number of offences of knowingly making misleading,false or deceptive statements and of forging or falsifying documents for the issue.  The investors had taken out a generally indorsedwrit of summons against the companyâs auditors who carried out certain works in connection with the listing particulars, includingthe preparation of a working capital report and works in relation to a statement of indebtedness and extracts from the companyâsaudited financial statements.  The investors had formed the belief that some of the financial information in the listing particularsand the audited accounts was untrue or misleading or contained material omissions in that the companyâs indebtedness had been understatedby Â£7 million and its available cash assets overstated by Â£4 million. The writ claimed damages against the auditors for negligenceor breach of duty under s. 150 of the Financial Services Act 1986.  The writ was, however, not served upon the auditors because theinvestors thought they would be unable to plead an adequate case of inaccuracy or negligence.  The investors then issued a noticeof motion against, <i>inter alia</i>, the company and 2 banks which were the companyâs principal lenders, seeking discovery of documents in their possession relatingto the preparation by the auditors of the companyâs accounts and the listing particulars.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Insofar as it is relevant for present purpose, the investors, by their solicitor, asserted in their evidence on the motion that theywere not in position to plead a case against the auditors because while they believed they had a case, they did not actually knowwhether they in fact had one, or if they did, what its factual basis was and whether it was of sufficient quality to make it worthprogressing to trial.  Rimer J, accepting such evidence, dealt with the application on the basis that further prosecution of theaction against the auditors was dependent upon obtaining sufficient discovery to enable the investors to know whether they had acase against the auditors.  Rimer J further came to the view that the investors claim based on s. 150 was extremely weak and wasmore likely to fail than not.  The claim in negligence was somewhat stronger but the investors faced major difficulty in provinga breach of duty.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Having taken such view, Rimer J dismissed the motion for discovery on grounds of, <i>inter alia</i>, the poor quality of the investorsâ case against the auditors and did so as a matter of jurisdiction and not discretion.  His Lordshipconcluded at p.457A-D :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... I have come to the conclusion that the orders sought against the five defendants are of a type which the courts do not makeand, were the applications to be opposed by the defendants, it would decline to make them.  That is because they are in the natureof âfishingâ orders and because they are not justified by any exception or qualification to the mere witness rule.  Moreover,I agree with Mr Hollander that the correct analysis is that the court has no jurisdiction to make the orders sought.  I do not considerthat the correct analysis is that the court has a general jurisdiction to make discovery orders of all sorts and for all purposesagainst anyone but merely declines to make orders of the present sort as a matter of discretion and if the application is opposed. I prefer the view that the development of English law has reached the point that it recognises a jurisdiction to make discoveryorders of, inter alia, the Norwich Pharmacal type, but that it has not reached the point where it recognises a jurisdiction to makeorders of the type sought by the plaintiffs in the present case.  On the contrary, it has recognised that it cannot and does notmake such orders. ...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> In coming to this conclusion, Rimer J first noted that all members of the House of Lords in <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> regarded the plaintiffs therein as having the strongest <i>prima facie</i> case of infringement against the importers.  In particular, Rimer J referred to the citation by Lord Cross of Chelsea of a passagefrom <i>Post v. Toledo, Cincinnati and St Louis Railroad Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2011%20NE%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 11 NE 540</a>, a decision of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, which included the statement that â<i>a bill for discovery cannot be used to enable a plaintiff to fish for information of any causes of action he may have against otherpersons than the defendant</i>â and said at pp.445C-446B :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âLord Cross said that he found that decision:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... of great assistance in the solution of the problem before us in this case.  The court which decided it was of high standing;it was decided in the light of the old English Chancery authorities which as the case was decided as long ago as 1887 the judgeswere probably in a better position to understand than we are; and it lays down a reasonable principle by which to judge whether aplaintiff should have this sort of discovery.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I interpret Lord Cross as approving the whole of the passage he cited from the Post case, including the statement that bills of discoverycould not be used âto enable a plaintiff to fish for information of any causes of action he may have against other persons otherthan the defendantâ.  The Norwich Pharmacal case was not about an application for discovery of that sort.  It was in no sense afishing application.  It was based on the premise that the plaintiffs had a clear case for infringement against the importers andthere was no question of the plaintiffs fishing for information as to whether they had any such case.  Had they been, then I considerit likely that their application would have failed.  Lord Kilbrandonâs judgment also proceeded on the basis that the plaintiffshad a clear case against the importers: see page 200A-B.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">By contrast with the Norwich Pharmacal case, the plaintiffs in the present proceedings do not have a prima facie case against Coopers. Nor on the material before the court do they even disclose an arguable case, since their evidence concedes that, on the informationat present known to them and without the desired discovery, they cannot plead a case against Coopers and cannot hope to progresstheir writ to a trial.  The whole point of their discovery application against the defendants is to find out if they do have a caseagainst Coopers.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In my judgment, Norwich Pharmacal provides no authority at all for the proposition that discovery for that purpose can properly beordered against third parties.  On the contrary, I consider that it is implicit in the judgments of most of their Lordships thatsuch discovery cannot be ordered and the citation from the Post case, which Lord Cross approved, include a specific statement tothat effect.â  </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Rimer J then considered submissions by counsel for the investors based on subsequent authorities, namely <i>RAC Corp v. Reddingtons Rare Records</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20WLR%201445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 WLR 1445</a>; <i>SociÃ©tÃ© Romanaise de la Chaussure SA v.

His Lordship observedthat in none of those cases was discovery sought to ascertain whether the plaintiff had a cause of action against a suspected wrongdoerand that disclosure was ordered on the basis that the plaintiff did have a <i>prima facie</i> or strong <i>prima facie</i> claim against the identified wrongdoer.  Rimer J summarized at p.444A-C :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... The plaintiffs have identified Coopers as alleged wrongdoers and have issued a writ against them.  The defendants against whomthey seek discovery are, in principle, compellable to give evidence at any trial so that, on the face of it, the discovery ordersought against them infringes the mere witness rule and cannot therefore be made.  There are exceptions to the mere witness rule,of which Norwich Pharmacal provides one type of example, and the Bankers Trust and Aiyela cases provide others.  The present casedoes not fall within any of those exceptions.  Mr. McQuaterâs argument is, in effect, that there is a further exception, namelythe case where, although the alleged wrongdoer has been identified, there will be no trial unless the desired discovery is obtainedsince without it the plaintiffs will not know if they have a case at all, cannot therefore plead it and cannot progress it to trial. In my judgment, however, there is no such further exception.  For reasons given earlier, I consider that applications for discoveryfor that purpose are in the nature of âfishingâ applications which the court will not allow.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Rimer J was also referred by counsel for the investors to <i>P v. T Ltd</i>, which case his Lordship described at p.454D as âfairly remarkableâ and at p.457A as turning on its own âvery unusual factsâ. Rimer J cited the passage quoted in Â§38 above and said at pp.456B-457A :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThat passage underlines that Norwich Pharmacal itself was a case where the plaintiffs had a prima facie case against the knownwrongdoer.  The Vice-Chancellor recognised that the case before him did not satisfy that test since, until the allegations were known,it remained in question whether a tort had been committed against the plaintiff at all.  That recognition is, in my view, consistentwith the conclusion to which I have come, that the Norwich Pharmacal principle is not one which enables a plaintiff to obtain a discoveryorder for fishing purposes.  In a sense, the application by the plaintiff in P. v. T. Ltd was in the nature of a fishing applicationsince whilst he believed he had done nothing to warrant a charge of gross misconduct, he was not in a position to assert that themaker of the allegations had committed a wrong against him until he knew what the allegations were.  For the reasons he gave theVice-Chancellor made the discovery order sought.  The case was of course one which cried out for the making of the order which theVice-Chancellor made and it would appear to me to be a grave defect in our system of justice if the courts could not provide theplaintiff in that case with the remedy he wanted.  It is, if I may respectfully say so, not in the least surprising that the Vice-Chancellormade the order which he did and his judgment reflects how he considered that, in the particular circumstances of the case, justicedemanded that he should do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr McQuater relies on that case as showing that the Norwich Pharmacal principle or, at any rate, its extension in P. v. T. Ltd doesenable the court to make discovery orders against third parties even in cases where the plaintiff, until he has the desired discovery,is not in a position to assert a prima facie case of wrongdoing against the intended defendant.  I agree with Mr McQuater that thedecision in P. v. T. Ltd can be regarded as going further than any previous decision.  I do not, however, regard it as an authorityfor justifying the order sought in the present case.  The Vice-Chancellor emphasised the special nature of the facts in the casebefore him.  I do not consider that he would have regarded himself as establishing a new general principle that an intending plaintiffwho wishes to find out if he has a case against an intended defendant is entitled to discovery against third parties directed atassisting him in that enquiry.  In my judgment, any such development would be inconsistent with the Norwich Pharmacal case itselfand also with the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Aiyela case, which latter was apparently not cited in P. v. T. Ltd.  Inmy judgment, the case is one which turned on its own very unusual facts and I do not regard it as establishing any wider principleapplicable to the present case.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The Court of Appeal ([1998] CLC 1177) upheld Rimer Jâs decision to dismiss the motion but on the grounds that the orders for discoverysought against the banks and the company would infringe the âmere witnessâ rule because the investors could plead an arguablecase against the auditors such as to give rise to a trial in due course in which both the banks and the company could be compelledto produce the documents sought and also that the banks were not so mixed up in the alleged tortious acts of the auditors as to warrantan order for discovery against them.  </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Insofar as it is material to the case before me, Morritt LJ, with whom Brooke and May LJJ concurred, disagreed with Rimer Jâs assessmentof the prospects of the investorsâ claim against the auditors both under s. 150 and in negligence.  And bearing in mind that aparty was required to plead the material facts on which he relied and not the evidence by which he hoped to prove them, Morritt LJsaw no problem in the investors pleading good causes of action against the auditors and concluded that the investors already hadsufficient information to ensure that there was a trial of the case they sought to make against the auditors if they chose to makeit.  In this regard, Morritt LJ held (at p.1183A-B, Â§18) that the court must have regard to all the evidence and was not bound bythe conclusion of the investorsâ solicitors as to the ability of the investors to plead and prove their claim so far as it dependedon matters before the court.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Towards the end of his judgment, at p.1185D-E, Morritt LJ said <i>obiter</i> in favour of an applicant seeking <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery, not of the identity of a wrongdoer, but of a fact without which he could not properly formulate a claim against a knownsuspected wrongdoer the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â25. Counsel for the investors raised in the course of argument the case where, although the identity of the wrongdoer is known,one fact crucial to the proper allegation of his liability is not but is susceptible of ascertainment from a known document in thehands of a third party.  It was suggested that in such a case if the third party had been mixed up in the relevant transaction thenthere was no objection to an order for discovery; the mere witness rule would not be infringed because without the ascertainmentof the missing fact there would be no trial; the application would not be lacking in particularity so as to be stigmatized as merefishing for the document constituting the piece missing from the jigsaw puzzle would be capable of identification.  It is not necessaryto decide the point and I do not do so but I see much force in it.  The consequence would be that the principle of Norwich Pharmacalwould be applicable in any case where, for whatever reason, the action for which the document or information was required could notin its absence proceed to trial and would not be confined to cases in which the reason why the action could not so proceed was ignoranceas to the identity of the proper defendant.  The establishment of such a proposition would also enable effect to be given to thereference made by Lord Reid in Norwich Pharmacal to the duty to provide âfull informationâ as well as the identity of the wrongdoerwithout giving rise to a general obligation to give disclosure (cf. Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim (No.5)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20All%20ER%20911" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 All ER 911</a> at p.914).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> I pause to observe that the different conclusion drawn by the Court of Appeal as to the apparent merits of the investorsâ caseagainst the auditors and the investorsâ ability to sufficiently plead such case without the assistance of the information soughtto be discovered does not, in my opinion, detract from what Rimer J said regarding fishing applications properly so called. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Nor do I read the above quoted passage from Morritt LJâs judgment as suggesting that <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery of a fact necessary for the proper formulation of a claim against a known suspected wrongdoer can be ordered regardlessof the quality of the applicantâs case for such a claim.  Before the Court of Appeal, counsel for the investors did not contendthat this case was so similar on its facts to that of any previously decided cases as to be determined by that earlier decision. Counsel accepted that Rimer Jâs analysis of the earlier decisions and the distinctions between those cases and this was right.

Althoughthe intended claimant had a right for an audit to be conducted, the intended defendant had made it plain that they did not have intheir records dates of manufacture.  The respondent had records of what had been made and when in the form of daily machine lists. The application for <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery of these daily machine lists against the respondent (against whom the intended claimant had no cause of action) was basedon what Jacob J described as âreasonable grounds for supposingâ that there was over-production during the course of the licenceagreement.

In particular, <i>P v.

The defendantâs primary asset was its interest in the Buzzard Field,the most significant oil field to be discovered in the North Sea in the past decade.  The claimant was in an advanced stage of negotiationwith EnCana UK Holdingsâ parent company, EnCana Corp., for the acquisition of the defendantâs interest in the Buzzard Field andcontended that EnCana Corp. had entered into an oral protocol agreement not to solicit offers from third parties in relation to thedefendantâs interest in the Buzzard Field (the first limb) and to advise the claimant of any <i>bona fide</i> offers from third parties in relation to the Buzzard Field assets and to allow the claimant an appropriate time to respond to anysuch offer (the second limb).  EnCana Corp. announced the sale to Nexen Energy just before the claimant and EnCana Corp. were dueto sign the legal documentation.  It was common ground that the court must proceed on the basis that the claimant had a real prospectof establishing the existence and enforceability of the protocol agreement.  It was also common ground that if the claimant establishedthe existence and enforceability of the protocol agreement, there was established a breach of the second limb.  The claimant suspectedthat EnCana Corp. had also, in breach of the first limb, solicited from Nexen Energyâs holding company, Nexen Inc, an offer topurchase the defendant and applied for <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery to obtain the necessary evidence to establish whether or not this suspicion was well-founded and to enable the claimantto determine whether to sue EnCana Corp. or not. </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Lightman J observed, at pp.517f-518e, Â§Â§19-20, that the <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> jurisdiction, as subsequently developed, encompassed circumstances where disclosure of crucial information or a missing piece ofthe jigsaw, other than the identity of the wrongdoer, was required to enable the applicant to bring a claim against a known wrongdoer. His lordship set out, at p.518e-f, Â§Â§21, three conditions to be satisfied for the court to exercise the extended power to order<i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> relief :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) a wrong must have been carried out, <u>or arguably carried out</u>, by an ultimate wrongdoer;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) there must be the need for an order to enable action to be brought against the ultimate wrongdoer; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) the person against whom the order is sought must be mixed up in so as to have facilitated the wrongdoing and be able or likelyto be able to provide the information necessary to enable the ultimate wrongdoer to be sued. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> The application was dismissed on the grounds that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The exercise of the courtâs jurisdiction to order <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> relief against third parties who were mere witnesses innocent of any participation in the wrongdoing being investigated was a remedyof last resort.  The jurisdiction was only to be exercised if the third parties were the only practicable source of information sothat, unless and until they disclosed what they knew, there could be no litigation in which they could give evidence.  On the materialbefore the court, the claimant could, or ought to be able to, obtain the necessary pre-action disclosure from EnCana Corp. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) There was no evidence that the defendant was mixed up in or facilitated the suspected breach of contract.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> There was no issue that the first condition had been satisfied.   It appears from the report that the claimant had grounds for strongsuspicion that EnCana Corp. âtipped offâ Nexen Inc about the proposed sale of its interest in the Buzzard Field and thereby orotherwise solicited interest and an offer by Nexen Inc.  There was evidence that EnCana UK Holdings and the defendant claimed thatNexen Inc became interested in purchasing the defendantâs interest in the Buzzard Field on around 19 October 2004.  The agreementfor sale was signed on 29 October 2004 which meant that Nexen Inc formulated the bid by Nexen Energy from start-to-finish in approximately10 days.  That agreement contained a mutual covenant to keep confidential information relating to the negotiations leading to theagreement.  Between 5 and 26 November 2004, the claimant tried to ascertain from EnCana Corp. how it completed the transaction withNexen Inc so quickly and why it failed to notify the claimant about Nexen Incâs offer.  EnCana Corp. failed to provide satisfactorydetails of how Nexen Incâs bid came about, claiming such information to be confidential.  The transaction was completed on 1 December2004. </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Lastly, it was held in <i>MacDoel Investments Ltd v. Federal Republic of Brazil</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%20JLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] JLR 201</a> that it was not unjust that a duty to disclose should arise where the court was satisfied that there was a reasonable suspicion thatthe third party had been mixed up in the wrongdoing.  The Jersey Court of Appeal (Bailhache, Bailiff, Smith &amp; Jones JJA) so heldpartly because they saw no reason to require a higher threshold in respect of the question whether or not the defendant was a personwho had become mixed up in the wrongdoing given that <u>something less than <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing was sufficient</u> to enable the court to order disclosure.  Lord Kilbrandonâs speech in <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> at p.205G-H and Jacob Jâs decision in <i>Carlton Film Distributors Ltd v. VCI Plc</i> were referred to. </p>    <p class="heading">The principles</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> In my view, the points of principle that can be derived from the above authorities are as follows. </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The categories of information for which <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery can be ordered are not close.  As said by Lord Woolf CJ in <i>Ashworth Hospital Authority v. MGN Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20WLR%202033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 WLR 2033 (HL)</a> at p.2049, Â§57, using <i>P v. T Ltd</i> as an illustration, new situations are inevitably going to arise where it will be appropriate for the jurisdiction to be exercisedwhere it has not been exercised previously.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> In an appropriate case where it is necessary in the interests of justice, <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery can be obtained, not on the basis of an actual tort, but to find out if a wrong had been committed against the applicantand if so, the precise nature of the wrong.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> This, I believe, is not inconsistent with the summary of principles by Ma J in <i>A Co v. B Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%203%20HKLRD%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 3 HKLRD 111</a> at p.117G-H, Â§13(1), one of which is the requirement of cogent and compelling evidence that serious tortious or wrongful activitieshad taken place.  I say so because in dealing with the defendantâs objection that the plaintiff before him was âfishingâ forinformation, Ma J drew attention to <i>P v. T Ltd</i> as an instance where the court ordered <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery notwithstanding the plaintiffâs inability to demonstrate to the courtâs satisfaction the factors he referred to atp.120F-H, Â§13 of his judgment.  </p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> However, this is not to say that <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery to verify wrongdoing is to be lightly ordered.  Orders for this purpose must by their nature be exceptional and rare. Although the applicant is essentially not in a position to show a <i>prima facie</i> case of wrongdoing and is acting on no more than a suspicion that wrongdoing may have been committed, such suspicion must be foundedupon facts and circumstances which plausibly give rise to the suspicion and which the court can reasonably act on.  In this regard,in <i>P v. T Ltd</i>, in support of the possible causes of action in defamation and malicious falsehood, Sir Richard Scott V-C did have before him evidencethat the unidentified third party had made an allegation of gross misconduct against the plaintiff and the plaintiffâs depositionon affidavit that he had done nothing that justified such allegation.  </p>    <p class="heading">The present case</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> The facts and circumstances summarised in Â§Â§25 and 26 above are, to my mind, insufficient to pass the âreasonable suspicionâthreshold. </p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The fact that other parties in the chain of supply of the Uniforms had obtained payment under different letters of credit with theuse of forged bills of lading is a red herring and irrelevant.  As noted by Mr J.E. Jamison of Messrs Clifford Chance, solicitorsfor HBZ, the letters of credit under which ZITEC should apply for payment were the HBZ L/Cs, not the AIB L/Cs.  The HBZ L/Cs hadbeen revised to permit shipment from Shanghai.  The Uniglory B/Ls were actually compliant.  There was no need for ZTIEC to use anyother shipping documents. </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> As for the amount that ZTIEC had got paid for the Uniforms, there is evidence of the payment that had been made by SMQ in the formof 2 copy letters dated 10 June 2001 (which was some 6 months after the last shipment of the Uniforms from Shanghai in December 2000)from AIB to SMQ, certifying that AIB had debited SMQâs current account with it for various sums that AIB had transferred to thebeneficiaries of the AIB L/Cs.  The numbers of the bills of lading under which the goods paid for were shipped were listed.  The21 Unpaid Uniglory B/Ls were not among them, meaning that SMQ had not paid for the Uniforms shipped under such bills of lading. Also, SMQâs letter before action to Uniglory dated 14 June 2001 referred only to the 31 Paid Uniglory B/Ls.  Thereafter, SMQ claimedagainst Uniglory on the basis that it had paid for the Uniforms shipped under the 31 Paid Uniglory B/Ls but had not been able torecoup such payment from El Hosan, etc.  Other than what was paid by SMQ under the AIB L/Cs, there is no evidence of any other fundsout of which ZTIEC was paid.  There is certainly no evidence that Karim had paid ZTIEC any sum which Karim had not been able to recoupfrom SMQ under the AIB L/Cs.  In the light of the aforesaid evidence, I feel unable to attach any weight to :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) the hearsay statement by ZTIECâs employee and the statement by Vast Oceanâs owner (which must also be hearsay) that the lossessuffered by ZTIEC should be less than the amount it claimed in the ZTIEC Action, the meanings of which appear to me to be most ambiguous;or</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) the payment of some but not all of ZTIECâs invoices in no or no discernable pattern. </p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">HBZ not mixed up</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> The second objection mentioned in Â§32 above should be obvious and need no elaboration.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> At the hearing, when I raised this objection, Mr Wong urged me to view the forgery and presentation of unauthentic shipping documentsto obtain payment for the Uniforms and the making of a false or inflated claim against Uniglory by ZTIEC as a single transaction. I do not think this is right on proper analysis.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> One cannot emphasize enough the extraordinary nature of <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> relief (see, e.g., <i>A Co v. B Co</i>, <i>per</i> Ma J at p.116J, Â§12).  In my view, there is no room for imprecision or approximation.  The purpose of an order for <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery is to provide a party who has been wronged with the information that he requires to seek redress against the wrong by actionor otherwise assert his legal rights against the wrongdoer in respect of such wrong.  It is therefore important to identify the precisewrong or suspected wrong of which the applicant claims to be the victim and in respect of which he has legal rights to assert. </p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Nor can one emphasize enough the significance of the requirement of involvement in the wrongdoing on the part of the party againstwhom <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery is sought.  As explained by Lord Woolf CJ in <i>Ashworth Hospital Authority v. MGN Ltd</i>, at p.880A-B, Â§Â§35-36, the need for involvement, though not stringent, is still a significant threshold requirement because itdistinguishes the party against whom <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery is sought from a mere onlooker and justifies the intrusion to be occasioned to that party by an order for disclosure. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Uniglory has no locus to raise any claim out of ZTIECâs alleged forgery and presentation of unauthentic shipping documents to obtainpayment for the Uniforms.  Uniglory only became a victim when ZTIEC allegedly made a false or inflated claim against it in the ZTIECAction after having so obtained payment for all or part of the Uniforms shipped under the Unpaid Uniglory B/Ls.  </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The only things that HBZ had done were processing ZTIECâs application for payment and making payment under the HBZ L/Cs.  The pointis not, as Mr Jamison puts it, that HBZ was merely doing what it does as a bank.  In <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i>, the Customs and Excise Commissioners acted in performance of their statutory duties but they were held to have become âmixed upâin the importation of the infringing goods because without certain action on their part such infringements could never have takenplace and they had therefore facilitated the commission of such tortious acts: <i>per</i> Lord Reid at p.174F.  See also Lord Morris at p.181B-D; Viscount Dilhorne at p.188C-D; Lord Cross at p.197F-G and Lord Kilbrandonat p.204B-D.  So here the real point is that HZB did not, by processing ZTIECâs application for payment or making payment underthe HBZ L/Cs, facilitate the making of the allegedly false or inflated claim by ZTIEC against Uniglory.  On this, I refer to thethird of the 3 conditions for the grant of <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> relief as formulated by Lightman J in <i>Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd v. Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd</i> at p.518e-f.  I also refer to Â§21 of Morritt LJâs judgment in <i>Axa Equity &amp; Law Life Assurance Society Plc v. National Westminster Bank Plc</i>.  </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss Evergreenâs application against HBZ. </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> I also make an order <i>nisi</i> that Evergreen should pay HBZ the costs of this application, including costs previously reserved, to be taxed if not agreed. </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Lisa K.Y.
