The main cause of action of the Plaintiffs is that of passing off. The other disputes between the partiesare concerned with a registered trade mark (TM.

Starting from 1979, GDF had been selling through its local distributor the Pearl River Bridge Super Mellow Mijiu.The wines were produced by the Shiwan Brewery.

However, it is clear that in contrast to the enquiryas to damages, the court is not concerned with the effect which the defendant's activities have had on the plaintiff but merely withthe profit which the defendant has made from them. Thus, the plaintiff will be entitled to an account of the profits made from allsales which fall within the scope of the injunction, whether or not he has suffered any loss thereby. It follows that, where theplaintiff's complaint is the selling of deceptively marked goods to middlemen who are not themselves deceived, the defendant willbe obliged to account for the profits on all such sales, irrespective of how the goods were subsequently dealt with.

In paras. 951-954, there is a reference to the Infabrics case, and in particular to the pointthat section 18 was "designed to provide a remedy for infringement of copyright, alternative to, or to some extent cumulative with,the remedy of damages for infringement, and the availability of such damages depended on proof of infringement." The plaintiffs herehave clearly proved infringement. In para. 955, it is said "Even when infringement is proved, the section 18 remedy could be draconianalthough perhaps no more so than the often lauded treble damages available under US law. The measure of damages is the market valueof the goods, not the market value less the cost price of the goods, ie, the profit earned on the sale of the goods. Hence, the remedysometimes led to extreme and indiscriminate results." The authors quote the example cited in the Infabrics case, where the goodscontain gold - "Their Lordships illustrated this point in drawing attention to situations where the substrate of the infringing goodsmight be composed of some precious metal, say gold. In these circumstances, the measure of damages under section 18 would have beenthe full market value of the goods, not the market value of the goods minus the value of the gold as it would normally be under section17."</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In paras. 956-175, there is a reference to the case the <strong>Oriental Press v.

The court held that such damages should be assessed by taking into consideration the identities ofthe actual parties, and the strengths and weaknesses of their particular bargaining positions .... Three of the five CFA judges indicated,however, that such an assessment based on the notion of a hypothetical willing licensor and willing licensee would not apply wherethe plaintiff, acting reasonably, would not have granted a licence to the defendant at any price. The court's reasoning would appearalso to apply to copyright damages claimed under the present <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528" class="autolink_findacts">Copyright Ordinance</a>. It should also be noted that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 108(2)</a> of the present Ordinance specifically empowers the court to award additional damages based on the flagrancy of the copyright infringement."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Laddie, Prescott &amp; Vitoria on <em>The Modern Law of Copyright,</em> 1st Ed, Chapter 12.24-12.26, 12.28, 12.41-12.45 contains a detailed consideration of these topics.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In this case, the Plaintiffs are not in the business of granting licences or exclusive licences to any other trader or in any waypromoting the copyrights infringed. The traditional approach of the starting point of normal royalty figure may not be appropriatehere. However, I have the option, if I wish, to assess a figure of "what a reasonable royalty would have been or what would havebeen the cost of obtaining similar work elsewhere." - see chapter 12.25 of Laddie. Failing that, then there is the option of nominaldamages for copyright infringement.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> As far as the additional damages are concerned, I must take into account - (a) the flagrancy of the infringement; (b) any particularbenefit accruing to the defendant; (c) the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the defendant's business accounts and records.Counsel for the Plaintiffs submitted that there are no authorities to assist me in assessing additional damages, since mostly damagesare settled. In this case, the Plaintiffs own people turned their back on them and made products. Cheung J. awarded additional damagesto show the court's disapproval. The difficulty is that the plaintiffs do not grant licences and there is no normal royalty fee forthe assessment of the damages, but Counsel went on to submit that the Plaintiffs seek a nominal fee, say a premium of 200%, may betens of thousands of dollars.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> Cheung J. did not believe the evidence put forward by Tung Gook (1982), CRA, Chung Tai and Shiwan Brewery. In effect, the learnedJudge found their evidence incredible. The defendants were clearly aware of the copyright of the Plaintiff, especially when CRA'spredecessor had designed the label of the Super Mellow Mijiu, Shiwan Brewery produced the two rice wines for GDF, Tung Fook (1982)was the distributor for GDF's Super Mellow Mijiu and Chung Tai and its predecessor were the distributors of GDF's Shiwan Mijiu before1995. There must have been flagrant and blatant infringement and disregard of the Plaintiff's rights, bearing in mind the close relationshipbetween the parties. Counsel urged the court for copyright damages in a nominal sum to show the court's disapproval in the face ofthis flagrant and blatant disregard of the Plaintiffs' rights.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Cheung J. also found evidence of malice in relation to the trade libel. The defendants' behaviour was calculated and deliberate andspecifically designed to usurp the intellectual property rights of the Plaintiffs. In echoing the words of Mr. Justice Mayo (as hethen was), the conduct of the parties involved here were reprehensible and they did everything possible to frustrate and underminethe Plaintiffs legitimate claims. Their conduct was flagrant and justifies an award of substantial additional damages.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> In relation to conversion damages, the measure is the market value of the goods, not the market value less the cost price of thegoods, that is, the profit earned on the sale of the goods. As a result, GDF is entitled to the full market value of the Super MellowMijiu sold from March 1995 to 27th June 1997 against Tung Fook (1982). Counsel submitted that the defendant took what was owned bythe Plaintiffs and sold it. If the defendant had not done that, then the goods would have been sold by the Plaintiffs, as set outin the summary at pages 87 to 88 of the bundle (but only up to 27th June 1997), being $7,456,426.70.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Counsel submitted that in the <strong>Oriental Press Group</strong> case, at page 523B, Mr. Justice Rogers (as he then was) said that there was no overlapping between the damages for copyright infringementand damages for conversion so long as there was no duplication in the damages. In this case, there is no duplication from the twoheads of damages.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> As far as Shiwan Mijiu is concerned, GDF is only entitled to damages for copyright infringement and additional damages. Similar considerationsapply to Super Mellow Mijiu. GDF is entitled to and claims under both heads of damages.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> In the <strong>Infabrics</strong> case, Lord Scarman says that</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"A more troublesome point on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18</a> is the measure of damages. In cases, like the present, of industrial design, damages for infringement under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> are often small. Limited (in the absence of special circumstances) to the depreciation in value of the copyright, they can be minimal.In the present case of Infabrics paid only a few pounds for the design. But damages for conversion can be very great. If the industrialapplication of the infringing copy is a success, damages are recoverable as if the owner of the copyright was the owner of everyinfringing copy sold: <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/528/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18(1).</a> And what if the infringing copy be engraved upon a silver chalice or a gold medallion? The language of the subsection is, I think,clear: it bestows upon the owner of the copyright the rights and remedies to which at common law an owner of goods is entitled fortheir conversion. It treats the owner of the copyright as if he were the owner of the infringing copies. Since at common law thedamages for conversion are ordinarily measured by reference to the value of the goods converted, I would not think it legitimateto construe the subsection otherwise, though the result will be injustice in some cases. If the possibility of excessive damagesis to be eliminated, legislation is needed: for the language of the subsection permits of no other construction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">AWARD</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> As to damages for Super Mellow Mijiu's claim. It is clear from the cases that the plaintiff is entitled to damages for infringementof the copyright and for conversion, that while these remedies are cumulative, there must be an avoidance of double damages for substantiallythe same loss. In this case, the plaintiff has adduced evidence that it has suffered loss in the sum of $7,456,425.70, and seeksdamages in conversion for that sum. As the case law shows, I am left with the unenviable task of making a 'crude assessment' in relationto damages for infringement and additional damages, since the plaintiff was not in the practice of granting a licences and the traditionalapproach of using the normal royalty figure is not appropriate. I am left with the issue of what a reasonable royalty would havecost the infringers in obtaining similar products elsewhere or the option of an award of nominal damages. Unfortunately, there areno precedents to guide me and I must do my best to fix a figure that is appropriate to the circumstances of this case, includingthe harm caused by the infringement. In reaching a figure I should avoid duplication. In these circumstances, I am of the view thatthe appropriate award in damages in this case is $7,456,426.70 for damages in conversion with only a nominal award of $250,000 forinfringement of the copyright and $100,000 additional damages to show the court's disapproval of the defendant's actions in thiscase.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> As to damages for Shiwan Mijiu's claim. The amended monthly sales record of Shiwan Meiji from 24/2/95 to 3/11/98 is $7,770,017.30.I refer back to <strong>Kemp</strong> where it is said where the owner of the copyright did not grant licenses, or did not market his copyright in the same way as theinfringer, the court is left to make a crude assessment of the harm caused. While I have no evidence of a royalty fee upon whichto base the damages, it is clear that if the infringer had not marketed the wines as it did, the owner of the copyright would have,and that I should base the damages on some proportion of the sales effected by the infringer. On those grounds, and on what can onlybe a crude assessment, I make an award in the sum of $1,500,000 damages for infringement of the copyright and a further sum of $500,000as additional damages.</p>    <p class="heading">Inducement or procurement of breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> GDF is entitled to damages for inducement or procurement of breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract againstTung Fook (1982).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> In this regard, <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at paragraphs 1930ff, refers to the tort of inducement of breach of contract,</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"which makes actionable the inducing by the defendant, intentionally and without lawful justification, of any person to break anycontract made by him with the plaintiff, if the plaintiff is thereby damaged. Although damage is the gist of the action, little exactdetail can be given as to the measure of damages, as the courts have consistently endorsed Lord Esher M.R.'s pronouncement in <em>Exchange Telegraph Co. v. Gregory</em> that 'it is not necessary to give proof of specific damage' because 'the damages are damages at large. Nevile J. in <em>Goldsoll v. Goldman</em> stated the position in somewhat more detail. 'The damage,' he said, 'may be inferred, that is to say, that if the breach which hasbeen procured by the defendant has been such as must in the ordinary course of business inflict damage upon the plaintiff, then theplaintiff may succeed without proof of any particular damage which has been occasioned him.' The type of damage that is likely tobe inferred by the court is loss of profits. This may be the profit that the plaintiff would have made on the contract the breachof which the defendant has induced. Alternatively, it may be the profit that the plaintiff is prevented from making on other contracts."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Damages are said to be at large and it is not necessary to give proof of specific damage. The obvious type of damage under this headis that of loss of profits. Alternatively, it may be the profit that the plaintiffs were prevented from making. Being the profits,then there were other expenses as a result of the action of Tung Fook (1982). The plaintiffs are already claiming and are entitledto the total profits of Tung Fook (1982) in relation to its passing off action for Super Mellow Mijiu and for Shiwan Mijiu. Thus,to claim would be a double benefit.
