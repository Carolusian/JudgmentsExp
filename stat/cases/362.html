According to the loan agreement, the defendant could make monthlydeductions for repayment of principal and interest from his salary.  He would pay up the balance upon retirement from his commutedpension.

If no repayment were made, interest at 5% over the basic rate would apply. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In the course of the deductions, he became bankrupt.  He was unable to repay the outstanding balance.  The property became vestedin the Official Receiver.  As a result of his bankruptcy, the defendant was of the view that it could no longer make the deductionsfrom his salary.  It filed a Proof of Debts as an ordinary creditor.  It suspended deductions for the subsequent 39 months untila court decision in another case hence a legal advice came into being.  It was advised that it had priority over other creditorswith immediate effect but not retrospectively. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The plaintiff blamed the defendant for not making the deductions for the 39 months so that such monies could go towards repaymentof the housing loan, at the expense of his unsecured creditors.  He contended over the 5% extra interest on the outstanding balancefor the 39 months.  The defendant eventually waived the extra interest and only kept the basic interest. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiff now claims a sum representing the 39 monthsâ non-deductions as well as any interest he still had to pay due to thenon-reductions of the outstanding balance for the 39 months. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The defendantâs case</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> According to the loan agreement, the defendant could, but have no duty in contract or in tort to, make any deductions at any timeor at all.

He had to pay the downpayment loan in full by virtue of para. 31(3)(a) of CivilService Bureau Circular <i>(âCSBCâ)</i> 22/93 Annex A.  DAS ceased monthly deductions from his salary.  As no income payment order was made in the bankruptcy order, thedefendant paid his whole salary to him.
