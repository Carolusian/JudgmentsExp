class="heading">Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>    This is an action for breach of fiduciary duty against a director and shareholder of two companies and for dishonest assistancein the breach of duty and knowing receipt of the companiesâ properties against the other defendants.  The properties involved wereunit 1A and unit 1D of Thomson Commercial Building in Wanchai (âUnit 1Aâ and âUnit 1Dâ respectively or âUnitsâ collectively). The events in this action took place some twenty years ago.  The major events occurred between 1991 and 1993. </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In May 1991, the Plaintiff (âVosâ) and Wealth Country Limited (âWealth Countryâ) under the control of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (âYungâ) entered into a partnership in the trading of veterinary medicine.  They acquired Goldmark Agents Limited (âGoldmarkâ)as the corporate vehicle for carrying on their business and for holding Unit 1D.  In May 1992, they acquired another shelf company,World Champ Limited (âWorld Champâ), for holding Unit 1A.  The partnership was short-lived as a result of distrust and disputesbetween Vos and Yung.  In June 1993, Vos entered into negotiation to sell his interest in Goldmark and World Champ (âCompaniesâ)to Yung.  The negotiation fell through.  Then Yung sold the Units to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (âGlobal Fairâ) which was under the control of the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant (âCheungâ).  In August 1993, Vos petitioned for the winding up the Companies.  The Official Receiver was appointedprovisional liquidator of the Companies on 20 August 1993.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> This action was originally commenced by the Official Receiver in his capacity as the provisional liquidator of the Companies againstGlobal Fair, Yung, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant (âStart Winâ), the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant (âAuâ) and the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant (âNew Championâ) on 3 May 1995.  On 6 September 2000, Cheung and the 7<sup>th</sup> Defendant (âMrs Yungâ) were joined as the defendants pursuant to the order of Master Barnes, as she then was.  The rights andinterests of the Companies in this action were then assigned by the Official Receiver to Vos who was the only other shareholder ofthe Companies.  On 18 October 2006, the assignment was approved by A Cheung J and Vos substituted the Companies as the plaintiffin this action.  The litigation had a long procedural history which took thirteen years to reach the stage of trial.  While whatis behind this action was a shareholders or partnership dispute and Vos featured himself as the Plaintiff, the claims are those whichrightfully belong to the Companies.  This action has to be viewed in this context. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> This action is primarily against Yung for breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Companies as director in disposing of the Units atan undervalue and against Cheung for dishonest assistance in the breach of fiduciary duty and knowing receipt of the Companiesâproperties which had been disposed of by Yung in breach of trust.  Global Fair and Start Win were corporate vehicles used by Cheungfor acquiring or holding the Units.  New Champion was a corporate vehicle used by Yung to take over the business of Goldmark.  MrsYung is Yungâs wife.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant (âAuâ) is the brother of Frankie Au who is the common law husband of Mrs Yungâs sister, Iris Leung.  They all playedvarious roles in assisting Yung in the breach of fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The claims may be grouped under four headings:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  loss caused by Yungâs and Mrs Yungâs attempt to make secret profit in the purchase of Unit 1A against Yung and Mrs Yung (âAttemptedSecret Profit Claimâ);</p>        <p>(2)  funds misappropriated by Yung and Au  in their conduct of Goldmarkâs business (âMisappropriation Claimsâ);</p>        <p>(3)  loss caused by sale of the Units at an undervalue (âSale of Units Claimâ) against Yung; and</p>        <p>(4)  Sale of Units Claim against Cheung, Global Fair, Start Win and Au.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Dramatis personae</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  <i>Menno Leendert Vos</i> (âVosâ) <i>-  </i> Vos is the Plaintiff.  He is a Dutch veterinary surgeon.  He joined Alphasan International BV (âAlphasan Groupâ), a conglomerateof Dutch corporations trading in veterinary pharmaceutical products.  Alphasan Group included Alphasan Far East Limited (âAlphasanFEâ) and Chemproha Chemical Distributor Limited (âChemprohaâ).  Vos was posted to Hong Kong as the general manager of Chemprohain 1988.  He became a director of Alphasan FE in 1990.  When the operation of Alphasan Group in Hong Kong closed down in 1991, hewas given distribution rights in Alphasan veterinary medicine as part of his compensation package.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Vos was inexperienced in business.  He was very impressed by Yung as a successful businessman and competent manager.  He trustedYung as a kind and generous friend who helped him out during his first attempt to operate a business by providing him with free officeaccommodation and supporting services.  He was very casual in his dealing with Yung.  He readily co-signed cheques presented to himby Yung.  On the whole, save for his evidence denying his demand to increase the price for the sale of his shares in the Companiesto Yung, his evidence is credible.  He gave evidence in a responsible manner.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> <i>William Leung</i> -   William Leung is a certified public accountant.  He was the proprietor of an accounting company known as William Leung &amp;Co. which was later incorporated.  William Leung &amp; Co. provided secretarial services through Atkins Secretaries &amp; ConsultantsLtd (âAtkins Limitedâ), Longâs Managers Limited (âLongâs Managersâ) and Longâs Nominees Limited (âLongâs Nomineesâ). William Leung was instructed by Yung to provide secretarial services to Avant Garde Company Limited (âAvant Gardeâ) and GlobalFair.  He kept record of the instructions he received from Yung.  He gave evidence in a responsible manner.  I accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> <i>Johannes de Vries</i> (âDr de Vriesâ) -   Dr de Vries was a veterinary surgeon recruited by Vos from Holland to work in Animal Health Centre Limited(âAnimal Health Centreâ) operated by Goldmark.  He was a responsible and credible witness.  I accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  <i>Eddie Kan</i> -   Eddie Kan was a former employee of VIP Media Supplies (âVIP Mediaâ) operated by Mrs Yung.  She is a pet lover.  After Goldmarkobtained distributorship of pet food products from Hillâs Science Diet of Colgate-Palmolive Corporation (âHillâsâ), Yungrecruited her to work in Goldmark as marketing executive.  She came to know Dr de Vries whom she later married.  She tipped off Vosabout Yung and his family members selling Goldmarkâs goods and pocketing the proceeds of sale.  Her evidence was supported by salesinvoices issued by VIP Media.  That evidence was not disputed by the Defendants.  I accept her evidence.  She was dismissed by Yungand developed some animosity against him.  She also gave evidence about other irregular activities of Yung against Goldmark.  Butthat aspect of her evidence is not relied on or pursued by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  <i>Ewa-Anna Dahn</i> (âDr Dahnâ) -   Dr Dahn was a veterinary surgeon employed by Global Fair to work in Phoenix Veterinary Clinic after acquiringUnit 1D.  She is not an interested party.  I have no reason to doubt her credibility.  I accept her evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  <i>Paul Varty</i> (âVartyâ) -   Varty is a professional surveyor.  He was called as an expert witness to explain the valuation of the Units givenby Mr Togher (âTogherâ) of Vigers Hong Kong Limited (âVigersâ) as Togher was unavailable to give evidence.  He demonstratedcompetence as an expert.  His evidence was fair and unbiased.  I accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  <i>Yung Ka Po</i> (âYungâ) -   Yung is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  He was a Hong Kong citizen.  He was Cheungâs classmate in a renowned government school in Hong Kong.  Between 1976and 1981, he studied civil engineering in the University of Calgary in Canada.  In 1981, he returned from Canada and joined an architecturalfirm in Hong Kong.  During the course of his employment, he acquired much knowledge in computer science.  He left the architecturalfirm to start his computer services business in Wanchai Computer Centre in Lockhart Road.  He came to know Mrs Yung who operatedVIP Media opposite his stall.  Yungâs services complemented VIP Media which sold office supplies and computer equipments.  Subsequently,Yung and Mrs Yung married and purchased unit 8D of Thomson Commercial Building (âUnit 8Dâ) from where they operated VIP Media.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Yung was a seasoned businessman.  He had a mind for business and charisma.  He was articulate and possessed the skill of persuasion. He took advantage of Vosâ trust on him and caused Vos to co-sign cheques to reimburse himself for expenses which he had not incurredor had been already reimbursed.  He was dishonest with the funds of Goldmark.  He was able to manipulate the accounts of the Companiesand put forward apparently convincing explanations for what he did.  However, upon a close scrutiny of the objective evidence, Ifind him not a witness of truth.  He was capable of turning himself into wolf in sheepâs clothing.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  <i>Leung Tsui Yu</i> (âMrs Yungâ) -   Leung Tsui Yu is the 7<sup>th</sup> Defendant.  She is Yungâs wife.  She operated VIP Media with her sister Iris Leung.  Their father was employed by Goldmark as deliveryman.  Later, Auâs brother Frankie Au joined VIP Media and became the common law husband of Iris Leung.  The business of VIP Mediawas later incorporated and held by Wealth Country in 1990.  Mrs Yung held three shares and Yung held one share in Wealth Country. The Plaintiff obtained judgment on liability against Mrs Yung by default on 17 April 2001.  She did not appear in this trial.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  <i>Iris Leung</i> -  Iris Leung is Mrs Yungâs sister.  She is the common law wife of Frankie Au. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  <i>Au Ka Fai</i> (âAuâ) -  Au is the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant.  He is the brother of Frankie Au.  He was an employee of Goldmark, World Champ, New Champion and Global Fair at differentstages.  He did a lot extraordinary acts which had the effect of concealing Cheungâs and Yungâs identity.  He admitted that hewas foolish and had done what an ordinary employee would not have done.  However, his evidence was vague.  He avoided answering questionsunder cross-examination by blaming on his memory.  He insisted that he was employed and instructed by Cheung to sign various companydocuments, resolutions and bank documents.  That was inconsistent with Cheungâs evidence that she did not take part in the managementof Global Fair.  He was obviously insincere, evasive and was still trying to conceal the truth from this Court.  I give little weightto his evidence.  But, I am satisfied that he was a dummy.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  <i>Cheung Wai Yin</i> (âCheungâ) -   Cheung is the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant.  She studied in the same government school with Yung when they came to know each other in 1972.  She then studied medicinein the University of Hong Kong while Yung left for Canada.  After her graduation in 1981, she joined the Prince of Wales Hospital. She went to the United Kingdom in 1985 to qualify as a specialist in paediatric medicine.  In 1987, she started private practicein Tuen Mun and Shatin.  She was married and has three children.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  This litigation became known to her family when the Official Receiver sought to impose a charge on her matrimonial home.  Her husbandbroke up with her and she left the matrimonial home.  She and her husband are now separated though not legally divorced.  About ayear before this trial started, she closed down her practice to prepare for the litigation as she could not afford the hefty legalfees charged by her solicitors. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Cheung is a medical practitioner with good character.  She said that despite the uncertainty over her title to the Units, she dischargedthe mortgage over the properties.  That would have weighed heavily in favour of her honesty and credibility.  Seeing all that shehad gone through in connection with this litigation and assuming that indeed she discharged the mortgage over the properties, itwould be extremely difficult not to accept her evidence.  However, though the mortgages were paid off, the source of payment wasunsupported by documentary evidence which would reasonably be expected to have been produced.  I consider her assertion an emptyassertion. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Another consideration strongly in her favour is that Cheung appeared to be a simple medical practitioner operating a solo and simplemedical practice who was not alert to the frauds in the commercial world.  She said that she was deeply impressed by what Yung toldher, i.e. Yung had been defrauded by Vos who drained the Companies of their funds leaving Yung with nothing but the burdened Unitswhich Yung had to sell to save the crippled Companies.  This purportedly simple and unfortunate woman could have easily and unwittinglyfallen prey to her long trusted but dishonest friend who, as I have said, was a wolf in sheepâs clothing.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On the other hand, Cheung was an extremely intelligent woman as demonstrated by her professional achievement and by the very competentway she presented the legal arguments on behalf of herself and Yung.  I agree with most of the legal principles she advanced, thoughnot the distorted way she applied them to the distorted facts she advocated.  She is certainly not a naÃ¯ve woman as she tried toimpress me.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Having considered the totality of the evidence and her conduct in the entire incident, in particular the secrecy and corporate structureshe used to cover up her identity as the purchaser and owner of the Units, I form a very unfavourable view of her credibility.  Ifind it was more likely than not that she was a knowing party to Yungâs design in stripping the Companies of their asset than aninnocent party who had accidentally wandered into Yungâs fraudulent design.  I do not believe in her evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  <i>Goldmark Agents Limited</i> (âGoldmarkâ) -<i> </i> Goldmark was the corporate vehicle acquired by Vos and Yung for the purpose of carrying out their partnership business.

He came to know Yung who provided computerservices to Chemproha.  They became good friends.  When Alphasan Group closed down its operation in Hong Kong in March 1991, Vosstarted his business selling Alphasan products.  Initially, he operated from the office of VIP Media in Unit 8D with Yung providingaccommodation and supporting services.  After a couple of months, Vos and Yung decided to enter into a partnership selling veterinaryproducts.  In May 1991, they purchased Goldmark and used it as the corporated vehicle for carrying on their partnership.  Vos heldone share and unknown to Vos the other share was held by Wealth Country instead of Yung personally.  Vos and Yung were the firstdirectors of Goldmark.  Vos was responsible for marketing and securing distributorship in veterinary medicine.  Yung was responsiblefor administration, accounting and secretarial duties.  They each contributed $50,000 to the business.  Goldmark operated at Unit8D.  It opened an account with the International Bank of Asia Limited (âIBAâ).</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In August 1991, Goldmark and VIP Media moved to slightly larger rented premises at unit 7A of Thomson Commercial Building.  At thattime, Goldmark secured distributorship in Delft Blue earthenware and coffee products.  It opened another account with a Dutch bank,Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen - Boerenleenbank BA also known as Rabobank Nederland (âRabobankâ).  Vosâs wife was the secretaryto its president Mr Postma.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In September 1991, one of Yungâs client in his computer service business offered to sell him Unit 1D for $2.9 million.  Vos andYung decided to purchase it for use as the office of Goldmark.  Each agreed to contribute $800,000 to the capital of Goldmark, ofwhich $700,000 would be treated as shareholders loans to be applied towards the purchase of Unit 1D while the balance would be treatedas capital for trading purpose.  The balance of the purchase price would be financed by a mortgage loan from Rabobank.  Vos toldYung that his contribution for the purchase would not be available until December 1991.  Yung agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Two other important events occurred in September 1991.  Firstly, Iris Leung was appointed as director of Goldmark on 21 September1991.  The parties are in dispute as to the circumstances, purpose, duration and legal effect of Iris Leungâs appointment.  Thisissue will be dealt with separately in Section (B) before dealing with the various claims of the Plaintiff.  Secondly, on 28 September1991, Mrs Yung entered into a provisional agreement to purchase Unit 1A from Sonatina International Limited (âSonatinaâ) at $2.32million.  She nominated World Champ as the purchaser.  This was the first of a series of transactions which ended with Kensway (onbehalf of Vos) and Yungâs mother (on behalf of Yung) each owning 50% of the issued shares of World Champ.  Those transactions formedthe basis of the Plaintiffâs Attempted Secret Profit Claim which will be dealt with in Section (C).</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In October 1991, Vos secured distributorship of Intervet vaccines which provided a greater range of veterinary pharmaceutical products. Then he left for Holland to get married.  On his return, Yung and Frankie Au helped Vos to move into an accommodation in RobinsonRoad.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In November 1991, the sale and purchase of Unit 1D was completed.  Goldmark and VIP Media moved into Unit 1D.  Round about thattime, Yung and Vos discussed and agreed to purchase Unit 1A at $2.85 million.  Eventually, World Champ was used as their corporatevehicle for purchasing and holding Unit 1A on their behalf.  The sale and purchase was completed in 28 April 1992 with Rabobank providinga loan of $1.5 million to Goldmark to finance the purchase.  Those transactions will be dealt with in greater details in Section(C).</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Between November 1991 and April 1992, Vos expanded into the pet accessory and pet food business.  He and Smulders who was the beneficialowner of Iceville Limited (âIcevilleâ) negotiated with another Dutch veterinary surgeon, Dr Urquhart, to acquire all the sharesof and in Jade Rainbow Limited (âJade Rainbowâ) which owned distributorship or agency in pet accessories from fourteen suppliersfor $450,000.  Iceville was the distributor of Iamsâ pet food, which dominated the Hong Kong market.  On 15 February 1992, thesale and purchase of Jade Rainbow was completed, with Goldmark and Genius Wisdom Investment Limited (âGenius Wisdomâ) on behalfof Smulders each holding one share in Jade Rainbow.  In March 1992, on behalf of Jade Rainbow Vos applied to Hillâs for distributionof Hillâs pet food.  However, Jade Rainbow dropped out and the distributorship was subsequently awarded to Goldmark instead.  On1 April 1992, Vos signed the distributorship agreement on behalf of Goldmark with Hillâs for pet food and prescription diet. </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  By the end of that period, the business of Goldmark expanded tremendously.  It acquired distributorship in Intervet vaccine andKruuse.  Through Jade Rainbow, it owned distributorship from fourteen pet accessories suppliers.  It acquired sole distributorshipin Hillâs pet food and prescription diet.  The pet food business was particularly promising and Vos anticipated it would generateannual profit of $1 million.  Yung secured the tenancy of a warehouse in Chaiwan to store pet food.  Frankie Au was put in chargeof the warehouse.  Goldmark purchased a van and employed a driver and Yungâs father-in-law as a delivery assistant.  Goldmark alsoemployed Eddie Kan, a former staff of VIP Media, as marketing executive to cope with the increased business.  The future of Goldmarkwas very promising.  Goldmark instructed CafÃ© Leung to prepare an audited account for the period from 15 August 1991 to 14 April1992.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  During that period, Cheung entered the scene.  She first appeared with her husband at Goldmarkâs stall in the Holland Festivaland purchased some Van Nelle coffee promoted by Goldmark.  Thereafter she visited Goldmarkâs office in Unit 1D on a number of occasions. She was introduced to Vos by Yung.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Starting from July 1992, Goldmark sold Hillâs pet food on a small scale from residual stock left by the previous distributor. Both Vos and Yung injected $400,000 into Goldmark to finance the pet food business.  Then the first container of pet food arrivedin September 1992.  Dr Chandler from Hillâs visited Hong Kong in October 1992 to supervise the launch of Hillâs products by Goldmark.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Since Unit 1A could not be rented out, Goldmark moved into Unit 1A and offered Unit 1D for rent.  Again Unit 1D could not be letout.  Vos and Yung discussed about operating an animal clinic and an animal social club in Unit 1D.  It was agreed that the clinicand social club should be run by different companies. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  On 20 November 1992, Yung and Mrs Yung acquired one share each in Hong Kong Animal Health Association Limited (âAnimal HealthAssociationâ).  The business of Animal Health Association was to operate a social club to promote Hillâs pet food, Jade Rainbowâspet accessories and the veterinary clinic provided by Animal Health Centre.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  On the same day, Vos and Goldmark each acquired one share in a shelf company which was then re-named as Animal Health Centre.  Drde Vries was recruited by Vos from Holland as the surgeon in charge of the clinic.  The clinic started operation on 8 February 1993. Mrs Vos occupied a corner in the clinic selling pet food and accessories to walk-in customers under the name of Kensway, which wasa company jointly owned by Vos and Mrs Vos.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  On 12 December 1992, Genius Wisdom sold its 50% shareholding in Jade Rainbow to Goldmark for $50,000.  On 31 December 1992, Goldmarktransferred 40% of the shareholding in Jade Rainbow to Kwok.  Kwok, Goldmark, Yung, Vos and Eddie Kan became directors of Jade Rainbow. But Yung was the sole signatory of the bank account of Jade Rainbow.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Towards the end of 1992, there was a break down in confidence between Vos and Yung.  Vos accused Yung of withholding the businessrecords and accounts of Goldmark and depleting Goldmarkâs cash by failing to arrange Jade Rainbow to pay for the goods suppliedto it by Goldmark and keeping the proceeds of sales.  On the other hand, Yung accused Vos of refusing to contribute to the increasedcapital requirement of Goldmark and similarly causing Goldmark to pay for purchases by Animal Health Centre.  They also disputedabout the operation of the clinic.  Vos suggested to have the accounts of Goldmark audited by KM Leung of KM Leung &amp; Co. (C.P.A.). Yung agreed. </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The distrust and dispute between Vos and Yung escalated.  On 20 May 1993, Mrs Vos changed the locks of the clinic and refused togive a set of duplicate keys to Yung.  Eddie Kan also informed Vos that she was instructed to sell Goldmarkâs goods using invoicesof VIP Media and to collect payment for the goods sold on behalf of Wealth Country.  On the evening of 21 May 1993, Vos and Mrs Vosraided the warehouse in Chaiwan to check the stock of Goldmark.  They discovered that an additional lock was installed.  Then theyreturned to the office of Goldmark and searched Yungâs office.  Most of the documents were locked up.  They made copies of somedocuments.  Yung suddenly returned.  The confidence between Yung and Vos totally broke down.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Vos sought advice from KM Leung on 22 May 1993.  A meeting was arranged between KM Leung, Yung, Frankie Au, Au and Vos on the followingday.  After a meeting of ten hours into the early morning of 24 May 1993, an agreement was reached for Yung to buy out Vosâ interestin Goldmark for $2.7 million (âProvisional Settlement Agreementâ).  Under the agreement Vos was to keep the medicine businesswhile Yung was to keep the rest of the business including Hillâs distributorship.  The parties were to enter into a formal settlementagreement in the office of Messrs Johnson Stokes &amp; Master (âMessrs JSMâ) on 25 May 1993.  During the course of finalisingthe formal settlement agreement, Vos insisted Yung to pay another sum of $1.8 million.  Yung declined and the parties fell into adead lock.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In June 1993, Yung stepped up hostility against Vos.  He locked up Vosâ computer and records relating to the veterinary medicineand denied Vos access to bank statements of Rabobank and IBA.  He secretly moved the operation of Goldmark and VIP Media and thetelephone line to unit 14A of Thomson Commercial Building (âUnit 14Aâ).  Between 21 June and 10 August 1993, Yung withdrew $588,000from Goldmarkâs account with IBA to pay himself.  Those payments formed the basis of part of the Misappropriation Claims and willbe dealt with in Section (D).</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Yung dismissed Eddie Kan.  He transferred from Goldmark all of its stock of Hillâs pet food to Jade Rainbow for US$15,575.60. He collected vitamin B12 from Jean Marie Pharmacal Co. Ltd on behalf of Goldmark for credit in the amount of $27,600 and sold themthrough Jade Rainbow to Macau Racing Company for $58,850.  Yung also instructed Messrs Hau, Lau, Li &amp; Yeung (âMessrs HLLYâ)to issue a letter of demand to Vos demanding repayment of loans from Goldmark in the amount of $298,831 and to Kensway demandingrepayment of $47,000.  Vos retaliated by complaining to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (âICACâ) against Yung andhis family members for fraudulent conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  On 11 June 1993, Yung presented a cheque number 505802 drawn on Rabobank in the amount of $500,000 pre-signed by Vos and himselfto Rabobank.  The cheque was not honoured by Rabobank due to lack of funds.  On 16 June 1993, Rabobank froze Goldmarkâs account. On 29 June 1993 Rabobank demanded Goldmark to repay its outstanding loan of $4,083,047.21 together with accrued interest withintwo weeks.  Rabobank arranged a meeting to be held on 1 July 1993 with Vos and Yung about repayment of the loan.  Yung did not turnup.  On that day, Dr de Vries also closed down the clinic to return to Holland.  On 2 July 1993, Messrs JSM offered a finalised settlementagreement to Yung for execution before 6 July 1993.  Yung did not sign the agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  On the other hand, on 18 June 1993, Yung procured Iris Leung to sign as director of Goldmark jointly with him a resolution (â1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolutionâ) changing the mandate of Goldmarkâs account with IBA so that the account could be operated by the single signatureof Yung.  As a result, Yung withdrew a total of $293,310 from the IBA account to pay himself and Iris Leung.  Those withdrawals formedthe basis of part of the Plaintiffâs Misappropriation Claims against Yung, which will be dealt with in Section (D).</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  On 8 July 1993, Yung and Iris Leung passed a resolution on behalf of Goldmark to sell Unit 1D (â2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolutionâ).  On 9 July 1993, Yung in his personal capacity and on behalf of Goldmark as World Champâs director passeda resolution to sell Unit 1A (â3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolutionâ).  On the same day, Yung instructed Top Auctioneer Limited to sell the Units by auction.  The auction was advertisedon 12 to 14 July 1993.  Cheung made a bid through Global Fair offering to purchase Unit 1A and Unit 1D for $2.05 million and $2.2million respectively.  On 16 July 1993, on behalf of the Companies Yung accepted Global Fairâs offer.  On 28 July 1993, the saleand purchase of the Units was completed.  On the same day, Goldmark repaid the loan owed to Rabobank.  This sale and purchase formedthe basis of the Plaintiffâs Sale of Units Claim against Yung and against Cheung, Global Fair, Start Win and Au.  Those claimswill be dealt with in Sections (E) and (F).</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  On 11 August 1993, Yung caused the balance of the purchase price paid to World Champ for the sale of Unit 1A in the amount of $90,000to be withdrawn to pay himself.  This withdrawal formed the basis of part of the Plaintiffâs Misappropriation Claims against Yungand Au.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  On 20 August 1993, Vos petitioned for the winding up of the Companies.  The Official Receiver was appointed provisional liquidatorfor the Companies on the same day.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  On 23 September 1993, Yung acquired New Champion which then took over Hillâs distributorship from Goldmark.  Cheung and Yung employedDr Dalglish to operated the veterinary clinic in Unit 1D under the name of Phoenix Veterinary Clinic and as New Championâs consultantfor Hillâs pet food.  Subsequently, in the first quarter of 1995, the sale of Hillâs pet food increased to thirty-six containersper year.  Hillâs pet food market share ratio against Iams, increased from one to ten in 1993 to five to ten by 1997.  It is estimatedthat New Champion made a net profit of $1.25 million per year.  In 1997, Hillâs set up its Hong Kong office to supervise the localbusiness.  A former marketing manager of Iceville was appointed to head Hillâs Hong Kong office.  It then terminated New Championâsdistributorship in 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  On 12 November 1993, Global Fair mortgaged Unit 1D to Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (âHSBCâ) as security foroverdraft facilities in the amount of $2.5 million to be given to New Champion.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  On 24 November 1993, Cheung caused Global Fair to transfer Unit 1A to Start Win under a purported sale and purchase agreement ata consideration of $4 million with a mortgage loan of $2 million from Dao Heng Bank to Start Win secured against a mortgage of Unit1A.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  On 3 May 1995, the Official Receiver commenced proceedings against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants and obtained a mareva injunction against Global Fair and Start Win restraining them from selling the Units.  On 6 September2000, Cheung and Mrs Yung were joined as parties to the proceedings.  On 18 October 2006, the injunction was discharged after elevenyears.  Pursuant to the order of A Cheung J, the Units were sold and a sum of $2.25 million from the proceeds of sale was paid intoCourt on behalf of Global Fair and Start Win pending the outcome of this trial.  A total sum of similar amount representing the rentalincome collected from the Units was also paid into Court by the Official Receiver.</p>    <p class="heading">The approach</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim is for breach of fiduciary duty against Yung as director of the Companies and against Cheung and her groupof companies for dishonest assistance and/or knowing receipt of trust properties belonging to the Companies, which had been disposedof by Yung in breach of trust.  I used the words âPlaintiffâs claimâ to remind myself that though Vos has substituted the Companiesas the plaintiff in this action by an assignment of the right of action of the Companies by the Official Receiver, the action is,nevertheless, about the rights of the Companies and not Vosâ personal rights as shareholder of the Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In essence, Yungâs defence is a denial that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty as director and he gave explanations as tohow he conducted the affairs of the Companies.  An overall view of his explanations is that Vos failed to contribute to the workingcapital of Goldmark, used Goldmarkâs funds to finance his veterinary clinic, by duress forced him into buying out Vos interestin the Companies and despite that Vos resiled from the Provisional Settlement Agreement and demanded for an increase in the purchaseprice.  When he refused Vosâ unreasonable demand, Vos caused Rabobank to demand Goldmark to repay its loan almost immediately. In order to avoid a forced sale of the Units by Rabobank, he sold the Units under auction.  He had been legally advised in respectof what he did.  The price for the sale of the Units was reasonable.  The sale was a commercial decision made <i>bona fide</i> and in the interest of the Companies. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Yung also introduced as the main issue Smuldersâ ambition to control the pet food market through Iceville and his 50% interestin Jade Rainbow.  He argues that there were only two competitors in the pet food market, Iams and Hillâs.  Iceville was the distributorof Iamsâ pet food.  Smulders intended to obtain distributorship in Hillâs pet food under the cover of Jade Rainbow and Yungâsidentity as a local businessman.  Then when Yung discovered the non-competition clause in Hillâs distributorship agreement, Smuldersor Jade Rainbow had to abandon the application for Hillâs distributorship in favour of Goldmark.  As a result, Smuldersâ ambitionto control the pet food market evaporated, Smulders lost his interest in Jade Rainbow and sold his shares in Jade Rainbow to Postma. Then eventually, Smulders revenged on him by causing the termination of New Championâs distributorship when Icevilleâs ex-marketingmanager was employed by Hillâs to take charge of Hillâs operation in Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Even assuming all that Yung alleged about Smuldersâ ambition in the pet food market was true, those facts are irrelevant to thePlaintiffâs very narrow case as opened by Mr Lam, counsel for the Plaintiff.  Even if Vos acted oppressively in forcing an agreementon Yung and in bringing about Rabobankâs demand for repayment of loan, those circumstances could not relieve a director from hisobligation to act in the best interest of the Companies.  The question is whether under, what Yung did amounted to breach of fiduciaryduty.  The allegations against Vos might have an impact on Vosâ credibility; but that is irrelevant because whether Yung was inbreach of fiduciary duty is largely to be determined by his conduct which is to be assessed on the basis of objective evidence. Smuldersâ motive to control the pet food market and to drive New Champion out of the pet food market is clearly irrelevant.  Thelatter event took place after the present dispute.  Mr Lam is right that much of those disputes are irrelevant.  I have set out thosedisputes and their background and am not going to embark on any inquiry as to those irrelevant allegations. </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Yung also argues that Vosâ motive in petitioning the winding up of the Companies was to bring about the termination of Hillâsdistributorship.  Such motive is irrelevant to the present action.  Any damage to Goldmark would be suffered by Vos and Yung equally. In any event, through New Champion, Yung had acquired Hillâs distributorship.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Cheungâs primary defence is that there was no breach of fiduciary duty on Yungâs part.  Further and in the alternative, herdefence is that she was a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice of any breach of fiduciary duty and that the price she paid reasonably reflected the forced salevalue of the Units.

There were one resolution in 1991 andthree resolutions in 1993 in issue.  On 21 September 1991, Vos and Yung passed a resolution appointing Iris Leung as director ofGoldmark (â1991 Resolutionâ).  Pursuant to that resolution, Iris Leung and Yung passed the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution on 18 June 1993 changing the mandate of Goldmarkâs bank account with IBA.  Then they passed the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution on 8 July 1993 authorising the sale of Unit 1D.  Lastly, Yung both in his personal capacity and in Goldmarkâs capacityas director of World Champ passed the 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution on 9 July 1993 authorising the sale of Unit 1A.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1991 Resolution</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  According to Vos, Yung was going to leave Hong Kong for the United States of America on 21 September 1991 to keep Mrs Yungâs companywhen giving birth to their child.  Yung approached Vos and suggested to appoint Iris Leung during his absence in case something happenedwhile he was away.  Vos insisted that the appointment was only to cover the period while Yung was away and that it was to be recordedby a minute of board meeting.  Immediately, a board meeting was held and the resolution passed.  Yung drafted the minute which wassigned by Vos and Yung.  At Yungâs instruction, Vos signed a notice of change of director.  The notice was filed with the CompaniesRegistry by Yung or someone on his behalf.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  According to the minute, Vos chaired the meeting.  The board resolved (a) the budget for Goldmark from 24 August 1991 to 23 March1992; (b) that Vos shall be entitled to the first $250,000 profit, i.e. $145,833 for the period up to 23 March 1992; (c) the scopeof business; and (d) Iris Leungâs appointment as director.  In respect of item (d), the resolution was in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âd)  Appointment of Director :</p>        <p>  Miss Leung Choi Hung is hereby appointed Director for the Company while Mr Yung is absent from the Colony.  Miss Leung shall resignas Director of the Company in the next Directorsâ Meeting which shall be held when Mr Yung returns to the Colony.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  According to Yung, the minute was drafted by Vos.  It was Vos who raised the question of the resolution as he would be going toHolland for his marriage and then to Singapore for a trip.  It had nothing to do with Mrs Yung giving birth to their child as Yungâstwo children were born in early 1989 and December 1992.  Vos was concerned that Yung would be on business trips while Vos was awayand there was no one to attend to the business of Goldmark especially the completion of the purchase of Unit 1D.  Another and mostimportant concern of Vos was to secure his right to the first $250,000 profit.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Whether Mrs Yung gave birth to her child in 1991 was not conclusively proved.  According to Vos, Mrs Yung returned in October 1991with a child.  Assuming that Vos was mistaken, it was Yungâs evidence that Vos was concerned that Yung might be on business tripout of Hong Kong during October 1991 when Vos was away.  This suggests that the concern in Vosâ mind was that Yung might be outof Hong Kong.  When the evidence is understood in that light, whether Yung was away because Mrs Yung was going to give birth to herchild at the time is of minor significance.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Yung denied that the board meeting was held in a hurry.  There were only two directors and the conduct of Goldmarkâs businesswas very informal.  Matters were discussed without a formal meeting or notice of meeting.  Decisions were made and recorded in minutesprepared after discussion.  Yung said that he was inexperienced in company affairs other than those relating to small family companies,whereas Vos had more experience in company affairs and formalities through his employment with Alphasan Group. Hence, it was Voswho usually prepared the minutes and attended to filing of company documents.  Yung said that the minute was the first minute relatingto running a business that he ever experienced in his life.  That submission is blatantly misleading.  Admittedly Yung was in chargeof administrative, secretarial and accounting functions of Goldmark.  He was very experienced with secretarial affairs of all thecompanies under his control.  He was knowledgeable about off-shore and bearer share companies.  In all likelihood, he was the oneresponsible for the preparation and filing of this minute.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Yung also referred to two other minutes of the same date signed by Vos and Yung changing the bank mandate of Goldmarkâs bank accountwith Rabobank and IBA authorising Vos and Iris Leung to sign jointly on cheques and authorisations relating to the accounts.  Onthe top left hand corners of those three minutes were the date â20/9/91â which admittedly were written by Vos.  Yung submitsthat the minutes were all prepared by Vos.  He argues although those minutes were all dated 21 September 1991, Vos at least had sightof those minutes beforehand.  This is a very forceful argument.  Those matters took place eleven years ago before Vos wrote his witnessstatement and seventeen years ago before he testified in Court.  Those were trivial routine matters.  Yung agreed that he would beaway on business trips at that time.  Vos might well have honestly mistaken when re-constructing what had happened.  As Mr Lam submits,who drafted the 1991 Resolution contained in that minute was besides the point because both Vos and Yung signed on the minute andassented to the contents.  I agree.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Yung did not dispute the authenticity of his signature on the minute but refused to confirm that the contents of the copy of minutein the document bundle bore the exact wordings as in the original which presumably was kept by the Official Receiver and not madeavailable at trial.  He impliedly suggests that Vos or those representing him had forged the copy of the minute.  That is too farreaching.  In any event, his dispute as to authenticity of the minute came far too late.  If Vos in collusion with his solicitorswere to forge the minute, they would have inserted contents which would have put the matter beyond dispute.  I do not see any reasonwhy his solicitors would have taken the risk to commit an offence to further Vosâ cause.  Yungâs equivocal stance about the contentsof the minute shows a lack of good faith in his defence.  I dismiss Yungâs suggestion.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Then Yung submits in the alternative that if the wordings in the copy of the minute were the same as those in the original, theminute had failed to record their true common intention.  Yung argues that Iris Leungâs appointment as director was intended tocover Vosâ absence in October 1991 during Vosâ trip to Holland and Singapore and had nothing to do with his trip to the UnitedStates because Mrs Yung did not give birth to their child in 1991.  It is difficult to see how the word âVosâ and âYungâcould have been mixed up.  Then Yung further argues that Iris Leungâs appointment was intended to be a regular or permanent oneso that she would be called upon to act if either Vos or Yung was absent.  In the 1991 Resolution, it was unequivocally stated thatIris Leung was appointed while Yung was absent from Hong Kong and that she would resign as director in the next directorsâ meetingheld when Yung returned.  The terms of Iris Leungâs appointment could hardly be clearer.  Yung was thoroughly familiar with theEnglish language.  He graduated from one of the top government secondary schools in Hong Kong.  He went to live and study in Canada. He graduated with an engineering degree.  He communicated with Vos in English effectively.  He prepared his witness statement andsubmission in English, which showed that his standard of English was of an absolutely high standard.  He could not have misunderstoodthe meaning of the 1991 Resolution as recorded in the minute.  If the resolution did not accord with his intention, he would haveraised it there and then.  If in fact their intention was to have Iris Leung to substitute Vos, even if Yung failed to notice themistake, Vos would have.  There was no reason why Vos when acting <i>bona fide</i> at that stage of his relationship with Yung would not have put the matter right.  Yungâs argument is hardly convincing. </p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Yung draws support for his argument that Iris Leungâs appointment was intended to be a regular or standing appointment from thenotice of change of director filed by Vos with the Companies Registry.  He submits that the description of Iris Leungâs appointmentin the notice was one without limitation and if Vos really intended her appointment to be a short term one, Vos should have fileda notice of resignation with the Companies Registry after the term of her appointment expired.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  I think the important document to consider is the 1991 Resolution and not the notice filed with the Companies Registry.  Yungâsargument is distorting the intention of the parties as reflected in the 1991 Resolution.  In the resolution, it was unequivocallystated that Iris Leung was appointed while Yung was absent from Hong Kong and that she shall resign as director in the next directorsâmeeting held when Yung returned.  Those were the terms of Iris Leungâs appointment agreed to by Vos and Yung.  Yungâs argumentthat it was Vosâ intention to appoint Iris Leung not only as his substitute but also as a permanent director is absolutely absurd. Goldmark was basically a 50-50 partnership between Vos and Yung.  There was no reason why Vos would have wished to appoint IrisLeung who was Yungâs sister-in-law to replace him during his absence.  That would wholly upset the balance of power which Vosâand Yungâs own appointment as director was intended to maintain.  Such appointment would have the effect of allowing Yungâs campto pass any resolutions they wished and to override any objections from Vos.  By the terms of her appointment, Iris Leung was deemedto have resigned upon the next directorsâ meeting after Yungâs return on 3 October 1991 or whatever later date.  Even if IrisLeungâs appointment was a standing one effective on any occasions when Yung was out of Hong Kong, she had no authority to act asdirector if Yung was in Hong Kong and to pass any resolutions jointly with Yung.  Her appointment was as if she was an alternatedirector under article 6 of the Articles of Association of Goldmark, which provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA Director who is about to go away from or is absent from Hong Kong may with the approval of the majority of the other Directorsnominate any person to be his substitute and such substitute whilst he holds office as such shall be entitled to notice of Meetingsof the Directors and to attend and vote thereat accordingly and he shall ipso facto vacate office if and when the appointor returnsto Hong Kong or vacate office as a Director or removes the substitute from office and â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> Yung argues that Iris Leungâs appointment was connived by the board as she never resigned when Yung returned to Hong Kong.  Vosexplained that he assumed Yung would attend to the secretarial work and overlooked whether Iris Leung resigned upon Yungâs return. As shown in Goldmarkâs documents, Iris Leung never participated in any of the board meetings since her appointment until she passedthe 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution on 18 June 1993 after the outbreak of hostility between Yung and Vos.  Under those circumstances, I am unable todraw the inference that her appointment was connived by failure, whether on the part of Vos or Yung, to ensure that she resignedafter Yungâs return or to file a notice of her resignation with the Companies Registry.  Such notice is for the benefit or protectionof third parties dealing with the company.  As between the parties to the resolution, they are bound by the terms of the resolution.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Yung further argues that by raising no objection to the audit report labelling Iris Leung as director of Goldmark, Vos connivedat her appointment.  According to Vos, he only had a fleeting glance of the report as Goldmark had to submit the report urgentlyto Rabobank in connection with its application to increase the overdraft facilities.  Hence he did not read it with sufficient careas to notice the reference to Iris Leung as director.  The audit report was dated 23 April 1993 when hostility had or was about tocommence.  The auditor might have been misguided by the documents filed with the Companies Registry.  The report was signed by Yungand not by Vos.  Yung might have consciously taken advantage of the mistake while Vos might have carelessly overlooked.  I give littleweight to that representation contained in the audit report.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  In conclusion, I find that the intention of Vos and Yung as reflected in the minute of 21 September 1991 was that Iris Leung wasto be appointed as director during the temporary absence of Yung from Hong Kong and that she shall resign upon Yungâs return. Iris Leungâs failure to resign or Vosâ failure to secure her resignation did not extend the term of her appointment.  On theevidence, Iris Leung was effectively appointed as alternate director, though the words âalternate directorâ were not used andneither Yung nor Vos had any concept of alternate director at the time.  Her appointment fully complied with the terms of article6 of the Articles of Association of Goldmark.  Under the terms of the 1991 Resolution, Iris Leungâs appointment had the same effectas if she was an alternate director.  By the terms of article 6 as well as by the terms of the 1991 Resolution, upon the first directorsâmeeting after Yungâs return on 3 October 1991 or whatever the date, Iris Leungâs appointment was <i>ipso facto</i> terminated.  Iris Leung only had authority to represent Yung during his absence from Hong Kong and could not pass any resolutionsjointly with Yung.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution and 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  By reason of the conclusion reached in the preceding paragraph, Iris Leung had no authority to pass the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution and 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution.  Those resolutions are therefore invalid.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Yung relied on the alleged advice he received from Alfred Hau of Messrs HLLY.  He said that Alfred Hau had done a companies searchand confirmed that Iris Leung was a legitimate director of Goldmark and could sign the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution.  This incident is described in fuller details and in its proper context in paragraphs 241 - 252 below.  For thepresent purpose, suffice it is to say that I do not believe Yungâs evidence that he had sought legal advice.  If indeed he believedIris Leung was a regular director, he would not have taken the trouble to seek confirmation from his solicitor.  Secondly, even assumingthat he had sought such advice, that advice, at best, explained that Yung was acting <i>bona fide</i> on legal advice, but cannot resurrect Iris Leungâs appointment which had expired.  An incorrect legal advice from a third partycannot be binding on Goldmark and give effect to Iris Leungâs appointment.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Leaving aside my finding of fact on the intention of Yung and Vos in the 1991 Resolution, Mr Lam submits that as a matter of lawIris Leungâs appointment lapsed after eighteen months from the date of incorporation of Goldmark pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 111(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> and article 7 of the Articles of Association of Goldmark in default of an annual general meeting held by the company. </p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 111(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âEvery company shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other meetings in thatyear, and shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it; and not more than 15 months, or such longer period as theRegistrar may in any particular case authorize in writing, shall elapse between the date of one annual general meeting of the companyand the next:</p>    </blockquote>    <p>  Provided that, so long as the company holds its first annual general meeting within 18 months of its incorporation, it need nothold it in the year of its incorporation or in the following year.â</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Article 7 of the Articles of Association of Goldmark provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt the Ordinary General Meeting to be held next after the adoption of these Articles and at every succeeding Ordinary General Meetingall Directors, except Permanent Directors if any are appointed, shall retire from office and shall be eligible for re-election.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  The combined effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 111(1)</a> and article 7 is that a newly incorporated company must hold its first annual general meeting within eighteen months of its incorporationand at that meeting all directors, except permanent directors, shall retire from office, though they shall be eligible for reappointment. That was in fact what was held by Deputy High Court Judge Louis Chan in <i>Re J &amp; D Industrial (HK) Ltd</i> [2006] 3 HKC.  In that case the company concerned had an article which was similar to article 7 of the Articles of Association ofGoldmark.  I do not find it necessary to quote his Lordshipâs well considered judgment in that case.  His Lordship reviewed authoritiesboth from the United Kingdom and from our Court of Appeal and reached the above conclusion which his Lordship was bound to reach. His Lordship referred to the Court of Appeal decision in <i>Alexander Ward &amp; Co v Samyang Navigation Co Ltd &amp; Anor</i> CACV 20/1971.  In that case, Blair-Kerr SPJ quoted with approval the following dicta of Sargent J in<i>Re Consolidated Nickel Mines Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1914%5d%201%20Ch%20883" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1914] 1 Ch 883:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA director on his appointment does not ordinarily step into an office which is perpetual unless terminated by some act, but intoan office the holding of which is limited by the terms of the articles.  The meaning of article 101 is that the holding of the officeof director was only to last until the end of 1906, or until the earlier date on which the ordinary meeting for that year was held. If the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and Veritatem &amp; Co ceased to be directors as from 1<sup>st</sup> January 1968, or 1<sup>st</sup> January 1969 as the case may be, and there has been no other directors appointed, it would appear that the company has had no directorsat any rate since 1<sup>st</sup> January 1969.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>More recently, in <i>The Incorporated Owners of Finance Building v Bright Hill Management Consultants Co Ltd</i> CACV 386/2000, Leong CJHC, Woo and Cheung JJA reached the same conclusion.  Mr Lamâs proposition of the law is beyond dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  The present case is on all four with <i>Re J &amp; D Industrial (HK) Ltd</i>.  Goldmark was incorporated on 4 April 1991.  There is no dispute that Goldmark had not held any annual general meeting within eighteenmonths of its incorporation or at all.  Even if Iris Leungâs appointment under the 1991 Resolution were valid, her appointmentexpired by operation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 111(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> and article 7 of the Articles of Association of Goldmark in default of the company holding any annual general meeting within eighteenmonths of its incorporation.  That might be a fortuitous event.  But, as a matter of law, Goldmark had no validly appointed directorsafter 4 October 1992.  Goldmark would have to act through its shareholders in general meeting.  The 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution and 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution were therefore invalid.</p>    <p class="heading">The 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Similarly, on 9 July 1993, Yung in his personal capacity and in Goldmarkâs capacity as director of World Champ passed the 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution authorising the sale of Unit 1A.  World Champ was incorporated on 26 August 1991 and had not held any annual generalmeeting within eighteen months of its incorporation or at all.  For similar reason, Yungâs, Goldmarkâs as well as Vosâ appointmentas directors of World Champ expired by operation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 111(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> and article 7 of the Articles of Association of World Champ on 26 February 1993.  With effect from that date, World Champ had novalidly appointed directors and had to act through its shareholders in general meeting who were Vos and Yungâs mother-in-law. In addition, Yung also had no authority to represent Goldmark on the board of World Champ because his own appointment as directorof Goldmark had also lapsed on 4 October 1992 for reason as explained in the preceding paragraph.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution purportedly passed by Yung and Goldmark was therefore invalid.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Having disposed of the questions of validity of the resolutions, I now turn to examine the four heads of claims.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">(C)  attempted secret profit CLAIM AGAINST YUNG AND MRS YUNG</p>    <p class="heading">The background circumstances</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  The following factual background is not in dispute. </p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  On 28 September 1991, which was at about the same time as or shortly after Vos and Yung were considering the purchase of Unit 1D,Mrs Yung entered into a provisional agreement to purchase Unit 1A for $2.32 million from Sonatina with completion date on 31 December1991.  She paid a deposit of $50,000.  On 30 September 1991, she instructed Alfred Hau then of Messrs Alsop Wilkinson (âMessrsAWâ) to act for her.  On 2 October 1991, she paid a further deposit of $414,000.  On 14 October 1991, she nominated World Champto be the purchaser.  On 17 October 1991, Mrs Yungâs father and brother acquired World Champ as a shelf company.  Each of themheld one share in World Champ and became its first directors.  According to Yungâs case, they held the shares as nominees of MrsYung.  On 25 October 1991, Sonatina and World Champ executed the formal sales and purchase agreement (âSonatina/World Champ agreementâ). Mrs Yungâs father signed on behalf of World Champ. </p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  In November 1991, Yung and Vos discussed about purchasing Unit 1A for $2.85 million.  They agreed to contribute equally towardsthe purchase price and that Unit 1A be held by a separate corporate vehicle to be identified.  Vos told Yung that his funds wouldonly become available in mid December 1991.  Yung agreed. </p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  On 18 November 1991, Mrs Yungâs father, on behalf of World Champ, entered into a Chinese preliminary agreement for the sub-saleof Unit 1A to Yung for $2.85 million (âWorld Champ/Yung agreementâ).  Under that agreement, a deposit of $285,000 was paid uponsigning and a second deposit of same amount was to be paid on 30 November 1991 when the formal sale and purchase agreement wouldbe signed.  The agreement also provided that the purchaser shall pay the vendor commission of 1%. </p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  On the following day, Yung showed the World Champ/Yung agreement to Vos.  Vos co-signed a cheque number 505801 in the amount of$285,000 drawn on Goldmarkâs account with Rabobank payable to Yung for the purpose of reimbursing him the deposit he had allegedlypaid.  On 20 November 1991, Yung deposited two cheques in the amount of $8,856 and $64,252 into Goldmarkâs account with Rabobank. On 29 November 1991, he deposited another cheque in the amount of $500,000 into Goldmarkâs account.  Yung said that these werehis shareholdersâ loans to Goldmark to enable it to pay the deposit and reduce the overdraft.  Those payments were not disputedby the Plaintiff.  Vosâ evidence went further.  He said that on that day, he co-signed a cheque number 505802 drawn on Goldmarkâsaccount with Rabobank in the amount of $500,000 payable to Yung as security for the above loan advanced by Yung.  The circumstancesof the issue of this cheque were disputed by Yung.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  On 2 December 1991, Yung nominated Fudo Limited (âFudoâ) to be the purchaser in the sub-sale from World Champ.  He arrangedfor Messrs AW to act for Fudo instead of acting for World Champ and instructed Messrs Shaw Ng and Ma to act for World Champ.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  On 3 December 1991, Goldmark issued another cheque number 505804 in the amount of $285,000 drawn on Rabobank account payable toYung as the second deposit for Unit 1A.  Yung suggested to Vos to use Fudo as the corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A and saidthat Fudo was a company owned by him and Mrs Yung which they had no use.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  To allay Vosâ worry that Fudo might have some hidden liability, Yung produced a signed statement on or about 5 December 1991 confirmingthat he and Mrs Yung were the only directors and shareholders of Fudo which had an asset of $4 only.  On 6 December 1991, Vos agreedto Yungâs suggestion to become a 50% shareholder of Fudo for the purpose of using it as the corporate vehicle for holding Unit1A.  On the same day, Mrs Yung was allotted sixteen shares in Fudo but Vos was only allotted ten shares.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  On 16 December 1991, Vos issued a cheque in the amount of $700,000 to Fudo as his contribution to the purchase price.  On 18 December1991, World Champ and Fudo executed the formal sub-sale and purchase agreement of Unit 1A (âWorld Champ/Fudo agreementâ) withcompletion date on 31 December 1991.  Mrs Yung signed on behalf of Fudo and her brother signed on behalf of World Champ. </p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  The Sonatina/World Champ agreement and World Champ/ Fudo agreement were both due for completion on 31 December 1991.  However, Yungand Mrs Yung were late in attending the office of Messrs AW which resulted in Sonatina forfeiting World Champâs deposit and cancellingthe Sonatina/World Champ agreement.  Yung informed Vos that the purchase could not be completed.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  On 7 January 1992, Yung was appointed as director of World Champ.  On 22 January 1992, World Champ instructed Messrs Phyllis KYKwong &amp; Co. (âMessrs PKâ) to institute legal action against Sonatina seeking specific performance of the Sonatina/World Champagreement.  On 14 April 1992, the court made an order by consent ordering the completion of the Sonatina/World Champ agreement on28 April 1992 upon payment of $2.236 million by World Champ, i.e. $380,000 over and above the agreed purchase price of $2.32 million.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  In the meantime, Yung told Vos that the purchase of Unit 1A could be completed at the lower price of $2.7 million using World Champas the corporate vehicle to hold the unit upon paying certain legal costs.  Vos agreed.  On 27 April 1992, World Champ and Fudo terminatedthe World Champ/Fudo agreement.  The Sonatina/World Champ agreement was completed on 28 April 1992 pursuant to the consent order.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Vosâ interest in World Champ was not regularised until half a year later.  On 12 November 1992, ninety-eight shares in World Champwere allotted to Mrs Yungâs mother.  On 14 November 1992, Mrs Yungâs fatherâs and brotherâs two shares were also transferredto Mrs Yungâs mother.  By an instrument of transfer and one set of bought and sold notes dated 14 November 1992, Mrs Yungâs mothertransferred two shares to Goldmark.  On 30 November 1992, Goldmark was appointed director of World Champ while Mrs Yungâs fatherand brother resigned as directors.  On 30 December 1992, one-hundred shares were issued to Kensway and Vos was appointed as directorof World Champ.  Thus as at that day, Yung, Goldmark and Vos were directors of World Champ.  On 24 February 1993, Goldmark transferredtwo shares back to Mrs Yungâs mother.  Thus since that day, Mrs Yungâs mother and Kensway were the 50% shareholders of WorldChamp.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Thus World Champ, as the corporate vehicle of Goldmark or of Vos and Yung acquired Unit 1A at a total consideration of $2.7 millionplus the costs of the legal action for specific performance against Sonatina.  Rabobank advanced $1.5 million to Goldmark towardsthe purchase secured by a mortgage over Unit 1A.  Goldmark paid the legal costs and expenses including Rabobankâs solicitorsâfees of $14,180 for handling the loan and mortgage documentation. </p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffâs case</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case is that Vos first saw the advertisement offering Unit 1A for sale in September 1991 and discussed with Yungabout the purchase but Yung ignored him.  Upon knowing of Vosâ interest in purchasing Unit 1A for Goldmark, Yung and Mrs Yung secretlypurchased the unit from Sonatina for $2.32 million with intention of reselling it to Goldmark at a profit.  Yung concealed from Vosthe fact that he and/or Mrs Yung were the beneficial owners of Unit 1A and orchestrated a sub-sale of Unit 1A to a corporate vehicleof Goldmark, namely Fudo, for $2.85 million with the intention of making a secret profit from Goldmark.  Following Mrs Yungâs failureto complete the Sonatina/World Champ agreement on 31 December 1991, Yung told Vos that the purchase could not be completed becauseof problems relating to the title deeds of Unit 1A.  Then in February 1992, after Yung had reached settlement with Sonatina, Yungtold Vos that the problems with the title deeds were resolved and the sale and purchase could be completed at a reduced price of$2.7 million plus some legal expenses.  Yung persuaded Vos to use World Champ as the corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A in placeof Fudo because of some unexpected indebtedness in Fudo.  Vos agreed and the World Champ/Fudo agreement was cancelled.  As a resultof Yungâs unsuccessful attempt to make the secret profit, Goldmark paid $380,000 more than it would have paid plus other legalcosts and expenses had Yung not been in breach of fiduciary duty.  Yung is therefore liable to Goldmark for equitable damages inthat amount.  Mrs Yung is likewise liable for dishonestly assisting Yung in his breach of fiduciary duty.  Judgment on liabilitywas entered against Mrs Yung by default.  The remaining issue in respect of her case is assessment of the damages for which she isliable.</p>    <p class="heading">Yungâs case</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Yung denied that Vos had discussed with him about the purchase of Unit 1A in September 1991.  His case is that when Vos came toknow that Mrs Yung had purchased the unit, he offered to purchase 50% interest in Unit 1A.  Then they agreed to purchase Unit 1Afrom Mrs Yung at the then market price of $2.85 million using Fudo as the corporate vehicle for holding the unit.  Later, Vos becamehesitant in the purchase because of his lack of funds.  When Yung told Vos that Mrs Yung was late on the date of completion, Vosexcused Mrs Yungâs fault in failing to complete.  As events turned out, World Champ had to acquire Unit 1A at $2.7 million insteadof $2.32 million.  Then Yung offered Vos the option to acquire 50% interest in Unit 1A by acquiring 50% interest in World Champ insteadof using Fudo to purchase Unit 1A from World Champ.  Vos agreed in view of the reduction in price.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Yungâs defence is that, firstly, the true and intended purchaser of Unit 1A was not Goldmark but a new joint venture between Yungand Vos.  Secondly, prior to 28 April 1992 World Champ and Unit 1A were Mrs Yungâs properties and she owed no fiduciary duty toGoldmark.  Thirdly, in any event, Yung had disclosed to Vos that World Champ would be making a profit from the sub-sale of Unit 1A.</p>    <p class="heading">The law - directorâs fiduciary duty owed to his company</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  The legal principles governing the fiduciary duties owed by a director to his company is very well settled and can be found in anycompany law text books.  In general, a director is under a duty to act at all times in good faith and in the interest of the company. He is under a duty to act for a proper purpose and not to act for a collateral or improper purpose.  He shall not place himselfin a position where his duties owed to the company conflict or may conflict with his personal interests or with duties that he owesto others (âno conflict ruleâ).  The prohibition against conflict is not an absolute one.  It does not extend to entry into aposition of potential conflict.  It only prohibits against taking advantage of a conflict when it arises.  If a trustee purchasesproperty which he holds on trust for the beneficiary, he places himself in a position of conflict.  A trustee must not sell trustproperty to himself, whether or not he makes a profit, except under the most stringent of conditions, which almost invariably includewell informed consent of the beneficiary. </p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  Subsumed within this âno conflict ruleâ is the rule that a director must not, unless expressly authorised, profit from his office. A director may not obtain any secret profit from his position as director of the company.  This âno profit ruleâ is a very strictrule.  Mr Lam quoted the following statement of the law as regards secret profit by the High Court of Australia in <i>Furs Limited And Tomkies and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%2d1936%29%2054%20CLR%20583" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935-1936) 54 CLR 583</a> at 592 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn our opinion the decision of this appeal is governed by the inflexible rule that, except under the authority of a provision inthe articles of association, no director shall obtain for himself a profit by means of a transaction in which he is concerned onbehalf of the company unless all the material facts are disclosed to the shareholders and by resolution a general meeting approvesof his doing so, or all the shareholders acquiesce.  An undisclosed profit which a director so derives from the execution of hisfiduciary duties belongs in equity to the company.  It is no answer to the application of the rule that the profit is of a kind whichthe company could not itself have obtained, or that no loss is caused to the company by the gain of the director.  It is a principleresting upon the impossibility of allowing the conflict of duty and interest which is involved in the pursuit of private advantagein the course of dealing in a fiduciary capacity with the affairs of the company.  â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  In <i>Aberdeen Rail Co v Blaikie Brothers</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1843%2d60%5d%20All%20ER%20249" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1843-60] All ER 249</a>, Lord Cranworth LC emphasised that the rules governing fiduciary duties are so inflexible and strict that it does not depend on theextent of the adverse interests of the director, the fairness or unfairness of the transaction, or the genuineness of the transaction. He said at 252:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">  âA corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interestsof the corporation whose affairs they are conducting.  Such an agent has duties to discharge of a fiduciary character towards hisprincipal, and it is a rule of universal application that no one having such duties to discharge shall be allowed to enter into engagementsin which he has or can have a personal interest conflicting or which possibly may conflict with the interests of those whom he isbound to protect.  So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairnessof a contract so entered into.  It obviously is, or may be, impossible to demonstrate how far in any particular case the terms ofsuch a contract have been the best for the <i>cestui que trust</i> which it was impossible to obtain.  It may sometimes happen that the terms on which a trustee has dealt or attempted to deal withthe estate or interests of those for whom he is a trustee have been as good as could have been obtained from any other person; theymay even at the time have been better.  But still so inflexible is the rule that no inquiry on that subject is permitted.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  In <i>Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%202%20AC%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 2 AC 134</a>, the House of Lords stressed that the âno profit ruleâ applies even where the fiduciary has acted in good faith.  Lord Russellheld at 144:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> â The rule of equity which insists on those, who by use of a fiduciary position make a profit, being liable to account for thatprofit, in no way depends on fraud, or absence of bona fides; or upon such questions or considerations as whether the profit wouldor should otherwise have gone to the plaintiff, or whether the profiteer was under a duty to obtain the source of the profit forthe plaintiff, or whether he took a risk or acted as he did for the benefit of the plaintiff, or whether the plaintiff has in factbeen damaged or benefited by his action.  The liability arises from the mere fact of a profit having, in the stated circumstances,been made.  The profiteer, however honest and well-intentioned, cannot escape the risk of being called upon to account.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  However, the shareholders can, by resolution in general meeting, confirm a contract in which the directors or some of them are interested,and upon such a resolution the director is entitled to vote his shares in whatever way he chooses, even if the result will be toassure the passing of the resolution.  Such a resolution would not, however, be effective if it amounted to a fraud or oppressionon the minority shareholders: see <i>Cook v Deeks</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1916%5d%201%20AC%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1916] 1 AC 554.</a>  Neither Cheung nor Yung sought to rely on this principle to absolve them from liability.</p>    <p class="heading">The issues</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case is not based on secret profit but loss and damage caused as a result of the directorâs attempt to makesecret profit in breach of his fiduciary duty to act in good faith and in the interest of the Companies.  The partiesâ cases aremiles apart.  The burden of proof is on the Plaintiff.  Vos may only succeed if he could prove his case as pleaded.  Yung bears noburden of proving anything.  Vosâ evidence would have to be tested against Yungâs.  The issues for determination are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  whether Mrs Yung purchased Unit 1A after she became aware of Vosâ interest to acquire the unit for Goldmark;</p>        <p>(2)  what were the reasons given by Yung for the failure to complete the World Champ/Fudo agreement and what led to World Champ replacingFudo as the corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A;</p>        <p>(3)  whether Yung owned or had a controlling interest over World Champ prior to the completion of the Sonatina/World Champ agreementon 28 April 1992;</p>        <p>(4)  whether Yung had informed Vos that World Champ under Mrs Yung and/or Yungâs control had acquired Unit 1A;</p>        <p>(5)  whether Vos consented to profit to be made by Mrs Yung or World Champ while under her and/or Yungâs control;</p>        <p>(6)  whether Goldmark was the intended purchaser when it made payments towards the purchase of Unit 1A;</p>        <p>(7)  whether Goldmark or World Champ suffered any loss in the purchase of Unit 1A; and</p>        <p>(8)  whether what Yung did amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty to act in good faith and in the interest of Goldmark.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Yung raised many other issues, such as whether Goldmark knew on 28 September 1991 that Unit 1A was available for sale at $2.32 million,whether that information belonged to Goldmark in equity and whether Vos or Goldmark had any beneficial interest in Unit 1A.  Thoseare non-issues or irrelevant.</p>    <p class="heading">The âmerry-go-roundâ cheques</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Before turning to the issues in respect of this claim, I shall first deal with the evidence about two cheques drawn on Goldmarkâsaccount with Rabobank in connection with the purchase of Unit 1A, cheque number 505802 and 505836.  These cheques may not have muchsignificance in the context this head of claim, but they are featured in the other heads of claim.  Based on these two cheques Yungalso attacked Vos for changing his evidence.  On the other hand, Vos alleged that the date on cheque number 505802 was forged byYung and called into question Yungâs honesty not only generally or in relation to that cheque but a number of issues to which thatcheque was related.  It is therefore convenient to deal with these two cheques separately now and get them out of the way.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  It is common ground that on 29 November 1991 Vos and Yung co-signed cheque number 505802 in the amount of $500,000 and issued itto Yung as security for Yungâs loan to Goldmark. This cheque was not cashed as Goldmark was short of funds.  On 1 March 1992, Vosco-signed another cheque number 505836 which was cleared on 7 August 1992.  According to Vos, cheque number 505836 was to replacecheque number 505802.  Vos called these cheques and other cheques issued for such purpose the âmerry-go-roundâ cheques. </p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  The date as now shown on the cheque was 29 December 1992.  But it is common ground that it was countersigned by Vos on 29 November1991 as security for a short term loan of $500,000 advanced by Yung to Goldmark on that day.  The dispute between the parties iswhether the cheque was dated or undated when issued.  If it was dated, it must have been post-dated to 29 December 1991. </p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  The argument was raised by Yung as an attack on the credibility of Vos for changing his evidence.  He referred to Vosâs witnessstatement and the Plaintiffâs statement of claim in which it was alleged that cheque number 505802 was used in the acquisitionof Unit 1A.  However, in his evidence in Court, Vos said that Goldmark had issued a number of cheques in that amount to Yung.  Therewere numerous occasions in which Yung showed him cheques of that amount which Yung said he had deposited into the account of Goldmark. In return Goldmark issued cheques of that amount to Yung as security.  Vos recalled that all those cheques he signed were dated. He had to spend a lot of time and efforts after liquidation to find out the truth relating to the cheques.  He said that chequenumber 505802 which on the face was dated 29 December 1992 was in fact dated 29 December 1991 which was used as a security for aloan of $500,000 advanced by Yung on 29 November 1991.  Later, Yung told him that cheque number 505802 had expired and he issuedhim cheque number 505836 on 1 March 1992 as replacement.  The replacement cheque was subsequently cleared on 7 August 1992.  Vosalleged that despite Yung told him that cheque number 505802 had expired, it was presented on 11 June 1993 with the date of the chequealtered to 29 December 1992.  The cheque was not honoured by Rabobank because by then Goldmark had already exceeded its overdraftlimit.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  On a proper understanding of Vosâ evidence, he was not changing his evidence when he talked about the âmerry-go-roundâ cheque. His statement was given on 15 November 2002, which was eleven years after the incident.  There were numerous cheques in the amountof $500,000 issued to Yung as security for or as repayment of Yungâs loans to Goldmark.  It is understandable that Vos may noteasily relate cheque number 505802 with cheque number 505836.  It took him some time to find out what the various cheques of $500,000were for.  By reason of the proximity in time with the purchase of Unit 1A, Vosâ mistake in relating cheque number 505802 withthe purchase could readily be understood.  But his witness statement was not inconsistent with his evidence.  Cheque number 505802was indeed issued to Yung on 29 November 1991 as security for Yungâs loan to Goldmark for the purpose of financing the purchaseof Unit 1A.  His evidence in Court only completed the link between cheque number 505802 and cheque number 505836 which was issuedas a replacement cheque to repay Yungâs loan.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  Yungâs evidence was that cheque number 505802 was issued to him on 29 November 1991 as security for a loan of $500,000 which hedeposited into Goldmarkâs account with Rabobank.  That loan and the purpose for the issue of cheque number 505802 were not in dispute. The dispute is whether the cheque was dated when issued.  Vos said it was but Yung said that it was not.  Then Yung said that thesaid loan of $500,000 was rectified as a shareholdersâ loan and it was agreed that the cheque be used as security for another directorâsloan advanced on 8 November 1991 in the amount of $550,000 which Vos was unable to contribute.  Thus Yung advanced $1,100,000 toGoldmark for the purpose of completing the purchase of Unit 1D.  Then, in February 1993, another cheque number 510297 drawn on Rabobankwas issued to Yung as security for his loan of $1,100,000.  Yungâs account is very strained and difficult to understand.  If theloan of $500,000 advanced to Goldmark on 29 November 1991 was rectified or regularised as a proper shareholdersâ loan it shouldhave been supported by a loan certificate issued by Goldmark for that amount.  There was none.  The other problem is why should chequenumber 505802 be used as security for another loan of a greater amount.  It would have been much tidier for the parties to tear upor cancel cheque number 505802 and issue Yung with a new cheque in the correct amount of $550,000 as security.  Then, why was thesituation not rectified in February 1993 when the cheque number 510297 of $500,000 was issued to Yung?  Why did the parties not issuea cheque for $600,000 so as to tie in with the loan?  These difficulties suggest that Yung was trying to give an explanation by jugglingwith data which do not fit because his explanation was untrue.  I only mention the above evidence for completeness.  There is noneed for me to resolve that issue.  The issue I have to decide now is whether the date on cheque number 505802 was forged.  To thatissue I now return.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Yung attacked Vosâ evidence as incredible because Vos must have known that a cheque would not expire until after six months hadlapsed and he would not have issued cheque number 505836 in March 1992 to Yung as a replacement for cheque number 505802 when slightlyover three months had passed.  He referred to the date on the cheque and argues that although the figure â2â in the year â1992âappeared different from the figure â2â in the date â29â, it was written in one continuous smooth stroke without correction. He also argues that Vos must have crossed out or torn up the expired cheque before issuing a replacement.  He submits that Vos wasconcocting evidence in accusing him of altering the date on the cheque.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  The figure â2â in the year â1992â and in the date â29â written on cheque number 505802 were very different.  The downwardstroke of the figure â2â in â1992â which constituted the main body of the figure appeared vertical and very much like thefigure â1â as in â1991â.  Of course, I note that to the naked eye, it appeared to have been written in one continuous strokewithout correction, but I am, however, not assisted by any expert opinion.  On the evidence, cheque number 505802 must have beenissued at a time between the issue of cheque number 505801 and 505803.  Cheque number 505801 was issued on 18 November 1991 to reimburseYung of the deposit he alleged paid.  According to the bank statement from Rabobank, the value date was 20 November 1991.  Therewas no evidence when cheque number 505803 was issued, but the value date as shown in Rabobankâs statement was 3 December 1991. Therefore, cheque number 505802 must have been issued between 18 November and 3 December 1991.  This supports the partiesâ evidencethat cheque number 505802 was issued on 29 November 1991.  Vosâ evidence that the cheque was issued on 29 November 1991 but postdated to 29 December 1991 ties in neatly with the above time frame and with the fact that Yung advanced $500,000 to Goldmark on 29November 1991.  On the other hand, if the cheque was issued undated as Yung alleged, why did he put a date of 29 December 1992 onthe cheque and present it six months later on 11 June 1993?  Why didnât he put a current date on what he alleged to be an undatedcheque?  Why didnât he present it earlier but waited until after the dispute with Vos had erupted?  Why did he present the chequewhen he should have known not only that Goldmark was short of funds in Rabobankâs account but had exceeded its overdraft limit? All these unanswered questions suggest Yung was not telling the truth.  The inescapable inference is that the date of 29 December1992 on cheque number 505802 was a forgery and Yung was the person who forged it.  Though the burden of proving fraud is a very onerousone especially in the absence of handwriting expert evidence, the circumstances in this case are such as to make Vosâ evidenceabsolutely compelling and Yungâs evidence manifestly untrue.  I accept Vosâ evidence and reject Yungâs. </p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  My finding in respect of this cheque not only demonstrates Yungâs dishonesty in forging and presenting a cheque which had beenreplaced, but also the amount of thoughts and caution he exercised in his dealing with Vos as reflected by his preserving a replacedcheque for a year and half and to use it against his company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Mrs Yung purchased Unit 1A after she became aware of Vosâ interest to acquire the unit for Goldmark</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  Mrs Yung purchased Unit 1A on 28 September 1991 shortly after Yung and Vos were discussing about the purchase of Unit 1D.  Accordingto Vos, at about the same time, he saw a poster at the lobby of Thomson Commercial Building offering Unit 1A for sale.  He discussedwith Yung but Yung ignored him.  Then about a month or so later in early November 1991, Yung informed him that Unit 1A was availablefor sale at $2.85 million.  They agreed that Goldmark should purchase the unit by a separate corporate vehicle to be identified. Throughout the discussion, Yung never told Vos that Unit 1A had been purchased by Mrs Yung or a company under her and/or Yungâscontrol.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  Yung said that Unit 1A was never advertised by poster outside the management office of Thomson Commercial Building.  His evidencewas that Mrs Yung was very friendly with a Mr Chan of the management office, who informed her about availability of Unit 1A and introducedher to an estate agent.  Then Mrs Yung purchased Unit 1A through Gallery Company on 28 September 1991.  Yung referred to Vosâ witnessstatement dated 15 November 2002 in which the allegation was that Yung informed Vos that Unit 1A was available in November 1991. He attacks Vosâ evidence about having seen a poster in the management office as a recent concoction.  Vosâ evidence was indeedslightly equivocal.  He admitted that he did not know the content of the poster except that it was about Unit 1A as he could notread Chinese.  At one stage under cross-examination he said it was difficult to say he clearly remembered but insisted that he hadseen the poster. </p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  Yung submitts that the management office would not have put up any poster disclosing particulars of Unit 1A or allowed such posterto be put up as it was the business of the management office to earn commission by introducing sales.  He said that Unit 1A was boughtby Mrs Yung on the very day it was put on the market before the estate agent had prepared the poster.  There was no evidence to thateffect from Mrs Yung either.  More importantly, Yungâs submission conflicts with his own evidence because not only that the managementoffice freely disclosed the availability of Unit 1A to Mrs Yung but also diverted the business to an outside agency.  If Mrs Yunghad to purchase through Gallery Company, why did she not purchase through the management office.  Yungâs evidence was confusingand illogical.  His evidence suggests that it was not the business of the management office to introduce sales of units inside ThomsonCommercial Building and discredits Yungâs evidence that no poster relating to Unit 1A was posted at the management office.  I rejectYungâs evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  <i>Prima facie</i>, if a witness departs from his witness statement in a material aspect, it damages his credibility.  In assessing the witnessâ credibility,the Court must consider the circumstances of the departure, the importance of the departure to the case of the party calling thewitness and the totality of evidence.  In the present case, the departure has little to add to the Plaintiffâs case.  Accordingto Vosâ evidence, his suggestion about the purchase was ignored by Yung in September 1991.  The significance of this event mighthave diminished in Vosâ mind at the time he wrote his witness statement.  I do not consider much damage has been done to his credibilityby reason of this departure.  Vos appeared equivocal about the poster.  Bearing in mind that he could not read Chinese and that theevent occurred seventeen years ago, he should be reasonably excused.  On the other hand, his demeanour suggests he was a responsiblewitness.  Though elsewhere, I find him incredible, on the totality of the evidence and his demeanour when cross-examined under thisissue, I accept his evidence.  The significance of Vosâ evidence is that Mrs Yung had not acquired Unit 1A before Vos suggestedthe purchase to Yung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The reasons Yung gave for the failure to complete the sale and purchase and for World Champ replacing Fudo as the corporate vehiclefor holding Unit 1A</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  Vosâ case is very simple.  He was keen to purchase Unit 1A.  He acted according to what he was told by Yung.  On 16 December 1991,he deposited $700,000 into the account of Fudo as his contribution to the purchase price of Unit 1A.  Two weeks later, he was toldby Yung that the sale and purchase could not be completed due to problems with the title deeds and he let things rest there.  Afterabout a month, Yung told him that the parties could proceed with the sale and purchase at a somewhat reduced price using World Champas the corporate vehicle and paying certain legal costs.  He was also told that Fudo could not be used as it had incurred some debts. It is understandable that he would accept Yungâs suggestion to acquire 50% interest in World Champ which had the effect of completingthe sale and purchase of Unit 1A for Goldmark.  Given his trust in Yung, his case is inherently credible.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  If Vos had indeed been informed of Mrs Yungâs prior purchase at $2.32 million and that she inadvertently failed to complete theSonatina/World Champ agreement on time, Yungâs case that Vos excused Mrs Yungâs fault could be credible in view of their longterm relationship.  If so, Yungâs case about World Champ replacing Fudo as the corporate vehicle to hold Unit 1A could also becredible.  However, according to Vos, that was not the case.  Vos was not even aware that Mrs Yung was the beneficial owner of WorldChamp and was subselling the unit at a profit.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  On balance, I think Yungâs case is inherently incredible.  On the one hand, Yung said that Vos was hesitant to purchase Unit 1Abecause of his lack of funds.  On the other hand, his evidence was that Vos was so eager to purchase that he was willing to pay $2.85million for a property which was purchased a month or so ago at $2.32 million, a 23% increase in price over a month.  What discreditedYungâs case most was the fact that Vos had his share of the purchase price ready by 16 December 1991.  Vos could not have beenhesitant in the purchase due to lack of funds and he had caused Goldmark to pay two deposits.  The totality of the evidence is moreconsistent with Yungâs covering up his case of attempted secret profit.  Under that scenario, he could not have told Vos that MrsYung was responsible for the failure to complete the Sonatina/World Champ agreement because if Vos did not know World Champ was ownedby Mrs Yung, Vos would demand World Champ to pay damages under the World Champ/Fudo agreement.  Thus Yung had to conveniently lieto Vos by putting the blame on problems with the title deeds.  As matters subsequently turned out, the sub-sale to Fudo would benon-profitable because of the increase in price, legal costs and stamp duty.  The sub-sale would also result in additional legalcosts and stamp duty to Goldmark, half of which would have to be borne by Yung.  It would be more convenient to peruade Vos to takeover World Champ, cancel the World Champ/Fudo agreement and thereby pass the legal costs of the action for specific performance againstSonatina to Goldmark.  On balance, I am driven to accept Vosâ evidence. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Yung owned or had a controlling interest in World Champ prior to the completion of the Sonatina/World Champ agreement on 28April 1992</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  One of Yungâs defence is that World Champ was owned by Mrs Yung and her family and they owed no fiduciary duty to Goldmark.  Inorder that Yung may be liable for attempted secret profit from the purchase of Unit 1A, the Plaintiff has to show that Yung controlledor owned or had a substantial interest in World Champ prior to the completion of the Sonatina/World Champ agreement on 28 April 1992.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Yung argues that he had no control over World Champ before it became the corporate vehicle of Vos and Yung or Goldmark for the purchaseof Unit 1A. He was neither a director nor shareholder of World Champ.  In his witness statement, Yung portrayed a picture that heand Mrs Yung were financially separate from and independent of the other.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Wealth Country represents the major asset of Yung and Mrs Yung.  It is the holding company of VIP Media which used to be Mrs Yungâsbusiness.  It also holds one share in Goldmark which represents 50% interest in Godlmark.  It is not disputed that that interestwas the greatest asset of Wealth Country.  Initially, Mrs Yung held three shares and Yung held one share in Wealth Country.  Yungwas its director until his resignation on 22 October 1990.  But in Goldmarkâs financial statement for the year 1992/93 signed byYung, it stated that Wealth Country was a company controlled by Yung.  Yung seeks to explain the inconsistency by arguing that hewas merely authorised by Mrs Yung to manage and control Wealth Country.  I reject his explanation.  I find that Yung was in controlof Wealth Country and has at least 25% interest in that company.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  Yung said in evidence that the one share in Goldmark held by Wealth Country also belonged to Mrs Yung as he had given her everything. This is contrary to his own witness statement in which he said that one share was held by Wealth Country on his behalf.  Then Yungsaid under cross-examination that to the outside world, he and Mrs Yung were the same.  He said as between him and Mrs Yung, everythingwas Mrs Yungâs, though this may not be so to the outside world.  He was being crafty.  I do not accept his evidence.  Despite hisminority interest in Wealth Country, he was a director of Goldmark by virtue of Wealth Countryâs holding in Goldmark.  He was fullyin control of Goldmark while Mrs Yung only played a minor secretarial or clerical role.  This shows that he was the person in controlof Wealth Country.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  Yung admitted under cross-examination that the matrimonial home was registered in his name though it was purchased using funds ofWealth Country.  On the other hand, Unit 8D which was also purchased with the funds of Wealth Country was registered solely in MrsYungâs name.  Then the proceeds of sale of Unit 8D was applied towards the purchase of Unit 1A by World Champ.  The income of WealthCountry came from the business of VIP Media and Goldmark.  It is clear that Yung and Mrs Yung shared in the income from Goldmarkand VIP Media jointly as a common fund.  There is no truth in Yungâs evidence that they were financially independent of one anotherand that everything belonged to Mrs Yung.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  Though Yung claimed that he had no control or interest in World Champ until it became the corporate vehicle of Vos and Yung jointlyor of Goldmark in the purchase of Unit 1A, the fact showed that he was actively involved in the affairs of the only business of WorldChamp at the time, i.e. the sub-sale of Unit 1A.  He said that he paid the first deposit to World Champ on behalf of the joint ventureand he was reimbursed by Goldmark to him personally.  As for the second deposit, he said that as World Champ had no bank account,the deposit was paid to him.  He explained that paying him was the same as paying World Champ because if the cheques for the purchasewere directly made out to World Champ, it would tentamount to issuing the cheque to himself.  He could not explain why the chequewas not issued to Mrs Yung as World Champ was her company and alter ego.  Of course, his difficulty was that would expose the relationshipbetween Mrs Yung and World Champ which was the secrecy Yung was trying to protect by the use of World Champ as an intermediary inthe transaction. </p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  More importantly, even before World Champ became Goldmarkâs or Yungâs and Vosâ corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A, Yunghad become its director and had conduct of the action for specific performance against Sonatina.  Thus, Yung had control of WorldChamp even at a time when Mrs Yung was the sole beneficial owner of World Champ.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  The totality of the evidence shows that Yung and Mrs Yung were not financially independent of one another but their assets weretreated as one pool of family asset controlled by Yung.  Specifically, Yung had control of Mrs Yungâs interest in Wealth Countryand World Champ.  I accept Mr Lamâs submission that it was clear from the above that the <i>modus operandi</i> of Yung in his business dealings was to hide himself behind the corporate structures of which, he was neither a director nor a shareholder,although he was the one in actual control.  He was deeply involved in the affairs of World Champ before he became its director before7 January 1992 and certainly more involved since.  I find that he and Mrs Yung were parties to the design to purchase Unit 1A andsub-sell it at a profit to Goldmark. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Yung had informed Vos that Mrs Yung or World Champ had acquired Unit 1A and whether Vos consented to profit being made byMrs Yung or World Champ from the purchase</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  These two issues are related and can be conveniently dealt with together.  According to Vos, on 8 November 1991, Yung informed himthat Unit 1A was available for sale at $2.85 million and they agreed for Goldmark to purchase the unit using a separate corporatevehicle.  On 19 November 1991, Yung showed Vos the Chinese preliminary sale and purchase agreement for Unit 1A dated 18 November1991, i.e. the World Champ/Yung agreement.  Vos could not read Chinese and accepted that it was an agreement entered into by Yungon behalf of Goldmark or the new corporate vehicle to be identified.  According to Vos, Yung did not tell him that Unit 1A was ownedby Mrs Yung and her family or company under their control or that they were to make a profit out of the sale.  As a result Vos issuedtwo cheques of $285,000 each from Goldmarkâs bank account to reimburse Yung in respect of the two deposits Yung allegedly paidto World Champ.  These are respectively cheque numbers 505801 and 505804.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  According to Yung, on or around 18 November 1991, Vos learned that Mrs Yung had purchased Unit 1A and sought confirmation from himif that was the case.  Vos expressed his interest in investing in half of the property.  Yung told Vos that it was Mrs Yung who hadbecome the true owner of Unit 1A for her family and that the then market value was $2.85 million.  Vos agreed to buy 50% interestin the unit and suggested using a separate corporate vehicle to hold the unit jointly with Yung.  Later that evening, on behalf ofthe new joint venture which was yet to be born and identified Yung entered into the Chinese World Champ/Yung agreement for the saleand purchase of Unit 1A.  Then on the following day, Yung presented the World Champ/Yung agreement to Vos and interpreted its contentto Vos who wrote down in English the translation of some of the relevant provisions of the agreement.  Yung expressly informed Vosthat World Champ was a company related to Yung or Mrs Yung.  Vos had no objection and consented to profit to be made by Mrs Yung.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  This dispute is one of fact which stands or falls on my finding of Vosâ and Yungâs credibility.  Yung submits that the ChineseWorld Champ/Yung agreement was peculiar in that it provided that the purchaser was to pay 1% commission to the vendor and not toan estate agent.  He argues that this term supports his case that Vos had knowledge of the special relationship between the vendorand World Champ and of Mrs Yungâs ownership of Unit 1A. </p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Yung referred to the English translation of some of the terms of the World Champ/Yung agreement, which Vos admitted were his handwriting. He submits that this is further evidence in support of his case that he had explained the agreement to Vos and informed him of MrsYungâs ownership of Unit 1A.  Though Vos admitted that the translation was written by him, Vosâ evidence was that it was writtenby him when he was explained the content of the agreement while going through Goldmarkâs documents after liquidation of the Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  Yung referred to the two deposits which were paid to him instead of to World Champ and argues that this is another piece of evidencethat Vos knew World Champ was related to him or Mrs Yung.  But Vosâ evidence was that the first payment was made to reimburse Yungfor what he had allegedly paid under the World Champ/Yung agreement and that the other payment was made to Yung at his suggestionas he trusted Yung and entrusted him with the purchase of Unit 1A.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  Yung referred to the indulgence given by World Champ in not forfeiting the deposit when Vos failed to pay the second deposit on30 November 1991 when the formal World Champ/Fudo agreement was originally scheduled to be signed.  He submits that this again reflectedthe special relationship between World Champ and Mrs Yung, which Vos was aware of.  However, even according to Yungâs witness statement,he explained that the delay in signing the World Champ/Fudo agreement was probably due to his failure in identifying the corporatevehicle to hold Unit 1A and nothing was mentioned about late payment of the deposit by Vos.  Fudo was only suggested by Yung on 3December 1991.  The delay or indulgence was all a matter caused by or under the control of Yung.  I reject his submission.</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Then, Yung argues that under the World Champ/Yung agreement as well as the subsequent formal World Champ/Fudo agreement, World Champwas the vendor of Unit 1A to the joint venture between Vos and Yung, but ultimately, World Champ became the final purchaser and corporatevehicle for the joint venture.  He submits that Vos must have noticed this and must have asked why.  He also submits that this arrangementwas not possible without Fudo having to pay cancellation fees for which Vos would be liable.  He further submits that it was impossiblefor Vos not to have asked about the relationship between World Champ and Fudo.  These questions are self answered, if I accept Vosâevidence that upon Mrs Yungâs failure to complete the Sonatina/World Champ agreement in time, Yung persuaded Vos to accept WorldChamp as the corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A for them or Goldmark.  Furthermore, there could be no question of any cancellationfee to be paid by Fudo to World Champ because it was World Champ which failed to complete the Sonatina/World Champ agreement withthe result that it could not complete the World Champ/Fudo agreement.  If any cancellation fees had to be paid, it would have beenWorld Champ which had to pay Fudo.  After all, at the material time, both Fudo and World Champ were manipulated by Yung.  Yungâssubmission on this point is disingenuous could be readily dismissed.  Yungâs submission demonstrates how crafty he was in manipulatingthe facts to his advantage.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  Yung was the engineer of those transactions.  The use of two intermediaries, World Champ and Fudo, suggests the whole purpose wasto use World Champ to conceal Mrs Yungâs identity as the vendor to Fudo.  Had the transactions been as transparent as Yung wouldhave me to believe, Fudo was not necessary.  Yung could have given effect to the intention of the parties by simply allotting 50%of the shares in World Champ to Vos.  There would be no need to enter into the World Champ/Yung agreement and the World Champ/Fudoagreement.  It would not have been necessary to engage an additional solicitor and to pay additional legal costs and stamp duty. All those sub-sales were done to dress up the World Champ/Fudo agreement as an armsâ length transaction when it was actually not. The only reasonable inference is that Vos had not been informed of the true relationship between Mrs Yung and World Champ nor consentedto profit to be made from the transaction.  That gives support to Vosâ evidence which I accept.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Goldmark was the intended purchaser of Unit 1A under the World Champ/Yung agreement</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case is that Goldmark was the intended purchaser of Unit 1A, though the agreement was that the unit was to beheld by a separate corporate vehicle.  Yungâs case is that Unit 1A was intended to be a separate and distinct investment of Vosand Yung personally.  The significance is that if the purchaser was a distinct entity, Yungâs fiduciary duty owed to Goldmark isnot in issue.  The key to this issue is who provided the source of funds for the purchase.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  Mr Lam referred me to Goldmarkâs cheque number 505836 dated 1 March 1992 in the amount of $500,000 payable to Yung which was enteredin Goldmarkâs books prepared by Yung as payment for the purchase of Unit 1A.  It should be recalled that that cheque was issuedas a replacement for cheque number 505802, which was issued as a security for Yungâs loan.  It was cleared on 7 August 1992.  Thisis evidence coming from Yung that Goldmark paid $500,000 towards the purchase of Unit 1A.  However, I shall assume for the benefitof Yung that the said sum of $500,000 was a reimbursement to Yung for the funds he had put in the purchase or as repayment of a loanhe had advanced to Goldmark for the purchase of Unit 1A.  Accordingly, that amount should be ignored, otherwise that payment wouldmake a double count.  The significance of this evidence is that Goldmarkâs books confirmed that the sum of $500,000 had been paidby Goldamrk towards the purchase of Unit 1A.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  There is no dispute that the two deposits of $285,000 were paid using cheques drawn on Goldmarkâs bank account.  There is alsono dispute that Vos paid $700,000 into the account of Fudo on 16 December 1991 for the purpose of purchasing Unit 1A as is acknowledgedin Table A submitted by Yung in the course of his closing submission.  The balance of the purchase price was financed by Goldmarkâsloan of $1.5 million from Rabobank.  Those funds totalled $2.77 million which was more than sufficient to cover the purchase pricefor Unit 1A.  All the legal costs and expenses in connection with the purchase were paid by Goldmark.  Thus, the evidence is overwhelminglyin favour of Goldmark being the purchaser.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  Yung put forward a very complicated model to explain the various payments by Goldmark.  He said that though Vos wanted to acquirea 50% interest in Unit 1A, Vos had no money to pay his share of the purchase price.  Then Yung and Vos, as shareholders of Goldmark,agreed that Goldmark should refund part of the shareholdersâ loans to Yung and Vos so that they could pay the deposit.  Thus, Goldmarkissued a cheque number 505801 drawn on Rabobank to pay the deposit of $285,000 on behalf of the new joint venture between Vos andYung.  As World Champ had no bank account at that stage, the cheque was made payable to Yung.  This explained why the first depositwas paid by Goldmark to Yung.  Yung said that all these facts had been explained to Vos.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  After thus repaying $285,000 to the shareholders, Goldmark was depleted of funds.  On 20 November 1991, Yung lent $64,252 to Goldmarkand, at the suggestion of Vos, a further sum of $500,000 on 29 November 1991.  Vos co-signed and issued Yung a cheque number 505802drawn on Rabobank as security for the loan.  At about the same time, Vos suggested that he intended to use the funds which he hadoriginally promised to make available to Goldmark for purchase of Unit 1D to pay for the purchase of Unit 1A under the new jointventure instead.  Yung objected and insisted that those funds should be applied as shareholdersâ loan to Goldmark towards Goldmarkâspurchase of Unit 1D.  Vos reluctantly agreed.  This explained the issue of cheque number 505802, which will become relevant lateron.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  By 30 November 1991, Vos could still not come up with his contribution towards payment of the second deposit.  Again, Vos suggestedthat Goldmark should return more shareholdersâ loan to the shareholders for paying the second deposit.  Yung agreed.  Hence, on3 December 1991, Goldmark issued a cheque number 505804 drawn on Rabobank in favour of Yung for the purpose of paying the seconddeposit.  This explained the payment of the second deposit by Goldmark.  Yung submits that Vos knew about all those arrangementsand that it was because of the close relationship between World Champ and the new joint venture that World Champ did not forfeitthe first deposit despite their failure to pay the second deposit on 30 November 1991.  But, I have rejected that agreement. </p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  Yungâs story went on as follows.  On 6 December 1991, Fudo was named as the corporate vehicle for the new joint venture betweenVos and Yung.  At the time, Vos was allotted ten shares, while Mrs Yung held sixteen shares.  Thus, Vos just held a little over one-thirdof the shares in Fudo.  Yung explained that the unequal shareholding was to reflect the larger amount of funds put in by Yung towardsthe purchase price.  On 18 December 1991 when Fudo signed the formal sale and purchase agreement, Vos still failed to provide hiscontribution towards the purchase of Unit 1A and dropped out from the joint venture.  However, Yung and Mrs Yung kindly agreed toallow Vos to remain as a minority shareholder of Fudo and give him the option of re-joining the joint venture if he paid his halfshare of the purchase price upon which he would be issued his full 50% shares in Fudo. </p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  Vosâ evidence was that he knew nothing about the unequal shareholding as he entrusted all administrative and secretarial arrangementsto Yung.  On an objective view, Yungâs allegation is hardly credible because there is no dispute that on 16 December 1991, justtwo days before signing the formal sale and purchase agreement, Vos had deposited $700,000 into Fudoâs bank account.  Since thepurchase would be financed by a loan from Rabobank of $1.5 million, Vos had fully paid his contribution, be it his contribution toYungâs alleged new joint venture or to Goldmark.  I accept Vos evidence.  I reject Yungâs story.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  Vosâ payment of $700,000 into the account of Fudo is very important.  It completely destroyed Yungâs case.  Not only was Vosâpayment of the $700,000 not disputed by Yung, it is acknowledged by Yung in Table A of his written submission.  Furthermore, a numberof loan certificates issued by Goldmark, World Champ and Fudo were disclosed by the Defendants.  In Certificate No 1 issued by Fudo,Fudo acknowledged a shareholdersâ loan of $700,000 from Vos.  That certificate was signed by Vos and Yung.  It was undated, butthere is no other evidence about any other shareholdersâ loan of that amount from Vos.  That certificate must be referable to Vosâcontribution of $700,000 on 16 December 1991 which could not be disputed.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  I note that the Certificate No 1 was marked cancelled.  No explanation had been given by Yung.  I assume that it was cancelled becauseFudo was subsequently replaced by World Champ as the corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A and the loan was transferred elsewhere. There is no evidence that the loan was returned to Vos.  But there were two certificates issued by Goldmark, Certificates No 3 and4, which acknowledged a shareholdersâ loan of $700,000 respectively advanced by Vos and Wealth Country to Goldmark.  During hiscross-examination of Vos, Yung put to Vos that his $700,000 was not paid to Fudo but to Goldmark.  The inference is that the $700,000paid by Vos on 16 December 1991 was first deposited into Fudoâs account pursuant to the agreement that Fudo was to be the corporatevehicle and was then transferred to Goldmark when World Champ was used to replace Fudo as the corporate vehicle for holding Unit1A.</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  Could the money have been transferred to World Champ instead as World Champ became the corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A?  Probablynot, because there was no evidence of any certificate from World Champ issued to Vos for $700,000.  Instead, there were two certificatesissued by World Champ to Vos and Wealth Country, Certificate No 1 and 2 respectively, acknowledging a shareholdersâ loan of $800,000from each of them.  Those certificates were undated but Vos inserted the date of 30 November 1992 under his signature.  There werealso two certificates issued by Goldmark to Vos, Certificates No 5 and 9, acknowledging two shareholdersâ loan of $400,000 andtwo certificates issued by Goldmark to Wealth Country, Certificates No 6 and 10, similarly acknowledging two shareholdersâ loanof $400,000.  Those four certificates were undated and marked cancelled.  Interposed among those certificates were Certificates No7 and 11 from Goldmark which were receipts signed by Vos acknowledging repayment of his two loans of $400,000.  Certificate No 11was dated 30 December 1992, but Vos put down the date of 30 November 1992 on both certificates.  There were also Certificates No8 and 12 from Goldmark, which were receipts signed by Yung and Mrs Yung on behalf of Wealth Country acknowledging repayment of theirtwo loans of $400,000.  Certificate No 12 was dated 30 December 1992. </p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  Under cross-examination, Yung said that towards the end of 1992, an agreement was reached between Vos and Yung to adjust the booksof Goldmark, in Yungâs words, âsegregateâ the purchase of Unit 1A, as reflected in Goldmarkâs audited reports for the yearended 1992, which were produced in April 1993.  As part of the segregation arrangement, shareholdersâ loans to Goldmark from Vosand Wealthy Country were cancelled to the extent of $800,000 with the same being treated as going towards the purchase price of Unit1A.  This confirmed that the two sums of $800,000 were transferred from Goldmark to World Champ as evidenced by the certificates.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  The inferences to be drawn from those certificates are as follows.  Vos and Wealth Country advanced two sums of $400,000 each toGoldmark at some stage (Goldmarkâs Certificates No 5, 6, 9 and 10).  Those loans were repaid (Goldmarkâs Certificates No 7, 8,11 and 12).  At least one of those repayments was made on 30 November 1992 or 30 December 1992.  Then on the same day, the two repaymentsof $800,000 were transferred as two loans of $800,000 each advanced by Vos and Wealth Country to World Champ (World Champ CertificatesNo 1 and 2).  Because the two repayments to Vos by Goldmark and the shareholdersâ loan to World Champ were all dated 30 November1992, the inference is that the repayment by Goldmark to Vos and Wealth Country and the loan by Vos and Wealth Country to World Champtook place on the same day or were regularised on the same day.  Whether that day was 30 November 1992 or 30 December 1992 does notmatter that much. </p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Based on the above facts, Yung advanced a somewhat futile argument that the transfer of the two shareholdersâ loan of $800,000from Goldmark to World Champ towards the end of 1992 segregated Unit 1A from Goldmark.  Thus, with the transfer of the shareholdersâloan from Goldmark to World Champ or this segregation of the World Champâs account from Goldmarkâs account as suggested by Yung,World Champ had a loan of $1.6 million from Vos and Wealth Country which together with Goldmarkâs loan of $1.5 million from Rabobankwas more than sufficient to pay for the purchase price of Unit 1A.  Yungâs argument is that this transfer or segregation of accountevince the intention that World Champ was the purchaser of Unit 1A as an intity independent of Goldmark.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Such intention has never been put to Vos.  Be that as it may, the relevant time to consider the intention of the parties was thetime of contribution of the purchase price of Unit 1A.  The crucial facts were that at the point of time of the purchase of Unit1A, the purchase was financed by Vosâ initial deposit of $700,000 into Fudoâs account which as the facts show were transferredto Goldmark and the Goldmarkâs loan of $1.5 million.  The two initial deposits and all attending legal costs and expenses werepaid by Goldmark.  The irresistible inference is that the intention of Yung and Vos was that Goldmark was to be the purchaser.  Onthe facts, no contrary intention could be inferred.  The segregation of accounts of funds seven months later is not sufficient tooverturn this inference.  It was just a regularisation exercise and was neither here nor there. </p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  Following Mrs Yungâs failure to complete the Sonatina/World Champ agreement on 31 December 1991, Yung went on with his story asfollows.  He said that Vos as director of Fudo raised no complaint or accusation about Mrs Yungâs failure to complete the purchaseand excused Mrs Yungâs fault.  Then he said that Fudo failed to tender the appropriate payment on time and World Champ could haveissued legal action against Fudo, but it did not.  Yung was very evasive and equivocal in his evidence.  On the contrary, Vosâevidence is that he was told by Yung specifically that the sale and purchase could not be completed because of problems with thetitle deeds.  Vos never knew that the real cause was Mrs Yungâs arriving late for completion.  That fault was, of course, WorldChampâs and not Fudoâs.  Yet, Yung has the audacity to say that out of his and Mrs Yungâs generosity, they condoned Fudo. His allegation that Vos raised no complaint against Mrs Yung should also be considered in the light of Vosâ evidence that he didnot know Mrs Yung was behind the transaction.  Had Yung told Vos that the failure to complete was because of World Champâs default(without mentioning that Mrs Yung was behind World Champ), Vos surely would have insisted to demand compensation from World Champfor recovery of double deposit, a handsome profit of $570,000 within less than a month.  When Yungâs and Vosâ evidence is analysedagainst the above background, it is amply clear that Yungâs evidence is utterly incredible.  I accept Vosâ evidence.  I findthat Yung had not told Vos the true reason for the failure to complete the purchase and falsely represented to Vos that the failurewas due to problems with the title deeds.  Then when some progress was made in the settlement negotiation with Sonatina, Yung toldVos that the problem was resolved.  He then persuaded Vos to accept World Champ as the corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A.  Thisfinding further supports Vosâ evidence that he had not been told about the relationship between World Champ and Mrs Yung and explainswhy he raised no question when World Champ which was the vendor of Unit 1A to Fudo became Goldmarkâs corporate vehicle for holdingUnit 1A.  Vos probably did not even know that World Champ was the vendor.</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  To complete Yungâs evidence on this issue, he said that when Vos came to know in February 1992 that Unit 1A could be acquiredfor $2.7 million, Vos decided to purchase his half share in Unit 1A.  As Vos could not contribute his $700,000 to pay for his halfshare, Goldmark issued a cheque number 505836 drawn on Rabobank to Yung as repayment of shareholdersâ loan so as to enable Fudoto complete the purchase of Unit 1A.  Yung submits that this explained why Goldmakâs cheque was used to pay part of the balanceof the purchase price.  But that cheque was an outright payment to Yung which was not referable to any repayment of shareholdersâloan for the purpose of paying the purchase price towards completion of the purchase of Unit 1A.  On the other hand, Vosâ evidencethat cheque number 505836 was issued to replace cheque number 505802 which was referable to the loan given by Yung towards paymentof the two deposits.  Vosâ evidence was certainly more compelling.  Furthermore, the purchase was financed by a loan of $1.5 millionfrom Rabobank. Having analysed the partiesâ evidence up to this stage of the event, Yungâs evidence above can be readily dismissedbecause there is no dispute that Vos had paid his contribution of $700,000 into the account of Fudo on 16 December 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  Yung argues that World Champ paid nothing towards the purchase of Unit 1A and that except for the loan of $1.5 million from Rabobank,the entirety of the balance of purchase price of $1.2 million was paid by Mrs Yung.  Those payments were $50,000 initial deposit,second deposit of $414,000 and $736,000 deducted from the clientâs account held by Messrs PK with money transferred from MessrsAW.  The two deposits were paid by Mrs Yung as the purchaser on behalf of World Champ when World Champ was her alter ego.  Subsequently,World Champ as Vosâ and Yungâs or Goldmarkâs corporate vehicle had the benefit of those payments.  But the indisputable factwas that Goldmark paid $570,000 to Yung by way of two deposits.  That amount must have found its way into Mrs Yungâs pocket.  Thatleaves a balance of $630,000 which Mrs Yung apparently might not have been repaid.  Yung was in charge of the accounts of Goldmarkand World Champ before and after 28 April 1993.  He had received the two deposits of $570,000 saying that paying him was the sameas paying World Champ or Mrs Yung.  Yet, he had the audacity to mislead the Court by arguing that the balance of the purchase priceof $1.2 million was all paid by Mrs Yung.  It is difficult to give any weight to his argument.  Furthermore, even on Yungâs case,by reason of the segregation of accounts in November or December 1992, World Champ had been allotted $1.6 million shareholdersâloan from Vos and Wealth Country.  That together with the loan of $1.5 million from Rabobank was more than enough for World Champto have paid the purchase price of $2.7 million including all attending costs.  Yung was in charge of accounts of the Companies. He must somehow have arranged for the said sum of $630,000 to be repaid to Mrs Yung or himself.  That sum could well have formedpart of the $800,000 shareholdersâ loan from Wealth Country just as Vosâ payment of $700,000 to Fudoâs account could hve formedpart of Vosâ shareholdersâ loan to World Champ.  In view of the above, the insincere way in which Yung gave his evidence andsubmission and the absence of evidence from Mrs Yung, I reject Yungâs argument.</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  Another explanation proffered by Yung for the use of Goldmarkâs cheques in paying the deposits and various other payments towardsthe purchase was to show that the payments represented his joint interest with Vos under the new joint venture.  He argues that heand Vos were just using Goldmarkâs bank account to show that the funds were their joint funds from their new joint venture andthat they were just borrowing the use of the Goldmarkâs cheques to evince that common intention.  That explanation is hardly credibleor logical.  Yung was and is a seasoned businessman.  If there was a conscious intention to segregate the investment in Unit 1A fromGoldmarkâs business, that was precisely the opposite of what should have been done.  If there was a new joint venture and the intentionwas to evince a separate joint fund, the easiest way to do so was to open a new joint account.  Both Yung and Vos were very familiarwith members of the senior management of a number of banks in Hong Kong.  In any event even without such connection, opening a jointaccount in those days and nowadays was and is a very simple matter.  The sale and purchase of Unit 1A did not occur all of a sudden,but extended throughout a period of two months.  Yung and Vos could have opened such a joint account, if not in time for reimbursingYung the first deposit, at least for the purpose of paying the second deposit and all the other payments thereafter.  I reject Yungâsarguments.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  Yung tries to play down the significance of Rabobankâs loan of $1.5 million to Goldmark to complete the purchase of Unit 1A byarguing that it was just a commercial arrangement and that the loan was secured against World Champâs interest in Unit 1A.  Securitywas one thing, but liability was more important.  World Champ had no liability for the loan except to the extent of its interestin Unit 1A, but Goldmark attracted liability under the loan agreement with Rabobank if the new joint venture was unable to repayand the value of security fell below the amount of outstanding loan.  Under cross-examination, Yung admitted that World Champ wouldhave no difficulties obtaining a mortgage loan by itself, provided that Yung and Vos would offer their personal guarantees.  Thiswas especially so as Yung and Vos were very familiar with the major banks in Hong Kong.  On the other hand, Goldmark was operatinga very promising business at the material time.  Even though the shareholders behind the Companies were the same, there was no reasonwhy Goldmark should attract such a burden and risk, if World Champ was not its corporate vehicle for holding Unit 1A.  After all,the purpose of using a corporate vehicle to own property was to protect the shareholders from unforeseen liability arising from theownership of the property.  I reject Yungâs argument.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  There are some other minor arguments raised by Yung, such as that there was no documentary evidence showing World Champ was a subsidiaryor related company of Goldmark.  I dismiss those arguments as carrying little weight in the light of the totality of the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  Vosâ case is very simple and straightforward.  It is credible when measured against the totality of the evidence.  The two depositsof $570,000 paid by Goldmark, Vosâ deposit of $700,000 into Fudoâs account and Goldmarkâs loan of $1.5 million from Rabobankwere more than sufficient to pay for the purchase price of Unit 1A.  All the legal costs and expenses in connection with the purchasewere paid by Goldmark.  These objective and incontrovertible evidence support Vosâ evidence that the agreement between him andYung was that Goldmark was to purchase Unit 1A using a separate corporate vehicle.  The evidence in favour of Goldmark as the purchaseris overwhelming.  Yung put forward a very complicated model to explain the various payments by Goldmark.  The model is too complicatedto be true.  The more complicated is the explanation, the farther away that explanation is from the truth.  The model is incredibleand has been demonstrated to be false in a number of material respects as discussed above.  In particular, that model stands on thebasis that Vos could not provide his share of contribution to the purchase price.  That basis was completely destroyed by Vosâpayment of $700,000 into Fudoâs account.  I reject Yungâs evidence.  I find that Vos and Yung as directors of Goldmark agreedthat Goldmark was to purchase Unit 1A using a separate corporate vehicle.  Fudo was the intended corporate vehicle but as eventsturned out, it was replaced by World Champ.</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  Goldmark paid another sum of $500,000 towards the purchase price as recorded in the books of Goldmark by Yung.  That amount hadprobably been advanced by Yung or Mrs Yung and was then repaid by cheque number 505836 which was cleared on 7 August 1992.  It mighteven have come from Mrs Yungâs proceeds of sale from her Unit 8D as alleged by Yung.  That is immaterial.  The balance of the purchaseprice was financed by Rabobankâs loan to Goldmark of $1.5 million.</p>    <p class="heading">Finding of fact</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  I therefore make the following finding of fact.  Vos became aware that Unit 1A was up for sale and informed Yung.  Knowing thatVos was interested in the unit, Yung and Mrs Yung decided to purchase it and sub-sell to Goldmark for quick profit.  Mrs Yung purchasedUnit 1A on 28 September 1991 with completion on 31 December 1991.  To conceal her identity as the owner of Unit 1A, Mrs Yung nominatedWorld Champ as the purchaser.  She purchased World Champ as a shelf company and had its shares held by her father and brother asher nominees.  World Champ was controlled by Yung.  In early November 1991, Yung informed Vos that Unit 1A was available.  They reachedagreement that Goldmark was to purchase Unit 1A for $2.85 million using a separate corporate vehicle to be identified.  Then on behalfof the corporate vehicle to be identified Yung entered into the World Champ/Yung agreement with World Champ and presented it to Voson 19 November 1991.  He did not tell Vos the relationship between World Champ and Mrs Yung or himself.  Vos did not know and wasnot informed by Yung or Mrs Yung that Unit 1A was being purchased from them or from World Champ which was owned by Mrs Yung, stillless that they stood to make a profit of $530,000 from the deal.</p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  As events turned out, due to Mrs Yungâs default, the Sonatina/World Champ agreement and World Champ/Fudo agreement were not completed. Following the settlement with Sonatina, Yung persuaded Vos to use World Champ as the corporate vehicle for Goldmark for holdingUnit 1A and Fudo dropped out of the arrangements, presumably to reduce costs.  The Sonatina/World Champ agreement was then completedon 28 April 1992.  Thus through World Champ, Goldmark acquired Unit 1A for $2.7 million.  Even though there was a subsequent adjustmentof the books of Goldmark to segregate the accounts of World Champ and Unit 1A from Goldmarkâs books and accounts, that was irrelevantas acts relied on as breach of fiduciary duty had already taken place.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether Yung was in breach of fiduciary duty</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  Had Mrs Yung not been late for completion on 31 December 1991, the Sonatina/World Champ agreement and the World Champ/Fudo agreementwould have been completed.  Fudo or Goldmark would have paid $2.85 million instead of $2.32 million to purchase Unit 1A.  World Champor Yung and Mrs Yung would have profited $530,000 from the transaction.  Under that scenario, it would have been a straightforwardcase of breach of fiduciary duty by Yung as director of Goldmark.  Knowing of Goldmarkâs intention to purchase Unit 1A, in collaborationwith Yung, Mrs Yung purchase Unit 1A from Sonatina and Yung made arrangements to sub-sell it to Fudo.  The arrangements were unknownto Vos and hence unknown to Goldmark.  Had the design worked out, Yung would have placed himself in a position of conflict and wouldhave made a secret profit.  Yung would have been in breach of the âno conflict ruleâ and the âno profit ruleâ.  Mrs Yungwould have been liable as accessory for assisting Yung in his breach.  That designed failed.  That, however, is not the end of thematter.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  Yung was under a duty to act in good faith and in the interest of Goldmark.  He should not have attempted to make secret profitfrom his dealing with Goldmark.  Had he been loyal to his duty, he would have brought about the purchase of Unit 1A for Goldmarkdirect from Sonatina in September 1991 at the price of $2.32 million.  But for his crooked design, Goldmark ended up paying $2.7million.  Goldmark suffered loss of $380,000.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  But, assuming that Vos did not know about the availability of Unit 1A in September 1991, the position is no different on my findingof fact that Yung held a significant interest in World Champ.  He, Mrs Yung and World Champ were one and the alter ego of the other. He and Mrs Yung acted pursuant to a common design to sub-sell Unit 1A to Goldmark at a profit.  He was the controlling mind of WorldChamp.  Even if it was Yung who first suggested to sell Unit 1A to Goldmark, he should have informed Vos that World Champ would makea profit of $530,000 and that World Champ was a company in which Mrs Yung and himself were interested.  Again, it was his attemptedbreach of the âno conflict ruleâ and the âno profit ruleâ which brought about the damage suffered by Goldmark.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  Under either scenario, Yung is liable for breach of fiduciary duty and Mrs Yung is liable as accessory for assisting in Yungâsbreach.  They are jointly liable for equitable damages to Goldmark. </p>    <p class="heading">Loss suffered by Goldmark</p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  Apart from the price difference of $380,000, Goldmark paid the following sums which would not have been incurred but for Yungâsbreach of fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  Goldmark would not have incurred and paid the fees of Messrs AW for representing Fudo in the World Champ/Fudo agreement in the amountof $20,870.  This payment was effected by a cheque number 376990 drawn on Goldmarkâs account with IBA made payable to Yung.  Vosexplained that the cheque was made payable to Yung at Yungâs request as an reimbursement of what he had paid Messrs AW.  Vos acceptedwhat was represented to him.  On the payment voucher prepared by Yungâs Philipino maid, Lita, it was recorded as payment to âALSOPâfor licence fee, presumably referring to Messrs AW.  There is no evidence and it is inconceivable what licence fee this solicitorsâfirm was charging Goldmark.  This reflects the illicit purpose of the payment and the fraudulent design engaged by Yung in coveringup not just this payment but the entire design in his attempt to make secret profit from the purchase of Unit 1A. </p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  Goldmark would not have incurred the legal costs of Messrs PK for commencing proceedings on behalf of World Champ against Sonatinafor specific performance of the Sonatina/World Champ agreement.  Those fees amounted to $40,468.60. </p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  Goldmark would not have paid World Champ as vendor of Unit 1A the commission of $28,500 under the World Champ/Fudo agreement.  Thecommission was made payable to Yung on Yungâs representation that it was a reimbursement to himself for what he had paid WorldChamp.  Again, Vos accepted what Yung said and issued Yung a cheque number 376991 drawn on goldmarkâs IBA account for that amount. It is only too clear that because of his trust in Yung built up since their partnership, he readily accepted what Yung representedto him.  It demonstrates how easy it was for Yung to take advantage of Vosâ trust and how readily Vos fell prey to Yungâs illicitdesign.  But there should be a set off in respect of the commission of $23,200 paid by Mrs Yung to Gallery Company in her or WorldChampâs purchase of Unit 1A from Sonatina.  The net amount is $5,300. </p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  Lastly, had Goldmark purchased Unit 1A at $2.32 million, it would have saved stamp duty in the amount of $14,575.</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  The total loss suffered by Goldmark in respect of this claim is $461,213.60 (i.e. $380,000 + $20,870 + $40,468.60 + $5,300 +  $14,575).</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion for Attempted Secret Profit Claim</p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  Yung was in breach of his fiduciary duty owed to Goldmark and is accordingly liable for damages representing the loss suffered byGoldmark which I assess in the amount of $461,213.60.  Judgment on liability having been entered against Mrs Yung for conspiracy,I therefore assess the damages for which she is liable in the same amount.  Accordingly, Yung and Mrs Yung are jointly liable tothe Plaintiff in the amount of $461,213.60 in respect of the Attempted Secret Profit Claim.  The award shall be with interest witheffect from the date of completion of World Champâs purchase of Unit 1A, i.e. 28 April 1992.</p>    <p class="heading">(D)  misappropriation claims AGAINST YUNG</p>    <p class="heading">Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a>  These are miscellaneous claims for misappropriation of Goldmarkâs funds by Yung discovered during the course of the winding upof the Companies.  They were related to Yungâs conduct before the breakdown of his relationship with Vos in May 1993 and thereafterwhen he hijacked the management of Goldmark.  There are two claims in respect of the former period and five claims in respect ofthe latter period.  These claims are relatively straightforward.  It is virtually impossible to argue that misappropriation by adirector of the companyâs assets does not involve breach of fiduciary duty. </p>    <p class="heading">Fraudulent reimbursement of legal fees from Goldmark</p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim is that on 26 November 1991 Yung presented Vos with a cheque number 368754 drawn on Goldmarkâs accountwith IBA in the amount of $19,500 payable to Yung for signature.  Yung represented to Vos that the payment was a reimbursement ofpayment made by Yung in settlement of bill number 8637 issued by Messrs AW on 13 November 1991.  The bill was in respect of legalservices rendered by Messrs AW in Goldmarkâs purchase of Unit 1D.  Upon winding up, it was discovered that the services renderedby Messrs AW was complimentary.  Messrs AW confirmed to the Official Receiver by their letter dated 22 December 1993 that they hadwaived the fees of $19,500.  The bill rendered by Messrs AW showed that the costs for attending to the agreement and assignment inthe amount of $19,500 was marked complimentary and Messrs AW only charged Goldmark for the disbursements in the amount of $1,050.</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  The above facts are not disputed by Yung.  Yungâs defence is that at the time of signing the cheques Vos agreed to pay him a bonusbecause of the savings he had made for Goldmark.  Yung said that, firstly, Messrs AW waived the fees for the agreement and assignmentof $19,500 because of his relationship with Messrs AW.  Yung was on good terms with a solicitor, Alfred Hau then of Messrs AW, whosubsequently left and started his own firm Messrs HLLY.  That Alfred Hau had much to do with the subsequent auction of the Units. Secondly, Yung said that he brought about the purchase of Unit 1D without going through an estate agent and saved $29,000 by wayof commission.  He also said in evidence that as he was informing Vos of his demand for the bonus he was holding a pencil and crossedout the words âcomplimentaryâ from the bill meaning that the fee for the agreement and assignment had to be paid to him.  Allthese were denied by Vos.  In any event, Yungâs assertion that by crossing out the word âcomplimentaryâ Vos could have agreedto make a bonus to him does not make any sense.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  Yung referred to the two cheques, one in the amount of $19,500 issued to him and the other in the amount of $1,050 issued to MessrsAW for the disbursements.  He submits that Vos must have realised that the names of the payee written on the two cheques were different,must have asked why and must have agreed to give Yung the reward when he signed the two cheques.  Vos denied that was the case andsaid that signing two cheques for one bill it was not unusual in his dealings with Yung.  I do not share Vosâ opinion.  I thinkit is highly unusual to have issued two cheques to two different payees to settle the same bill.</p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  On the other hand, the cheque stubs showed that the cheque issued to Messrs AW was remarked as âWilkinson Legal Feeâ and thecheque issued to Yung was remarked as âLegal fee paid by Kapoâ.  Yung presented the cheques to Vos for countersignature.  Hemust be the one who wrote the cheques and cheque stubs or at least approved their contents.  In the payment voucher in respect ofthese cheques, it was noted that both payments were for âprofessional serviceâ.  If what Yung said was true, the payment voucherand the cheque stub for cheque number 368754 should have recorded the payment as âbonusâ.  It is also worth noting that the paymentvoucher was prepared by Yungâs maid, Lita, and during the Official Receiverâs examination of Yung in the winding up proceedings,Yung falsely alleged that Lita was the part time account clerk hired by Vos.  All these objective evidence weigh heavily againstYung.</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  Though it is unusual for Vos to have signed two cheques to settle the same bill, there was an explanation.  I have found in respectof the earlier claims that it was Vosâ practice to accept what was represented to him by Yung and sign cheques payable to Yungas reimbursements which Yung claimed to have paid on behalf of Goldmark.  In going through the documents, I find it a special featurein this case that many of the payments in respect of Goldmarkâs liability were effected as reimbursements to Yung rather than asdirect payment by Goldmark to the recipient.  Because of his trust in Yung, Vos accepted the payments as reimbursements without questionand signed many cheques payable to Yung for expenses which allegedly had been paid by Yung on behalf of Goldmark.  On the bill waswritten the words âPaid by Capoâ.  The cheque stub showed that the cheque was issued as reimbursement of legal fees paid by Yung. In the light of all these incontrovertible and objective evidence, I think the balance leans heavily in favour of Vosâ evidencebeing closer to the truth than Yungâs.  I accept Vosâ evidence.  I find that Yung had misrepresented to Vos that he had paidthe legal fees which was marked as âcomplimentaryâ on the bill.  Vos took Yungâs words for granted and issued him the chequefor a liability which never existed. </p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  Though Yung might have saved Goldmark from estate agentâs commission in purchasing Unit 1D and might have saved Goldmarkâs legalfees, it nevertheless was a directorâs duty to act in the interest of the company and to reduce the companyâs expenses.  A directoris not entitled to extra bonus unless agreed to by the company.  Just as Vos secured Hillâs distributorship without charging anycommission or bonus, neither should Yung.  There was no agreement that Yung should receive a bonus.  His conduct was deceptive andin breach of his fiduciary duty as director.  He is liable to make good the funds lost.</p>    <p class="heading">Double reimbursement of legal fees from Goldmark</p>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  On 28 April 1992, Messrs Ho &amp; Wong as solicitors of Rabobank issued a bill number 92215 in the amount of $14,180 for their feesin handling Rabobankâs loan of $1.5 million to Goldmark and the mortgage of Unit 1A.  Yung procured Vos to countersign and issuehim a cheque number 372611 drawn on Goldmarkâs account with IBA dated 19 May 1992 as reimbursement to Yung for the fees paid. The cheque was supported by a voucher dated 20 May 1992 prepared by Lita.  However, Yung procured Vos to countersign and issue himanother cheque number 376989 drawn on Goldmarkâs account with IBA dated 28 July 1992 for the same purpose.  The second cheque wassupported by a payment voucher dated 8 June 1992, which was also prepared by Lita.</p>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  Yung has no defence to this claim save to argue that the auditor must have known about this sum when auditing the accounts in March1993 and made adjustments.  As submitted by Mr Lam, this was unlikely.  An auditor would merely rely upon the vouchers prepared bythe directors, in this case by Yungâs maid, Lita.  It is unlikely that the auditor would have gone behind each and every voucherespecially for a relatively small sum as this.  He would most likely have relied on the description given in the voucher of âprofessionalfeesâ and regarded it as having been properly incurred.  Having received a double payment, even if innocently, Yung became a constructivemoney.  The burden is on him to show the appropriate adjustment had been made by the auditor when reconciling Goldmarkâs account. There is no such evidence.  Hence, Yung is under a duty to return the said sum of $14,180.</p>    <p class="heading">Payment of four sums from Goldmarkâs account with IBA to Yung</p>    <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a>  The Plaintiff claims misappropriation of four payments made by Yung after the break down of relationship between Vos and Yung inJune 1993.  Hitherto, Goldmarkâs account with IBA could only be operated on the joint signatures of Vos and Yung.  On 18 June 1993,Yung procured Iris Leung to sign as director of Goldmark together with himself the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution changing the bank mandate with IBA so that all cheques and authorisations must be signed singly by Yung.  With thechange of mandate, Yung withdrew three sums of $200,000, $30,000 and $33,310 from Goldmarkâs account with IBA for himself and asum of $30,000 for Iris Leung.</p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  Yung did not dispute the above facts.  His defence is that by reason of Iris Leungâs appointment as director of Goldmark underthe 1991 Resolution, the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution changing the mandate was valid and that the three sums were not payments to himself but to the cash account he maintainedfor Goldmarkâs business.  Having found on the facts that Iris Leungâs appointment under the 1991 Resolution expired upon Yungâsreturn to Hong Kong on 3 October 1991 or whatever the date and on the law that her appointment would in any event have lapsed pursuantto <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 111(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> and article 7 of the Articles of Association of Goldmark, the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution changing the mandate is invalid.  But, this is really besides the point.  The issue is not whether the new mandatewas valid by reason of the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution, but whether Yung misappropriated the funds of Goldmark.  Even if the mandate or the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution were valid, that did not legitimise his pocketing the funds which belonged to Goldmark.</p>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  Yungâs further defence is that since the outbreak of hostility, Vos refused to sign further cheques, bringing Goldmark to a standstill. He therefore had no choice but to pass the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution to give him sole authority to operate Goldmarkâs account with IBA.  Such evidence was contradicted by the indisputablefact that on 25 May 1993, Vos signed a series of cheques of Goldmark at Yungâs request at the office of Messrs JSM.  Yung thenalleged that he telephoned Vos but could not reach him.  No attempt was made to look for Vos at his residential address in RobinsonRoad or to contact him through Messrs JSM.  Despite the many communications between Vos and Messrs JSM about finalising the formalsettlement agreement, there was no record of Yungâs complaint about Vos refusing to sign cheques or even of request for Vos tosign cheques.  Yung said that he did not wish to trouble any third parties and merely left a message with Messrs JSM to ask Vos tocontact him.  Again, there was no record of any such attendance notes on Messrs JSMâs files.  Yung said that he had even soughtadvice from Alfred Hau of Messrs HLLY but could not explain why he was not advised to contact Messrs JSM or why Messrs HLLY neverwrote on his behalf to Messrs JSM concerning this matter.  On the contrary, at all material times, Messrs JSM was chasing Yung tosign the formal settlement agreement, but to no avail.  Yungâs allegation that Vos refused to sign cheques and that he could notget in touch with Vos was just an empty excuse.</p>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  When asked why he did not give Vos notice of meeting for the purpose of passing the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution, Yung was very evasive.  He was equivocal and said he might have given notice to Vos about the board meeting buthe could no longer remember.  He was unable to say how the notice would have been given.  He accepted that he did not give noticeto Vos through Messrs JSM nor did he give a copy of the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution to Vos or Messrs JSM.  Vos denied to have received any notice of board meeting for the purpose of passing the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution.  Vos had been checking on the Goldmarkâs balance in the IBA account every now and then.  Had he been given noticeof such board meeting, he would certainly have reacted most strongly, especially as he was already represented by a top firm of solicitors. He would have applied for an injunction or must have at least alerted IBA of the invalidity of Iris Leungâs appointment.  I rejectYungâs evidence.  It is only too obvious that Yung deliberately withheld information about the passing of the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution from Vos so that he could secretly change the mandate without Vosâ knowledge and empty Goldmarkâs funds in GoldmarkâsIBA account.  From the secretive and illegitimate manner with which Yung held the board meeting and passed the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution, dishonesty on the part of Vos in his withdrawal of the funds from the IBA account could readily be inferred.</p>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  Yung did not dispute withdrawing the three sums of $200,000, $30,000 and $33,310 to pay himself without Vosâ consent.  He saidthat the funds were paid into Goldmarkâs âcash accountâ or âcash bankâ to be used mostly for transactions in relation tothe company.  He could produce no books or ledgers kept in respect of that cash account.  He said that the cash account was keptin his computer.  There were no contemporaneous printouts and no supporting documents.  Such a cash account could be made up or alteredat any time.  I give no weight to his evidence.  He bears the burden of proving he was entitled to be reimbursed the three sum ofmoney, which he failed. </p>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  Yung did not deny that on 21 July 1993 he issued a cheque to Iris Leung from Goldmarkâs account with IBA in the amount of $30,000. Iris Leung was an employee of VIP Media and was at all material time on the payroll of VIP Media.  There is no dispute that Goldmarkhad never paid Iris Leung salary prior to 21 July 1993.  Yung explained that he felt Iris Leung deserved to be paid a salary.  Evenif Iris Leung deserved to be paid a salary in view of her increased contribution to Goldmark, Yung was not entitled to act unilaterally. He had never consulted Vos or obtained Vosâ consent for such payment.  The very secretive and improper way in which the 1<sup>st</sup> 1993 Resolution was passed and the payment was made suggest that Yungâs reason for making the payment was not genuine.  He hasto account to Goldmark for his misappropriation of that sum of money.</p>    <p><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  Accordingly, Yung is liable to refund $293,310 which he misappropriated from Goldmarkâs account with IBA.</p>    <p class="heading">Yungâs appropriation of $90,000 from World Champ</p>    <p><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  Yung instructed Messrs Wong Shum &amp; Co. (âMessrs WSâ) to act for the Companies in the sale of the Units to Cheung.  Uponcompletion of the sale and purchase of the Units, part of the proceeds of sale in the amount of $90,000 was payable to the Companies. On 10 August 1993, Yung instructed Messrs WS to pay the said sum to Goldmark, presumably believing that he could withdraw the moneyif it was paid into Goldmarkâs account with IBA.  However, on the same day, on the instruction of Vos, Messrs JSM instructed IBAnot to release any funds from Goldmarkâs account without Vosâ prior written approval.  On 11 August 1993, Yung instructed MessrsWS to pay the sum $90,000 to World Champ instead.  Upon deposit of the said cheque from Messrs WS into World Champâs account withIBA, Yung withdrew the money to pay himelf.</p>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  Yung did not dispute the above facts.  His defence is that World Champ was indebted to Mrs Yung in relation to its acquisition ofUnit 1A for a long time and the loan was repayable on demand.  Pursuant to the instruction of Mrs Yung, he issued a cheque payableto himself as he believed he was entitled to receive this cheque for and on behalf of Mrs Yung.  Of this funds, $30,000 was loanedto Goldmark on 9 August 1993 as shown in Goldmarkâs cash account.</p>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  Yungâs defence is a whole load of nonsense.  The funds used by World Champ in the purchase of Unit 1A all came from Goldmark. It might include loans from Yung to Goldmark.  But there was no evidence whatever of any loan from Mrs Yung.  Whatever money MrsYung might have used in the purchase of Unit 1A, was used to pay Sonatina under the Sonatina/World Champ agreement when World Champwas under her wings.  She was then purchasing Unit 1A for herself.  When World Champ became Yungâs and Vosâ corporate vehiclefor holding Unit 1A, all funds for the purchase were clearly shown to have come from Goldmark, the two deposits totaling $570,000Vosâ deposit of $700,000 into Fudoâs account and Goldmarkâs loan of $1.5 million from Rabobank.  There was also a loan of $500,000from Yung which was secured by Goldmarkâs cheque number 505802 which was then replaced by cheque number 505836.  I assume in favourof Yung that this sum was used to pay the two deposits so as to avoid a double counting.  Whatever money World Champ might have benefitedfrom Mrs Yungâs payments when World Champ was her nominee must have somehow been cleared between herself and Yung or between Goldmarkand Yung because Goldmark had fully provided the purchase price of $2.7 million.  This shows how gallantly Yung was trying to pullwool over the Courtâs eyes, not to mention his dishonesty in forging cheque number 505802 and attempt to cash that cheque whenthe loan had already been repaid by cheque number 505836.  I reject Yungâs evidence.  He is liable to make good the amount of $90,000which he misappropriated from World Champ.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion for Misappropriation Claims</p>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  In conclusion, Yung is liable to repay the Plaintiff $416,990 under the Misappropriation Claims ($19,500 + $14,180 + $200,000 +$30,000 + $33,310 + $30,000 + $90,000).

The2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution and 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution authorising the sale of the Units were invalid.  Yung had no authority to sell the Units.  The Units were sold toYung and Mrs Yung with Cheung, Global Fair and Avant Garde as their nominees to conceal their identities.  Yung was in breach ofhis duty to act in good faith and in the interest of the Companies, the âno conflict ruleâ and the âno profit ruleâ.  TheUnits were sold at an undervalue as part of Yungâs attempt to strip the Companies of their assets after the disputes had arisenbetween him and Vos.  As for the case against Mrs Yung, judgment on liability was entered against her.  The outstanding issue isassessment of damages.</p>    <p class="heading">Yungâs case</p>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  Yung denied that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Resolution and 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution were invalid.  He argues that proper notice of board meeting to consider the resolutions had been given to Vos, butVos failed to attend.  He denied that the Units were sold to himself or at an undervalue.  His further defence is that at the timehe believed he had no way out and the auction of the Units was the only way to save Goldmark.  His case is that by July 1993, Goldmarkwas in severe financial difficulties due to the operation of Jade Rainbow and Animal Health Centre which placed huge burden on Goldmarkâscash flow.  As a result of his dispute with Vos, Vos colluded with Rabobank to destroy Goldmark by freezing its account and overdraftfacilities and demanding repayment of all indebtedness.  He was desperate.  To save Goldmarkâs business and to protect the Unitsfrom being force sold by Rabobank, he considered the only way out was to sell the Units as quickly as possible, even if the priceobtained was just sufficient to cover Goldmarkâs indebtedness to Rabobank.  He therefore passed the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution and 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution to authorise the sale of the Units.  The sale was a genuine business decision made <i>bona fide</i> in the interest of the Companies.  Even if he was in breach of the âno conflict ruleâ, the rule should be relaxed as he was thelegal owner of 50% of the issued shares in the Companies and the equitable owner of the remaining 50% and the major creditor of theCompanies.</p>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  Lastly, Yung had a counterclaim against the Companies for monies which he had advanced to the Companies and any claim against himcan be set off against those advances.</p>    <p class="heading">The approach and issues</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a>  The Plaintiffâs pleaded case is breach of fiduciary duty and not merely breach of duty of care as director.  The Plaintiff iseffectively alleging fraud on the part of Yung and Cheung.  There were numerous factual issues raised by Yung and Cheung.  Many wereabout competition in the pet food market, which I do not think are relevant.  I shall only deal with those issues which are relevant. Essentially, Yung and Cheung submit that the decision to sell the Units by auction was a <i>bona fide</i> commercial decision made in the interest of the Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  Yung and Cheung argue that the decision to dispose of the Units was a business decision to meet creditorâs, namely Rabobankâs,demand and to avoid imminent threat of winding up of the Companies.  The Companies had no choice then but to sell the Units.  Cheungcorrectly submits that the court does not pass judgment on the merits or demerits of management decisions of directors and that thecourt only determines judicially whether directors of a company have breached their fiduciary duty to act in good faith and in theinterests of the company as a whole.  In approaching the question whether a director was acting <i>bona fide</i>, the courtâs approach is as follows.  The court will presume the directors acted in good faith and will give the best considerationto the subjective views of the directors.  If the directorsâ decision was one which a reasonable board could consider to be inthe interests of the company then the court presumes that the directors acted <i>bona fide</i> and had good grounds for their decision: see <i>Tett v Phoenix Property and Investment Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20BCLC%20599" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] BCLC 599</a> at 621, per Vinelott J.  However, in the absence of relevant considerations, good faith by itself is insufficient to satisfy thecourt that the directors have discharged the duty to act <i>bona fide</i> in the interests of a company.  The test used to judge whether an act is <i>bona fide</i> in the interest of a company is whether a hypothetical director who, acquainted with the facts and circumstances and credited withintelligence, could reasonably have acted in the way the director did.  I shall approach Yungâs evidence with the above principlesin mind.</p>    <p><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a>  Essentially, the Plaintiffâs complaint is that Yung sold the Units at substantial undervalue to his own nominees.  Sale at anundervalue is strong evidence of negligence, but the Plaintiffâs pleaded case is not negligence.  Negligence is not to be equatedwith breach of fiduciary duty: see <i>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20Ch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] Ch 1</a>, per Millett LJ, as he then was.  Under the above principle, the court will not normally question a sale even at undervalue, if itis a <i>bona fide</i> business decision and the court proceeds with the presumption that it is.  However, where the sale was at such a gross undervalueas to suggest lack of good faith, some inference of impropriety could be drawn.  That opens the question whether the decision wasa <i>bona fide</i> business decision.  This is particularly so, if the sale at undervalue was to the director or his nominees.  If the sale was nota <i>bona fide</i> business decision, the director was in breach of his duty to act in good faith and in the interest of the company.  If the sale wasalso a sale to himself or his nominees, he was also in breach of the âno conflict ruleâ and the âno profit ruleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  The foremost issue is whether the Units were sold at an undervalue.  If they were not, the Plaintiffâs case cannot even get offthe ground.</p>    <p><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  The second issue is whether Yung had given Vos notice of board meeting to consider the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution and 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution.  Though I have already found that the two resolutions were invalid and that neither Goldmark nor World Champ hadany validly appointed directors at the time, whether notice of meeting had been given to Vos goes a long way in proving whether Yungacted with any fraudulent intention or whether the decision to sell was a <i>bona fide</i> one.</p>    <p><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  The third issue is whether Yung was desperate for the reasons he gave.</p>    <p><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  The fourth issue is whether the auction was a sham.</p>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  The fifth issue is whether Cheung and her companies were nominees of Yung.  That calls for an investigation into the source of fundsof Cheungâs purchase of the Units.  This issue will be fully canvassed in Section (F) when dealing with the Sale of Units Claimagainst Cheung and her group of companies (paragraphs 390 - 412).  For the purpose of this section, my finding is in the affirmative.</p>    <p><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  The last issue is whether in the light of the finding on the above issues, that Yungâs decision to sell Units by auction was agenuine business decision <i>bona fide</i> in the interest of the Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  Some of the issues relevant to the claim against Yung and his group were intertwined with those relevant to the claim against Cheungand her group of companies.  I shall first make finding of fact in relation to those factual issues and then deal with the claimagainst Yung and the claim against Cheung and her group of companies separately. </p>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  The factual background is as set out in paragraphs 91 to 103 above.  The followings are the further finding of fact relevant tothis claim against Yung, Cheung and their related companies.</p>    <p class="heading">Valuation of the Units</p>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  Before considering the partiesâ evidence and submissions on valuation, I shall make a few observations on the methodology in valuation. The methodology adopted by Vigers in the valuation reports presented to Court is what is commonly called the direct comparison method. That method is usually adopted by valuers and is preferred especially if suitable comparables are available.  The idea and principlebehind this method is simple and logical.  The basic principle is to compare like with like, in terms of time, size, location andsuch factors as are relevant to the particular subject matter for the valuation.  The method involves calculating the unit rate insale and purchase transactions of similar properties made at about the same time as the value date of the subject property.  Thevaluer then makes adjustment for size, time lag, location and any other factors which the valuer considers appropriate and calculatesthe adjusted unit rates.  Then, the valuer applies a weighting factor to the adjusted unit rates and calculates the unit rate forthe subject property from which he assesses the valuation.  If comparable transactions in the same building are available, they arepreferred.  Fewer adjustments will have to be made and the weighting factor may also be dispensed with altogether.  In such a case,the valuer only needs to make adjustments for size and time lag.  Adjustment for time lag is usually made by reference to the JonesLang Wootton Capital Value Index (âJLW Indexâ).  The index shows the fluctuation in property value in various districts in HongKong at different times.  It is regarded as a reliable guide for adjusting property value over the period of time as covered by theJLW Index.  It is also accepted by the surveying profession that the larger the size of the property, the lower is its unit rateper square foot.  The adjustment usually ranges from 5% to 15%.  Except for adjustment for time lag for which a valuer may be guidedby the JLW Index, the other adjustments are essentially based on the intuition and experience of the valuer. </p>    <p><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  In September 1993, about two months after the auction, Vigers also prepared a valuation report of the Units at the instruction ofthe Official Receiver (â1993 Vigers Reportâ).  In November 2002, the Plaintiffâs then solicitors, Messrs Stephenson Harwood&amp; Lo instructed Vigers to assess the open market value of the Units as at various dates for the purpose of this litigation. Togher prepared a very comprehensive report with a covering letter consisting of forty-four pages (â2002 Vigers Reportâ).  Togherwas not available to give evidence.  Instead, the Plaintiff called Varty who is also a professional surveyor of thirty years standing. Varty has given expert evidence in the High Court and Lands Tribunal.  I accept his evidence as expert.  He reviewed the 1993 VigersReport and 2002 Vigers Report, a valuation letter and a valuation certificate prepared by Vigers in respect of the Units. </p>    <p><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  The 2002 Vigers Report described the Units, the location, the encumbrances and the Crown lease.  From the registered floor plan,Vigers calculated the saleable area of Unit 1A to be 705 square feet with a storeroom of 146 square feet and a flat roof of 105 squarefeet and the saleable area of Unit 1D to be 910 square feet.  It gave the following valuations:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0">            <tr>                <td width="131"><u>Date</u> </td>                <td width="149">Valuation for<u><br />                Unit 1A</u> </td>                <td width="149">Valuation for<br />                <u>Unit 1D</u> </td>                <td width="140">Unit rate per <u>square foot</u> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="131">08/11/1991</td>                <td width="149"> </td>                <td width="149">$2,366,000</td>                <td width="140">$2,600</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="131">28/04/1992</td>                <td width="149">$2,823,000</td>                <td width="149"> </td>                <td width="140">-</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="131">16/07/1993</td>                <td width="149">$3,821,000</td>                <td width="149">$4,004,000</td>                <td width="140">$4,400</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="131">24/11/1993</td>                <td width="149">$4,039,000</td>                <td width="149">$4,232,000</td>                <td width="140">$4,650</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="131">12/11/2002</td>                <td width="149">$1,303,000</td>                <td width="149">$1,365,000</td>                <td width="140">$1,500</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>The unit rate is calculated based on the valuation for Unit 1D which contained no non-saleable area.  Vigers assessed the value ofUnit 1A and Unit 1D at $3.821 million and $4.004 million respectively as at 16 July 1993, i.e. the date of the auction of the twounits.</p>    <p><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  Presumably there were no transactions in respect of large units on the first floor of Thomson Commercial Building available as comparables,Vigers referred to comparable transactions of smaller units in higher floors.  Except for the valuations for 12 November 2002 inwhich four comparables were referred to, Vigers referred to eight comparables of higher floors and smaller sizes with a unit rateranging from $4,183 to $5,205 per square foot.  Specifically, it referred to the sale of Unit 1A by Global Fair to Start Win whichwas not a genuine but a controlled sale by Cheung on 3 November 1993 at a unit rate of $4,606.  There are non-saleable areas in Unit1A, namely the flat roof and storeroom which make simple calculation difficult.  As Togher was not called, I have no idea about thebasis of his valuation of Unit 1A.  But I can safely assume, as suggested by Varty, that Togher adopted the same unit rate in respectof saleable area in Unit 1A and Unit 1D and gave a discount for the unit rate for the non-saleable area.  On that basis, I assumeVigers adopted a unit rate of $4,400 per square foot in valuing the Units as at 16 July 1993.  </p>    <p><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  The 1993 Vigers Report and covering letter consisted of twelve pages.  It is the usual valuation report which this Court is familiarwith.  It described the Units, the location and the Crown lease.  It classified Thomson Commercial Building as a grade B office buildingat Wanchai where the demand for commercial space appeared to be moderate.  In the report, Vigers gave a slightly different floorarea for the Units.  Based on the floor plans, Vigers assessed the saleable area of Unit 1A to be 716 square feet with a store roomof 143 square feet and a flat roof of 139 square feet and the saleable area of Unit 1D to be of 858 square feet.  The report referredto four comparables on higher floors of smaller sizes ranging from 262 square feet to 274 square feet transacted between Februaryand June 1993.  Those four comparables were also used in the 2002 Vigers Report.  The unit rate of those four comparables rangedfrom $4,015 to $4,599 per square foot.  Vigers assessed the valuation of the Units at $3.4 million each and gave a forced sale valueof $2.55 million for each property, a discount of 25% off the open market value. </p>    <p><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a>  Varty agreed with those valuations.  He explained Vigersâ valuation as follows.  He assumed that Vigers calculated a unit rateof $4,329 per square foot from the four comparables and then made a minus 10% adjustment for size as the Units are larger in sizethan the comparables, thereby reaching an adjusted unit rate of $3,896 per square foot.  He thought that probably Vigers made noadjustment for time as the JLW Index was flat between the time of the various comparable transactions and July 1993.  Varty opinedthat by applying that adjusted unit rate to the saleable area and a unit rate discounted by one-sixth for the non-saleable area,Vigers probably reached the valuation of Unit 1D at $3.34 million and the valuation of Unit 1A at $3.44 million which Vigers thenaveraged out making a valuation of $3.4 million for each property.  He disagreed with Cheungâs suggestion that adjustment shouldalso be made for height.  He thought that height was not a very significant factor for commercial buildings in the type of environmentas Thomson Commercial Building or at most a minus 5% adjustment might be given for a comparable at the highest floor of the building.</p>    <p><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a>  The same result would be reached by using the reverse calculation method which is probably simpler.  Adopting that method, I assumeVigers adopted the unit rate for Unit 1D as the unit rate for the saleable area of Unit 1A, i.e. $3,963 (i.e. $3,400,000 Â¸ 858)and allot the balance of the value of Unit 1A to the non-saleable area, which would then give a unit rate of $1,995 for the non-saleablearea (i.e. ($3,400,000 â$3,963 x 716) Â¸ (143 + 139)).  The discount on the unit rate for the non-saleable area is about 50%, whichappeared reasonable.  The valuation for Unit 1A could therefore be explained on the basis that Vigers adopted the same unit ratefor saleable area as that of Unit 1D and a 50% discount on the unit rate for the non-saleable area for Unit 1A.  The overall differenceis small, but the logic is more appealing and involves fewer loose ends than the method suggested by Varty.</p>    <p><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  At the instruction of Rabobank, Vigers also issued a letter with a certificate valuing Unit 1A at $2.6 million as at 24 May 1993(âvaluation letterâ) and an abbreviated report valuing Unit 1D at $3.4 million as at 7 June 1993 (âabbreviated reportâ). Those valuations were obtained by Rabobank in connection with Goldmarkâs application for banking facilities should Yung take overVosâ shareholdings in the Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  Varty opined that the valuations contained in Vigersâ valuation letter and abbreviated report were of little value.  Such valuationswere requested by banks.  They were known as mortgage valuations and were done verbally and usually over the telephone within a matterof minutes.  The valuations are usually made by trainees or junior staff by the dozens in a day.  Details or floor plans were notavailable to the valuer.  The valuer never inspected the property.  The valuer merely referred to immediately available transactionswhich they had.</p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a>  Having taken into consideration all the points raised by Yung and particularly by Cheung, Varty calculated the unit rate of comparablesto be $4,620 per square foot.  He made a minus 10% adjustment for size.  He is of the opinion that the value of Unit 1A was $3.61million and Unit 1D was $3.78 million as at July 1993.  Allowing for some adjustment for height of not more than 5%, which he wouldhave thought unnecessary, he was prepared to accept the valuation contained in the 1993 Vigers Report which was lower than that inthe 2002 Vigers Report prepared for the purpose of this litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a>  Cheung raised numerous criticisms against Vartyâs evidence.  Except for her argument on the adjustment for size, none of her criticismshas any substance.  Cheung produced some transactions in Thomson Commercial Building between 29 July 1996 and 1 September 1997 andargues that based on those transactions, adjustment for size should be between 22% and 32%.  She submits that Vartyâs adjustmentof 10% was grossly inadequate and that Varty failed to explain her data.  Varty was thrusted with her data under cross-examinationand had no opportunity to really consider and analyze the data as he otherwise would have had he been fairly given the data in advanceto respond to.  This is not the way to approach expert evidence.  Varty replied that he was skeptical of statistical analysis ofthat nature.  He said that those data did not show the general trend for Thomson Commercial Building and that he would not be surprisedto see contrary statistics but he had no opportunity to review all relevant reports and transactions.  He suggested there might beother adjustments such as time and that he was skeptical of the transactions in 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a>  I think the way in which the data was presented to Varty was unfair.  Had Varty been shown the data and argument in advance, hewould have been able to examine other transactions during the period and verify if there were other transactions which showed a differenttrend and in particular if the transactions shown by Cheung were just hand picked ones to advance her argument.  Two other pointsraised by Varty were also relevant.  He mentioned about adjustment in time and the frantic transactions in 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a>  Cheung quoted the transaction of the large unit on 29 July 1996 and then a number of transactions of small units from 5 July throughto 31 December 1996.  She also quoted transaction of another large unit on 7 January 1997 and then a number of transactions of smallunits from 26 March 1997 through to 1 September 1997.  Based on those transactions, she calculated the unit rate of a large unitwas 68% of that of small units in 1996 and 78% of small units in 1997 or an adjustment of minus 22% to 32%.  It is common knowledgethat the property market was rising from 1996 through to the last quarter of 1997 and the Court can take judicial notice of thisfact.  The property market in the second half year of 1997 was particularly frantic.  The JLW Index for office property in Wanchaifor 1996 and 1997 were as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0">            <tr>                <td width="140" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="112" valign="top"><b>January</b> </td>                <td width="112" valign="top"><u>April</u> </td>                <td width="103" valign="top"><u>July</u> </td>                <td width="103" valign="top"><u>October</u> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="140" valign="top">1996</td>                <td width="112" valign="top">  757.5</td>                <td width="112" valign="top">  771.9</td>                <td width="103" valign="top">  813.1</td>                <td width="103" valign="top">  834.8</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="140" valign="top">1997</td>                <td width="112" valign="top">1,013.7</td>                <td width="112" valign="top">1,046.4</td>                <td width="103" valign="top">1,087.7</td>                <td width="103" valign="top">1,011.1</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="140" valign="top">Annual increase</td>                <td width="112" valign="top">33.82%</td>                <td width="112" valign="top">35.56%</td>                <td width="103" valign="top">33.77%</td>                <td width="103" valign="top">21.12%</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>Before Cheung could make the proposition she suggested, she has to adjust the unit rate of the small units to the notional unit rateon the same date as the transaction of the large unit which she wished to compare.  The transactions in the small units were allat a much later date.  In a rising market as the JLW Index showed, time alone would account for 10% to 18% increase in unit ratein a six months period.  In a broad brush, this would knock down Cheungâs adjustment from the range of 22% to 32% to the rangeof 4% to 22%.  Thus Vartyâs adjustment of 10% or my general observation of 15% from other cases I am aware of is not inappropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  I shall now take a step further to work on Cheungâs data by applying the JLW Index to adjust the unit rate of the small unitsto the notional unit rate as at the date of transaction of the large unit in the following table:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0">            <tr>                <td width="93">Date</td>                <td width="75"><u>unit rate</u> </td>                <td width="65">JLW <u>Index</u> </td>                <td width="93">percentage change<br />                <u>in index</u> </td>                <td width="75">adjusted<br />                <u>unit rate</u> </td>                <td width="82">average adjusted<br />                <u>unit rate</u> </td>                <td width="91">percentage<br />                <u>adjustment</u> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">29/07/1996</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$3,262</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">  813.1</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">-</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$3,262</td>                <td width="82" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="91" valign="top">-21.30%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">05/07/1996</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,703</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">  813.1</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">-</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,703</td>                <td width="82" valign="top">$4,145</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">20/12/1996</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,934</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">1013.7</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">19.79%</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$3,959</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">31/12/1996</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,702</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">1013.7</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">19.79%</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$3,771</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">07/01/1997</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,003</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">1013.7</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">-</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,003</td>                <td width="82" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="91" valign="top">-17.73%</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">26/03/1997</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$5,239</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">1046.4</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">3.12%</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$5,076</td>                <td width="82" valign="top">$4,866</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">27/06/1997</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,826</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">1087.7</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">6.8%</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,498</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">30/07/1997</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$5,019</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">1087.7</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">6.8%</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,678</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">31/07/1997</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$5,212</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">1087.7</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">6.8%</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$4,858</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="93" valign="top">01/09/1997</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$5,205</td>                <td width="65" valign="top">1011.1</td>                <td width="93" valign="top">-0.26%</td>                <td width="75" valign="top">$5,219</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>The JLW Index is only available quarterly.  In doing the calculation above, I only selected the JLW Index which was closer to thetransaction in question.  I could have made some adjustment to the index.  I do not consider that necessary as it would be futilebecause, as Varty said, I am not sure if I have the data of all the transactions during the year.  Furthermore, the purpose of thetable is to show the qualitative picture to weigh Cheungâs submission.  The table is not intended to show the quantitative valuesand, not being an expert myself, I do not intend to rely on the quantitative values.  The above table shows that after adjustingfor time lag, the adjustment for size is between minus 17.73% and minus 21.30%.  Another observation is that the transaction on 05/07/1996is out of line with the other two transactions in small units in the same year and should be rejected.  If that transaction is takenout, the average adjusted unit rate would be $3,865 and the adjustment for the 1997 transactions would be minus 15.6%.  This is inline with my observation that the usual adjustment for size is between 5% and 15%. </p>    <p><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  As a non-expert, the effort Cheung spent in presenting her argument is admirable, but her argument cannot withstand logical analysisand is only to be rejected.  But, having critically examined the data, I agree that Vartyâs adjustment of minus 10% for size isinadequate.  The appropriate adjustment should have been minus 15%.</p>    <p><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  Both Yung and Cheung advanced the argument that in late 1980s or early 1990s, a lot of factory premises were being converted foruse as office premises and as a result users of grade C office, such as those in Thomson Commercial Building, moved to factory premisescausing a drastic reduction in the price of grade C offices, including the Units.  Vartyâs answer is that the event was irrelevant. Those factory premises were in North Point extending eastward and there were no factory premises in Wanchai where Thomson CommercialBuilding is situated.  Users looking for office space in Wanchai would not be interested in accommodation in North Point.  Besidesthe office accommodation converted from factory premises were of sizes ranging from 10,000 square feet upwards.  Those accommodationhas no effect on the demand of small office accommodation in Wanchai.  I agree with Vartyâs opinion.  Besides, the valuations preparedby Vigers were based on real transactions in Thomson Commercial Building.  Those transactions reflected all the relevant considerationsa buyer for such accommodation would have, including the one raised by Yung and Cheung if it has any bearing.</p>    <p><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  Cheung attacks Vartyâs opinion as not a genuine professional opinion.  She said Varty was unable to inform the Court how the openmarket value of $3.4 million for Unit 1A and Unit 1D as pleaded in the Re-re-re-amended Statement of Claim was arrived at.  I disagree. My summary of the evidence above precisely showed how Varty arrived at the valuation of over $3.4 million for each property buthe was prepared to accept the lower value as pleaded or as assessed in the 1993 Vigers Report.</p>    <p><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a>  Cheung argues that Varty was unable to explain the discrepancies in valuations made in the 1993 Vigers Report, 2002 Vigers Report,valuation letter and abbreviated valuation.  He was not the maker of those documents.  He could not have known how the makers reachedtheir valuations.  But I think Varty has stated his professional opinion.  He has shown by his own calculation using the data inthe 1993 Vigers Report that the valuation in that report was reasonable and he rejected the valuation in the 2002 Vigers Report. He has given his professional opinion why the valuation letter and the abbreviated valuation were unreliable. </p>    <p><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a>  Cheung argues that Varty was instructed by the Plaintiffâs solicitors, whereas the 2002 Vigers Report was requested by the solicitorsfor the Official Receiver.  She argues that no one knows what was the instruction given to Vigers and the methodology used by Vigersin arriving at the valuation.  She criticized Varty for not having discussed the 2002 Vigers Reports with Togher who wrote the report. There is no substance in those arguments.  The instructions given to Vigers under the 1993 Vigers Report and 2002 Vigers Reportwere clearly set out in the reports.  Varty is an expert in surveying and knows of the relevant principles in valuation.  He explainedthe two reports and the methodology clearly. </p>    <p><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a>  Cheung raised other criticisms such as Varty had never worked with Vigers, had not received any information from Vigers about thevaluation and about how they prepared the valuation letter and abbreviated valuation for Rabobank, had not been shown the internalmemorandum from Rabobank, had not visited the properties, etc.  I do not think I need to respond to those unfounded criticisms thanto say I reject them all.</p>    <p><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a>  Varty fully understood his primary duty was to assist the Court rather than to advance his clientâs case.  In the end, Varty didnot prefer the valuation in the 2002 Vigers Report.  He gave his opinion in a fair and responsible manner.  He gave an unbiased opinionwhich fairly favoured the Defendants by preferring the lower valuation contained in the 1993 Vigers Report.  Save for his opinionabout the quantum of adjustment for size, I accept his opinion.</p>    <p><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a>  Based on the data in the 1993 Vigers Report and the two other comparables available from the 2002 Vigers Report, Varty assessedthe value of Unit 1A and Unit 1D at $3.61 million and $3.78 million respectively.  He allowed a 10% discount for size which I considerinadequate.  If an adjustment of minus 15% is adopted, the valuation would become $3.43 million and $3.59 million respectively. Both valuations are higher than that given in the 1993 Vigers Report which has been pleaded by the Plaintiff.  It is not known whatadjustment for size Togher allowed when arriving at the valuation.  On the data available to me, it must have been more than minus15%.  Togher might also have made a negative adjustment for height which Varty did not consider necessary for commercial buildingin the kind of environment in which Thomson Commercial Building stood.  In any event, the valuation in the 1993 Vigers Report couldnot have erred.</p>    <p><a name="p237" class="para" id="p237">237.</a>  It is also interesting to note that in November 1993, Cheung caused Global Fair to transfer Unit 1A to Start Win at a purportedconsideration of $4 million.  While Cheung says that the transaction was a fictitious one and the purchase price of $4 million wassuggested by the bank officer in order to obtain a mortgage loan of $2 million, the loan would not have been approved without a professionalvaluation report called for by the bank.  The JLW Index for January 1993 and January 1994 were 602.1 and 830.0 respectively, whichrepresents a monthly increase of 3.15% during the period.  On a very rough basis, this means an increase of 14.2% during the fourand half months from mid July to late November 1992.  Working forward from the July 1993 valuation of $3.4 million for Unit 1A, thevaluation in the end of November 1993 would have been $3.88 million.  That suggests the purchase price of $4 million was only 3%over valued which was by no means excessive.  Working backward from the purchase price in late November 1992, the valuation of Unit1A in July 1992 would have been $3.43.  That is consistent with the valuation in the 1993 Vigers Report.</p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a>  In the same month, HSBC granted an overdraft facility of $2.5 million to New Champion secured against Global Fairâs mortgage onUnit 1D.  Given the well known cautious approach of this top Hong Kong bank, the facility granted would not have exceeded 60% ofthe professional valuation of Unit 1D.  That suggested HSBC acted on a valuation of Unit 1D at above $4.16 million.  This mortgagesupported the valuation in the 1993 Vigers Report.</p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a>  In conclusion, I accept the valuation of the Units in the 1993 Vigers Report.  I find that the open market value of the Units asat the date of the auction was $3.4 million each.  I also accept Vigersâ opinion that the forced sale value for Unit 1A and Unit1D were both $2.55 million in July 1993.  On the basis of this valuation, the sale was at a discount of 37.5% off the open marketvalue or 17% discount off the forced sale value.  The sale was at a gross undervalue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Yungâs knowledge of the invalidity of Iris Leungâs appointment as director of Goldmark</p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a>  In Section (B), I make the finding that Iris Leungâs appointment as director of Goldmark lapsed before passing the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolutions.  I now turn to consider whether Yung had knowledge of the invalidity of her appointment.  On the facts, it wasYung who raised the question of Iris Leungâs appointment to cover his absence from Hong Kong.  The minute was written in simpleEnglish, which Yung could have no difficulties in understanding.  He must know that was the terms of her appointment and that herappointment lapsed upon the first directorsâ meeting on his return. </p>    <p><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a>  Furthermore, on 23 June 1993 he instructed Messrs HLLY to demand on behalf of Goldmark, Vos and Kensway to repay certain sums owing. This prompted Messrs JSM to write to Messrs HLLY to challenge their authority to represent Goldmark.  In their letter dated 12 July1993, a few days after passing the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution, Messrs JSM expressed the undisputable legal opinion that Iris Leungâs appointment have lapsed because no annualgeneral meeting had been held for over eighteen months since the incorporation of Goldmark.  Yung admitted having been show thatletter by Messrs HLLY and asked to produce the 1991 Resolution authorising Iris Leungâs appointment to Messrs HLLY for legal advice. Neither did he produce the 1991 Resolution to Messrs HLLY for legal advice nor did he instruct Messrs HLLY to seek a copy from MessrsJSM.  Yung ignored both the legal opinion expressed by Messrs JSM in their letter dated 12 July 1993 and his own solicitorsâ adviceto produce the 1991 Resolution for their consideration.  The irresistible inference that could be drawn from his conduct is thathe knew the terms of Iris Leungâs appointment, that the appointment had lapsed and that he did not want to expose the invalidityof her appointment by producing the 1991 Resolution to his solicitors. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether notice of board meeting to consider the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution and 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution had been given to Vos</p>    <p><a name="p242" class="para" id="p242">242.</a>  Vosâ evidence was that he was not served with any notice of board meeting for the purpose of passing the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution and 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution to sell the Units.  Vos could not recall having been served any such notice.  He certainly would have recalled ifhe had received the notice as the purpose of the meetings was to sell the only and major asset of the Companies.  He must have attendedthe meetings to protect his interest or do something to prevent the sale from occurring.  It is difficult for someone to prove thenegative.  But, I think Vos has raised sufficient evidence to shift the legal burden of proof of this issue to Yung.</p>    <p><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a>  Yungâs evidence was that he had discussed with Alfred Hau of Messrs HLLY about Goldmarkâs urgent need to sell the Units in viewof Rabobankâs demand.  He told Alfred Hau how Vos betrayed Goldmark and that he was worried Vos would not attend the meetings forthe purpose of passing the two resolutions to authorize the sale of the Units.  Then Alfred Hau told Yung that he had done a companysearch and found that Iris Leung was a director of Goldmark and that as long as Iris Leung and Yung attended the meetings, they couldresolve to sell the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p244" class="para" id="p244">244.</a>  Then according to Yung, Alfred Hau told him that the meeting must be arranged in the proper manner.  Alfred Hau advised him of theproper procedure and in particular about service of the notice by posting it on the door of Vosâ registerd address.  Alfred Hauthen drafted the notice of meeting for Goldmark and gave it to Yung to serve on Vos.  Yung then instructed Frankie Au to serve iton Vos at Vosâ residence in Robinson Road.  Alfred Hau also undertook to prepare all the documentations, board minutes and introducedYung to Top Auctioneer.</p>    <p><a name="p245" class="para" id="p245">245.</a>  To sell the sole and substantial asset of a company is obviously an important and serious matter.  In view of the hostility whichhad developed between Vos and Yung at the time, it is extremely unlikely that a prudent solicitor advising his client dealing witha hostile opponent on such an important matter under such precarious circumstances and volunteering to draft the notice of meetingwould not have volunteered to serve the notice by his staff as well but would have left it to his client to serve the notice.  Aprudent solicitor would have arranged service by his competent staff who is experienced with the procedure and for an affidavit tobe prepared in case litigation arises.  No explanation was given why Messrs HLLY did not serve the notice to Vos.</p>    <p><a name="p246" class="para" id="p246">246.</a>  No copy of the notice of meeting was disclosed by Yung.  Frankie Au was not called to prove service of the notices.  Frankie Auis the common law brother-in-law of Mrs Yung.  No explanation was given as to the failure to call him to give evidence.  This castsserious doubts on whether such notice had been served. </p>    <p><a name="p247" class="para" id="p247">247.</a>  Alfred Hau was not called to give evidence to support Yungâs version of events.  No advice or attendance notes from Messrs HLLYhas been produce to support Yungâs evidence.  Both Yung and Cheung were well familiar with the existence of such attendance notesin Messrs JSM and Messrs WS.  No explanation for his failure to call Alfred Hau and to produce the attendance notes was given byYung.  Again, this casts serious doubts on whether such advice had been received and the truthfulness of Yungâs evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p248" class="para" id="p248">248.</a>  Similarly, any prudent solicitor would also have served a copy of the notice on Messrs JSM who was then acting for Vos.  Yung acceptedthat he had not caused a copy of the notice to be served on Messrs JSM.</p>    <p><a name="p249" class="para" id="p249">249.</a>  Then, lastly, Yung admitted that he had not serve a copy of the resolutions passed on Vos or Messrs JSM either.</p>    <p><a name="p250" class="para" id="p250">250.</a>  It was argued by Cheung on behalf of Yung that Yung had told Vos many times about the sale of the Units.  However, the only documentaryevidence Cheung could refer to was an internal memorandum from Messrs JSM in which Vosâ solicitor quoted his telephone conversationwith Yung on 16 June 1993.  In the memorandum, Yung was reported to have reiterated his view that he would not be prepared to enterinto any formal settlement agreement until he received written evidence that Unit 1A held by World Champ would be sold.  But thatwas not notice to Vos that Yung was going to sell Unit 1A and the manner of sale. </p>    <p><a name="p251" class="para" id="p251">251.</a>  I think Yungâs evidence is wholly incredible.  His conduct was not consistent with someone who was acting on proper legal advice. He did not call his advising solicitor to support his evidence.  More importantly, his evidence about having sought legal advicefrom Alfred Hau is contradicted by the evidence he gave during his examination by the Official Receiver.  On that occasion, he saidthat he had not consulted his solicitors for advice about the auction and how to pay back the mortgage loan demanded by Rabobank. His failure to call Frankie Au and Alfred Hau is something which weighs heavily against his credibility.  The circumstances he describedwere improbable.  I think Vos would have to have some degree of mental disorder not to attend the meetings or not to do anythingto prevent the meetings from being held, if he had received the notice.  I accept Vosâ evidence that he had not been served withany notice of board meetings for the purpose of passing the two resolutions.</p>    <p><a name="p252" class="para" id="p252">252.</a>  Yung must have appreciated the importance of giving notice of such meetings to Vos.  If not, he would not have tried to tender theevidence, though which I rejected, that he was acting on legal advice.  The meetings were to discuss a very important matter, namelyselling the most valuable asset of the Companies.  At the time he was at logger heads with Vos.  His failure could not have beenaccidental or due to an oversight.  It must have been his deliberate intention to conceal the two resolutions from Vos so that hecould dispose of the Units without Vosâ knowledge or intervention.  This casts a very bad light on the rest of his evidence inrelation to this claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Goldmark was in financial difficulties due to the operation of Jade Rainbow or Animal Health Centre</p>    <p><a name="p253" class="para" id="p253">253.</a>  Yung contended that Jade Rainbow and Animal Health Centre were operating at substantial loss each month, which resulted in a severeburden on Goldmarkâs cash flow and placed Goldmark in financial difficulties.  This, he alleged, was part of the reason for sellingthe Units.</p>    <p><a name="p254" class="para" id="p254">254.</a>  However, Yungâs allegation was just an empty assertion which is not supported by any documentary evidence.  No profit and lossaccount of Goldmark for 1993 was produced.  Yung was cross-examined on the profit and loss accounts of Jade Rainbow for the periodfrom 1 January to 31 March 1992 and for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1992.  The accounts showed a gross profit of $306,623.28for the first six months of 1992.  The majority of that amount in the sum of $237,174.83 was earned since Goldmark and Genius Wisdomacquired Jade Rainbow.  On the other hand, the accounts showed a net loss of $17,141.25 for the first six months and a net loss of$9,838.66 for the first three months.  The loss incurred since Goldmark took over Jade Rainbow was only $7,303.  The loss was mainlydue to payment of rent to Goldmark in the amount of $32,056 and staff salaries in the amount of $105,998.80.  The rent paid to Goldmarkwas just a paper payment which did not affect the overall cash flow of Goldmark and Jade Rainbow.  The loss to Jade Rainbow was again to Goldmark.  Before acquiring Jade Rainbow, Goldmark did not have that rental receipt.  Discounting that rental payment, JadeRainbow had a net profit of about $24,753 for the second quarter of 1992 or a monthly net income of $8,251.  Another reason for theloss was the salary payment.  Under cross-examination, Yung admitted that the salary payment by Jade Rainbow included salaries forstaff of Goldmark.  He could only identify Eddie Kan as being mainly engaged in the business of Jade Rainbow.  Her salary was only$9,000 per month.  The loss caused by the salary payment was only an accounting loss, most of which was incurred for the businessof Goldmark.  Effectively, Jade Rainbow contributed about $82,000 to the cash flow of Goldmark by paying the salary of the staffof Goldmark.  That was the position as at 30 June 1992.  No evidence was presented by Yung as to the position in June 1993.  I canonly assume it was similar.  Thus, Jade Rainbow was an asset and not a burden to Goldmark.  The only burden which Yung could identifyis that facilities from Rabobank in the amount of $200,000 was taken from Goldmark and earmarked for Jade Rainbow.  That has no effecton the overall position of Goldmark.</p>    <p><a name="p255" class="para" id="p255">255.</a>  The profit and loss account for Animal Health Centre prepared by Mrs Vos showed a net loss of $95,141.78 as at 26 May 1993.  Yungâscomplaint was that all capital investment for Animal Health Centre such as the X-ray machine, equipments, fittings and furnitureas well as medicine were paid by Goldmark.  The amount of those liabilities as shown in the profit and loss account was $605,943.98. That I agree imposed a burden on Goldmark.</p>    <p><a name="p256" class="para" id="p256">256.</a>  Up until 20 May 1993 before hostility commenced, Goldmark had no problem with cash flow.  Goldmark had an overdraft facility withRabobank in the amount of $1.3 million.  A review of the bank statements of Goldmarkâs account with Rabobank showed that chequeswere issued from that account drawing on the overdraft facility and then every now and then a cheque in a round sum from GoldmarkâsIBA account was deposited to reduce the overdraft, keeping it below $1.1 million.  There were almost no deposits of odd sums intothe Rabobank account suggesting that the Rabobank account was not used to receive business payments.</p>    <p><a name="p257" class="para" id="p257">257.</a>  Animal Health Centre commenced operation on 8 February 1993.  By then, presumably, all major capital expenses had been paid.  Theopening and closing balance of the Rabobank account for February 1993 was a debit balance of $946,773.66 and $1,043,388.95 respectively. A cheque of $200,000 from the IBA was paid in on 25 February 1993 to reduce the amount of overdraft.  The overdraft was still withincomfortable margin.  There was a credit balance of $54,009.78 in the IBA account.  Despite the burden imposed by Animal Health Centre,Goldmark did not appear to have any difficulties in maintaining normal operation.</p>    <p><a name="p258" class="para" id="p258">258.</a>  In March 1993, the debit balance of the Rabobank account was increased by about $30,000 to $1,072,321.68.  There was a cheque depositof $10,000 from the IBA account and another cheque deposit in the amount of $42,500.  The overdraft was still maintained within comfortablemargin.  There was a credit balance of $55,039.03 in the IBA account.  Again, Goldmark did not appear to have any difficulties inits normal operation.</p>    <p><a name="p259" class="para" id="p259">259.</a>  In April 1993, the debit balance of the Rabobank account was increased by about $200,000 to $1,127,329.65.  There were two depositsamounting to $60,399.37, but no deposit from the IBA account.  Though the overdraft facilities were near exhaustion, a facility ofabout $173,000 was still available.  The balance in the IBA account increased to $142,857.40.  Had money been transferred from theIBA account as it used to in the past, Goldmarkâs position would have been healthier.  Despite that, Goldmark did not appear tohave any difficulties in its normal operation.</p>    <p><a name="p260" class="para" id="p260">260.</a>  In May 1993, the debit balance of the Rabobank account was increased by about $44,000 to $1,171,699.72.  There was a cheque depositof $353,681.80, which appeared to be a business payment in view of the odd sum.  A facility of about $133,000 was still available. The balance in the IBA account was reduced to $16,584.34.  There was no deposit from the IBA account, but $100,000 was transferredout from the IBA account.  It should be recalled that on 20 May 1993 hostility broke out between Yung and Vos.</p>    <p><a name="p261" class="para" id="p261">261.</a>  Then in June 1993, the debit balance of the Rabobank account was increased by about $321,000 to $1,493,128.33 as at 11 June 1993just before Yung deposited the forged cheque number 505802.  There was no payment from the IBA account and no deposit whatever. On the other hand, the balance in the IBA account increased to $232,328.64 just before Yung caused a transfer of $200,000 to payhimself on 23 June 1993 after altering the mandate in the IBA account.  The balance in the IBA account was $82,075.23 at the endof that month.  Had Yung not transferred $200,000 from the IBA account to pay himself but instead deposited it into the Rabobankaccount, the Rabobank account would be as healthy as ever.</p>    <p><a name="p262" class="para" id="p262">262.</a>  It would be futile to examine the Rabobank and IBA accounts thereafter, as Yung had been withdrawing from the IBA account to payhimself and the Rabobank account had been deliberately kept inactive except to carry on with the massive debit balance.  Lookingat the two accounts together, it appeared that the financial position of Goldmark was all along the same from February to June 1993. Had Yung not made the unauthorised withdrawals of $293,310 from the IBA account in June 1993 and deposited them into the Rabobankaccount, Goldmark would have been in the same position as it was in April 1993.  It would have had free facilities of about $300,000available in the Rabobank account.  Yung alleged that the account was frozen by Rabobank.  But the reality was he did not put infunds from the IBA account to keep the Rabobank account within its overdraft limit. </p>    <p><a name="p263" class="para" id="p263">263.</a>  The following are further reasons why the operation of Jade Rainbow and Animal Health Centre could not have been a cause of Goldmarkâsfinancial difficulties.  According to Eddie Kan, soon after acquiring the Hillâs distributorship she was instructed by Yung tosell pet food and other Goldmarkâs stock using invoices of VIP Media and to insert in the delivery notes a direction to the customerto pay Wealth Country.  She was told by Yung not to let Vos know about this arrangement.  She recovered a number of invoices anddelivery notes from her customers in support of her evidence.  She said that Mrs Yung and Iris Leung also sold Goldmarkâs stockusing the invoices of VIP Media.  Yung did not dispute Eddie Kanâs evidence and her evidence was indisputable in the light of theinvoices recovered.  Yung only argues that there was an agreement between him and Vos that Goldmark would not sell direct for retail. Hence, the retail business was carried out by Animal Health Centre using invoices of VIP Media.  His other argument was that theamount involved was small.  I do not wish to unnecessarily burden this judgment.  Even if that was the case, there was no reasonfor Yung to instruct customers to pay Wealth Country and then not to reimburse Goldmark, which was what Vos was complaining.  Yung,Mrs Yung and Iris Leung were effectively selling Goldmarkâs stock to pay themselves.  A simple description of their activitieswas theft.  The total amount shown in the invoices recovered by Eddie Kan was not insubstantial.  But such activities had been carriedout by everybody and had been carried on for a long time, about a year before the outbreak of hostility.  Such activities must havean impact on Goldmarkâs cash flow.</p>    <p><a name="p264" class="para" id="p264">264.</a>  Accordingly, I dismiss Yungâs allegation about financial pressure caused by the operation of Jade Rainbow and Animal Health Centreas a mere excuse of no substance at all.  I note, of course, that an available margin of $300,000 for the type of business Goldmarkwas engaged in might be tight.  But Vos had made application to Rabobank to increase the total facilities from $4.15 million to $5.9million.  The application was approved by Rabobank on 11 May 1993 and the increased facilities of $1.75 million would have been availablehad the proper documentation been completed by Yung.  As a result of the intervening dispute between Vos and Yung since 20 May 1993and the breakdown in the settlement negotiation, the extra facilities never became effective. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Collusion between Vos and Rabobank to freeze Goldmarkâs account, to demand repayment of outstanding loan and to damage Goldmark</p>    <p><a name="p265" class="para" id="p265">265.</a>  Yung alleged that he was put in fear by Rabobankâs demand to repay the outstanding loan.  This fear was exacerbated by Rabobankrefusing to honour cheque number 505802 made payable to himself on 11 June 1993.  Cheung reinforces Yungâs allegation by arguingthat there was a close relationship between Smulders, Vos and Postma, the president of Rabobank, who were all Dutch.  She emphasisesthat Mrs Vos was Postmaâs secretary and Rabobank is a Dutch Bank.  She also relies on Vosâ reporting Yungâs corruption to theICAC on 9 June 1993 as evidence of Vosâ intention to damage Goldmark.  She argues that Vos and Rabobank teamed up to oppress Yungfor some ulterior motive.  She argues that Rabobank was never interested in the repayment as it ignored Goldmarkâs solicitorsâenquiries for the redemption amount four times in connection with the sale of the Units to Global Fair.</p>    <p><a name="p266" class="para" id="p266">266.</a>  In support of his argument that there was no reason for Rabobank to demand repayment of the loan, Yung said that on 11 May 1993Rabobank approved an increase of facilities to $5.9 million with several guarantees from himself and Vos and an all monies mortgageon the Units.  He said that before the new facilities became effective Vos proposed to increase the facilities to $6.2 million andto change the guarantee to a personal guantee of $6.2 million solely from Yung.  That was for the purpose of facilitating Yungâspurchase of Vosâ interest in the Companies. He said that Rabobank agreed to the increase and in its internal communication on 31May 1993 noted that he was a man with a net worth of $8 million.  He said there was no reason why Rabobank would have refused tohonour cheque number 505802 when Goldmarkâs account would not have exceeded its facilities limit of $4.2 million.  He thereforebelieved and accused Vos of colluding with Rabobank to freeze Goldmarkâs account and demand immediate repayment of the outstandingloan.</p>    <p><a name="p267" class="para" id="p267">267.</a>  Vos denied having anything to do with Rabobankâs refusal to honour the cheque number 505802 or to demand immediate repayment ofthe outstanding loan.  He said it would not have been in his interest to do so as he was negotiating with Yung for the purchase ofhis interest in the Companies.  Indeed there was no dispute that Vos even went as far as to procure Rabobank to increase the facilitiesand to accept Yung as the sole guarantor to enable Yung to complete the settlement agreement and to pay him.</p>    <p><a name="p268" class="para" id="p268">268.</a>  There is no dispute that on 11 May 1993 Rabobank approved Goldmarkâs application to increase the facilities from $4.15 millionto $5.9 million with a corresponding increase of the overdraft facilities from $1.3 million to $2 million.  But the documentationswere never completed and the new limits were not operative.  Then on 20 May 1993, hostility broke out and on 24 May 1993 the partiesreached a preliminary settlement agreement for Yung to buy out Vosâ interest in the Companies for $2.7 million.  In view of thatthere was no reason to proceed with the documentation for increasing the facilities.  The limit of the overdraft facilities remainedat $1.3 million.</p>    <p><a name="p269" class="para" id="p269">269.</a>  Again, there is no dispute that Vos procured Rabobank to further increase the facilities to $6.2 million with Yung as the singleguarantor while Vosâ obligation under his existing guarantee was to be released.  Obviously as Vos said, this arrangement was tofacilitate Yungâs purchase of his interest in the Companies.  According to Rabobankâs internal document, its credit committeeapproved the new facilities on 1 June 1993.  But Yung never proceeded with the documentation, obviously because of the deadlock inthe settlement negotiation.  Thus the limit of the overdraft facilities remained at $1.3 million as before.  Yung must know thatthe limit of the overdraft was $1.3 million and not $2 million as he alleged.  Plainly obvious, cheque number 505802 was not honoureddue to lack of funds.</p>    <p><a name="p270" class="para" id="p270">270.</a>  Yung referred to his alleged conversation with Jennifer Chan of Rabobank after the bank refused to honour cheque number 505802. He said that Jennifer Chan told him to speak to Vos if he wished to know why the account was frozen.  Yung said that by âfrozenâhe understood to mean that the account became inoperative even if money was deposited to reduce the overdraft. </p>    <p><a name="p271" class="para" id="p271">271.</a>  I find that evidence impossible to believe.  On the face, the overdraft facilities had been exceeded when the cheque was presented. That must be the first and most obvious reason a bank officer would give to his client for refusing to honour the cheque.  In thenormal course of business, if overdraft was maintained within approved limits, there was  no reason why the account would be frozen. Yung was not a third party  to the account but a director of the account holder and signatory of the account.  There was no reasonwhy Jennifer Chan would not have told him directly that there was no funds in the account but to tell him that  the account was frozenand that he should speak to Vos to find out the reason.  Were Yung a third party payee, it would have been likely for Jennifer Chanto have told him to refer to the drawer as a matter of usual practice.  But, Yung was effectively the account holder.  His evidenceof Jennifer Chanâs conversation is inherently incredible.  His evidence of what he understood by the word âfrozenâ is alsobeyond apprehension.</p>    <p><a name="p272" class="para" id="p272">272.</a>  Yung was the person in charge of the accounts of Goldmark and had control of its account with Rabobank.  It is impossible that hedid not know the limit of Goldmarkâs overdraft facilities was $1.3 million and not $2 million as he alleged.  The total of allfacilities was only $4.15 million.  He knew the new limit had never become effective.  He had been maintaining the account withinthe approved limit until the end of May 1993 when hostility broke out.  He then started to exceed that limit in June 1993, whichwas tolerated by Rabobank until it reached a debit balance of $1.493 million on 8 June 1993.  Rabobank might have been tolerant toGoldmark as a familiar and important client and allowed it to exceed its overdraft limit by about 10%.  But a prudent banker wouldnot have tolerated a withdrawal of a significant amount of $500,000 which would have exceed the limit by as much as 53%.  Yung musthave known the reason for the rejection of cheque number 505802 was because the overdraft limit had been exceeded.  Of course, healso knew that the date on the cheque was forgery.  I find his evidence about what Jennifer Chan said and his allegation that Rabobankhad frozen Goldmarkâs account in the sense he understood it were other concoctions of this extremely dishonest witness.</p>    <p><a name="p273" class="para" id="p273">273.</a>  It is not clear what triggered Rabobank to call in its loan.  Between 23 May 1993 and 16 June 1993, Vos and Yung were negotiatingfor Yungâs buying out Vosâ interest in the Companies.  Up until 16 June 1993 or even until 6 July 1993, Vos was still hopefulthat the settlement agreement would be finalised.  It made no sense for Vos to collude with Rabobank to demand repayment of the loanto destroy Goldmark, even if it was merely intended to put pressure on Yung. </p>    <p><a name="p274" class="para" id="p274">274.</a>  Yung and Cheung argue that no evidence was called from Rabobank to explain why it called in the loan.  There is no burden on a partyto call evidence to rebut any allegation raised by the opponent which are not relevant or necessary, especially where the allegationconcerns a non party.  Otherwise, litigation would become unnecessarily costly and protracted as this one already is by reason ofthe many frivolous arguments raised by Yung and Cheung.  Rabobank is a reputable international bank.  Despite its president, Postma,was personally known to Vos and that Mrs Vos was Postmaâs secretary, it was extremely unlikely that it would have agreed to enterinto any collusion to damage its customersâ interest and its own image by acting arbitrarily as Yung suggested.  On the facts ofthis case, the reason is obvious.  Despite that the limit of the overdraft account had already been exceeded, a director attemptedto further draw a substantial amount.  That was a red signal to any prudent bank officer.  It is understandable that a bank in thosecircumstances would, for its protection, demand repayment of all outstanding loan.  Being a seasoned businessman with his close relationshipwith bank officers from various major banks in Hong Kong, Yung must have realised that must have been the reason for Rabobank callingin the loan.  Yungâs argument is frivolous and vexatious. </p>    <p><a name="p275" class="para" id="p275">275.</a>  Yung and Cheung argue that upon discovery, they found documents from Rabobank suggesting that their solicitors were prepared toinstitute legal action against Goldmark for recovery of the loan and that support their belief that Vos had colluded with Rabobankto destroy Goldmark.  I think that was just standard practice of a bank and what its solicitors would do in the face of a defaultingborrower who failed to respond to their demand to repay or even to discuss about repayment of the loan.  Indeed Yung failed to turnup for the meeting with Rabobank on 1 July 1993.  Furthermore, those documents were not known to Yung before he sold the Units. The discovery could not have supported their belief of collusion and fear of Rabobankâs possible action at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p276" class="para" id="p276">276.</a>  The question is not just whether Vos and Rabobank had colluded to destroy Goldmark, but whether Yungâs belief and fear of suchcollusion were honestly held.  The burden is on Yung and Cheung to prove collusion.  They could offer no such evidence.  The factsof the case do not even raise any suspicion of such collusion.  As such, Yung could not have honestly and genuinely held any suchbelief and fear.  Indeed, on the facts, since 18 June 1993, Yung was taking preparatory steps to drain Goldmark of its funds.  Insteadof attending the meeting with Rabobank on 1 July 1993 to discuss about repayment of the loan, Yung was siphoning funds out of Goldmark,withdrawing money from the IBA account to pay himself and taking preparatory steps to sell the Units.  This evidence also rebutshis evidence about his belief and fear of collusion.</p>    <p><a name="p277" class="para" id="p277">277.</a>  I reject Yungâs evidence about his belief and fear that Vos had colluded with Rabobank to demand repayment of the loan in orderto damage Goldmark.  Yung knew full well the limit of the overdraft facilities.  He knew he was giving false evidence about his beliefand was advancing false arguments.  He knew the purpose for which the cheque number 505802 was issued to him had been spent and hehad received payment via cheque number 505836.  Yet he forged the date on cheque number 505802 and presented it to Rabobank.  Underthose circumstances, it is extremely dishonest of him to accuse Vos of procuring Rabobank not to honour the cheque and of colludingwith Rabobank to demand repayment of the loan to damage Goldmark.  I reject Yungâs allegation in its entirety.  Not only that hegave false evidence and that his submission started on a false premise, he was wilfully attempting to deceive the Court and demonstrateda total lack of good faith in the conduct of this litigation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Yung honestly believed auction of the Units was the only way to save Goldmark</p>    <p><a name="p278" class="para" id="p278">278.</a>  The main thrust of Yungâs defence was that he was put in fear by Rabobankâs demand to repay the outstanding loan and Vosârefusal to sign cheques of Goldmark which brought Goldmarkâs business to a halt.  He feared that Rabobank would take possessionof the Units and force sell them at a very low price.  He was very concerned about protecting Goldmark and in particular its Hillâsdistributorship.  Hence, to sell the Units by auction was the only way to save Goldmark.</p>    <p><a name="p279" class="para" id="p279">279.</a>  Yungâs fear of Rabobankâs action and belief that auction of the Units was the only way out were essentially build on a numberof false allegations.  Yung alleged that the operation of Jade Rainbow and Animal Health Centre caused Goldmark financial difficulties. He accused Vos of refusing to sign cheques for Goldmark and Vos could not be contacted, thereby bringing Goldmarkâs business toa halt.  He alleged that Vos colluded with Rabobank to demand immediate payment of the loan of over $4 million.  All those allegationshave been dismissed by me as untrue.  Essentially, there was no basis for his fear and belief that auction of the Units was the onlyway to save Goldmark.  But, assuming that he was put in fear by reason of Vosâ collusion with Rabobank, I shall go on to considerwhether his belief that auction of the Units was the only was out, could have been honestly held.</p>    <p><a name="p280" class="para" id="p280">280.</a>  As submitted by Mr Lam, even if Rabobank was acting unreasonably in calling in the loan, there was no reason why Yung did not liaisewith Rabobank for an extension of time to pay or attend the meeting with Rabobank on 1 July 1993.  He might have thought that Voshad great influence over Rabobank, but there was no reason for him not to attend the meeting.  Yung denied he was ever informed aboutthe meeting.  On Vosâ evidence which is supported by the internal documents of Rabobank, Yung did not attend the meeting scheduledon 1 July 1993 to discuss about defreezing of Goldmarkâs account.  In the light of the evidence, I dismiss Yungâs allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p281" class="para" id="p281">281.</a>  Even if he had no confidence with Rabobank, Yung could have entered into discussion with other banks in Hong Kong to transfer themortgage and facilities or for a bridging loan to arrange for the orderly disposal of the Units instead of an auction.  On Yungâsand Cheungâs evidence, Yung was very familiar with a number of senior bank officers.  Goldmark had good relationship with IBA. Yung was very familiar with Mr Donaldson of HSBC who promptly arranged facilities for New Champion secured against Start Winâsmortgage of Unit 1D.  Yet, he did not contact any of these banks to discuss about transferring the mortgage and facilities to IBAor HSBC.  On Yungâs and Cheungâs case, Yung was a very resourceful businessman.  He raised $850,000 to enable Cheung to pay thedeposit within one day and raised $1.35 million to enable Cheung to complete the purchase within a few days.  With such resourcesand his connection with the banks, he could have walked into IBA or HSBC and easily arranged a small bridging loan of say $2 millionenable the mortgage facilities from Rabobank to be transferred to another bank.  He did not.  Instead, he brought about a forcedsale of the Units himself.  Yungâs explanation was that he was confused at the time and did not wish to trouble his friends withthose matters.  That is hardly convincing for a seasoned businessman faced with what Yung alleged to be a very serious situation. </p>    <p><a name="p282" class="para" id="p282">282.</a>  Yung contended that those possibilities might not work as he did not think Vosâ cooperation would be forthcoming.  But the indisputablefact was that he never asked.  He claimed that Vos could not be contacted, but I rejected that allegation.  The fact was he did noteven attempt to contact Vos direct or through Messrs JSM.  He even concealed the passing of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution and 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution to sell the Units.  He said that he had received legal advice about the validity of Iris Leungâs appointment asdirector and hence passed the resolutions.  Even if he believed Vosâ cooperation would not be forthcoming, he could equally havesought Iris Leungâs cooperation to obtain facilities, permanent or bridging, since he believed Iris Leungâs appointment was valid.</p>    <p><a name="p283" class="para" id="p283">283.</a>  Even if the Provisional Settlement Agreement fell through and the parties were in dead lock, if Yung considered selling the Unitswas the only way out, he should have informed Vos, as the only other director and 50% shareholder of the Companies, that he was goingto sell the Units.  Instead, on my finding of fact, he proceeded with the sale secretly.  He did not give Vos notice of the proposedresolutions to be passed.  If he genuinely believed Iris Leung was properly appointed as director and that sale of the Units wasin the interest of the Companies, he should have and would have fearlessly informed Vos of the board meetings and told him that heand Iris Leung were going to pass the resolutions regardless of Vosâ wishes.  He did not. </p>    <p><a name="p284" class="para" id="p284">284.</a>  On the evidence, Yung had no basis for his fear and belief.  All the evidence showed that Yung was bent on going ahead to sell theUnits and to do so without Vosâ knowledge.  His alleged fear about possible action by Rabobank and his belief that sale of theUnits by auction was the only way out could not have been honestly held.</p>    <p class="heading">The auction of the Units</p>    <p><a name="p285" class="para" id="p285">285.</a>  According to Yung, he discussed with Alfred Hau about Vosâ distrayal of the Companies, Rabobankâs demand for repayment of theloan, his belief that Vos colluded with Rabobank to damage Goldmark, his fear that Rabobank would force sell the Units and his intentionto sell the Units by auction.  Alfred Hau explained to him the procedures for calling a board of directorsâ meeting and preparedthe documentation for him including the notice of meeting.  Alfred Hau advised him that he had checked with the Companies Registryrecord and confirmed that Iris Leung was a director of Goldmark.  I have discussed those aspects of Yungâs evidence and rejectedall those allegations.  Yungâs further evidence was that Alfred Hau advised him that he and Iris Leung might validly pass a resolutionto sell the Units and introduced Top Auctioneer Limited to him.  In short, he was saying that the auction was conducted on legaladvice.</p>    <p><a name="p286" class="para" id="p286">286.</a>  On the evidence, Yung admitted that he never obtained a valuation report of the Units before instructing Top Auctioneer Limitedto sell the Units.  He said, shortly after passing the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution and 3<sup>rd</sup> 1993 Resolution, he made inquiries with estate agents in the area and with the management office of Thomson Commercial Building. He alleged that he was told it would be very difficult to sell the Units quickly under the then market environment and was allegedlysuggested a price of $4 million to $5 million.  His concern was simply to sell the Units so as to repay the Rabobank loan.  Hence,he was prepared to sell the Units at any price above $4 million.  I am surprised that a prudent solicitor would have failed to advisehim to obtain a valuation report first before taking such a drastic and arbitrary decision. </p>    <p><a name="p287" class="para" id="p287">287.</a>  Yung said that he was told by Top Auctioneer Limited that it would take several days to prepare the tender documents and then severaldays to advertise the auction in newspapers.  Yet, he instructed Top Auctioneer Limited to advertise the auction of the Units on12 to 14 July 1993 with tender closing at noon on 14 July 1993.  The tender period was only two and half days.  When asked whetherhe thought the time was too short to receive a realistic tender, Yung replied that he did not think about it at all.  I do not thinkthere was any truth in that statement from this seasoned businessman.  I think Yung was being evasive.  According to Varty, whoseopinion I have no doubt is correct, he was shocked to see that the tender period was so short.  He said that the normal tender periodwas four to six weeks and at least three weeks.  That was to allow time for the market to become aware of the availability of theproperty and for interested buyers to make at least some preliminary investigation and to inspect the property.  He even called twodays âunconscionably shortâ.  I entirely agree with Vartyâs opinion.</p>    <p><a name="p288" class="para" id="p288">288.</a>  In the meantime, Yung did not even wait for estate agents to look for any interested purchasers.  His explanation was that he sensedit would be quite difficult for the estate agents to sell the Units.  He did not advertise the sale of the Units within Thomson CommercialBuilding either.  He did not inform Vos as the only other director and shareholder of the Companies or Messrs JSM as Vosâ legalrepresentative the resolutions to sell the Units and the auction.  I do not think a prudent solicitor would not have advised Yungnot to take any of the above steps.  Furthermore, Yung admitted that he and Mrs Yung were interested to bid for the Units.  If thatwas the case, there was all the more reason for him to have made the auction more transparent.  It was all the more important forhim to disclose the auction and his intention to bid to Vos.  I do not think a prudent solicitor would not have emphasised to Yungthe importance of keeping Vos informed of the auction.</p>    <p><a name="p289" class="para" id="p289">289.</a>  I have expressed my doubts that a prudent solicitor retained to advise Yung about the proper procedure for selling the Units underthe special circumstances of this case would not have arranged service of the notice of meetings and resolutions passed on Vos. I am even more unconvinced that a prudent solicitor would have in the present circumstances advised Yung to have the Units auctionedunder such a tight time schedule.  Alfred Hau was not called to confirm such were the advice he gave to Yung.  A prudent solicitorwould have suggested his client to liaise with the bank for time to sell the security so as to repay the loan.  Even if Rabobankwere to turn a deaf ear to any form of negotiation, a prudent solicitor knows that a mortgagee could not go about selling the mortgagedproperty at will, let alone within two weeks as what Yung was effectively doing.  A prudent solicitor knows that if the mortgagorresists a sale it could take at least six to twelve months for a mortgagee bank to obtain an order for sale.  A persistent mortgagorwho resists and appeals on each and every stage of the proceedings may delay the process for years.  Reality would have dictatedRabobank to cooperate with Yung to allow him to sell the properties within a reasonable time frame.  Being a seasoned businessmanand according to his evidence he had the unpleasant experience of a forced sale before, Yung must know that Rabobank could not sellthe Units within two weeks.  A prudent solicitor would have advised his client to obtain a valuation report before putting the propertyon auction.  Apparently such advice had not been given.  Even if Top Auctioneer Limited were introduced to Yung by Alfred Hau, whichI doubted, I do not believe Alfred Hau would have advised Yung to sell under such a tight schedule without first obtaining a valuationreport and without giving Vos notice of the intended sale and particulars of the auction.  Yung was only trying to give credibilityto his evidence by falsely claiming that he was acting under legal advice.  I do not accept his evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p290" class="para" id="p290">290.</a>  Though there was nothing unusual about the tender documents and advertisement, the tender period, as Varty put it, was âunconscionablyshortâ.  I could not agree with him more.  A tender period of two and half days was unconscionably short as against the normalperiod of four to six weeks.  I find that the auction was tailored only for Yung or his nominees to bid.  It was a sham. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Yung was in breach of fiduciary duty</p>    <p><a name="p291" class="para" id="p291">291.</a>  The answer to the question whether Yung was in breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Companies is whether Yung genuinely believedthe auction was a business decision in the interest of the Companies. </p>    <p><a name="p292" class="para" id="p292">292.</a> Cheung advanced a number of arguments that the auction was in the interest of the Companies and the creditors.  She argues that itwas not financially viable for the Companies to keep the Units, that sale of the Units was in the interest of the creditors and shareholdersof the Companies and that effectively Yungâs team was the major creditor.  She also argues that the sale was a genuine businessdecision to meet creditorâs demand to avoid imminent threat of winding up.  She said that Rabobank had been paid in full, thatYung would not be demanding any repayment of his loans and Vos may not demand repayment of his loans without Yungâs consent.  Shesaid that most important of all was that by selling the Units Goldmark was able to maintain the Hillâs distributorship.  She furtherargues that as Vos and Yung had entered into the Provisional Settlement Agreement, Yung was the sole shareholder of the Companiesin equity.  She submits that creditors would prefer sale of the Units by the Companies than foreclosure by Rabobank.  I do not findit necessary to deal with all of Cheungâs arguments.  Most of the issues Cheung raised are irrelevant to the central issues inthis case which is whether Yung was in breach of fiduciary duty in selling the Units at an undervalue.  Even if the issues Cheungraised were all resolved in favour of Yung, the point remains whether in selling the Units the way he did, Yung was in breach ofhis fiduciary duty owed to the Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p293" class="para" id="p293">293.</a>  I start with the presumption that Yung was acting <i>bona fide</i>.  But I must consider all the circumstances surrounding the auction.  The sale was at a gross undervalue, being 37.5% off the openmarket value or 17% off the forced sale value.  The forced sale value is usually the extremity and includes a discount for all possibleconsiderations in a fire sale and it is usually impossible to go much lower.  A further discount of 17% was a very substantial reduction. In the absence of a reasonable explanation, sale at a gross undervalue is some evidence on which lack of good faith or even badfaith may be inferred. </p>    <p><a name="p294" class="para" id="p294">294.</a>  Yungâs explanation was that Goldmark was in dire financial difficulties caused by the operation of Jade Rainbow or Animal HealthCentre.  I have rejected that explanation.  Goldmark was not in financial difficulties at the material time between May and July1993.  Yung failed to show any genuine financial difficulties threatening Goldmark.  Instead, he and his family members were drainingGoldmarkâs resources by diverting proceeds of sale of Goldmarkâs stock to Wealth Country without ever paying Goldmark.  Any difficultyin respect of Goldmarkâs Rabobank account was self-induced by Yung transferring business receipts from Goldmarkâs IBA accountto pay himself instead of to reduce the overdraft in the Rabobank account as he used to.  This exhausted the overdraft limit in theaccount.</p>    <p><a name="p295" class="para" id="p295">295.</a>  Yungâs other explanation was that Vos colluded with Rabobank to freeze Goldmarkâs account and demanded repayment of outstandingloan to damage Goldmark.  He had to sell the Units to pay off Rabobank and to protect Goldmarkâs interest in the Hillâs distributorship. I also rejected that explanation.  While it is not clear why Rabobank froze Goldmarkâs account and demanded repayment of the outstandingloan, probably it was because Yung attempted to cash a cheque of $500,000 when Goldmark had exceeded it overdraft limit.  Probablyunknown to Rabobank, on my finding, that cheque was a forgery.  The fact remains that Yung did not liaise with Rabobank about extensionof time for repayment.  He did not discuss the situation with Vos.  He took no steps to arrange alternative facilities from otherbanks.  He even deliberately refused to attend the meeting with Rabobank on 1 July 1993 to discuss the account.  Instead, he tooksteps to sell the Units himself.  He merely used the occasion of Rabobankâs calling in the loan to accuse Vos of colluding withRabobank to call in the loan as an excuse for his selling the Units to repay Rabobank.  I find that he did not have any genuine beliefthat Vos had colluded with Rabobank to call in the loan or any genuine fear that Rabobank would immediately force sell the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p296" class="para" id="p296">296.</a>  Yungâs third explanation was that he believed the sale was the only way to save Goldmark.  Again, I have rejected that explanation. He could have sought alternative financing from other banks, but he did not.  Though Rabobank demanded repayment in two weeks, ithad never commenced legal action and foreclosure was a long way off.  Rabobank would take at least six months to obtain an orderfor sale of the Units from the court.  Yet why should Yung be at such a hurry to?  He was not inducing a forced sale, he was deliberatelyexecuting a forced sale on Goldmark and at a ridiculously low price.  It was inexplicable that Yung should start a forced sale ofthe Units on his own initiative, except on the basis of some ulterior motive or bad faith. </p>    <p><a name="p297" class="para" id="p297">297.</a>  The sale was conducted in a most suspicious manner and bore all tell tale signs of bad faith.  Despite he was warned by Messrs JSMon 12 July 1993 about the invalidity of Iris Leungâs appointment as director of Goldmark and despite he was asked by Messrs HLLYto produce the 1991 Resolution, Yung did not produce the 1991 Resolution to Messrs HLLY for their further consideration.  He knewIris Leungâs appointment as director of Goldmark had lapsed and she had no authority to pass any resolutions on behalf of Goldmark. Despite all that, he acted on the 2<sup>nd</sup> 1993 Resolution which he procured Iris Leung to pass so as to sell Unit 1D.  In his dual capacity as director of Goldmark and directorof World Champ, he passed the 3<sup>rd</sup> Resolution to sell Unit 1A.  He did not give any notice of board meeting for the purpose of considering the sale of the Units toVos and did not give Vos a copy of the resolutions passed.  He deliberately concealed the sales from Vos.  </p>    <p><a name="p298" class="para" id="p298">298.</a>  Yung said the auction was arranged under legal advice and the auctioneer was recommended by his solicitors.  Yung did not obtaina valuation of the open market value of the Units and arbitrarily sold the Units to Global Fair at a value which was 37.5% belowthe open market value or 17% below the forced sale value.  The auction was a sham.  The decision to sell the Units under the termsof the auction was so bizarre that no reasonable board could consider to be in the interest of the Companies.  The auction was justa sham and the decision to auction was manifestly made in bad faith.  It could not have been a <i>bona fide</i> business decision in the interest of the Companies.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of the âno conflict ruleâ and the âno profit ruleâ</p>    <p><a name="p299" class="para" id="p299">299.</a>  There is no direct evidence that Global Fair was Yungâs nominee in purchasing the Units.  However, in my analysis of the claimagainst Cheung, Global Fair and Start Win, I made the finding that Cheung bid for the Units pursuant to a common design with Yung. I am unable to find what was the full extent of that design, but it included at least that Yung and Cheung were to provide the purchaseprice of Unit 1D and Unit 1A respectively or jointly.  Subsequently, Yungâs and Cheungâs rights were referable to those respectiveUnits.  But that apart, I have rejected Cheungâs and Yungâs evidence that they merely financed Cheungâs purchase of the Unitsby way of a loan which was substantially repaid.  So the evidence remains that Cheung bid for the Units through Global Fair undera design in which she and Yung provided respectively for the purchase price of Unit 1A and Unit 1D.  The further irresistible inferenceis that Cheung and Yung either purchased the respective Units separately or the Units jointly.  Whatever it was does not matter. Yung was in breach of the âno conflict ruleâ by purchasing through Global Fair.  As the purchase was at a substantial undervalue,Yung was also in breach of the âno profit ruleâ.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether the âno conflict ruleâ should be relaxed</p>    <p><a name="p300" class="para" id="p300">300.</a>  Yung argues that he is effectively the owner of all the issues shares of and in the Companies and their majority creditor.  Hence,in the circumstances, it would be too stringent not to relax the âself dealing ruleâ or the âno conflict ruleâ to allow himor Mrs Yung to put in a tender for the Units.  This argument is a non-starter because the Plaintiffâs case is not really aboutbreach of the âself dealing ruleâ or the âno conflict ruleâ as such.  The Plaintiffâs complaint is about Yungâs breachof fiduciary duty to act in good faith in the manner in which Yung conducted the sale of the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p301" class="para" id="p301">301.</a>  But as a matter of law, his argument has no legal basis.  It is assumed that via Wealth Country and Mrs Yungâs mother, Yung isthe beneficial owner of 50% of the issued shares of and in the Companies.  Yung now claims that by reason of his having signed theProvisional Settlement Agreement with Vos, he is also the equitable owner of the remaining 50% of the issued shares held by Vos ontrust for him.  Quite apart from the fact that Yung, Wealth Country and his mother-in-law were different legal entities and thatin another context Yung claimed to have no interest in Wealth Country, I am unable to agree with that proposition.  A similar argumentwas rejected in <i>Musselwhite and another v C H Musselwhite &amp; Son Ltd and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%201%20Ch%20964" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 1 Ch 964.</a>  I do not find it necessary to go into the detailed arguments in that case.  After drawing analogy from the position of an unpaidvendor of land and that of a mortgagee of land, Russell J concluded at 987 as follows as regards an unpaid vendor of shares:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> â In my judgment, so far as voting powers are concerned, an unpaid vendor remaining on the register is not to be regarded as ina weaker position, so far as the exercise of voting powers is concerned, than a mortgagee.  The purchaser acquires the beneficialinterest subject to the vendorâs lien: the mortgagor retains the beneficial interest subject to the charge in favour of the mortgagee,in the form of an equity of redemption.  In the one case the mortgagee is deliberately put on the register to safeguard his moneylent: in the other case the vendor is deliberately left on the register until all is paid to safeguard his purchase-money due.</p>        <p class="quote">  In my judgment an unpaid vendor of shares remaining on the register after the contract for sale retains vis-Ã -vis the purchaserthe prima facie right to vote in respect of those shares.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>According to the views of Russell J, the unpaid vendor of shares is entitled to notice of meeting and to vote in respect of his sharesin his own interest and is not bound to vote in accordance with the direction of the purchaser who has not fully paid for the shares.</p>    <p><a name="p302" class="para" id="p302">302.</a>  I agree with that view.  Share is a special kind of property.  Property in shares do not change hands by delivery.  Three legaltransactions are required to bring about a transfer of shares.  Firstly, there will be a contract for the sale of the shares.  Ifthe contract is effected through a stockbroker, it will be evidenced by his bought and sold notes.  Secondly, the vendor will executea document of transfer and deliver the shares to the purchaser.  Usually the vendor will execute the document of transfer upon paymentof the full purchase price.  As far as the vendor is concerned, if he was paid, that would be the completion of the sale.  His obligationis not to do anything which would be inconsistent with the sale of the shares.  Thirdly, the purchaser becomes a member and shareholderof the company by having his name entered into the register of the company.  He usually has to sign a transfer form to agree to acceptthe said shares.  In the case of a private company, usually the transfer has to be approved by the company.  The purchaser will acquirelegal ownership of the shares only upon completion of the third transaction.  I am not aware of any authorities on the question whena purchaser acquires an equitable interest in the shares purchased.  Approaching the question from first principle, the answer mustbe that it depends on the express or presumed intention of the parties.  The right to vote is one of the incidents of legal ownershipof shares.  If an unpaid vendor of shares remaining on the register after the contract for sale retains <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the purchaser the right to vote in respect of those shares, he must also retain his equitable interest together with his legal interestin the shares.  In the case of an ordinary sale and purchase of shares, I do not think it could have been the presumed intentionof the parties that a trust of the shares would be created at any time prior to the payment of the full purchase price.  On the otherhand, as soon as the purchase price was paid in full, the vendor must hold the shares on constructive trust for the benefit of thepurchaser pending completion of the third transaction, i.e. approval of the transfer by the company and the registration of the sharesin the purchaserâs name in the register of the company.</p>    <p><a name="p303" class="para" id="p303">303.</a>  There was no express intention under the Provisional Settlement Agreement, nor could any intention be inferred.  I cannot inferany intention other than that a vendor does not hold the shares on trust for the purchaser until he was fully paid.  To hold otherwisewould entitle the purchaser who had not even paid to do anything inconsistent with the rights of the legal owner of the shares.</p>    <p><a name="p304" class="para" id="p304">304.</a>  On the facts, for the reasons which I have given, I disagree with Yungâs submission that the auction was a genuine business decision<i>bona fide</i> made for the purpose of raising funds to meet the demand of Rabobank to avoid the threat of liquidation.  Yung was not the beneficialowner of 50% of the shares in the Companies held by Vos.  There was no justification to relax the âself dealing ruleâ or theâno conflict ruleâ.</p>    <p>Relief under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s358.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 358</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a></p>    <p><a name="p305" class="para" id="p305">305.</a>  Yung argues that he is entitled to relief under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s358.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 358</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> which excuses a director who has acted honestly and reasonably for the negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust.  Hequotes extensively from the authorities.  I do not wish to burden this already over burdened judgment.  The conditions for exemptinga director from liability are that he has acted honestly and reasonably.  On my finding of fact, not any had Yung acted deliberatelyand unreasonably, he acted dishonestly in each and every step in bringing about the forced sale of the Units at an undervalue tohimself or jointly with Cheung for his benefit and to the detriment of the Companies.  He is not entitled to the relief under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s358.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 358</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">Yungâs defence of set off and counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p306" class="para" id="p306">306.</a>  Yung counterclaims $1.1 million directorâs loan made to Goldmark on 8 November 1991 and a shareholdersâ loan of $1 million madeto Goldmark.  In the event that he was found to be liable for any breach of duty or misappropriation, he counterclaims for a totalof $2,894,659.50 as various sums which he claims he ought to be paid.  The total amount of his counterclaim is $4,994,659.50.  NewChampion also made a similar counterclaim against the Plaintiff.

However, there isno documentary proof in support.  Goldmarkâs bank statements from IBA and Rabobank did not show any such deposit.  New Championhas absolutely no legal basis for such a claim.</p>    <p><a name="p309" class="para" id="p309">309.</a>  As for the shareholdersâ loan claimed by Yung, there may well be shareholdersâ loans advanced to Goldmark by Wealth Countrybut not by Yung.  The Plaintiff claims against Yung are personal claims for breach of fiduciary duty and not proprietary claims,whereas Goldmarkâs liability for shareholdersâ loan is owed to Wealth Country and not to Yung.  In any event, Wealth Countryis not a party to these proceedings.  There is no evidence that New Champion advanced any loan to Goldmark.  Neither Yung nor NewChampion can have any valid counterclaim for shareholdersâ loan advanced by Wealth Country.</p>    <p><a name="p310" class="para" id="p310">310.</a>  As for his last head of counterclaim, Yung claims for sums which he is found to have misappropriated and liable to return to Goldmarkand other payments which had been properly accounted for in the books of Goldmark.  In respect of the sums which he was found tohave misappropriated, his counterclaim is plainly ridiculous.  In respect of the other sums, he has failed to establish the basisof his claims.  Those claims include, for example, the sum of $285,000 paid by Goldmark under Rabobank cheque number 505801 to reimbursehim for the deposit he paid for the purchase of Unit 1A, the sum of $500,000 paid by Goldmark under Rabobank cheque number 505836to him which had been cleared.  Such claims are equally ridiculous.  Neither can I see any basis for a counterclaim by New Championfor those sums.  Yungâs argument demonstrates a total lack of good faith in his conduct of this litigation whether on behalf ofhimself or New Champion. </p>    <p><a name="p311" class="para" id="p311">311.</a>  On the evidence, Yung and New Champion have failed to prove any legal set off.  Their counterclaims could hardly be connected withthe Plaintiffâs claims against him.  They are not entitled to any equitable set off either.

The point had been well settled for more than a century.  In <i>Manson v Smith (liquidator of Thomas Christy Ltd)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20BCLC%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 BCLC 161</a>, the English Court of Appeal held that a misappropriation of assets of a company was not a dealing because the liability for suchmisappropriation arose as a result of the judgment after the winding up and not as a result of any dealing between the claimant andthe company.  That case was about interpretation of rule 4.90 of the Insolvency Rules  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1986%20SI%201986%2f1925" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1986, SI 1986/1925</a> of the United Kingdom, which is equivalent to our <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a>.  Millett LJ, as he then was, said at 163:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThat raises this question of law: can a person who is ordered to repay moneys to the liquidator of an insolvent company in misfeasanceproceedings set off against the sum he is ordered to pay any sums which are owing to him by the company?  That is a question whichwould undoubtedly be worthy of consideration by the full court if it were a novel point of law, but it is not.  It is settled andhas been settled for more than a century that there is no set-off available between a debt due to a misfeasant and his liabilityto repay the moneys which he has been ordered to pay in misfeasance proceedings.</p>        <p class="quote">  â¦</p>        <p class="quote">  First, r 4.90 and its predecessors require there to be mutual debts or mutual dealings.  When Mr Manson improperly withdrew moneyfrom the company this did not constitute a dealing between him and the company.  A misappropriation of assets is not a dealing. Mr Manson will object to the following analogy, but I hope he will forgive me for it is only an analogy: the thief who steals mywatch does not deal with me.  Similarly, the man who steals money from a company does not obtain the money by a dealing within r4.90.  Accordingly, his liability to repay money he has misappropriated cannot be set off against any debt owing to him by the company.</p>        <p class="quote">  The second reason is that given in <i>Ex p Pelly</i> by Hall V-C, who referred (at 498) to an earlier decision of his own, in 1880, when he had reached the same conclusion.  I will readfrom his judgment in that earlier case when he said (see  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=21%20Ch%20D%20492" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">21 Ch D 492</a> at 498): </p>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ I have already held Mr Pearse liable under the 165<sup>th</sup> section of the Companies Act, 1862, to pay to the liquidator a portion of certain promotion moneys, which portion I considered hehad improperly received.  He has claimed to set off against this amount a sum which he says the company owed to him at the date ofthe winding-up, and I reserved for consideration the question whether the set-off can be sustained; and having considered it I havecome to the conclusion that it cannot.  A liability under the 165<sup>th</sup> section is a liability of a delinquent, and until the order directing payment in respect of it has been made should not be treated(in the delinquentâs favour) as a debt from him to the company so as to entitle him to a set-off.ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p313" class="para" id="p313">313.</a>  The law is very well settled and beyond argument.  It needs no elaboration.  If a man steals or misappropriates property belongingto a company, the company could not be said to have dealt with the thief in the appropriation of its own property.  If it could,the company must have resisted such theft or act of misappropriation.  The company could not have dealt with the wrongdoer by misappropriatingits own property.  Likewise, if a director commits a wrong on the company by his breach of fiduciary duty owed to the company, thecompany could not be said to have dealt with the director to commit a wrong on itself.  Quite apart from common sense, this ruleis well backed by policy.  If creditors or directors to whom an insolvent company owes money are entitled to a set off what theywrongfully misappropriated from the company against what the company owes them, liquidation could never be conducted in any fairand orderly manner.  The assets of an insolvent company will become a game for any directors or creditors who have prior knowledgeof its insolvency.  They would secure or compete for priority by committing wrongs against the company.  This would result in a directorwho has acted improperly recovering in full what the company owed him, whereas a director who acted properly and the honest creditorswould be relegated to a proof in the liquidation.  That could not have been the intention of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a>. </p>    <p><a name="p314" class="para" id="p314">314.</a>  On the facts, Yung committed serious breach of fiduciary duty against the Companies.  He deliberately and dishonestly sold the companiesâasset at an undervalue to himself or jointly with another.  Even if he had not benefited from his breach of fiduciary duty, the Companiessuffered loss.  His conduct could in no way be interpreted as a dealing with the Companies within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a>.  Quite apart from the lack of a factual basis for his claims, as a matter of law, he is not entitled to any set off.  Yungâs andNew Championâs counterclaim must be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Damages</p>    <p><a name="p315" class="para" id="p315">315.</a>  Yung was in clear breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Companies.  He is liable to make good the loss to the Companies.  Mr Lamsubmits that Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty occurred at the time of sale of the Units.  The loss is represented by the differencebetween the then open market value of the respective Units and the sale price.  The damages to be awarded to Goldmark in respectof the sale of Unit 1D is $1.2 million ($3.4 million - $2.2 million).  The damages to be awarded to World Champ in respect of thesale of Unit 1A is $1.35 million ($3.4 million - $2.05 million).  The total damages to be awarded to the Plaintiff is therefore $2.55million.</p>    <p><a name="p316" class="para" id="p316">316.</a>  Yung and Cheung argue that as the Units were subsequently sold by Global Fair for $3.8 million, which was $0.45 million below whatGlobal Fair had paid, the Companies suffered no loss.  While their argument is short of saying that Yungâs breach of fiduciaryduty was of service to the Companies, they submit that there was no reason why the Court should âstop the clockâ and assess damagesas at the date of breach.</p>    <p><a name="p317" class="para" id="p317">317.</a>  In <i>Target Holdings Ltd And Redferns (a firm) and another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 421</a>, Lord Browne-Wilkinson made an important statement of the principles concerning a trusteeâs liability to pay equitable compensationauffered by the beneficiary as a result of his breach of trust.  His Lordship said at 437:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA trustee who wrongly pays away trust money, like a trustee who makes an unauthorised investment, commits a breach of trust andcomes under an immediate duty to remedy such breach.  If immediate proceedings are brought, the court will make an immediate orderrequiring restoration to the trust fund of the assets wrongly distributed or, in the case of an unauthorised investment, will orderthe sale of the unauthorised investment and the payment of compensation for any loss suffered.  But the fact that there is an accruedcause of action as soon as the breach is committed does not in my judgment mean that the quantum of the compensation payable is ultimatelyfixed as at the date when the breach occurred.  The quantum is fixed at the date of judgment at which date, according to the circumstancesthen pertaining, the compensation is assessed at the figure then necessary to put the trust estate or the beneficiary back into theposition it would have been in had there been no breach.  I can see no justification for âstopping the clockâ immediately insome cases but not in others: to do so may, as in this case, lead to compensating the trust estate or the beneficiary for a losswhich, on the facts known at trial, it has never suffered.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>His Lordship then went on to consider the Canadian authority of <i>Canson Enterprises Ltd v Boughton &amp; Co</i> (1991) 85 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 129.  At 438 of his judgment, his Lordship quoted with approval the judgment of McLachlin J in that case.  He said after referringto that case:</p>    <p class="quote">ââ¦, I extract the following statements.</p>    <p>At  p.160:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhile foreseeability of loss does not enter into the calculation of compensation for breach of fiduciary duty, liability is notunlimited.  Just as restitution in specie is limited to the property under the trusteeâs control, so equitable compensation mustbe limited to loss flowing from the trusteeâs acts in relation to the interest he undertook to protect.  Thus, Davidson states[âThe Equitable Remedy of Compensationâ  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%203%20Melbourne%20University%20Law%20Review%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 3 Melbourne U.L. Rev. 349]</a>  âIt is imperative to ascertain the loss <i>resulting from breach of the relevant equitable duty</i>â (at p. 354, emphasis added).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At p. 162:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> â A related question which must be addressed is the time of assessment of the loss.  In this area tort and contract law are oflittle help. â¦ The basis of compensation at equity, by contrast, is the restoration of the actual value of the thing lost throughthe breach.  The foreseeable value of the items is not in issue.  As a result, the losses are to be assessed as at the time of trial,<i>using the full benefit of</i> hindsight.â  (Emphasis added.)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At p. 163:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> â In summary, compensation is an equitable monetary remedy which is available when the equitable remedies of restitution and accountare not appropriate.  By analogy with restitution, it attempts to restore to the plaintiff what has been lost as a result of thebreach, i.e., the plaintiffâs loss of opportunity.  The plaintiffâs actual loss as a consequence of the breach is to be assessedwith the full benefit of hindsight.  Foreseeability is not a concern in assessing the compensation but it is essential that the lossmade good are only those which, <i>on a common sense view of causation</i>, were caused by the breach.â (Emphasis added.)</p>        <p>In my view this is good law.  Equitable compensation for breach of trust is designed to achieve exactly what the word compensationsuggests: to make good a loss in fact suffered by the beneficiaries and which, using hindsight and common sense, can be seen to havebeen caused by the breach.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p318" class="para" id="p318">318.</a>  Thus, Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that the two principles fundamental to an award of damages at common law apply equally to equity:firstly, the directorâs breach must have caused the damage; and secondly, the company is to be put in the same position as it wouldhave been in if the director had not been in breach of duty.  The principle in assessing equitable compensation is basically to putthe trust estate or the beneficiary back into the position it would have been in had there been no breach.  There is no hard andfast rule whether to âstop the clockâ at the time of the breach.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to assess the compensationas at the time of breach, but some times it may not.  The appropriate time to make the assessment is at the date of judgment.  Thecourt shall assess what is just and equitable according to the circumstances pertaining at that time.  In making the assessment,the court shall use hindsight and common sense.  If by reason of some intervening event, the loss has been averted or mitigated,there was no reason to âstop the clockâ.  In <i>Target Holdings Limited</i>, Lord Browne-Wilkinson found the beneficiary suffered no compensatable loss at the date of judgment. </p>    <p><a name="p319" class="para" id="p319">319.</a>  I consider I am bound by the above principles.  I reject Yungâs and Cheungâs argument that the Plaintiff suffered no loss. That Cheung sold the Units at a loss was her choice and not Goldmarkâs or World Champâs.  The loss was the consequence of hermis-investment.  There is no reason why Goldmarkâs damages should be assessed as at the time when Cheung decided to actualise herloss.  Had Yung not been in breach of fiduciary duty and had Cheung and Global Fair not assisted in that breach, the question ofdamages would never have arisen.  Now that it has, it has to be assessed in accordance with established legal principles.</p>    <p><a name="p320" class="para" id="p320">320.</a>  The present case has taken fourteen years to come to conclusion.  That was a very long time.  At the time of breach, the Units weresold at an undervalue.  Subsequently, the Units were sold by Global Fair and Start Win for $3.8 million at a loss in October 2006. Property price fluctuated during these sixteen years.  I have not been provided with the valuation of the Units at the height ofthe property market during these sixteen years or as at today.  Certainly, those valuations were much higher than the price paidby Global Fair.  Under the principle in <i>Target Holdings Limited</i>, the Plaintiff is entitled to have his damages assessed with hindsight and common sense.  Approaching the assessment with hindsightand common sense, the Companies would either have sold the Units in 1993 if a sale was necessary or retained the Units.  Under thefirst scenario, the sale would not have been a forced sale.  The Companies would have been able to recover the open market valueof the Units at that time.  If so, the Units could not have been sold in 2006 for $3.8 million.  If the Units had been retained untiltoday, the Companies would have been entitled to realise the open market value today after giving credit to the $4.25 million whichthey had received.  The Plaintiff could have asked for assessment as at the date of judgment.  In that case, I believe, the differencebetween the open market value today and the price for which the Units were sold to Global Fair would have been much higher. </p>    <p><a name="p321" class="para" id="p321">321.</a>  The Plaintiff only asks to have damages assessed as at the time of breach.  That is extremely reasonable.  Accordingly, the Plaintiff,in the shoes of the Companies, is entitled to damages assessed as the difference between the open market value at the time of breachof fiduciary duty and the sale price of $4.25 million, i.e. $2.55 million. </p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion for Sale of Units Claim against Yung and Mrs Yung</p>    <p><a name="p322" class="para" id="p322">322.</a>  Yung was in clear breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Companies.

Cheung and Global Fair dishonestly assisted Yung by concealing his interest in the Units and were knowing recipientsof trust properties which had been disposed of by Yung in breach of his fiduciary duty to the Companies.  Upon Global Fair assigningUnit 1A to Start Win, Start Win was knowing recipient of trust property which had been disposed of by Yung in breach of fiduciaryduty to Goldmark and/or World Champ.  Start Win also dishonestly assisted Yung in the disposition and acquisition of the Units byassisting him in continuing to conceal his interest in Unit 1A.  Global Fair and Start Win therefore held the Units respectivelyas constructive trustees for the Companies and were liable to account to the Companies. </p>    <p class="heading">Cheungâs case</p>    <p><a name="p324" class="para" id="p324">324.</a>  Cheungâs defence is that she and Global Fair were <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty, if any.  She saw the advertisement for the auction of theUnits on 12 July 1993 by coincidence.  She recalled that the Units were the offices of Goldmark.  She enquired from Yung about theUnits and told Yung that she wanted to purchase them as an investment and to keep her investment in the Units secret from her husband. Yung then advised her to use corporate vehicles for holding the Units.  She bid for the Units.  Out of convenience, Yung paid thedeposit for her.  She was the only bidder.  The Units were sold to her at armâs length.  The purchase price she paid reflectedthe forced sale value of the Units.  The Units were purchased by her using her own funds and funds borrowed from her friends including$1.35 million from Yung and Mrs Yung.</p>    <p><a name="p325" class="para" id="p325">325.</a>  Cheung also pleaded limitation.  She was not joined in this action until 6 September 2000 when she was served the Writ and Statementof Claim amended pursuant to the order of Master Barnes, as she then was, on 1 September 2000, which was more than seven years fromthe events giving rise to the claims against her.</p>    <p class="heading">The law - dishonest assistance and knowing receipt</p>    <p><a name="p326" class="para" id="p326">326.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim against Cheung, Global Fair and Start Win is based on dishonest assistance in Yungâs breach of trust andknowing receipt of trust property.  A person other than a director of a company may also be liable for the directorâs breach offiduciary duty as accessory by rendering dishonest assistance to the director and for knowing receipt of assets which are traceableto the breach of fiduciary duty. </p>    <p><a name="p327" class="para" id="p327">327.</a>  The leading authority on the principles of liability for dishonest assistance are set out in the Privy Council decision of <i>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Philip Tan Kok Ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 378.</a>  The Privy Counsel held that where a third party dishonestly assisted a trustee to commit a breach of trust or procured him to doso, the third party would be liable to the beneficiary for the loss occasioned by the breach of trust, even though the third partyhad received no trust property and irrespective of whether the trustee had been dishonest or fraudulent.  To be liable as an accessory,the assister must have deliberately or knowingly interfered in the trust relationship by assisting the trustee in depriving the beneficiaryof the property held for him by the trustee.  The assister must know that he was assisting in a breach of trust.  He must also haveassisted with a dishonest state of mind.  The test of dishonesty contains a subjective and an objective element. Acting dishonestlyor acting with a lack of probity, which is synonymous, means not acting as an honest person would act in the circumstances and couldusually be equated with conscious impropriety as distinct from inadvertent or negligent conduct or carelessness, although a thirdparty might be acting dishonestly if he recklessly disregarded the rights of others by turning a blind eye.  In that context, dishonestyis to be judged objectively.  But the third partyâs conduct has also to be assessed on the basis of his actual knowledge at thetime and not what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated.  Regard may be had to his personal attributes including experienceand intelligence and the reason for his acting in that way.  To this extent, the test of dishonesty is subjective. The test is putin this way by Lord Hutton in <i>Twinsectra v Yardley and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%20AC%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] AC 164</a> at 172: the test is whether the accessory has acted dishonestly by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people and hashimself been aware that by those standards he was acting dishonestly.</p>    <p><a name="p328" class="para" id="p328">328.</a>  The principle in respect of an accessoryâs liability based on knowing receipt has been set out by Hoffmann LJ, as he then was,in <i>El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20BCC%20143" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] BCC 143</a> at 154.  To establish liability on a recipient of trust property, the plaintiff must show, first a disposal of his assets in breachof fiduciary duty; secondly, the beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets which are traceable as representing the assets ofthe plaintiff; and thirdly, knowledge on the part of the defendant that the assets are traceable to a breach of fiduciary duty. The principle has been approved by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Brown v Bennett</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20BCC%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] BCC 525</a> at 530 which stressed that the receipt must be the direct consequence of the alleged breach of trust or fiduciary duty of which therecipient is said to have notice.</p>    <p><a name="p329" class="para" id="p329">329.</a>  On the third ingredient, Cheung refers to the five categories of knowledge in <i>Baden and others v Societe Generale pour Favoriser le Development du Commerce et de lâIndustrie en France SA (Note)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 509</a> (â<i>Baden scale</i>â) and submits that the authorities have not given any definitive view as to the level of knowledge required for liability.  Thefive categories of knowledge on the <i>Baden scale</i> are: (1) actual knowledge; (2) wilfully shutting oneâs eyes to the obvious; (3) wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiriesas an honest and reasonable person would make; (4) knowledge of circumstances which would indicate the facts to an honest and reasonableperson; and (5) knowledge of circumstances which would put an honest and reasonable person on inquiry.  Under the classical categorisation,the first three categories have been taken to constitute actual knowledge or its equivalent and the last two objective and constructiveknowledge respectively.  Cheung submits that only actual knowledge within the meaning of the first category of knowledge under the<i>Baden</i> <i>scale</i> will fix the third party recipient with liability whereas constructive knowledge, objective knowledge or imputed knowledge is notenough.</p>    <p><a name="p330" class="para" id="p330">330.</a>  Accessory liability based on knowing receipt is a fairly recently developed principle.  The authorities in the United Kingdom weredivided as to which of the five categories of knowledge will suffice.  The situation has been clarified by the English Court of Appealin <i>Bank of Credit and Commercial International (Overseas) Limited v Akindele</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20Ch%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] Ch 437.</a>  While retaining the three ingredients necessary for liability based on knowing receipt, Nourse LJ held at 455 that the recipientâsstate of knowledge must be such as to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt.  It is therefore no longernecessary or appropriate to find into which category the recipientâs knowledge fell.  The knowledge required to fix the recipientwith liability is such knowledge as would make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt.  Actual knowledgeis certainly sufficient.  But that does not mean any of the other four categories of knowledge must necessarily be insufficient. It depends on all the circumstances of the case.  The test is whether it is unconscionable for the recipient to retain the benefitof the receipt. </p>    <p><a name="p331" class="para" id="p331">331.</a>  Prior to <i>BCCI (Overseas) Ltd</i>, the courts had not properly addressed their minds to the distinction between knowing assistance and knowing receipt.  The instinctiveapproach of most equity judges has been to assume that constructive knowledge as in the case of knowing assistance is enough forknowing receipt.  Other judges adopt the more restrictive approach of requiring actual knowledge.  This distinction is importantin explaining the proper approach to be adopted in respect of the two different forms of liability.  A claim based on knowing assistanceis a proprietary claim attached to the property.  For that reason, notice, actual or constructive, of another personâs beneficialclaim to the property may suffice for this form of liability.  On the other hand, the claim based on knowing receipt is a personalclaim founded on constructive trust arising from operation of law.  Actual knowledge is therefore required to bind the conscienceof the constructive trustee.  Constructive knowledge is not enough.  This distinction was recognised by Sir Robert Megarry V-C in<i>In re Montaguâs Settlement Trust</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20Ch%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] Ch 264</a> at 278.  He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe former is concerned with the question whether a person takes property subject to or free from some equity.  The latter is concernedwith whether or not a person is to have imposed upon him the personal burdens and obligations of trusteeship.  I do not see why oneof the touchstones for determining the burdens on property should be the same as that for deciding whether to impose a personal obligationon a [person].  The cold calculus of constructive and imputed notice does not seem to me to be an appropriate instrument for decidingwhether a [personâs] conscience is sufficiently affected for it to be right to bind him by the obligations of a constructive trustee.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At 285, his Lordship concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)  The equitable doctrine of tracing and the imposition of a constructive trust by reason of the knowing receipt of trust propertyare governed by different rules and must be kept distinct.  Tracing is primarily a means of determining the rights of property, whereasthe imposition of a constructive trust creates personal obligations that go beyond mere property rights.  (2)  In considering whethera constructive trust has arisen in a case of the knowing receipt of trust property, the basic question is whether the conscienceof the recipient is sufficiently affected to justify the imposition of such a trust.  (3)  Whether a constructive trust arises insuch a case primarily depends on the knowledge of the recipient, and not on notice to him; and for clarity it is desirable to usethe word âknowledgeâ and avoid the word ânoticeâ in such cases.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In essence, his Lordship was of the opinion that in order to establish liability for knowing receipt, the recipient must have actualknowledge or the equivalent that the assets received are traceable to a breach of trust and that constructive knowledge is not enough.</p>    <p><a name="p332" class="para" id="p332">332.</a>  The dicta of Sir Robert Megarry V-C in <i>In re Montaguâs Settlement Trust</i> was approved by Nourse LJ in <i>BCCI (Overseas) Ltd</i>.  Nourse LJ also considered the distinction between knowing assistance and knowing receipt important.  His Lordship reviewed a numberof English authorities in which it was held that in commercial transactions, constructive knowledge is not enough: see <i>Eagle Trust plc v SBC Securities Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20484" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 484</a>, <i>Cowan de Groot Properties Ltd v Eagle Trust plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%204%20All%20ER%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 4 All ER 700</a> and <i>Eagle Trust plc v SBC Securities Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20BCLC%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 BCLC 121.</a>  However, the preferred view reached in three decisions involving commercial transactions in New Zealand was that constructive knowledgewas enough: see <i>Wespac Banking Corpn v Savin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%202%20NZLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 2 NZLR 41</a>, <i>Equiticorp Industries Group Ltd v Hawkins</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%203%20NZLR%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 3 NZLR 700</a> and <i>Lankshear v ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20NZLR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 NZLR 481.</a>  A contrary view was reached in Canada in <i>Citadel General Assurance Co v Lloyds Bank Canada</i> (1997) 152 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 411. </p>    <p><a name="p333" class="para" id="p333">333.</a>  After reviewing the authorities, Nourse LJ made the observation that the claim in constructive trust in <i>Baden</i> was based on knowing assistance and not on knowing receipt.  He then referred to Lord Nichollsâ dicta in <i>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan</i> at 392 that âknowinglyâ was better avoided as a defining ingredient of the liability and and affirmed the unconscionability testas adopted by Buckley LJ in <i>Belmont Finance Corpn Ltd v Willaims Furniture Ltd</i> (No 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20All%20ER%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 All ER 393</a> at 405 or by Sir Robert Megarry V-C in <i>In re Montaguâs Settlement Trusts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20Ch%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] Ch 264</a> at 273.  His Lordship said at 455:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn <i>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 378</a>, which is now the leading authority on knowing assistance, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council,said, at p 392G, that âknowinglyâ was better avoided as a defining ingredient of the liability, and that in that context the<i>Baden</i> categorisation was best forgotten.  Although my own view is that the categorisation is often helpful in identifying different statesof knowledge which may or may not result in a finding of dishonesty for the purposes of knowing assistance, I have grave doubts aboutits utility in cases of knowing receipt.  Quite apart from its origins in a context of knowing assistance and the reservations ofKnox and Millett JJ, any categorisation is of little value unless the purpose it is to serve is adequately defined, whether it isfivehold, as in the <i>Baden</i> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 509</a>, or twofold, as in the classical division between actual and constructive knowledge, a division which has itself become blurred inrecent authorities.â</p>        <p>  What then, in the context of knowing receipt, is the purpose to be served by a categorisation of knowledge?  It can only be to enablethe court to determine whether, in the words of Buckley LJ in <i>Belmont Finance Corpn Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20All%20ER%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 All ER 393</a>, 405, the recipient can âconscientiously retain [the] funds against the companyâ or, in the words of Sir Robert Megarry V-C in<i>In re Montaguâs Settlement Trusts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20Ch%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] Ch 264</a>, 273, â[the recipientâs] conscience is sufficiently affected for it to be right to bind him by the obligations of a constructivetrusteeâ.  But, if that is the purpose, there is no need for categorisation.  All that is necessary is that the recipientâs stateof knowledge should be such as to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt.</p>        <p>  For these reasons I have come to the view that, just as there is now a single test of dishonesty for knowing assistance, so oughtthere to be a single test of knowledge for knowing receipt.  The recipientâs state of knowledge must be such as to make it unconscionablefor him to retain the benefit of the receipt.  A test in that form, though it cannot, any more than any other, avoid difficultiesof application, ought to avoid those of definition and allocation to which the previous categorisations have led.  Moreover, it shouldbetter enable the courts to give commonsense decision in the commercial context in which claims in knowing receipt are now frequentlymade paying equal regard to the wisdom of Lindley LJ on the one hand and of Richardson J on the other.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Thus, the modern test of liability for knowing receipt is whether it is unconscionable for the recipient to retain the benefit ofthe receipt.  In applying the test the court is no longer confined to look at the knowledge of the recipient but to look at all thecircumstances of the receipt.  This test has done away with the difficulties caused by the fivefold or twofold categorisation ofknowledge.  Actual knowledge in the sense of the first category of knowledge in the <i>Baden</i> <i>scale</i> is undoubtedly an important and in most cases decisive factor in determining unconscionability.  But that does not mean the otherfour categories of knowledge are irrelevant.  The question is whether the recipientâs knowledge, whatever its categorisation onthe <i>Baden</i> <i>scale</i>, is in all the circumstances such as to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt.</p>    <p class="heading">The approach and issues</p>    <p><a name="p334" class="para" id="p334">334.</a>  In the previous section, I have found that Yung was in breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Companies.  Thus, the main issues inrespect of the claim against Cheung and her companies are whether Cheung had knowledge of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty and wasa party to or knowingly assisted in Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty to the Companies by purchasing the Units and that she did sowith dishonest intention.  The burden of proof is on the Plaintiff.  There is no direct evidence of such knowledge or intention onthe part of Cheung.  Proof will have to be by inference which may be reasonably drawn from basic facts proved.  The basic facts areset out in the sub-section below.  They are indisputable and were disclosed by documents discovered in the course of liquidationof the Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p335" class="para" id="p335">335.</a>  The thrust of the Plaintiffâs case is coincidence, secrecy and Yungâs financing in Cheungâs purchase of the Units.  Mr Lamsubmits that Cheung would not have by a series of coincidences bid for the Units and did the series of acts set out in the backgroundfacts below unless pursuant to an agreement or design of Yung.  The secrecy with which Cheung concealed her identity as the personbehind all those acts gives support to the adverse inference which may reasonably be drawn against her.  But of course, Cheung hasher explanations too.  The dispute between the parties boils down to three issues.  Firstly, are Cheungâs explanations credible? To determine that issue, it is necessary to find who were in control of Avant Garde, Global Fair and Start Win and whether Cheungâsexplanations for the coincidences leading to her bidding for the Units credible.  Ultimately, the key to the mystery is who was orwere the source of funds used for purchasing the Units.  On that issue, much turns on the inference to be drawn from the fund movementas a result of the transfer of Unit 1A to Start Win and the mortgage of Unit 1D after November 1993.  Secondly, if Cheungâs explanationsare not credible, could the inference of Cheungâs knowledge of and intention to assist Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty be reasonablydrawn against her.  Thirdly, did Cheung assist in Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty with dishonesty.  The explanations are solelymatters within Cheungâs knowledge.  They are difficult to rebut, especially the explanations involved Avant Garde, a BVI bearershare company which masks the identity of its true owner. </p>    <p><a name="p336" class="para" id="p336">336.</a>  The Plaintiffâs case against Cheung is built on inferences to be drawn from basic facts, most of which are not in dispute.  Theadverse inference to be drawn against Cheungâs conduct is overwhelming.  Cheung offers explanations for what she did.  Her evidenceis corroborated by Yungâs.  Of course, such evidence is exclusively within the knowledge of Cheung and Yung and is difficult torebut or challenged.  But on the other hand, there is a general lack of documentary evidence in support of part of their case wheresuch corroborating evidence is reasonably expected, such as bank statements.  Many of the facts and inferences to be drawn from thebasic facts are intertwined, particularly those relating to the transfer of Unit 1A to Start Win and the mortgage of Unit 1D to HSBC. It is impossible to analyse these facts in any orderly and compartmentalised manner without some degree of overlapping and repetition.</p>    <p><a name="p337" class="para" id="p337">337.</a>  The factual issues in respect of Global Fairâs and Start Winâs liability based on knowing receipt are the same.  I have foundYung was in breach of fiduciary duty in disposing of the Units.  It is beyond dispute that Global Fair and Start Win were recipientsof the Units belonging to the Companies.  The remaining issue is whether they had knowledge that the Units were traceable to thebreach of fiduciary duty and the knowledge is such as to make it unconscionable for them to retain the benefit of the receipt ofthe Units.</p>    <p class="heading">The factual background</p>    <p><a name="p338" class="para" id="p338">338.</a>  The factual background is as set out in paragraphs 90 to 103 above.  The following are the further finding of fact relevant to thisclaim against Cheung and her related companies.</p>    <p><a name="p339" class="para" id="p339">339.</a>  On 14 July 1993, Cheung bid for the Units.  The deposit of $850,000 was paid by Mrs Yung from the funds of Wealth Country and herown funds kept in HSBC to Messrs HLLY which was the solicitor acting for Goldmark as vendor of the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p340" class="para" id="p340">340.</a>  On 15 July 1993, Yung instructed Messrs WS to take over from Messrs HLLY as solicitors for the sale of the Units.  On 16 July 1993,Yung on behalf of the Companies accepted Global Fairâs tender and sold the Units to Global Fair at $4.25 million.</p>    <p><a name="p341" class="para" id="p341">341.</a>  On 21 July 1993, Messrs WS received $1,350,000 from Global Fair in part payment of the purchase price for the Units.  The said sumwas drawn from the accounts of Wealth Country and Mrs Yung.  On or about 27 July 1993, Messrs WS received the balance of the purchaseprice in the amount of $2,050,000 from Global Fairâs solicitors, Messrs YC Leung &amp; Co. (âMessrs YCLâ).  The funds originatedfrom Cheungâs account with HSBC.  Messrs WS repaid Goldmarkâs outstanding loan due to Rabobank with the proceeds of sale.  Thesale and purchase was completed on 28 July 1993.</p>    <p><a name="p342" class="para" id="p342">342.</a>  Together with the deposit paid by Mrs Yung, the total amount paid by Yung and Mrs Yung was $2.2 million which was exactly the purchaseprice for Unit 1D.  Cheungâs case is that this was a loan which was later repaid.  The amount of $2.05 million paid by Cheung neatlymatched the purchase price for Unit 1A. </p>    <p><a name="p343" class="para" id="p343">343.</a>  Vos commenced winding up proceedings against the Companies in August 1993.  As a result, the title deeds of the Units were withheldby the Official Receiver, despite that the sale of the Units had been completed on 28 July 1993.  The title deeds were subsequentlyreleased to Global Fair on 25 September 1993. </p>    <p><a name="p344" class="para" id="p344">344.</a>  On 12 November 1993, with Yungâs assistance, Cheung and Global Fair mortgaged Unit 1D to HSBC as security for overdraft facilitiesto be granted to New Champion.  Cheungâs explanation is that the facilities were used to repay Dr Ho who lent her $500,000 to purchasethe Units and to finance her veterinary business in addition to the business purpose of New Champion.</p>    <p><a name="p345" class="para" id="p345">345.</a>  On 24 November 1993, Global Fair assigned Unit 1A to Start Win at a purported purchase price of $4 million.  Start Win obtaineda loan of $2 million from Dao Heng Bank secured against the mortgage of Unit 1A as security.  A sum of $1.9 million from the proceedsof the loan which were paid to Global Fair as Start Winâs purchase price was paid over to Yung.  Cheungâs explanation is thatthe money was used to repay Yung and Mrs Yung in part for their loan of $2.2 million.</p>    <p><a name="p346" class="para" id="p346">346.</a>  In December 1993, Cheung commenced operating a veterinary clinic in Unit 1D under the name of Phoenix Veterinary Clinic.  She employedDr Dalglish as the veterinary surgeon and Au as his assistant and to develop her veterinary business.  Since 1994, Yung moved intoUnit 1D to manage and supervise the operation of the clinic.  New Champion also operated from Unit 1D.  Then Dr Dalglish left andwas replaced by Dr Dahn.  The clinic was closed down in April 1995.  Since August 1994, Unit 1A was rented to Acota Limited.  Therental income was paid over to Yung.  Cheungâs explanation is that the rental income was used to repay the balance of the loanfrom Yung and Mrs Yung.  </p>    <p><a name="p347" class="para" id="p347">347.</a>  In the course of the years, New Championâs overdraft from the HSBC and Start Winâs mortgage loan from Dao Heng Bank againstwhich the Units were secured were repaid.  The Units were sold in October 2006 for $3.8 million.  A sum of $2.25 million from theproceeds of sale was paid into court pending the outcome of this litigation.  Cheung claimed that the mortgage loans were repaidfrom the income from her medical practice.  But she produced no documentary evidence in suppot of her allegation.</p>    <p><a name="p348" class="para" id="p348">348.</a>  The above paragraphs set out the factual background which is undisputed.  What is in dispute is the inferences to be raised fromthe above factual background which are particularly relevant to the Plaintiffâs claim and germane to Cheungâs defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The circumstances leading to and surrounding Cheungâs participation in the auction</p>    <p><a name="p349" class="para" id="p349">349.</a>  The circumstances how Cheung came to participate in the auction are matters solely within the knowledge of Yung and Cheung.  Themajor dispute between the parties is whether Cheung coincidentally came to read about the advertisement for the auction or that shecame to know about and participate in the auction by design. </p>    <p><a name="p350" class="para" id="p350">350.</a>  There is no dispute that Cheung first entered the scene in early 1992 when she and her husband visited Goldmarkâs stall in theHolland Festival and purchased some Van Nelle coffee promoted by Goldmark.  There is also no dispute that thereafter Cheung visitedthe office of Goldmark and was introduced to Vos.  What happened thereafter is in dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p351" class="para" id="p351">351.</a>  According to Vos, between April and May 1992, Yung told him that his friend Dr Winnie Cheung who was a medical practitioner andtrusted him completely was interested in becoming a shareholder of Goldmark and would be willing to provide funds to Goldmark.  Yungsaid that he had successfully invested Cheungâs funds in foreign currency trading.  Vos declined the suggestion as there was noneed for more capital at that time.  Soon after that Cheung visited Goldmark and was formally introduced to Vos.  Thereafter Yungtalked to Vos about Cheung about once a month until May 1993.  The discussions were usually in the context of Yungâs son receivingtreatment from Cheung, but Yung also suggested on several occasions to admit Cheung as a shareholder in Goldmark.  Vos consistentlyresisted the suggestion.  Yung and Cheung denied that Cheung had expressed any interest in investing in Goldmark.  On the totalityof the evidence, I find Vos more credible.  Vosâ answers under cross-examination were spontaneous.  His evidence that Yung hadmentioned about his success in foreign currency trading for Cheung was supported by Goldmarkâs activities in foreign currency trading. At that time, Goldmark had made significant break through in its business by acquiring the Hillâs distributorship and appearedto have strong business potential.  It is understandable that Yung might wish his old friend to be part of this promising businessand so that he might have greater control over Goldmark.  I accept Vosâ evidence.  But this finding has no real significance. </p>    <p><a name="p352" class="para" id="p352">352.</a>  On the more critical issue as to how Cheung came to see the advertisement about the auction or whether she saw it at all, Cheungâsevidence, which is challenged by the Plaintiff, is as follows.  Since her childhood, Cheung was deeply impressed by her parents ofthe need to invest in property.  She had always wanted to invest in some properties which she would leave to her children.  Aftergiving birth to her third child, she began looking for properties for investment.  Hence, it was her habit to read property advertisementsin her leisure during her long lunch breaks.  On 12 July 1993, she saw the advertisement about the auction of the Units.  She recalledthose were the offices of Goldmark.  After she had returned to her clinic and handled a few patients, she telephoned Yung.  Yungtold her that the Units were worth purchasing as an investment and could rent for at least $15,000 a month.  She discussed brieflyabout her husbandâs speculation activities in foreign currencies or what she called gambling problem, her wish to keep her propertyinvestment secret from her husband and that she wanted to pass the properties to her children.  Then Yung suggested to her the useof corporate vehicles and overseas bearer share companies to hold the Units.  She had never heard about bearer share companies before. Yung suggested her to seek the services of William Leung. </p>    <p><a name="p353" class="para" id="p353">353.</a>  On the following day, Cheung telephoned Yung and discussed about the price to bid for the Units.  Yung did not give her any suggestedprice but said words to the effect that âthe higher the betterâ and âaccording to and appropriate to her meansâ.  She alsoenquired more about the use of corporate vehicles for holding the Units.  Yung reassured her that things were not complicated andthat he would inform William Leung to make the necessary arrangements.</p>    <p><a name="p354" class="para" id="p354">354.</a>  On the morning of 14 July 1993, Cheung telephoned Yung and confirmed that she would bid for Unit 1A and Unit 1D at $2.05 millionand $2.2 million respectively.  She told Yung the inconvenience she had of having to go to HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank to collectsufficient cash to purchase a bank draft to pay the deposit and then to go to Hong Kong to lodge the tender form.  Yung then offeredto arrange for the bank draft and to prepare the tender form for her.  Later that morning, Au took the tender form with the conditionof sale annexed to Cheungâs clinic for her signature. </p>    <p><a name="p355" class="para" id="p355">355.</a>  Cheungâs evidence is corroborated by Yungâs.  Yung said that he and Mrs Yung initially intended to purchase the Units and hadtaken some preparatory steps to do so such as instructing William Leung to arrange for Avant Garde as the corporate vehicle for holdingthe Units.  It was during the very time of the tender period that Cheung telephoned him all out of the blues coincidentally and toldhim that she was interested in bidding for the Units.  He then happily decided it was not necessary for them to bid, though unknownto him Mrs Yung stood by to bid just in case Cheung desisted at the last moment.</p>    <p><a name="p356" class="para" id="p356">356.</a>  Understandably, the Plaintiff could offer no evidence to contradict Cheungâs and Yungâs allegations which were solely withintheir knowledge.  Mr Lam challenged the credibility of Yungâs evidence in cross-examination.  He referred to Yungâs evidencegiven during the Official Receiverâs examination, in which Yung said unequivocally that he had not told anyone about the auction. Yung also said that he had not told any of his friends about the problems he had with the Companies.  He mentioned nothing aboutthe sudden telephone call from Cheung.  That evidence is inconsistent with his evidence now before the Court in support of Cheungâsevidence.  In reply to Mr Lamâs cross-examination, Yung explained that what he had told the master during the examination was truebecause he had indeed not told Cheung about the auction but it was Cheung who talked to him about the auction.  I find such argumentartificial and disingenuous.  At that stage, Yung was obviously concealing his and Cheungâs involvement in the auction.  He mightdo so for an innocent purpose as he might think the truth would be damaging to his case or might unnecessarily implicate Cheung. If that were his explanation today, I might accept the explanation as an innocent one though his choice to lie was a bad choicemade in the confusion of the moment.  But that is not the case.  Instead, he tried to be semantic and crafty.  I find him evasiveand defensive.  His demeanour and the tenor of his evidence when tested against incontrovertible evidence shows that he is incredible. His dishonesty as established in the Misappropriation Claims and the Sale of Units Claim proven against him, his assertion thathis maid, Lita, who was asked to make up payment vouchers was Vosâ clerk etc show how ready he was to lie before the Court.  Yungwas not telling the truth during the Official Receiverâs examination as well as now before the Court.  I do not believe in hisevidence that his discussion with Cheung about the purchase of the Units was by coincidence.</p>    <p><a name="p357" class="para" id="p357">357.</a>  Having disposed of Yungâs corroborating evidence, I now turn to examine the inherent credibility of Cheungâs evidence.  Mr Lamsubmits that a special feature in this case is Cheungâs lack of involvement in relation to the purchase and taking possession ofthe Units.  Prior to bidding, Cheung had not visited the Units, made no enquiries as to their current market price from estate agentsor HSBC with whom she was familiar, had not checked the title of the Units, the terms of the tender, and had not sought legal adviceetc.  Much of what Mr Lam submits is counsel of wisdom.  Cheung had been to Unit 1D before on numerous occasions and was familiarwith the place.  She had made some enquiries about the Units from Yung whom she trusted.  She was informed of the price at whichthe Units were purchased a year ago.  On her evidence, she was bargain hunting and was consciously making a very low offer.  I donot think too much could be said for what Cheung had not done and should have done. </p>    <p><a name="p358" class="para" id="p358">358.</a>  However, it was unusual that Yung would have completed the tender form, paid the deposit and lodged the tender form for her andall that Cheung did to make her investment of $4.25 million was to sign her name on the tender form which had been prepared for anddelivered to her.  I also find it remarkable in what she further alleged, that she had not even asked or been informed of the timefor completion and when the balance of the purchase price had to be paid.</p>    <p><a name="p359" class="para" id="p359">359.</a>  Mr Lam submits that it was unusual that after her bid had been accepted, Cheung did not visit the Units to see what she had boughtuntil mid August 1993 and did not check the then market value of the Units to ascertain if she had made a good bargain.  Most peculiarly,she did not even take possession after she had paid the full purchase price.  On her evidence, Cheung did not even know that Unit1D was equipped as a veterinary clinic with expensive clinic instruments and X-ray machine.  Cheung explained that as Yung was outof Hong Kong she did not wish to trouble Mrs Yung to show her around the Units.  I find it incredible that she did not even do theleast to assert her ownership in the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p360" class="para" id="p360">360.</a>  Furthermore, all those unusual features which could otherwise be explained on the basis that Cheung and Yung were trusted friendsbecome suspicious and inexplicable when viewed together with the inferences to be drawn from my other findings.  Those other findings,which I shall deal with below, are the payment of deposit by Yung on her behalf, Yungâs financing of the purchase price which matchedthe purchase price of Unit 1D, Cheungâs concealment of her identity as the person behind Global Fair bidding for the Units, theunusual corporate structure used for holding the Units, the appointment of Au as director of Global Fair in October 1993 and thesubsequent dealing with the Units.  Principally because I reject Cheungâs and Yungâs evidence and draw certain inferences frommy factual findings in respect of the above issues, I draw as the only irresistible inference that Cheung did not come to know aboutthe advertisement and bid in the auction by coincidence but by design.  As I have said, all those inferences and factual findingsare all intertwined.  I shall analyse them in greater details below.  I shall come back to what that design was after completingmy analysis of the evidence.  For the time being, suffice it is to say that I find that Cheung bid for the Units by design ratherthan by coincidence. </p>    <p class="heading">The secrecy and concealment of Cheungâs identity as owner of Global Fair and purchaser of the Units</p>    <p><a name="p361" class="para" id="p361">361.</a>  Another special feature in this case is the secrecy and concealment of Cheungâs identity as the owner of Global Fair and StartWin and the person who signed the tender form bidding for the Units for and on behalf of Global Fair.  This is some evidence on whichinference could be raised as to Cheungâs knowledge of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty and her dishonest intention in the purchase. The evidence is also relevant as to Cheungâs defence of limitation.</p>    <p><a name="p362" class="para" id="p362">362.</a>  Mr Lam submits that Cheung and Yung made great efforts to conceal Cheungâs identity as the person behind Global Fair in the purchaseof the Units.  In the tender form, Cheung described herself as âDr Cheungâ without giving her full name and used an illegiblesignature which on her own evidence she had not used for over eight years and that signature was only used in her doctorâs notesand laboratory forms while she was working in Prince of Wales Hospital.  That signature was never used in formal documents such ascheques or legal documents.  Cheung was unable to explain why she did not use her usual legible signature.  When pressed, she offeredno reason but that the purchase represented âa new leaf in her lifeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p363" class="para" id="p363">363.</a>  In her consent to act as director of Global Fair and other documents filed with the Companies Registry dated 19 July 1993 and onthe share certificates of Avant Garde, Cheung signed in Chinese as âWing Yeeâ, which admittedly is her daughterâs name.  Thatwas only a few days after she re-adopted her illegible signature for what she called as turning âa new leaf in her lifeâ.  Thereason she gave for signing as âWing Yeeâ is that while signing her name, she was thinking of her children and wanted to ensurethat the company or the Units could be passed onto them, so that by signing as âWing Yeeâ, her daughter could claim ownershipof Global Fair by presenting her Hong Kong Identity Card in the future.  Such reasoning is simply too naÃ¯ve to have been genuinelyheld by an intelligent person like Cheung.  The explanation she gave was a desperate one given while trying to conceal the truthunder cross-examination.  It was untrue.  The inference is that Cheung was plainly hiding her identity as the purchaser of the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p364" class="para" id="p364">364.</a>  Under cross-examination, Cheung admitted instructing Miss Ma of Atkins Limited to fill in the various company documents statingher occupation as a merchant and giving the address of Atkins Limited as her residential address.  Her explanation for the formerwas that she did not want to boast about her professional status and did not know that the documents were going to be public documentsand for the latter was that she had not thought about it at the time.  Cheung admitted that she had been specifically asked for herresidential address.  I find it incredible that the circumstances under which she was filling in the company documents would haveprovoked her to instruct Miss Ma to quote the address of Atkins Limited as her residential address.  I find that the purpose of herinstruction to Miss Ma was to deliberately conceal her identity. </p>    <p><a name="p365" class="para" id="p365">365.</a>  Cheung also seeks to explain that what she did was to keep the purchase secret from her husband.  That is a lame explanation forher husband could not have access to the tender form.  On the other hand, signing the company documents of Global Fair and sharecertificates of Avant Garde as âWing Yeeâ would not be effective to conceal her identity from her husband.  If her husband couldhave access to the company document of Global Fair, he would have known that Cheung was a shareholder of Global Fair and thereforethe owner of the Units.  The appearance of the words âWing Yeeâ as the signature would double confirm to her husband Cheungâsidentity.  If her husband could have access to the documents of Avant Garde on which the words âWing Yeeâ appeared, it wouldonly raise more questions which Cheung would have difficulties answering.  I reject Cheungâs evidence that all those acts weredone to conceal her identity from her husband. </p>    <p><a name="p366" class="para" id="p366">366.</a>  Plainly, Cheung was deliberately concealing her identity.  Having so rejected her evidence, the inference is that all those actswere done to conceal her identity as the person behind Global Fair which was the purchaser of the Units.  Of all the people in theworld, Vos was the only person whom she had reason to conceal her identity from because Vos knew she was connected with Yung.  Theseinferences are irresistible.  They support the inference that Cheung bid for the Units by a common design with Yung and not by coincidence.</p>    <p class="heading">The unusual corporate structure used for holding the Units</p>    <p><a name="p367" class="para" id="p367">367.</a>  Cheung adopted a very unusual corporate structure for holding the Units.  The Units were purchased by Global Fair which is jointlyown by Cheung and a BVI company, Avant Garde.  Start Win to which Global Fair transferred Unit 1A is similarly held by Avant Gardeand Cheung jointly.  The corporate structure is rather unusual for property holding for individuals with few and insubstantial propertiessuch as these. </p>    <p><a name="p368" class="para" id="p368">368.</a>  The theme of Cheungâs explanation for the use of this unusual corporate structure for holding the Units was that she wanted toinvest in real property for her children and at the same time keep her investment secret from her husband who indulged in foreignexchange speculation lest he would demand money from her to support his speculation activities.  For the purpose of this exercise,I ignore for the benefit of Cheung the complication of Auâs position in Avant Garde.</p>    <p><a name="p369" class="para" id="p369">369.</a>  First of all, this explanation was never pleaded in Cheungâs defence.  The closest averment in her Defence filed was that shewanted to keep her investment away from her husband because of their estranged relationship.  There was absolutely no mention ofher husbandâs speculation activities.  That allegation is clearly a recent concoction.</p>    <p><a name="p370" class="para" id="p370">370.</a>  Secondly, there is little, if any, evidence to support Cheungâs allegation about her husbandâs activities in foreign exchangespeculation with her money.  Apart from a sum of $72,000 withdrawn from her joint account with her husband which was deposited intothe husbandâs foreign exchange account, there is no evidence of any fund movement from Cheungâs account or her clinicâs accountto the husbandâs foreign exchange account. </p>    <p><a name="p371" class="para" id="p371">371.</a>  More crucially, on the record available from the Companies Registry, Cheung was a shareholder of Global Fair, albeit only of oneshare, and was one of its two directors.  Similarly, the record showed that Cheung was a 1% shareholder of Start Win with herselfand her sister as its sole directors from 4 November 1993 through to 14 September 1999.  If Cheungâs husband came to know aboutCheungâs shareholding, her directorship in these two companies and the Units held by these two companies, her husband would pressfor information about the ownership of Avant Garde, her relationship with Yung and Longâs Nominees and so on.  It would raise lotsof questions for Cheung to answer and create more problems and embarrassment for her than what the secrecy could avoid.</p>    <p><a name="p372" class="para" id="p372">372.</a>  Furthermore, if Cheungâs intention was to keep her investment secret from her husband, there were many and easier ways with whichshe could have achieved that purpose without the use of such unusual corporate structure.  She could have simply used Avant Gardefor holding the Units.  She could have used Global Fair for holding the Units with her sisters or other relatives holding the sharesof Global Fair on trust for herself and/or her children.  She could have her sister bidding and holding the Units in her sisterâsown name on trust for herself and/or her children.  Cheung explained she did not want to involve her family members in the transactionbecause she did not wish to disclose her marital problems with her husband to her family.  But just three months later, she askedher sister Cheung Wai Ha to become a director of Start Win.  She then gave a half-hearted explanation that it was a happy affairwhich she had no problem sharing with her family.  But that raises two unanswerable questions: why was the same was not a happy onethree months ago and why was disclosure of her marital problem not a concern three months later.  I think Cheung was hiding the truth.</p>    <p><a name="p373" class="para" id="p373">373.</a>  In any event, Cheungâs alleged secrecy from her husband was a lame excuse.  She withdrew $345,000 from her joint account withher husband, which would not go unnoticed by her husband.  Initially, she said she did not intend to use those funds as she did notwish her husband to know.  The fact was that she did use those funds.  Cheung then explained that her husband would not have noticedit as he never checked his account.  But, on her own evidence, her husband did all the accounts of her clinics and prepared tax returnsfor her.  It would be quite inconceivable that her husband would not have noticed the movement of over $2 million in her accountand the overdraft of $380,000 left after 21 July 1993.  Her explanations are contradictory.  The questions why a BVI bearer sharecompany was used for holding the shares of Global Fair, why Longâs Nominees was used for holding a share in Avant Garde and a sharein Start Win and why Yung was the person to have control over these shares held by Longâs Nominees remain unanswered. </p>    <p><a name="p374" class="para" id="p374">374.</a>  There is also the indisputable and inexplicable fact that on 25 October 1993 Au replaced Cheung as director of Global Fair and thenexercised the shareholderâs right of Avant Garde to pass resolutions leading to the mortgage of Unit 1D to HSBC as security foroverdraft facility for New Champion.  These evidence are discussed in greater detail below in paragraphs 367 to 380.  These factssuggest that Cheungâs alleged ownership in Avant Garde and Global Fair was not absolute.  She may be a nominee owner or joint ownerin those companies holding the Units on behalf of another.  It was the identity of that other which was what the unusual corporatestructure and the secrecy with which Cheung concealed her identity in the tender form was intended to protect.  And that other personcould not be any other but Yung, the architect of the corporate structure.  I reject Cheungâs evidence that the purpose of theunusual corporate structure was to keep the purchase secret from her husband.  I find that the purpose was to conceal her identityas the person behind Global Fair bidding for the Units and Yungâs identity as the beneficial or joint owner of the Units.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Auâs appointment as director of Global Fair and his acting for and on behalf of Avant Garde</p>    <p><a name="p375" class="para" id="p375">375.</a>  I now turn to a series of very significant events which have an important bearing in my decision.  It should be recalled that asa result of the winding up petition, the title deeds of the Units were withheld by the Official Receiver.  However, soon after therelease of the title deeds of the Units by the Official Receiver, Cheung, Yung, Au, Avant Garde, Global Fair, Start Win and New Championdid some most extraordinary things in relation to the Units.  Those extraordinary acts were done solely for the benefit of Yung andNew Champion in which Yung was interested.  Those extraordinary acts were as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p376" class="para" id="p376">376.</a>  First, on 25 October 1993, Au replaced Cheung as director of Global Fair.  With effect from that date, the directors of Global Fairwere Au and Avant Garde, which effectively meant Au was in full control of Global Fair.  On 3 November 1993, Global Fair enteredinto an agreement for the sale of Unit 1A to Start Win. </p>    <p><a name="p377" class="para" id="p377">377.</a>  On 12 November 1993, Au acting for and on behalf of Avant Garde as the majority shareholder of Global Fair passed two resolutionsat shareholders general meeting to alter the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Global Fair to authorise it to guarantee loansof a third party.  On the same day, in his capacity as director of Global Fair and in his capacity acting for and on behalf of AvantGarde, he passed a board resolution to mortgage Unit 1D to HSBC in favour of New Champion.</p>    <p><a name="p378" class="para" id="p378">378.</a>  On 23 November 1993, Au, on behalf of Avant Garde as director of Global Fair, passed a board resolution authorising payment of theproceeds of sale of Unit 1A to himself, instead of to a bank account of Global Fair.  This strange arrangement was aborted, presumablybecause in their good sense, solicitors acting for Dao Heng Bank, the mortgagee, considered such arrangement irregular.  In the end,the proceeds of sale were paid into a newly opened account of Global Fair with First Pacific Bank of which Au was the sole signatory. It is peculiar that while it is Cheungâs case that she was the absolute owner of Global Fair in which Au admittedly had no interest,Au was the sole signatory of that account.  Subsequently, from that account Au withdrew $1 million on 30 November 1993 and $0.9 millionon 1 December 1993 to pay Yung.</p>    <p><a name="p379" class="para" id="p379">379.</a>  The above acts are not disputed and indeed they are undisputable.  On the face, those extraordinary acts may even be described asirregular from which adverse inference could reasonably be drawn against Cheung and Yung.  But Cheung and Yung have explanationsfor those acts and they rely on those explanations as their defence as well. </p>    <p><a name="p380" class="para" id="p380">380.</a>  According to Cheung, the purpose of Auâs appointment as director of Global Fair was to enable Start Win to raise a mortgage loanover Unit 1A so as to enable her to repay part of the $2.2 million she borrowed from Yung and Mrs Yung.  It was Cheungâs case thatshe did not know she had to complete the purchase of the Units within one month coupled with difficulties in obtaining corporateloans from banks against a mortgage of acquired properties as security.  Then Yung and Mrs Yung conveniently lent her a total of$2.2 million to complete the purchase.  I have rejected that explanation (paragraphs 401 - 402).  To continue with her explanation,Cheung said that upon release of the title deeds by the Official Receiver, she tried to mortgage the Units to raise money to repayYung.  She approached HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank and a local bank.  She was asked to submit documents for their consideration,but she did not.  Her explanation was that she sensed the banks were reluctant to grant mortgage loan on properties which had alreadybeen acquired due to restrictions imposed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (âHKMAâ).  Then, a bank officer of Dao Heng Bank,who was the brother of her old classmate suggested her to get around that restriction by a fictitious sale of the Units to a relatedcompany.  Thus, on 3 November 1993, Cheung caused Global Fair to enter into a sale and purchase agreement with Start Win to purchaseUnit 1A for $4 million.  She admitted that the sale and purchase as well as the purchase price were fictitious.  The purpose wasto dress up the transaction as a new sale and purchase transaction so as to circumvent HKMAâs restriction and obtain a loan torepay Yung.  She explained that Au was appointed as a director of Global Fair so as to dress up the transaction as an armsâ lengthtransaction between two different unrelated parties; i.e. Au representing Global Fair as vendor and she representing Start Win aspurchaser.  She says that the $1.9 million withdrawn by Au was to repay part of the $2.2 million loan lent to her by Yung and MrsYung.</p>    <p><a name="p381" class="para" id="p381">381.</a>  I do not think Cheungâs explanation credible.  To start with, Cheung said that she had approached a number of banks enquiringabout mortgage loans but did not proceed under her apprehension that the banks would not grant mortgage loans on already acquiredproperties.  I am not aware, as a matter of general knowledge, of such restrictions imposed by banks or HKMA.  It is the businessof a bank to earn interest by lending money.  It is difficult to believe that a bank would not lend against mortgage of good qualityfully paid properties for genuine business purposes of the borrower with ability to repay but would only lend to finance new purchases. The banks might be more cautious with mortgage of already acquired property in the amount of the loan to be advanced against thevalue of the property to be mortgaged and less accommodating with interest rate and terms of the mortgage but would not turn businessdown indiscriminately.  There is no evidence of the banksâ attitude towards such mortgage.  The fact was Cheung did not even makethe application.  But, contrary to what Cheung said, at about the same time, HSBC did grant an overdraft facility of $2.5 millionto New Champion on the mortgage of Unit 1D, which was an already acquired property.  Even though that mortgage was arranged throughMr Donaldson of HSBC with whom Yung was familiar, I doubt if that relationship made any difference.  HSBC is the leading bank inHong Kong and well known for its cautious lending attitude.  The amount of overdraft facility granted by HSBC was 25% higher thanthe mortgage loan granted by Dao Heng Bank on Unit 1A, which was a property of similar value.  I doubt if Cheungâs explanationwas true and if her belief about the banksâ attitude genuinely held.  In any event, there is no credible evidence of such attitudeof the banks.</p>    <p><a name="p382" class="para" id="p382">382.</a>  Cheungâs explanation of dressing up the transaction as a new purchase is also self contradicting.  She said that the bank officer,the accountant and the solicitors acting for the bank who arranged the documentation all knew about the fictitious nature of thetransaction and that the purpose was to circumvent HKMAâs restriction by dressing the transaction up as a new purchase.  I am mindfulof the possibility that some bank officers might well adopt irregular practices in order to obtain business.  However, what Cheungsaid was inconsistent with the transfer being openly treated as an inter-company transfer for the purpose of saving stamp duty. The bank must know that the transaction was not a new purchase.  Thus, it would not have mattered at all if Cheung were to sign asdirector for vendor as well as director for the purchaser.  According to Cheung, the procedure was a legitimate way the bank usedto circumvent HKMAâs restriction.  In the circumstances, there was no reason why the bank officer could not have been called tosupport the explanation given by Cheung.  I have difficulties in accepting that it was the bank officer who suggested to Cheung thefictitious transaction to circumvent HKMAâs restriction in order to grant her the loan. </p>    <p><a name="p383" class="para" id="p383">383.</a>  Even assuming that there were such HKMA restriction and that Dao Heng Bank would adopt or turn a blind eye to such arrangementsas alleged by Cheung to circumvent the HKMAâs restriction, what is fatal to Cheungâs explanation is that there was absolutelyno need to bring Au in as a director of Global Fair to dress up the transaction.  The same result could be obtained by Cheung signingthe sale and purchase agreement and assignment as director of Global Fair and her sister signing as director of Start Win.  Thisdestroyed the entire basis of Cheungâs explanation. </p>    <p><a name="p384" class="para" id="p384">384.</a>  Secondly, there was no reason why Cheung would have appointed Au as director of Global Fair.  Cheung had only seen Au once or twiceand known him for a few months since July 1993.  Au is related to Mrs Yungâs sister but wholly unrelated to Cheung.  The reasongiven by Cheung for her choice is that she trusted Au because Yung trusted him too.  That is hardly credible.  At least it cannotexplain why Cheung could not have trusted any of her sisters or brother-in-laws for the appointment or why she could have trustedAu more.</p>    <p><a name="p385" class="para" id="p385">385.</a>  Even if Au was to be appointed, Cheung could have appointed him as an additional director to sign the necessary documents withoutherself resigning from Global Fair altogether.  Cheung could not give any satisfactory reason why she had to resign in favour ofAu.  Au must be appointed for some other reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p386" class="para" id="p386">386.</a>  That leads me to another question, i.e. what role did Au perform in the whole design.  The original design was that the proceedsof sale were to be paid to Au personally and not Global Fair.  However, that plan failed presumably because the solicitors actingfor the mortgagee bank felt suspicious about the arrangement.  Then Cheung or whoever in control of the whole design arranged forGlobal Fair to open an account with the First Pacific Bank.  The extraordinary feature about this account was that Au was the solesignatory.  He had absolutely no interest in Global Fair but became the sole person in control of the net proceeds of the sale ofabout $2 million, not to say property worth $4 million.  On the other hand, on Cheung case, Cheung who was the sole beneficial ownerof 100% of the interest in Global Fair was not a signatory to this account.  The further undisputed fact is that Au almost immediatelypaid out $1.9 million to Yung.  That explains everything.  The purpose of Auâs appointment was to ensure the payment of $1.9 millionfrom the account of Global Fair to Yung.  He was to protect Yungâs and Mrs Yungâs interest in the $2.2 million which they hadput in the design.  There was no reason why Au should be appointed as director to the exclusion of Cheung. </p>    <p><a name="p387" class="para" id="p387">387.</a>  The other extraordinary act Au did was to pass resolutions to bring about the mortgage of Unit 1D to HSBC as security for New Champion. The arrangement was extraordinary because according to Cheungâs case, she was the owner of Unit 1D, but the property was mortgagedas security for $2.5 million overdraft facility for New Champion in which Cheung was not interested.  Cheungâs explanation forthe arrangement was that in view of the $2.2 million loan she was owing Yung and Mrs Yung, Yung suggested her to mortgage Unit 1Dto repay him.  I have considered that explanation in another context (paragraphs 407 - 409).  I do not accept that the $2.2 millionwas a loan from Yung and Mrs Yung.  There can be no doubt that passing the resolutions and to bring about the mortgage of Unit 1Dwas another important mission of Auâs appointment.  That was for the benefit of Yung.  Again, there was no reason why Cheung couldnot have passed the resolutions without appointing Au.</p>    <p><a name="p388" class="para" id="p388">388.</a>  On the balance of the evidence, I draw as the only irresistible inference that the purpose of Auâs appointment as director ofGlobal Fair to the exclusion of Cheung was to protect Yungâs interest in respect of Unit 1D held by Global Fair and to protecthis interest over the $1.9 million obtained by mortgage of Unit 1A.  The need to bring in Au to do all those extraordinary thingsinconsistent with Cheungâs right as the beneficial owner of Global Fair and Avant Garde and of the Units raises the irresistibleinference that Au was appointed to secure the interest of Yung over the Units and that Cheung was not the sole or absolute ownerof Avant Garde, Global Fair and the Units.  Probably, Yung did not trust Cheung as much as Cheung trusted him.  Another possibleinference is that Cheung knew there was something wrong with the whole design and wanted to dissociate herself from the more sensitivepart of it.  Admittedly, Au was the dummy to perform these tasks.  Yungâs interest over the Units may be exclusive or jointly withCheung.  But that is not a matter I can resolve or need to resolve. </p>    <p class="heading">Yungâs control over the corporate structure</p>    <p><a name="p389" class="para" id="p389">389.</a>  It is the common evidence of Yung and Cheung that Yung designed the corporate structure, acquired the corporate vehicles for Cheungto hold the Units and instructed William Leung to provide the secretarial services for setting up the corporate structure.  To WilliamLeungâs recollection, all subsequent instructions relating to these two companies were received from Yung and by documents emanatedfrom the fax machine of New Champion which was under the control of Yung.  In particular, Yung gave directions as to whom WilliamLeung should deliver the bearer share certificates of Avant Garde to, how William Leung was to vote in board meetings of Avant Gardeand Global Fair, etc.  William Leung issued invoices to Yung for the services he provided and those invoices were duly settled withoutcomplaint from Yung that he was not responsible for the payment.</p>    <p><a name="p390" class="para" id="p390">390.</a>  Avant Garde is a BVI bearer share company.  On the facts of this case, particularly with Yungâs involvement in the setting upof this company, one cannot but be very sceptical about the identity of the true owner and person in control of this company.  Yungacquired this company from East Asia Corporate Services (BVI) Ltd.  Avant Garde issued 50,000 bearer shares which are representedby four share certificates of 12,500 shares each.  It was only until early August 1993 when William Leung became concerned aboutthe ownership of the bearer shares of Avant Garde that he asked Yung and Yung informed him that those four share certificates wereto be held by Atkins Limited for Cheung.  On 25 October 1993, Cheung collected the four bearer share certificates from William Leung. There is also some evidence that William Leung was in possession of the company chop of Avant Garde which he applied on Cheungâsinstruction to the company documents of Universal Agents Limited which was another company he acquired for Cheung in mid October1993.  Cheung submits that these are evidence that she was the owner of Avant Garde. </p>    <p><a name="p391" class="para" id="p391">391.</a>  Global Fair was acquired by Yung from a secretarial company, Acota Limited, on or about 14 July 1993.  On 29 July 1993, one subscribershare was transferred to Cheung and one to Avant Garde.  On 30 July 1993, ninety-seven shares were allotted to Avant Garde and oneto Longâs Nominees, which was held on trust for Avant Garde.  Thus, Cheung is the legal owner as to 1% of the shareholding in GlobalFair and Avant Garde is the legal owner as to 99%.  Cheung and Avant Garde were appointed first directors of Global Fair on 19 July1993. </p>    <p><a name="p392" class="para" id="p392">392.</a>  Start Win was incorporated on 12 October 1993 with one subscriber share transferred to Cheung and one to Avant Garde.  On 4 November1993, ninety-eight shares were allotted to Avant Garde.  Thus, Cheung was the legal owner as to 1% of the shareholding in Start Winand Avant Garde was the legal owner as to 99%.  On 13 October 1993, Cheung and Cheung Wai Ha were appointed as the first directorsof Start Win.</p>    <p><a name="p393" class="para" id="p393">393.</a>  However, it should be recalled that on 12 November 1993, Au acting for and on behalf of Avant Garde as the majority shareholderof Global Fair passed two resolutions at shareholders general meeting to alter the Memorandum and Articles of Association of GlobalFair so as to authorise it to guarantee loans of a third party.  On the same day, in his capacity as director of Global Fair andin his capacity acting for and on behalf of Avant Garde, he passed a board resolution to mortgage Unit 1D to HSBC in favour of NewChampion.  According to Cheungâs case, she was the 100% shareholder of Avant Garde and Longâs Managers was the sole directorof Avant Garde.  Cheung does not dispute Auâs authority to act for and on behalf of Avant Garde in the exercise of its shareholderâsright.  Avant Garde is a bearer share company.  This suggests that Au had somehow become the holder of the bearer shares of AvantGarde on or before 12 November 1993 in place of Cheung.  This renders Cheungâs and Yungâs evidence that Cheung was the ownerof Avant Garde gravely suspect.  It supports the inference that Cheung was only a nominee owner of Avant Garde and, as their evidencefurther suggest, Yung was its real beneficial owner.</p>    <p><a name="p394" class="para" id="p394">394.</a>  As director of Global Fair, Au was instrumental to the payment of $1.9 million to Yung and HSBCâs granting overdraft facilitiesto New Champion secured against the mortgage of Unit 1D.  The two mortgages on Units were raised for the benefit of Yung and hiscompany, New Champion.  Au effectively admitted he was a dummy signing company resolutions and documents related to the transferof Unit 1A and mortgage of Unit 1D for Cheung.  As I have already find that Auâs appointment as director of Global Fair to theexclusion of Cheung was to secure Yungâs interest in Unit 1A or over the proceeds of the mortgage.  These showed that Yung mustbe interested in the Units or at least one of them and that Yung was in control of Au, Cheung, Global Fair and Avant Garde sinceJuly 1993 until 18 July 1994 at least, when Cheung was appointed director. </p>    <p><a name="p395" class="para" id="p395">395.</a>  Also, I cannot lose sight of the fact that in November 1993, Au was the person in control of Avant Garde which was the 99% shareholderof Start Win.  Thus, through Avant Garde, Au and therefore Yung had control over Start Win as well.  By reason of Yungâs controlover Avant Garde, he was also the person in control of Global Fair, at least until Cheungâs appointment as director of Avant Gardeon 18 July 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p396" class="para" id="p396">396.</a>  In view of all the circumstances, I draw the inference that Yung, being the person who was to be benefited by these transactions,was the one orchestrating these transactions.  He was the mastermind behind Avant Garde and Global Fair from the time when Cheungbid for the Units until at least up to around the time of the transfer of Unit 1A to Start Win and mortgage of Unit 1D as securityfor New Championâs overdraft facility, i.e. December 1993 or possibly until 18 July 1994 when Cheung was re-appointed directorof Avant Garde.  During that period of time, Yung had control over Avant Garde, Global Fair and Start Win and was the mastermindbehind these companies.</p>    <p><a name="p397" class="para" id="p397">397.</a>  For completeness, on 27 March 1997 Cheung was re-appointed as director of Global Fair.  On 30 March 1999 Au and Avant Garde resignedas directors of Global Fair and Cheungâs sister, Cheung Wai Ha, was appointed as director.  On 14 September 1999 Au was re-appointedas director.  On 30 March 2000, Au resigned as director.  On 14 September 1999, Au was appointed as director of Start Win.  The onand off appointment of Au as director of Global Fair and Start Win and his capacity to act for and on behalf of Avant Garde whichis the 99% shareholder of Global Fair and Start Win is interesting and unexplained.  Not only does it suggest that Cheungâs ownershipin Global Fair and Start Win is illusory, it also supports my finding that Au was representing the interest of another at varioustimes.  That other could be no one else but Yung. </p>    <p class="heading">Cheungâs source of funds for the purchase of the Units</p>    <p><a name="p398" class="para" id="p398">398.</a>  Cheung admits that she did not have $4.25 million to pay for the purchase of the Units.  There is no dispute that Mrs Yung paidthe deposit of $850,000 for Cheung so that Global Fair may bid for the Units and that she paid a further sum of $1,350,000 to MessrsWS to enable Global Fair to complete the purchase.  The total amount paid by Yung and Mrs Yung was $2.2 million, which exactly matchedthe purchase price for Unit 1D.</p>    <p><a name="p399" class="para" id="p399">399.</a>  Cheung said that she had access to a fund of about $3 million.  She had $20,000 cash on hand; $130,000 in her Standard CharteredBank account; $50,000 in one of her HSBC account; $500,000 overdraft facility in another HSBC account and $345,000 in her joint accountwith her husband.  On 13 July 1993, she obtained an increase in her overdraft facility by $700,000.  So she had a total amount ofavailable funds of $1,745,000.  She borrowed $1,160,000 from her friends and relatives.  On 21 July 1993, Cheung borrowed $250,000from Cheung Tsz Hung and his wife whom she repaid on 30 July 1993 with an extra amount of $10,000 to compensate them for having soldtheir British pounds at a loss in order to lend her the money.  Her two sisters, Cheung Wai Ha and Cheung Wai Kuen lent her $360,000. A nurse, Sham So Yuen lent her $50,000.  Dr Ho Yuk Hai also lent her $500,000 whom she repaid $520,000 on 16 December 1993.  Thoseloans totalled $1,160,000.  Some of those deposits and repayments were documented.  Thus, Cheung had a total source of availablefunds of $2.905 million, say $3 million.</p>    <p><a name="p400" class="para" id="p400">400.</a>  Cheungâs bank statement with HSBC shows that on 21 July 1993 the various amounts were paid in and then a sum of $2.05 millionwas withdrawn from her bank account, leaving a debit balance of about $380,000.  I could have no doubt in the truth of this partof Cheungâs evidence.  Thus, Cheung contributed $2.05 million and Yung and Mrs Yung contributed $2.2 million towards the purchaseof the Units which neatly tided in with the purchase price of the Unit 1A and Unit 1D respectively.</p>    <p><a name="p401" class="para" id="p401">401.</a>  I now turn to consider Cheungâs account of how she came to obtain the loans from Yung and Mrs Yung.  Cheung explained that MrsYung paid the deposit for her just out of convenience to save her the trouble of having to go to two different banks to collect enoughmoney to purchase the bank draft and then go to Hong Kong to submit the tender form.  Convenience was not the answer because thehard fact was Cheung never repaid before completion and she was further short of $1.35 million to complete.  The fact remains thatYung and Mrs Yung paid $2.2 million which happened to be the purchase price for Unit 1D. </p>    <p><a name="p402" class="para" id="p402">402.</a>  Cheung went on to explain that she borrowed $2.2 million from Yung and Mrs Yung because she did not know that the purchase wouldhave to be completed within one month, i.e. on or before 13 August 1993, and it never occurred to her that a corporation would haveproblem in obtaining bank mortgage loan within the time available.  On her account, she had never seen the tender form.  It was completedby Yung and presented to her for signature at her clinic on the morning of 14 July 1993 by Au.  A copy of the conditions of salewas annexed to the tender form.  She did not read the conditions of sale but assumed that completion would be in one or two monthsâtime.  She said she was keen to look for properties to purchase and she had never bid in an auction before.  Yet, on her own admission,she did not read the tender form and conditions of sale and did not notice that the purchase would have to complete within one month.</p>    <p><a name="p403" class="para" id="p403">403.</a>  I find her account hardly credible for a person of her education and care and particularly as a first time bidder at an auction. Before one makes a bid and pays a very substantial deposit, one must bear in mind what his further commitment would be.  When apurchaser has to pay the balance of the purchase price and whether he has the necessary funds to pay when due must be forefront inthe mind of any reasonable purchaser because failure to pay would result in the purchase falling through and the deposits forfeited. Thus even if Cheung had not read the conditions of sale but signed the tender form on the basis of what Yung represented to her,it is incredible that she did not even ask Yung when she would be required to pay the balance of the purchase price.  It is alsounlikely that in the circumstances Yung would not have asked her if she would have enough money to complete the purchase as he wasgoing to pay the deposit for her.  The deposit of $850,000 was a substantial sum of money back in 1993, more so was the balance ofthe purchase price of $3.4 million.  It is incredible that Cheung would not have ascertained when payment would be due and ensuredthat she could pay on time, should she be successful in the auction.  It is just incredible that when she was successful in the auction,she then helplessly turned to Mrs Yung for help.  In a truly armsâ length auction, her $850,000 deposit would have been forfeited.</p>    <p><a name="p404" class="para" id="p404">404.</a>  Cheung had banking facilities with HSBC.  On her evidence, before making the bid she had arranged with HSBC to increase her overdraftfacility by $700,000.  Yet, she did not have any preliminary discussion with her bank officer to enquire what finance she could obtainfrom HSBC or any other banks at all before placing her bid.  She did no more than ensuring she had funds for purchase of one unitonly.  Her explanation was that the tender had not yet been accepted and it might not be accepted and hence there was no point inmaking such inquiries.  I find her explanation a half-hearted one.  Unless she had the finance or had been assured of assistance,it was most surprising that nothing, not even by way of preliminary enquiries, had been undertaken by her about securing the financeto purchase the Units in case her bid was successful.</p>    <p><a name="p405" class="para" id="p405">405.</a>  After her bid was accepted, Cheung allegedly made enquiries with HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank and some local banks.  She was allegedlytold that as the purchaser was a limited company, it might take six to eight weeks to process a mortgage application.  Then she decidednot to proceed any further, or to seek advice from her solicitors or from Yung as to how to overcome the difficulties.  She couldhave sought Yungâs or Goldmarkâs consent to nominate herself as the purchaser to overcome the difficulties, though at the riskof loss of secrecy to her husband, which I held was not a genuine concern.  Alternatively, she could have offered herself as theborrower and her family member as guarantor.  She did not.</p>    <p><a name="p406" class="para" id="p406">406.</a>  What Cheung did was this.  She vigorously raised $1.16 million from her sisters and friends.  Other than that, she did nothing butto leave herself in the helpless situation of speaking to Yung on 18 July 1993 Then, Mrs Yung who answered the phone as Yung wasin the United States presumably negotiating with Hillâs over distributorship for his new company to be formed.  By way of contrast,the readiness with which Mrs Yung lent her $1.35 million was surprising.  When asked why she did not proceed with an applicationfor bank loan just the same in the hope that it would be approved in time or in any event the loan approved would enable her to repayher friends and Yung earlier, she could offer no reasonable explanation.  Again, had it not been for Yungâs $1.35 million, herdeposit would have been forfeited.  Cheungâs attitude was totally inconsistent with someone purchasing in an armsâ length auctionsolely with her own funds.  The overwhelming inference is that Cheung bid at the auction under a joint enterprise with Yung on jointfunds in which her agreed commitment was $2.05 million. </p>    <p><a name="p407" class="para" id="p407">407.</a>  I now turn to further consider Cheungâs other evidence that the $2.2 million provided by Yung and Mrs Yung was a loan which shehad repaid or nearly repaid between November 1993 and May 1995.  Firstly, Cheung said that she repaid $1.9 million from the proceedsof the mortgage of Unit 1A.  While I query the reasons for that payment, the payment itself was, nevertheless, incontrovertible. If Cheungâs evidence is accepted, the payment of $1.9 million could well be a genuine repayment of a <i>bona fide</i> loan to finance her purchase of the Units.  If her evidence is not accepted, the payment could be for any purpose known to Cheungand Yung only which the Plaintiff need not necessary prove in order to succeed.  What the Plaintiff need to do is to show that Cheungâsexplanation is not credible and the adverse inference which he seeks to draw is reasonable. </p>    <p><a name="p408" class="para" id="p408">408.</a>  In addition to the $1.9 million, it is Cheungâs evidence that 99% of the loan had been repaid.  Cheung said that at about thesame time as the mortgage of Unit 1A with Dao Heng Bank was being arranged, Yung suggested that in view of Cheungâs indebtednessto him, she should consider putting up Unit 1D as security for banking facilities to be given to New Champion.  She agreed.  Thenthrough Mr Donaldson of HSBC, Yung arranged for Unit 1D to be mortgaged by Global Fair to HSBC as security for overdraft facilitiesof $2.5 million to New Champion.  Cheung withdrew from the facilities $520,000 to repay Dr Hoâs loan of $500,000 with interestof $20,000.  The overdraft facility granted to New Champion was to be used by New Champion as well as by Cheungâs veterinary clinic. That explained why she agreed to have Unit 1D mortgaged in favour of New Champion.  She said she maintained an account with Yungas to the amount of facilities drawn by her veterinary clinic from the facility.  Eventually, the clinic business was unsuccessfuland she closed it down in May 1995 suffering a loss.  She cleared her account with Yung and paid off the outstanding mortgage loanwith HSBC.  She also paid off the mortgage loan owing to Dao Heng Bank by Start Win out of the income from her medical practice.</p>    <p><a name="p409" class="para" id="p409">409.</a>  That explanation is not without difficulties.  To begin with, on Cheungâs account, nine days after Global Fair had entered intothe sale and purchase agreement of Unit 1A with Start Win, Global Fair passed a resolution to amend its Memorandum and Articles ofAssociation to enable it to guarantee the loan to New Champion.  Thus, when Yung suggested Cheung to mortgage Unit 1D as securityfor overdraft facilities to be granted to New Champion, Cheung had already arranged to repay Yung $1.9 million in about two weeks. She would then be short of only $300,000 to repay Yung in full.  If indeed Cheung was the owner of the Units, it would make a nonsenseof her evidence that for her outstanding loan of $300,000 she would have agreed to Yungâs suggestion to mortgage her Unit 1D foran overdraft facility of $2.5 million for New Champion.  Cheung had nothing to do with the business of New Champion.  She had absolutelyno control over the overdraft account of New Champion.  What she did was to attract a liability of $2.5 million and a mortgage overwhat she said was her property just for her outstanding loan of $300,000 owing to Yung.  Furthermore, according to her case, Yungwas a resourceful and helpful friend who could and had raised more than $2 million at short notice and had lent her $2.2 millionfor half a year without any security or a loan receipt.  Yung certainly knew that $1.9 million was to be repaid to him very soon. When the bulk of the loan would have been repaid in two weeks, in the tenor of her explanation Yung could not have made such a meansuggestion which necessitated Cheung to incur a lot of trouble and expenses to mortgage Unit 1D and for a facility which was eighttimes her liability.  Her evidence is incredible.</p>    <p><a name="p410" class="para" id="p410">410.</a>  That apart, the mortgage of Unit 1D in favour of New Champion is highly suspicious.  Cheung was not a signatory to the overdraftaccount of New Champion.  She has neither the knowledge of nor the means to monitor the outstanding balance of the overdraft account. The mortgage is a clear indication that although the legal title of Unit 1D was held by Global Fair, the true beneficial interestin the unit was vested in Yung solely or jointly with Cheung and Cheungâs explanation of her sharing in the overdraft facilityof New Champion is just a cover up of her assistance in Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty after commencement of this action. </p>    <p><a name="p411" class="para" id="p411">411.</a>  Then Cheung proffered two reasons why she provided security for the overdraft facilities for New Champion which were that she hadto use part of the facilities to operate Phoenix Veterinary Clinic and to repay Dr Hoâs loan of $500,000.  She said that she maintainedan account with Yung in respect of the amount of facilities drawn by her veterinary clinic.  The clinic was unsuccessful and closeddown after a year incurring a loss of $700,000.  She settled her account with Yung in respect of the overdraft facilities.  Her evidencethat Phoenix Veterinary Clinic was unsuccessful was contradicted by Dr Dahn who operated the clinic.  I shall deal with the evidenceabout her operation of Phoenix Veterinary Clinic at the end of this section for completeness.  But nothing really turns on such evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p412" class="para" id="p412">412.</a>  As for Dr Hoâs loan of $500,000, Cheungâs receipt of the loan in July 1993 is documented, but not her repayment.  Cheung saidthat she repaid Dr Ho $520,000 in December 1993 including interest of $20,000 by using the overdraft facilities of New Champion. She produced Dr Hoâs bank statement as proof of her repayment.  The bank statement showed that Dr Ho received two payments of$450,000 and $70,000 but there was no indication of the source of the payment.  I can see no corresponding bank statement from NewChampionâs bank account showing the payment out.  I have no doubt that Cheung borrowed the money from Dr Ho and naturally she wasthe person who repaid him, but not necessarily from New Championâs overdraft account.  Cheung was selective in her production ofdocumentary evidence.  She took the trouble to obtain the bank statement from Dr Ho but withheld the bank statement of New Championwhich was within the possession and control of Yung from whom she could reasonably obtain.  That makes the non production of herown bank statements more inexplicable and suspicious.  On the evidence, I cannot be satisfied that the overdraft facilities of NewChampion was the source of funds for repaying Dr Ho.  This undermines her explanation. </p>    <p><a name="p413" class="para" id="p413">413.</a>  Then, lastly, Cheung said that she repaid the mortgage loans from Dao Heng Bank and HSBC.  Again, none of those allegations wassupported by any bank statements, which are wholly under her possession, custody and control.  If indeed there was evidence thatshe repaid the mortgage loan, it would support her case that she was the purchaser of the Units.  If not, the beneficial owner ofthe Units remains a mystery, but one thing that is sure is that Cheungâs explanation is to be rejected.  The overall inferenceto be drawn from the totality of the evidence is that Unit 1A and Unit 1D were beneficialy owned by Cheung and Yung respectivelyaccording to their contribution to the purchase price or joinly.</p>    <p><a name="p414" class="para" id="p414">414.</a>  Cheung provided no documentary evidence about the accounts of Phoenix Veterinary Clinic, the facilities drawn by the clinic, howshe repaid Dr Ho, how she settled the overdraft account with Yung and how she paid the mortgage loan from HSBC and Dao Heng Bank. The Plaintiff could tender no evidence to rebut Cheungâs allegations.  However, Yung and Cheung have been invited to produce bankstatements of their personal accounts and New Championâs account to support their case.  They were aware of the litigation as earlyas 1993 and should have preserved the evidence which is exclusively in their possession.  They elected not to produce such evidencewhen suh evidence is reasonably expected of them.  In the circumstances, I can give no weight to their oral testimony. </p>    <p><a name="p415" class="para" id="p415">415.</a>  Furthermore, on Cheungâs account, after repaying $1.9 million, nothing was repaid until Unit 1A was rented out almost a year laterand not by way of a lump sum, but by monthly rental income from Unit 1A.  On her evidence, Unit 1A was rented out between August1994 and May 1995 and the rental income in the amount of $282,000 was paid to Yung as part of the repayment of her loan.  She saidthat the balance would be settled after the present litigation.  Thus, according to Cheung, she repaid Yung and Mrs Yung $1.9 millionin November 1993 and $282,000 between August 1994 and May 1995, which was 99% of the money she borrowed from them.  However, theparties chose not to settle the small balance still owing but to wait until the conclusion of this litigation.  By now it was fifteenyears!  Cheungâs explanation is just like fitting a square peg into a round hole, which either does not fit or leaves gaps unfilled. I am only bound to reject her evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p416" class="para" id="p416">416.</a>  Having so rejected Cheungâs various explanations, the payment of $1.9 million to Yung by Global Fair and the payment of the rentalincome of $282,000 from the Unit 1A to Yung were not only not neutral events, but were the clearest indications that Yung or Yungjointly with Cheung were the true beneficial owner(s) of the Units.  I reject Cheungâs evidence that the $2.2 million contributedby Yung and Mrs Yung was a loan to her and her evidence that the $1.9 million paid to Yung by Global Fair was a repayment of partof that loan. </p>    <p><a name="p417" class="para" id="p417">417.</a>  I draw the inference that Cheung bid at the auction under a joint enterprise with Yung under which she contributed $2.05 millionand Yung and Mrs Yung contributed $2.2 million.  I find that the said contribution of $2.2 million by Yung and Mrs Yung was not aloan to Cheung but a contribution pursuant to the said joint enterprise and that the payment of the $1.9 million to Yung from theproceeds of mortgage of Unit 1A was part of that design and not a repayment of loan. </p>    <p class="heading">Cheungâs operation of Phoenix Veterinary Clinic</p>    <p><a name="p418" class="para" id="p418">418.</a>  I now turn to examine Cheungâs evidence about her operation of Phoenix Veterinary Clinic in Unit 1D.  Cheungâs evidence thatshe operated the veterinary clinic with Yungâs assistance is neither here nor there.  My finding here is not necessary for theconclusion that I am about to reach in this judgment but for completeness only. </p>    <p><a name="p419" class="para" id="p419">419.</a>  Cheung said that she did not know Unit 1D was equipped as a veterinary clinic before she bid for the property.  She only came toknow that it was renovated as a surgery with facilities like X-Ray machine and operating room when she visited the unit in August1993.  By December 1993, Unit 1D had been vacant for some time.  Cheung thought it a waste to discard the equipments there and toconvert the property back into an office.  At first, she employed Dr Dalglish to run Phoenix Veterinary Clinic.  Then Dr Dahn succeededDr Dalglish.  Dr Dahn signed an agreement with Global Fair to take over Phoenix Veterinary Clinic as sole proprietor at a guaranteedmonthly salary of $25,000, 50% profit sharing of monthly revenue above $60,000 and free home accommodation.  One of her obligationswas to provide consultancy services to New Champion as Hillâs local distributor.  She paid for the veterinary medicine and herassistants.  That agreement was of the nature of a cooperation agreement rather than a contract of employment.  She agreed with Yungthat Yung would attend to all bookkeeping and general management of the clinic until after she could take over within the next twoto three months.  She opened a bank account with HSBC.  Upon Yungâs insistence as being the person in charge of bookkeeping, Yungwas made a signatory of that account.  That arrangement was consistent with Global Fairâs obligation to pay Dr Dahn the guaranteedsalary and profit sharing.  Yung was in charge of the management of the clinic.  The business of New Champion was also operated fromUnit 1D in which Yung occupied one room and his staff occupied another.  Dr Dahn also signed a tenancy agreement with Global Fairfor the lease of Unit 1D at a monthly rental of $35,000.  That amount was to be set off against her consultancy fees to be paid byNew Champion.  Thus the rental and consultancy fee were just paper payments.  Then, when the income of the clinic started to buildup, Yung wanted to re-negotiate the term of the cooperation agreement.  That was followed by a dispute between Dr Dahn and Yung whenshe discovered Yung had withdrawn $61,000 from the bank account of the clinic without her knowledge on 3 February 1995.  On 4 February1995, Yung delivered a letter to Dr Dahn terminating the cooperation agreement.  That letter was signed by Yung for and on behalfof Global Fair.  When his authority to represent Global Fair was challenged, Yung claimed he was a director of Global Fair.  He subsequentlyreplaced that letter within an hour by a similar letter signed by Cheung.</p>    <p><a name="p420" class="para" id="p420">420.</a>  Though the accounts of the clinic is not before me, from Dr Dahnâs evidence, which is not disputed, Global Fair was unlikely tohave incurred any significant loss from the clinic operation.  Practically, all outgoings and expenses were paid by Dr Dahn.  GlobalFair was only responsible for Dr Dahnâs guaranteed salary and accommodation which must have been adequately covered by the rentalincome of $35,000 it received from New Champion through Dr Dahn.  Besides, the clinic generated a not insubstantial income of noless than $61,000 in three months.  The situation was presumably the same while the clinic was under Dr Dalglishâs operation. The clinic operation could not have occasioned a loss of $700,000 in about a year as alleged by Cheung.  It casts doubts on Cheungâsallegation that she shared the use of the overdraft facility of New Champion.  </p>    <p><a name="p421" class="para" id="p421">421.</a>  I draw no adverse inference and make no finding on Dr Dahnâs allegation of theft of the money from her clinicâs account againstYung as that is not an issue I have to decide.  Dr Dahnâs evidence was not disputed by Yung and Cheung.  On her evidence, Yungwas actively involved in the management of the clinic.  He physically worked inside the clinic and New Champion also operated frominside the clinic.  The consultancy fees paid by New Champion to Dr Dahn were ploughed back into Global Fair as rental income ofGlobal Fair.  Unit 1D was used partly for the business of New Champion.  There is also no dispute that under the terms of the Hillâsdistributorship New Champion was obliged to engage a veterinary surgeon as a consultant.  This further supports the inference thatPhoenix Veterinary Clinic was operated by Global Fair in Unit 1D purchased by funds from Yung and Mrs Yung and that Yung was thebeneficial owner of Global Fair.  That is also consistent with Auâs appointment as director of Global Fair every now and then tolook after the interest of Yung.</p>    <p class="heading">Cheungâs knowledge of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty</p>    <p><a name="p422" class="para" id="p422">422.</a>  Now, I come to the more important issue as to Cheungâs knowledge of Yungâs breach of trust.  Cheung argues that she did notknow that Yung was a trustee in relation to the Units, that the Units were disposed of by Yung in breach of trust and that she didnot deliberately intrude into this trust relationship by assisting Yung in the breach of trust.  In the case of accessory liability,it is sufficient that the accessory knows he was dealing with a person standing in a fiduciary relationship to another and owed dutyto act in good faith in relation to that other in the dealing of property held for the benefit of that other.  The accessory cannotescape liability merely because he does not know one is called a trustee and the other a beneficiary.  Cheung knew she was dealingwith Yung in relation to the Units as a director of the Companies which owned the Units.  In this day and age and with her attribute,knowledge and experience, Cheung must have known a director owes fiduciary duty to the company when dealing with the companyâsproperty put under the directorâs charge.  A director is not to squander away the companyâs property placed under his chargeat will or to sell the companyâs property at substantial undervalue.  Her argument that she did not know Yung was a trustee orthat she had no knowledge of the trust in relation to the Units is simply unsustainable.</p>    <p><a name="p423" class="para" id="p423">423.</a>  I have found that Yung was in breach of fiduciary duty in the way he sold the Units.  Cheung took part in the auction and purchasedthe Units.  That must be a deliberate interference of the trust relationship.  The questions are whether when doing so, Cheung hadknowledge of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty and was dishonest when assisting in the breach. </p>    <p><a name="p424" class="para" id="p424">424.</a>  There is no direct evidence of Cheungâs knowledge that the Units were sold by Yung in breach of his fiduciary duty owed to theCompanies or that she was reckless whether he was.  Mr Lam seeks to infer knowledge or recklessness on the part of Cheung from thesecrecy and concealment of her identity in the tender form, the use of the unusual corporate structure for holding the Units, Yungâsfunding of the purchase, Cheungâs lack of involvement in relation to the purchase, Auâs appointment as director of Global Fair,the subsequent payment to Yung of the proceeds of mortgage of Unit 1A, the mortgage of Unit 1D as security for overdraft facilitiesfor New Champion etc.</p>    <p><a name="p425" class="para" id="p425">425.</a>  I have analyzed the above issues in depth and reached the conclusion that those facts point to the irresistible inference that Cheungbid pursuant to a common design with Yung.  The question now is whether those facts are sufficient to infer knowledge on the partof Cheung of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty towards the Companies.  The most telling factor is that the Units were bid and soldat ridiculous undervalue in an auction with an unconscionably short tender period from which inference of impropriety towards theCompanies may be inferred.  Such inference is also supported by the inference which may reasonably be drawn from the secrecy andconcealment of Cheungâs and Yungâs identity as the person bidding for and holding the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p426" class="para" id="p426">426.</a>  On the inference to be drawn from sale at undervalue, Cheung ably argues that a distinction has to be drawn between the inferenceto be drawn against a purchaser from that against the vendor.  She quotes <i>Cowan de Groot Properties Ltd v Eagle Trust Plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%204%20All%20ER%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 4 All ER 700</a> in which it was held that the knowledge of the vendor directors selling at gross undervalue could not be imputed to the purchaser. Based on that case, Cheung argues that even if Yung were in breach of fiduciary duty in selling at undervalue, his knowledge couldnot be imputed to her.  <i>Cowan de Groot Properties Ltd</i> was a case involving purchase at below open market value in an auction.  The headnote reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn determining whether a purchaser company had knowledge of a breach of duty arising out of the sale of another companyâs propertyat an undervalue, the proper test to be applied was whether knowledge that the directors of the vendor company were deliberatelyselling at a gross undervalue could reasonably be imputed to the purchaser and, since the breach of fiduciary duty arose out of atypical commercial transaction, the requirement of knowledge as the basis for liability as a constructive trustee would be met whereit was possible to show that the purchaser had (i) actual knowledge of the breach, (ii) wilfully shut his eyes to the obvious or(iii) wilfully and recklessly failed to make the type of inquiries that an honest and reasonable man would have made.  In such asituation it would not be appropriate for the court to be astute to find circumstances which could indicate knowledge by a purchaserof breach of fiduciary duty on the part of directors of a vendor company.  The duty of directors of a purchasing company was to buyas cheaply as they could in the light of the mode and terms of the proposed sale and it would be going too far to impose on thema positive duty to make inquiries into the reasons for an offer being made to their company at what appeared to be a bargain price. The line should be drawn at the point where the price in question was indicative of dishonesty on the part of the directors of thevendor company, regard being had not only to the open market value but also to the terms and mode of sale.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p427" class="para" id="p427">427.</a>  I am in agreement with the principle as stated above.  A purchaser is in a very different position from that of a vendor companyâsdirector.  He owes no duty to the vendor company.  It is of course in his interest to buy as cheaply as possible.  If he purchaseson behalf of his company, that would be his duty too.  A vendor companyâs director is in a different position.  He owes duty toact in the interest of the vendor company.  It would be a clear breach for him to sell at undervalue.  Whether and the extent towhich the sale was at undervalue has to be measured against the circumstances prevailing at the time of sale and the directorâsexplanation.  The size and number of properties to be sold, the time within which the properties have to be sold, even the term ofthe sale such as the amount of deposit to be paid and the directorâs explanation have an impact on the question whether the salewas at undervalue.  The same applies to the purchaser but in a much more favourable light as it is in his interest to purchase ascheaply as possible.  He is entitled to explore the vendorâs bottom line and even to take advantage of the vendorâs weakness,such as his urgent need for cash, his need for a large deposit, etc.  However, even with all these considerations in mind, theremust come a stage where the sale is at such a glaring undervalue as to indicate not merely economic pressure but impropriety anddishonesty on the part of the director authorising the sale.  Under such circumstances, the purchaser would be caught as having thesecond and third categories of knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p428" class="para" id="p428">428.</a>  Turning back to the instant case, the Units were sold for $4.25 million against an open market value of $6.8 million or forced salevalue of $5.1 million, i.e. at 37.5% below the open market value and 17% below the forced sale value.  Cheung said that she did notcheck the then current market value of the Units before bidding.  But on her evidence, she read thousands of property advertisementseveryday and she bid at what she said was a forced sale value.  She said that she decided the bidding price by reference to whatGoldmark paid for Unit 1D a year ago, i.e. $2.9 million.  From the very competent way she challenged the Plaintiffâs valuationexpertâs evidence, it is obvious that Cheung is a person of exceptional intelligence who had kept herself abreast with the marketand was capable of feeling the market.  Having kept abreast with property advertisements, she must have known that the market wasrising and her bidding price was well below forced sale value which was usually between 25% to 30% below open market value.  Shemust have known she was bidding well below forced sale value, too.  A 25% to 30% discount off the open market value was already solow that it was difficult to go any lower.  The price she offered was ridiculously low.  A successful bid at such ridiculous pricewas more of a warning of impropriety than a sign of luck.  Of course, undervalue, without more, is not sufficient to fix Cheung withknowledge of Yungâs breach of duty.</p>    <p><a name="p429" class="para" id="p429">429.</a>  But, according to Varty, whose opinion I have no doubt is correct, the normal tender period was four to six weeks and at least threeweeks.  That was to allow time for the market to become aware of the availability of the property and for interested purchasers tomake at least some preliminary investigation and to inspect the property.  He even called a tender period of two days âunconscionablyshortâ.  Cheung said that she paid attention to property auction advertisements.  She must have been aware what was the usual tenderperiod and that the auction period in the present case was ridiculously and unconscionably short.  She could not have seen any auctionwith such a short tender period.  Even assuming that she had been misinformed by Yung that Rabobank was going to sell the Units,there is no evidence that Yung had told her that Rabobank was going to force sell the Units in two weeks or so as to justify Yungto pre-empt Rabobankâs action by selling ahead with such urgency.  Cheung is a woman of exceptional intelligence.  She is a specialistin the medical profession.  She has demonstrated her ability to research into the law and to argue legal proposition with competence. She would have appreciated that there were ways Yung could have sold the Units under more favourable circumstances by negotiatingwith Rabobank.  If Rabobank was not going to force sell the Units within a short time, why should Yung attempt to do so in two weekswith a tender period of two and half days.  She must have appreciated that there was something suspicious in Yung trying to auctionthe Units with two and half days.  No one in his right mind would have failed to appreciate that the auction in the circumstanceswas tailored made for Yung or his nominees to bid at undervalue.  I do not believe in Cheungâs evidence.  I have no difficultiesto draw as the only reasonable inference that by reason of the unconscionably short tender period and the ridiculously low pricewhich Yung was willing to sell, she knew the auction was not one in the ordinary course of business but one involving improprietyof some sort to the owners of the Units, on the part of Yung who was responsible for the sale. </p>    <p><a name="p430" class="para" id="p430">430.</a>  More importantly is this.  I have found that Cheung did not bid in the auction by coincidence and by herself, but by design andjointly with Yung.  She and Yung jointly provided for the purchase price of the Units.  I have also rejected their evidence thatYungâs contribution was by way of a loan to Cheung.  The inference is that she was bidding for the Units jointly for herself andYung.  Under the circumstances, her position is little different from that of Yungâs.</p>    <p><a name="p431" class="para" id="p431">431.</a>  Furthermore, Cheung concealed her identity in the tender form and in the company documents of Global Fair and by the unusual corporatestructure for holding the Units.  Then, when it came to the critical events in November or December 1993, she resigned from her directorshipof Global Fair in favour of Au and shied herself away as the holder of the bearer shares of Avant Garde.  As commented by MillettJ, as he then was, in <i>Agip (Africa) v Jackson and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20Ch%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 Ch 265</a> at 294, âsecrecy is the badge of fraudâ.  This comment precisely fit with Cheungâs conduct.  The only and irresistible inferencewhich could be drawn from such secrecy and concealment is that she knew not only that the auction was part of a fraudulent designto transfer the Units from the Companies to another otherwise than in an armâs length transaction but was conducted with an ulteriorand improper purpose.  That improper purpose was to dispose of the assets of the Companies at an undervalue to the benefit of another,be it Yung or her and Yung jointly.  She was part of that design.</p>    <p><a name="p432" class="para" id="p432">432.</a>  Cheung had been to Unit 1D before.  She knew that the Units were owned by the Companies.  She had been introduced to Vos and musthave known that Vos was the only other partner in the business.  She knew that the nature of Goldmarkâs business was selling petfood, pet accessories and veterinary medicine.  The Companies could have no substantial assets other than the Units which representedthe major assets of the Companies.  Assuming, as she said, that she had been told by Yung that Vos had drained the assets of theCompanies leaving $4 million liability due to Rabobank which caused Yung to auction the Units to repay, she must have some doubtsas to whether Vos would have fled leaving behind the Units of substantial worth for Yung to dispose of at will.  If she was acting<i>bona</i> <i>fide</i>, she must have asked Yung for supporting evidence than just accepting what Yung said on its face value.  She must have measured Yungâsrepresentation against Yungâs suggestion to her or their agreement to bid for the Units knowingly at substantial undervalue undera tender procedure which was only tailored made for them to bid and with the intention that Yung would accept the bid for and onbehalf of the Companies.  Under those circumstances, even if Cheung did not have full knowledge of Yungâs fraudulent design, shemust have known that there was something very untoward or improper about the whole design or at least about Yungâs motive.  Inthe absence of an acceptable or reasonable explanation, Cheung must know it was a breach of fiduciary duty for a director to createa forced sale situation and to sell the Companiesâ properties at substantial undervalue to himself or his nominee. </p>    <p><a name="p433" class="para" id="p433">433.</a>  The present case is distinguishable from <i>Cowan de Groot Properties Ltd</i>.  The price was so substantially low and the tender period was so unconscionably short as to indicate dishonesty on the part of Yung. These indicate that the auction was tailored made for Yung or his nominees to bid.  Other than that, the condition of tender containedno unusual terms which would explain the substantially low price.  Cheung was purchasing the Units jointly with Yung.  Accordingly,I find that Cheung had knowledge of Yungâs breach of trust when she participated in the bidding.  Even if I were to hold otherwise,I would still find that the circumstances were so suspicious that by participating without making due enquiries, Cheung wilfullyturned a blind eye to the obvious or wilfully and recklessly failed to make the type of inquiries which an honest and reasonableman would have made, lest her enquiries would reveal anything she would not wish to know.  Cheung could not be said to be a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser without notice of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Cheung assisted in Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty with dishonest state of mind</p>    <p><a name="p434" class="para" id="p434">434.</a>  To attract liability for a fiduciaryâs breach of duty, an accessory must have assisted in the breach with a dishonest state ofmind.  By that, it means the accessory has to have acted dishonestly by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people andhave been himself aware that by those standards he was acting dishonestly: see <i>Twinsectra v Yardley and Others</i>.  The test contains a subjective and an objective element.  Dishonesty is concerned with advertent as opposed to inadvertent conductor carelessness.</p>    <p><a name="p435" class="para" id="p435">435.</a>  I have analysed the facts of this case in great depth.  Yung was in breach of fiduciary duty by selling the Units at undervalueto the detriment of the Companies and Cheung assisted by purchasing the Units.  Purchasing or selling otherâs property at sucha substantial undervalue as in the present case is just like taking away property belonging to another.  The difference is only oneof degree.  Even ignoring the inference that Cheung purchased the Units jointly with Yung, it is beyond argument that honest peopledo not intentionally deceive others to their detriment or take away othersâ property.  Honest people do not use a golden egg toexchange for a gold egg.  Honest people do not participate or assist in such dishonest design.</p>    <p><a name="p436" class="para" id="p436">436.</a>  The next question is whether Cheung knew that such assistance was dishonest by that standard.  This question has to be answeredin the light of what she actually knew at the time she bid for the Units.  On the facts of this particular case, many of the findingsI made in relation to Cheungâs knowledge of Yungâs breach of trust are also relevant.  Cheung ought to know that there was somethingvery suspicious about the unconscionably short tender period of two and half days.  She was given the explanation by Yung that Voshad drained away the assets of Goldmark and Rabobank was demanding repayment of Goldmarkâs outstanding loan of $4 million withintwo weeks.  On my finding, she either purchased Unit 1A for herself and Unit 1D for Yung or both Units jointly for themselves.  Sheought to know that Yung was to be benefited by the sale at undervalue.  As Rabobank was not force selling the Units, why should sheand Yung be in a hurry to?  She must have known that Yungâs conduct was dubious and suspicious and his explanation was incapableof belief.  Furthermore, she concealed her and Yungâs identity in the tender process.  I have rejected her explanation that shedid so to keep her investment secret from her husband.  She would not have so concealed her identity as the person in control ofGlobal Fair bidding for and purchasing the Units if she did not entertain any belief that what she was doing was improper.  I amunable to accept her explanation as her genuinely held belief.  Having so rejected her explanation, I conclude that Cheung knew whatshe did was dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that Cheung knowinglyassisted in Yungâs breach with dishonest intention.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Cheung, Global Fair and Start Win assisted in Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty</p>    <p><a name="p437" class="para" id="p437">437.</a>  On the above finding of fact, I find that Cheung knowingly assisted in Yungâs breach with dishonest intention.  She is liablejointly with Yung to make good the loss suffered by the Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p438" class="para" id="p438">438.</a>  Global Fair was the corporate vehicle which assisted in Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty and in receipt of the Units sold to itpursuant to Yungâs breach.  As Cheung was a director and the controlling mind of Global Fair, her knowledge was imputed to GlobalFair.  Global Fair has therefore assisted Yung in the breach of fiduciary duty and is therefore liable jointly with Yung and Cheungfor the loss suffered by the Companies as a result of the sale of the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p439" class="para" id="p439">439.</a>  Start Win was not the first hand purchaser of Unit 1A from Yung at the time of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty.  At the time GlobalFair transferred Unit 1A to Start Win, Yungâs breach had already taken place.  It was impossible for it to have assisted Yung inhis breach.  Mr Lam submits that by reason of Global Fairâs transfer of Unit 1A to Start Win, Start Win, nevertheless assistedin Yungâs breach by concealing his beneficial interest in Unit 1A and in actualising the value of Unit 1A.  I do not agree withthe first limb of his argument for the simple reason that at the time of the transfer Yungâs breach had already been completed. The transfer of Unit 1A has no effect of covering up the prior sale by Yung to Global Fair.  In respect of the second limb of hisargument, I fail to see how by reason of the mortgage, Start Win could have assisted in actualising the value of Unit 1A.  The mortgagecreated a corresponding liability on Start Win.  Besides, the evidence suggests that Cheung was the purchaser and beneficial ownerof Unit 1A for having contributed to its purchase price.  I am unable to find Start Win had assisted in the breach.  It could beargued that the mortgage might have an effect on the value of Unit 1A as a real remedy which may be available to the Plaintiff. The point is academic in this case as the mortgage had been repaid and the unit sold pursuant to a Court order with part of the proceedsof sale paid into Court.  Start Win is not liable to the Plaintiff for dishonest assistance in Yungâs breach of trust.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether Global Fair and Start Win had knowledge of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty when receiving the Units and whether it is unconscionablefor them to retain the Units</p>    <p><a name="p440" class="para" id="p440">440.</a>  I have found that Cheung had actual knowledge of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty when she tendered for and purchased the Units. Actual knowledge means the first or the second or the third category under the <i>Baden</i> <i>scale</i>.  Cheung was the director and controlling mind of Global Fair and Start Win at the time when the Units were transferred to GlobalFair and Start Win.  A corporation must act through natural persons.  Hence, Cheungâs knowledge of Yungâs breach must be imputedto Global Fair and Start Win.  On the facts of the present case, it does not matter whether Cheungâs knowledge is the first, secondor third category under the <i>Baden</i> <i>scale</i>.  Insofar as the knowledge is of the first category, the test of unconscionability has been undoubtedly met.  Insofar as the knowledgeis of the second or third category, it makes no difference in the circumstances of this case.  On the facts of the present case,Global Fair and Start Win were the alter ego of Cheung.  Cheung was culpable as a knowing assister.  If she is liable as a knowingassister, it would be plainly unconscionable if she should be allowed to retain the Units.  The same applies to Global Fair as thecorporate vehicle used to carry out the design.  Furthermore, Global Fair received the Units at an undervalue which made it unconscionablefor it to retain the Units.  The test of unconscionability must be applied with common sense.  It cannot be right that if it is unconscionablefor Cheung to retain the Units, she can nevertheless retain them through Global Fair.  Accordingly, Global Fair is liable to thePlaintiff for knowing receipt of the Units.</p>    <p><a name="p441" class="para" id="p441">441.</a>  For the same reason, Start Win is the alter ego of Cheung imputed with her knowledge of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty.  Forthe same reason as in the case of Global Fair, it must be unconscionable for Start Win to retain Unit 1A.  Furthermore, Start Winwas a voluntary recipient of Unit 1A.  The sale from Global Fair was a fictitious transaction.  Start Win paid no consideration forUnit 1A.  It merely mortgaged Unit 1A and paid over the loan to Global Fair.  That payment could not be treated as part of the considerationfor the purchase.  Even if the mortgage was treated as consideration, it was at an undervalue.  Even if its knowledge of Yungâsbreach of fiduciary is of the second or third category in the <i>Baden</i> <i>scale</i>, it must be unconscionable for it to continue to retain Unit 1A.  <i>A fortiori</i>, if its knowledge is of the first category.  Start Win is therefore liable jointly with Yung, Cheung and Global Fair for the losssuffered by World Champ as a result of the sale of the Unit 1A.</p>    <p class="heading">Counterclaim for equitable set-off</p>    <p><a name="p442" class="para" id="p442">442.</a>  Cheung argues that as Goldmark had the benefit of being paid the purchase price for the Units which it had used to pay off Rabobankâsloan of $4,111,952, Global Fair is entitled to a counterclaim in respect of interest saved as a result.  The interest was to be calculatedat the rate of prime plus 3.75%, which is equivalent to a daily rate of $975.36.  Such counterclaim is groundless as Global Fairhad upon completion of the sale obtained possession and use of the Units.  The Companies were entitled to the price plus whateverdamages they suffered as a result of Yungâs breach and Global Fairâs knowing assistance in the breach.  Global Fairâs counterclaimis therefore dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Defence of limitation</p>    <p><a name="p443" class="para" id="p443">443.</a>  Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty and Cheungâs assistance took place in July 1993.  The action commenced in 1995.  On 6 September2000, Cheung was joined as a party pursuant to the order of Master Barnes, as she then was.  A claim of knowing assistance was pleadedagainst her.  That application was made <i>ex parte</i>.  Though Cheung was not a party to the application, her solicitors acting for Global Fair and Start Win were present at the hearingwhen the order was made.  Cheung never attempted to have the order set aside.  On 6 May 2005, the Plaintiff applied to amend there-amended statement of claim.  The amendment was largely technical and for clarification purpose only.  Suffiad J allowed the application. Cheung did not appeal against the order of Suffiad J.  She then pleaded the defence of limitation.</p>    <p><a name="p444" class="para" id="p444">444.</a>  Mr Lam submits that by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, the amendment which introduced a new claim against Cheung is deemed to have commenced on the same date as the original action andhence no question of limitation arises.

However, when readtogether with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35(3)</a>, it is plainly obvious that it could not have been the intention of the legislature to allow a plaintiff to circumvent the limitationprovisions by introducing amendment to the statement of claim under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35(1).</a>  The practice of the courts is not to allow an amendment which has the effect of reviving an otherwise statute-barred claim.

So far as the Plaintiffâs application for amendment is concerned, it was a simple application.  It was most unlikely that theissue of limitation would have been raised before Suffiad J.  In any event, limitation could not have been an issue to be properlyargued before his Lordship.  I am unable to agree with Mr Lam that the order of Suffiad J could have been interpreted as a determinationon the limitation issue.</p>    <p><a name="p448" class="para" id="p448">448.</a>  Mr Lamâs argument might have greater force in respect of the order made by Master Barnes, as she then was, when joining Cheungas the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant.  That was the most likely occasion when the issue of limitation would have been raised.  However, the joinder applicationwas made <i>ex parte</i>.  Though Cheungâs solicitors representing Global Fair and Start Win were present at the hearing, technically Cheung was not.  Limitationwas not an issue which affected Global Fair and Start Win.  Master Barnes, as she then was, made no order whether the limitationpoint may be raised or argued at trial.  Cheung was not present.  Obviously, the application and the issue of limitation had notbeen ruled on.  It was most unlikely that Cheung could have realised the effect of the deeming provision in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35(1)</a> and the need to set aside Master Barnesâ order.  She pleaded limitation after the amendment was allowed by Suffiad J.  Cheungâscase on limitation involves factual disputes which cannot be resolved without hearing <i>viva voce</i> evidence.  In the circumstances, it could not have been the case that by joining Cheung as a party, Master Barnes, as she then was,made a determination that the defence of limitation is wholly unarguable.  I find that it is open to Cheung to plead and argue onthe defence of limitation at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p449" class="para" id="p449">449.</a>  Six years have lapsed since the accrual of action before Cheung was joined as a party.  <i>Prima facie</i> the action against Cheung has been statute-barred.  Mr Lam relies on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(1)(b)</a> and argues that the facts relevant to the Companiesâ right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by Cheung and timedid not start to run until the Companies have disovered the concealment.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 26(1)</a> and (2) provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> â (1)  Subject to subsection (4), where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Ordinance,either â</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)  the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant;</p>            <p class="quote">(b)  any fact relevant to the plaintiffâs right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant; or</p>            <p class="quote">(c)  the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake,</p>            <p class="quote">the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud, concealment or mistake (as the casemay be) or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">  (2)  References in subsection (1) to the defendant include references to the defendantâs agent and to any person through whomthe defendant claims and his agent.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p450" class="para" id="p450">450.</a>  Cheung submits that to invoke <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(1)(b)</a>, the Plaintiff must prove deliberate concealment of facts relevant to the Plaintiffâs right by her or her agent.  She argues thatshe had not concealed anything from the Plaintiff and whatever acts of concealment, if committed, were committed by Yung.  She submitsthat she is entitled to have the benefit of the deliberate concealment by Yung of the fraud but time nevertheless runs against thePlaintiff in the normal way.  That argument is wholly unsustainable.  On the facts, I have found that Cheung bid for the Units pursuantto a common design with Yung.  What Yung did pursuant to that common design must be attributable to Cheung.  There is no shortageof evidence of deliberate concealment.  The question is what was the earliest time when the Plaintiff could with reasonable diligencehave discovered the concealment.  That was when time started to run against the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p451" class="para" id="p451">451.</a>  Cheung submits that there was never any concealment by her or Yung and concealment was impossible as the Official Receiver had takenover the management of the Companies since 20 August 1993 and had possession of all records and documents of the Companies.  Sheargues that the Official Receiver had possession of the tender form dated 14 July 1993 and could have realised that one âDr Cheungâwith a clinic telephone number bid for the Units on behalf of Global Fair.  She also submits that the Official Receiver could haveeasily found out her identity.  According to Vos, at that stage he was unable to associate that âDr Cheungâ or Global Fair withDr Winnie Cheung whom Yung had introduced to him.  I have no doubt in Vosâ evidence.  Even if he could, the name meant nothinguntil more evidence of the design was revealed during the course of the investigation.  That explains why when the Official Receiversought a mareva injunction against Global Fair and Start Win, but no injunction was sought against Cheung.</p>    <p><a name="p452" class="para" id="p452">452.</a>  Cheung submits that the Official Receiver could have discovered from company search the shareholders of Global Fair, Start Win andUniversal Agents Limited.  However, the records would only show Cheung to be a 1% shareholder of Global Fair and Start Win, but theownership of the remaining 99% shareholding of these companies was concealed by Avant Garde, a BVI bearer share company.  Cheungconcealed her own residential address by using the office address of Atkins Limited.  Neither the Official Receiver nor Vos couldhave associated the person named Cheung at the Atkins Limited address was the same Dr Winnie Cheung of Shatin.  For the same reasonsas given above, such discovery would mean nothing to the Official Receiver or Vos.</p>    <p><a name="p453" class="para" id="p453">453.</a>  Cheung submits that the Official Receiver could have discovered a copy of the cashier order of $850,000 used to pay the depositfrom the files of Messrs HLLY and Messrs WS, that the completion amount came from two different sources, a cheque of $2.05 millionfrom Messrs YCL and $1.35 million from HSBC and that four cheques were used to settle the outstanding loan owing to Rabobank.  Inmy view, those payments by themselves were just neutral events.</p>    <p><a name="p454" class="para" id="p454">454.</a>  Cheung submits that Vos knew Yung operated a veterinary clinic in Unit 1D since November 1993 and that veterinary surgeon was thesame consultant for New Champion.  That may link the veterinary clinic with Global Fair.  But Cheungâs identity was concealed byreason of her using the Atkins Limited address.  Thus Vosâ discovery could not suggest any involvement on the part of Cheung.</p>    <p><a name="p455" class="para" id="p455">455.</a>  Cheung submits that the land search of the Units after 20 November 1993 would have revealed Auâs appointment as director of GlobalFair, the sale of Unit 1A to Start Win and the mortgage of Unit 1D and that when traced along that line, Cheungâs involvement inthe Units would become obvious.  She said that Vos knew Au was related to Yung.  In the first place, there is no reason why the OfficialReceiver should periodically make land searches in relation to the Units.  The Official Recevier entertained no suspicion about Cheungor Global Fair and released the title deeds of the Units to Cheung in September 1993.  Secondly, I do not think the land search recordwould have revealed anything implicating Cheung.  The record could not have shown Unit 1D was mortgaged as security for overdraftfacilities of another company.  The record could not have shown Cheungâs involvement or signature on any of the documents as oneof the effects of, if not reasons, for Auâs appointment was to cover up Cheungâs involvement.  Besides, there is no reason whyOfficial Receiver should periodically make land searches in respect of the Units. </p>    <p><a name="p456" class="para" id="p456">456.</a>  While what Cheung and Au did in October to December 1993 was most extraordinary and suspicious, the land search and company searchby themselves could not have suggested their connection with Yung, not to mention Cheung, unless viewed together with the bank statementsof Global Fairâs bank account with First Pacific Bank.  Those statements would not be available until some months after January1994.  Unless the Official Receiver could pick up that lead and associate the evidence, he could have no idea of Cheungâs involvementin the design.  Six months thereafter would not have been an unreasonable time for exercise of due diligence for the Official Receiverto pick up the lead in view of the concealment.  Even then, it was still a long way off from having a case against Cheung.  A furthersix months thereafter would not have been an unreasonable time for the Official Receiver to build up a case against Cheung.  Timedid not start to run until January 1995.  On that count, the action was taken out within time.</p>    <p><a name="p457" class="para" id="p457">457.</a>  Mr Lam referred to the evidence given by Yung during his examination by the Official Receiver on 6 January 1995 when Yung concealedhis communication with Cheung about bidding for the Units.  Yung denied he was lying by craftily arguing that it was Cheung who spoketo him and not that he spoke to Cheung about the Units.  I reject that argument.  I find that he was concealing Cheungâs involvementin the design.  This is the background against which Cheung argues that she was entitled to the benefit of Yungâs concealment. I reject that argument.  As Cheung and Yung had embarked on a common design, what Yung did pursuant to that common design must beattributed to Cheung.  Mr Lam further argues that by telling the opposite, Yung was concealing.  I agree with that submission.  Thatevidence shows that even up to 6 January 1995, Cheung and Yung were still concealing Cheungâs involvement in the design.</p>    <p><a name="p458" class="para" id="p458">458.</a>  All along, Cheung had well concealed her identity on the tender form, the company documents of Global Fair and Avant Garde.  Thefirst hint of Cheungâs involvement in Yungâs design came from William Leung on 12 April 1995 during an interview with Mr Makof the Official Receiver when he disclosed a fax from Yung giving him instructions about the company structure for holding the Units. I think that is when time started to run against the Plaintiff.  Cheung was made a party on 6 September 2000.  That was well withinthe limitation period of six years.  The action against Cheung was not statute-barred.</p>    <p class="heading">Relief and damages </p>    <p><a name="p459" class="para" id="p459">459.</a>  Cheung argues that the Companies suffered no loss as Global Fair and Start Win were restrained from disposing of the Units, whichwere eventually sold pursuant to a court order below the price for which they were acquired by Global Fair.  She submits that theCompanies could have repaid Global Fair $4.25 million and have the Units back at anytime before the sale.</p>    <p><a name="p460" class="para" id="p460">460.</a>  The Plaintiff is not seeking to set aside the sale of the Units to Global Fair now.  He is claiming equitable compensation for Yungâsbreach of fiduciary duty and for Cheungâs, Global Fairâs and Start Winâs knowing assistance in the breach and knowing receiptof the Units.  Cheung concealed her identity and concealed Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty.  It was not until September 2000 thatthe Official Receiver was able to map out her involvement in assisting in Yungâs breach.  All along, it had never been Cheungâsstance that she, Global Fair and Start Win were ready and willing to return the Units to the Companies.  She vigorously contestedthe Plaintiffâs action throughout these sixteen years.  That she sold the Units at a loss was the result of her own mis-investmentand has no bearing on the damage suffered by the Companies as a result of her assistance in Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty.  Thereis no merit in her argument that the Companies suffered no loss as a result of her assistance in Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty. For reasons as stated in paragraphs 315 to 321, there is no reason for stopping the clock.  Cheung is jointly liable with Yung forequitable compensation which I assess to be $2.55 million.</p>    <p><a name="p461" class="para" id="p461">461.</a>  Apart from equitable compensation, the Plaintiff claimed various declarations in respect of the Units and the related property transactions,an account of income and proceeds of any dealing with the Units and an order setting aside the sale of the Units to Global Fair andStart Win.  The appropriateness of those remedies sought have been taken over by events, particularly the sale pursuant to the orderof A Cheung J.  As a result of the sale of the Units to third parties, I consider an order for equitable compensation with interestas from the date of breach or date of completion of the sale of the Units to Global Fair, i.e. 28 July 1993, is the only remedy whichis appropriate in the circumstances.</p>    <p class="heading"> (G)  action against the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p462" class="para" id="p462">462.</a>  Au was alleged to have rendered dishonest assistance to Yung in respect of the Sale of Units Claim and to have been involved inthe Misappropriation Claims in respect of the proceeds of sale of the Units in the amount of $90,000.</p>    <p><a name="p463" class="para" id="p463">463.</a>  Au was closely related to Yung and Mrs Yung.  He assisted in the operation of Goldmark, VIP Media, Wealth Country, Animal HealthCentre and Phoenix Veterinary Clinic.  He was instrumental to passing the shareholders resolutions and board of directors resolutionto enable Global to sell Unit 1A to Start Win and to mortgage Unit 1D in favour of New Champion and to Global Fairâs paying Yung$1.9 million.  This is as close as the Plaintiff could associate him with the design of Yung and Cheung.  Auâs conduct was relatedto Global Fair and Avant Garde subsequent to the auction, but was not proximate enough as to amount to knowing assistance. </p>    <p><a name="p464" class="para" id="p464">464.</a>  The other claim pleaded against Au was that he acknowledged on behalf of World Champ the receipt of a sum of $90,000 from MessrsWS as balance of the price of sale of Unit 1A which he then paid out to himself.  As the evidence revealed, the payment was indeedeffected by a cheque signed by Yung and made payable to Yung.  All Au did was to deposit the payment into the bank account of WorldChamp to which the money rightfully belonged.  Mr Lam then abandoned the claim against Au.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffâs actionagainst the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant is dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">(H)  action against the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p465" class="para" id="p465">465.</a>  New Champion was Yungâs corporate vehicle for taking over the Hillâs distributorship from Goldmark.  It was a company ownedand controlled by Yung.  It had the benefit of the use of Unit 1D as a security for its overdraft facilities from HSBC.  The Plaintiffâsclaim against New Champion is based on dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. </p>    <p><a name="p466" class="para" id="p466">466.</a>  Mr Lam submits that New Champion, being a company wholly or substantially owned and controlled by Yung was his alter ego and attributedwith the knowledge of Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty.  New Champion had the benefit of the mortgage over Unit 1D as security forthe overdraft facilities of $2.5 million granted by HSBC, which was used for the benefit of New Champion.  I have no difficultieswith that submission.  It is fully supported by the facts I have found.</p>    <p><a name="p467" class="para" id="p467">467.</a>  Mr Lam then submits that therefore New Champion received funds belonging to Goldmark and is liable to account for the same.  Thefunds were the facilities, i.e. loans to be advanced by HSBC from time to time to New Champion.  The party liable to repay was NewChampion, not Goldmark or World Champ.  The funds could not be said to be funds belonging to Goldmark.  HSBC had no right to callupon Goldmark for payment.  I fail to see how New Champion could be said to have received any fund from Goldmark, let alone thatthose funds were not trust property traceable to Yungâs breach of trust.  It is true that New Champion had the benefit of the useof Unit 1D as security for its purpose.  In the event of New Championâs default, HSBC will call on the security.  At the time ofthe mortgage, Goldmark had already sold Unit 1D to Global Fair.  Global Fair was the owner of Unit 1D and not Goldmark.  If the securitywere sold, it would have been Global Fair that suffered damage and not Goldmark whose damage had already been inflicted at the timeof the sale to Global Fair.  Goldmark may lose a real remedy in that the value of Unit 1D would have been reduced by the amount ofunpaid debt.  But that was not what the Plaintiff has pleaded, nor can I say the benefit of the use of Unit 1D as a security a propertyreceived traceable to Yungâs breach of trust.  Further, in any event, the mortgage had been repaid.  Goldmark could have sufferedno loss as a result of the receipt complained of.</p>    <p><a name="p468" class="para" id="p468">468.</a>  Mr Lam also submits that New Champion knowingly assisted Yung to continue concealing his interest in the Units acquired by him inbreach of fiduciary duty.  I think this argument could only be directed at New Champion in respect of Unit 1D.  I am quite unableto see how the mortgage could have the effect of concealing Yungâs interest in the Units.  Global Fair remained as the legal ownerof Unit 1D, though its status was reduced to that of a mortgagor.  New Champion did nothing to mask that fact.  Besides, at the timeof the mortgage, Yungâs breach of fiduciary duty had been completed.  As in the case against Start Win, I do not think concealingevidence of a breach of fiduciary duty amounted to assisting in its breach.</p>    <p><a name="p469" class="para" id="p469">469.</a>  For these reasons, the Plaintiffâs action against the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant must be dismissed.  For reasons already given, the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendantâs counterclaim against the Plaintiff must also be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">(I)  action against the 7<sup>th</sup> Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p470" class="para" id="p470">470.</a>  The Official Receiver has abandoned the claims against Mrs Yung, save for the default judgment entered against her for conspiracyin relation to the sale of the Units on liability with damages to be assessed.  Mrs Yung defaulted at this trial.  Accordingly, thedamages assessed at this trial shall be made against her.</p>    <p class="heading">(J)  Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p471" class="para" id="p471">471.</a>  For the above reasons, I enter judgment for the Plaintiff against the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants for damages as set out in paragraph 476 below.</p>    <p><a name="p472" class="para" id="p472">472.</a>  This case involves serious breach of fiduciary duty by Yung and dishonest assistance in a serious breach by Cheung and knowing receiptof the Companiesâ properties by Global Fair and Start Win.  Yung and Cheung have been most recalcitrant in their defence.  Theyput forward numerous arguments on the facts, which are frivolous, vexatious and factually incorrect.  In particular, Yung gave falseevidence and acted with glaring dishonesty.  He tried every trick to mislead the Court.  Cheung supported him and reinforced hisarguments.  An order for costs against them to be taxed on an indemnity scale is appropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p473" class="para" id="p473">473.</a>  In respect of the 7<sup>th</sup> Defendant against whom judgment on liability have been entered, I assess the damages for which she is liable to the Plaintiff tobe the same as that which the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants are found liable under the Attempted Secret Profit Claim and Sale of Units Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p474" class="para" id="p474">474.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim against the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant and 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants are dismissed.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant has obviously brought the litigation onto himself by reason of his suspicious conduct.  The 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant has also brought the litigation onto itself by reason of its association with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant who was its controlling mind.  Accordingly, there shall be no order as to costs as between the Plaintiff and the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p475" class="para" id="p475">475.</a>  All of the Defendantsâ counterclaims are dismissed. </p>    <p><a name="p476" class="para" id="p476">476.</a>  Accordingly, I make the following order:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> Defendants do pay the Plaintiff damages in the amount of $461,213.60 in respect of the Attempted Secret Profit Claim with interestat judgment rate with effect from 28 April 1992;</p>        <p>(2)  the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant do pay the Plaintiff damages in the amount of $416,990 in respect of the Misappropriation Claims with interest:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>i) on the sum of $19,500 with effect from  27 November 1991;</p>            <p>ii)  on the sum of $14,180 with effect from  30 July 1992;</p>            <p>iii)  on the sum of $200,000 with effect from 23 June 1993;</p>            <p>iv)  on the sum of $30,000 with effect from 21 July 1993;</p>            <p>v)  on the sum of $30,000 with effect from 23 July 1993;</p>            <p>vi)  on the sum of $33,310 with effect from  3 August 1993; and</p>            <p>vii)  on the sum of $90,000 with effect from 11 August 1993.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(3)  the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> Defendants do jointly pay the Plaintiff damages in the amount of $2.55 million in respect of the Sale of Units Claim with interestat judgment rate with effect from 28 July 1993, save that the liability of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant for damages shall be limited to $1.35 million with interest on that amount;</p>        <p>(4)  all of the Defendantsâ counterclaims against the Plaintiff are dismissed;</p>        <p>(5)  unless otherwise covered by previous Court orders, the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> Defendants do pay the Plaintiffâs costs of this action, including all costs reserved, to be taxed on an indemnity basis with interestat judgment rate with effect from 1 December 2009, save that the liability of the 7<sup>th</sup> Defendant for costs shall be limited to the costs incurred on or before 17 April 2001 and the costs of assessment of the damagesonly; and</p>        <p>(6)  all payments paid into Court by or on behalf of Global Fair and Start Win together with all accrued interest shall be paid outto the Official Reciever in partial discharge of the liability of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>  Defendants after fourteen days.</p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center"> </p>             </td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">( Anthony To )<br />                Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />                High Court</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr. Douglas Lam, instructed by M/s Dundons, for the Plaintiff by original action and the 1st and 2nd Defendants by counterclaim<br />        1st Defendant (by original action)/1st Plaintiff (by counterclaim), in person represented by the 6th Defendant<br />        2nd Defendant (by original action)/2nd Plaintiff (by counterclaim), in person<br />        3rd Defendant (by original action)/3rd Plaintiff (by counterclaim), in person represented by the 6th Defendant<br />        4th Defendant (by original action), in person<br />        5th Defendant (by original action)/5th Plaintiff (by counterclaim), in person represented by the 2nd Defendant<br />        6th Defendant (by original action)/6th Plaintiff (by counterclaim), in person<br />        7th Defendant (by original action), in person (absent)</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2009/1111.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
