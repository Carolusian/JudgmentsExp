The defendantsâ position is that, if the Statementof Claim is not dismissed and the action is permitted to continue, they do not oppose the proposed amendments sought by the plaintiffâssummons dated 3 September 2010 (this summons superseding that dated 30 July 2010).  So far as the split trial application is concerned,Mr Ashley Burns SC, appearing for the plaintiff, invited me to adjourn that application pending my decision on the strike out application.

Rather,the dispute between the parties has been whether the principle applies in the circumstances of this case.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In respect of the rule against reflective loss, it is necessary, when faced with an application to strike out a claim as offendingagainst that rule, to subject the pleadings to close scrutiny.  In <i>Johnsonâs</i> case, Lord Bingham said at p.36B-E:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThese principles do not resolve the crucial decision which a court must make on a strike-out application, whether on the factspleaded a shareholderâs claim is sustainable in principle, nor the decision which the trial court must make, whether on the factsproved the shareholderâs claim should be upheld. On the one hand the court must respect the principle of company autonomy, ensurethat the companyâs creditors are not prejudiced by the action of individual shareholders and ensure that a party does not recovercompensation for a loss which another party has suffered. On the other, the court must be astute to ensure that the party who hasin fact suffered loss is not arbitrarily denied fair compensation. The problem can be resolved only by close scrutiny of the pleadingsat the strike-out stage and all the proven facts at the trial stage: the object is to ascertain whether the loss claimed appearsto be or is one which would be made good if the company had enforced its full rights against the party responsible, and whether (touse the language of <i>Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20Ch%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] Ch 204</a>, 223) the loss claimed is âmerely a reflection of the loss suffered by the companyâ. In some cases the answer will be clear,as where the shareholder claims the loss of dividend or a diminution of the companyâs assets, or a loss unrelated to the businessof the company. In other cases, inevitably, a finer judgment will be called for. At the strike-out stage any reasonable doubt mustbe resolved in favour of the claimant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Chronology of this action</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The writ in this action was issued on 10 June 2009.

There should be no trial upon affidavit and disputed facts should be taken infavour of the party sought to be struck out. The court should not decide difficult points of law in striking out proceedings.  Theclaim must be obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claimto succeed before the court will strike it out: see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011 Vol.1</i> at Note 18/19/4 (p.404) citing <i>Ha Francesca v Tsai Kut Kan (No.1)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20HKC%20382" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 HKC 382.</a></p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  There was also no dispute between the parties that, on this application, the burden rested on the defendants to show that the claimwas plainly and obviously unsustainable.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  For the plaintiff, Mr Burns took a preliminary point that, due to its lateness, the application to strike out should not be entertainedat all or should only be acceded to in the clearest circumstances.  He pointed out that it was not until 24 August 2010 that thedefendants first challenged the plaintiffâs right to bring this action in correspondence and not until 12 October 2010 that thedefendants issued their strike out summons.  He referred to the commentary in <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011 Vol.1</i> at Note 18/19/3 (p.403) which includes the statements that âthe application should always be made promptly and as a rule beforethe pleadings are closedâ and âthe Court of Appeal has confirmed that late applications for strike out (i.e. at the commencementof the trial) should only be acceded to in the clearest circumstancesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I do not consider the timing of this application precludes a strike out. The commentary at Note 18/19/3 also states that âtheapplication may be made even after the pleadings are closed â¦ or the trial set down.  â¦ An important factor in exercising theCourtâs discretion [is] the emphasis upon saving precious court time, no matter the stage of the applicationâ.  Although thepleadings in this action have closed, they are subject to applications to amend by the plaintiff, and the action has not yet reachedthe stage of being set down.  Witness statements have not yet been exchanged.  The application was made promptly following the plaintiffâsresponse to requests for further and better particulars of its losses.  I note, in the context of the submission of delay, that thestriking out application which was entertained in <i>Johnsonâs</i> case was brought after the exchange of witness statements and the action had been fixed for trial.  For these reasons, I am satisfiedthat the timing of this application to strike out is not such that the court should decline to hear it, nor that it should applya more stringent test than normal in approaching it.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  More substantively, Mr Burns submitted that the no reflective loss principle had no application in this case for a number of reasons. First, he submitted that the principle only applies in respect of claims for damages and has no application to a claim for an accountof profits or to other relief sought by the plaintiff in this action.  Secondly, he submitted that the principle only applies toa plaintiff suing in his capacity as shareholder of a company and the plaintiff is not suing in such capacity in this action. Thirdly,he submitted that the causes of action relied on by the plaintiff in this action are different to those relied on in the DerivativeAction. Fourthly, he submitted that the losses claimed in this action may be greater than those recoverable in the Derivative Action.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I do not consider that the first point advanced on behalf of the plaintiff is correct.  In my opinion, the principle can apply toother types of remedies including an account of profits and is not limited to claims for damages.  The test is not the form of reliefbut, whether as a matter of substance, the claim is for monies that the company may claim for itself.  By way of example, see <i>Shaker v Al-Bedrawi</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20BCLC%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 BCLC 157</a> AT Â§80, where Peter Gibson LJ said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ We agree â¦ that if the claim by Mr Shaker for an account is in substance a claim to moneys to which ANA Inc has a claim againstMr Bedrawi, then consistently with the reasoning in <i>Johson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (a firm)</i> the <i>Prudential</i> principle would bar Mr Shakerâs claim for what in effect reflects part of the loss suffered by ANA Inc, and it matters not thatthe causes of action of Mr Shaker and ANA Inc are different. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See also, <i>Gardner</i> <i>v Parker</i> at Â§49 and <i>Minority Shareholders : Law, Practice and Procedure</i> by Victor Joffe QC et al. (3<sup>rd</sup> Ed.) at Â§1.151.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  So far as the plaintiffâs second point is concerned, namely that the principle only applies in respect of claims for damages andhas no application to a claim for an account of profits or to other relief sought by the plaintiff in this action, again, I do notconsider this submission to be correct.  It is trite that the principle is not only applicable to losses suffered by a claimant asshareholder but also to claims instigated by him in other capacities, such as creditor or employee: see <i>Landune International Ltd v Cheung Chung Leung</i> at Â§Â§31-32 where Yuen JA held :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â31. As for Mr Shumâs second submission that the fact that the Company owned shares in the Subsidiary should not be allowed toprejudice its claim, with respect that ignores the principle (or at least one of the principles) behind the rule against reflectiveloss â the prevention of double recovery. The principle debarring reflective loss is not based on the relationship of the plaintiffto the company, whether it be shareholder-company, or employee-employer, or creditor-debtor. The common thread is that the plaintiffâsloss would be made good if the company, employer or debtor, recovers from the defendant.</p>        <p class="quote"><a name="p32" id="p32">32.</a> Thus in <i>Gardner</i> <i>v Parker</i>, Neuburger L.J. held (Â§70):</p>        <p class="quote">â ... the rule against reflective loss is not limited to claims brought by a shareholder in his capacity as such; it would alsoapply to him in his capacity as an employee of the company with a right (or even an expectation) of receiving contributions to hispension fund. On that basis, <i>there is no logical reason why it should not apply to a shareholder in his capacity as creditor of the company expecting repaymentof his debt.</i> Indeed it is hard to see why the rule should not apply to a claim brought by a creditor (or indeed an employee) of the company concerned,even if he is not a shareholder.â (Emphasis added).</p>        <p class="quote">This conclusion is supported by a passage in Lord Millettâs speech in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood</i> (66):</p>        <p class="quote">âIf the company chooses not to exercise its remedy, the loss to the shareholder is caused by the companyâs decision not to pursueits remedy and not by the defendantâs wrongdoing.  By parity of reasoning, the same applies if the company settles for less thanit might have done.  Shareholders (<i>and creditors</i>) who are aggrieved by the liquidatorâs  proposals are not without a remedy; they can have recourse to the Companiesâ Court, orsue the liquidator for negligenceâ.   (Emphasis added).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See also, <i>Minority Shareholders: Law, Practice and Procedure</i> at Â§Â§1.156-1.157.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In considering the plaintiffâs third point, namely that the causes of action relied on by the plaintiff in this action are differentto those relied on in the Derivative Action, it is important to bear in mind that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the rule against reflective loss is not concerned with barring causes of action as such, but with barring recovery of certaintypes of loss.â</p>        <p>(<i>per</i> Neuberger LJ in <i>Gardner v Parker</i> at Â§49)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The principle applies where the loss claimed by the shareholder is merely reflective of the companyâs loss, even though the defendantmay owe wholly different duties to the company and to the shareholder : see <i>per</i> Peter Gibson LJ in <i>Shaker v Al Bedrawi</i> at Â§81 and principle (5) identified by Blackburne J in <i>Giles v Rhind</i> at Â§27.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Thus, the fact that the defendants in this action may owe different fiduciary duties to the plaintiff, by reason of the allegedrelationship of trust and confidence arising from their business dealings, to those owed by them as directors to API and AHI, doesnot affect the application of the principle.  Similarly, the reliance by the plaintiff on breaches of contractual duties or dutiesin tort on the part of the defendants does not affect its application.  Ultimately, the question is whether the loss allegedly sufferedby the plaintiff by reason of the breaches asserted in the action is merely reflective of the companiesâ loss.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  When the Statement of Claim in this action is compared with the Statement of Claim in the Derivative Action, it is clear that thefiduciary duties relied on by the plaintiff in this action (see Â§15 of the draft AmSoc) overlap with those pleaded in the DerivativeAction (see Â§80 of the AmSoc in that action). The asserted duties in this action are duties to act in good faith and not to makea profit at the expense of the plaintiff or to act for their own benefit to the exclusion of the plaintiff and these are not anydifferent, in substance, to those alleged to be owed by the defendants to the companies as directors.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I also agree with Mr Yan that the conduct relied upon by the plaintiff as constituting the alleged breach of duties in both actionsis essentially the same, namely setting up competing businesses, misappropriating business opportunities belonging to the companiesand misuse of the companiesâ information.  The observation of Lord Millett in <i>Johnsonâs</i> case, commenting on <i>Stein v Blake</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20All%20ER%20724" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 All ER 724</a>, is apposite here:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe plaintiff sought to distinguish <i>Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20Ch%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] Ch 204</a> by arguing that the defendant was in breach of a duty owed to him personally. But, as I pointed out, that was not the problem. Theproblem was that the only conduct relied upon as constituting a breach of that duty was the misappropriation of assets belongingto the old companies, so that the only loss suffered by the plaintiff consisted of the diminution in the value of his shareholdingwhich reflected the depletion of the assets of the old companies. The old companies had their own cause of action to recover theirloss, and the plaintiffâs own loss would be fully remedied by the restitution to the companies of the value of the misappropriatedassets.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In short, I am satisfied, from a comparison of the pleadings in this action and in the Derivative Action, that the same conducton the part of the defendantsâ forms the basis of the claims in both actions.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Mr Burnsâ fourth point in respect of the applicability of the no reflective loss principle was that the losses claimed in thisaction may be greater than those recoverable in the Derivative Action.  His submission in this regard was that, in this action, theplaintiff is suing for breaches of the restrictive covenants contained in the JVA (clause 22.1) and the Supplemental JVA (clause1.3) and fiduciary duties (as pleaded in Â§Â§12 to 15 of the draft AmSoc), as well as the tort of inducing such breaches, which causesof action are not available to the companies.  Furthermore, he submitted that the fiduciary duties pleaded in the Derivative Actionare the normal duties of a director and these are not co-extensive with those which the plaintiff alleges were owed to it in thisaction. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  It was submitted that, by reason of the differences in the causes of action relied upon in the two actions, the court might holdthat some of the conduct complained of by the plaintiff does not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty owed to the companies, althoughit might amount to breaches of the non-compete restrictive covenant in the JVA and Supplemental JVA or to breaches of the specificfiduciary duties owed by the defendants or either of them directly to the plaintiff.  Thus, the losses claimed by the plaintiff inthis action may well be greater than those recoverable by the companies in the Derivative Action.  It is incumbent on the plaintiff,submitted Mr Burns, to show that the whole of the losses claimed by the plaintiff reflected what the companies had lost and whatthey have a cause of action to recover.  Since it is unlikely that the loss claimed in this action is merely reflective of the companiesâloss and probable that the plaintiff may elect to pursue an account of profits rather than damages, the defendants cannot show this.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  For the latter submission as to the need to show the whole of the losses are reflective of what the companies had lost, Mr Burnsrelied on <i>Shaker v Al Bedrawi</i> at p.159d and <i>Perry v Day</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2004/1398.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] EWHC 1398 (Ch)</a>, 18.6.04 at Â§Â§58-59 &amp; 68-71.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  It is important to note that an essential difference between <i>Shakerâs</i> case and <i>Perry v Day</i> is that in those cases no derivative claim had yet been advanced.  Hence, in those cases, the courts were speculating as to whatthe companyâs claim against the relevant defendants might be.  Here, the Derivative Action has been commenced and API and AHIâscase against the defendants fully pleaded.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Furthermore, in <i>Shakerâs</i> case it was not part of the plaintiffâs case that the abstraction of monies from the company was in breach of his duty to the companyor an unlawful distribution or otherwise involved a breach of duty by Mr Al-Bedrawi to the company (see <i>per</i> Peter Gibson LJ at Â§60).  In those circumstances, the court held that the defendants had to satisfy the court that it was the inevitableconclusion from the facts which were admitted or agreed to be assumed that the abstraction of monies was a breach of duty by Mr Al-Bedrawito the company.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Similarly, in <i>Perry v Day</i>, the company had no cause of action against Mrs Day for the relevant loss (see Â§69).</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  That is to be contrasted with the position here where, in the Derivative Action, it is pleaded that the very same conduct complainedof by the plaintiff in this action constitutes breaches of fiduciary duty owed by the defendants to API and AHI and that, by reasonof such breaches, those companies have suffered loss and damage (see AmSoc in Derivative Action Â§Â§78-81).  In this context, assumingthe facts pleaded in the Derivative Action are established, I do not think the dictum of Laskin J in <i>Canadian Aero Service Ltd v OâMalley</i> (1973) 40 DLR (3rd) 371 at p.382, relied upon by Mr Burns, would lead to the conclusion that the activities complained of did notconstitute a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the defendants as a director and former director respectively of API and AHI.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I therefore do not accept that this, fourth, point advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs demonstrates that the no reflective lossprinciple cannot operate in this case.  On the contrary, I am satisfied that it has been demonstrated clearly by the defendants thatthe loss sought to be claimed by the plaintiff in this action is purely reflective of loss suffered by API and AHI, which loss isbeing claimed by those companies in the Derivative Action. A comparison of the claims made in this action and the Derivative Actionshows, in my opinion, that the claims are for the same loss.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I would add that my conclusion as to the applicability of the no reflective loss principle is not affected by the submission, whichMr Burns advanced, that the defendants have failed to give discovery of documents relating to earnings made by and profits derivedfrom the Alleged Competing Lounges and hence the plaintiff is not in a position to plead particulars of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In my opinion, the present action can and has been shown to infringe the rule against no reflective loss without reference to theactual quantum of damages being identified.  Notwithstanding the absence of discovery, there was and is nothing to prevent the plaintiffpleading the types of loss and damage it alleges it has suffered and which might be different to the loss for which the companiesmight claim in the Derivative Action.  In any event, I agree with the submission of Mr Yan that the earnings or profits of the AllegedCompeting Lounges (of which there is yet to be discovery), if said to be earnings and profits which API and AHI would otherwise haveearned, would fall to be recoverable loss of those companies and is claimed as such (see AmSoc in Derivative Action Â§95).</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Finally, Mr Burns submitted that there is no real prejudice to the defendants if this action is not struck out since (i) the interlocutorysteps in the action are at an advanced stage, (ii) the outstanding matters will arise in the Derivative Action in any event, and(iii) this action and the Derivative Action can be consolidated.  Because of these matters, it was submitted that there will in practicebe no or no significant saving in costs if the action is struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I do not accept this submission.  The question before me is whether the action is sustainable or not, not whether it should be allowedto proceed to trial as a matter of discretion.  In <i>Landune International Ltd v Cheung Chung Leung</i> at Â§33, Yuen JA cited Lord Millettâs speech in <i>Johnsonâs</i> case at p.62E-G where he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf the shareholder is allowed to recover such loss, then either there will be double recovery at the expense of the defendant orthe shareholder will recover at the expense of the company and its creditors and other shareholders. Neither course can be permitted.This is a matter of principle; there is no discretion involved. Justice to the defendant requires the exclusion of one claim or theother; protection of the interests of the companyâs creditors requires that it is the company which is allowed to recover to theexclusion of the shareholder.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In short, if the claim offends the no reflective loss principle, it should be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I conclude that the defendants are correct in their submission that the plaintiffâs claims in thisaction offend against the no reflective loss principle and should accordingly be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause ofaction.  The Derivative Action will continue, in which the companies can pursue the defendants for their alleged losses.</p>    <p class="heading">Disposition and costs</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  I therefore make an order in terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the defendantsâ strike out summons dated 12 October 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff pay the defendants the costs of the strike out summons dated 12 October 2010, with a certificate for two counsel,to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In the circumstances, the other applications of the plaintiff before me (see Â§Â§1(1) to 1(3) above) are dismissed and I make anorder <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff pay the defendants the costs of those applications, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p><br />	</p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Joseph Fok)<br />            Justice of Appeal<br />            (sitting as an additional Judge of the<br />                  Court of First Instance, High Court)<br /></td>        </tr>    </table><!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p> </p>	<p>Mr Ashley Burns, SC instructed by Messrs Tanner De Witt, for the Plaintiff</p><p>Mr John Yan, SC and Ms Sara Tong, instructed by Messrs William W.L.
