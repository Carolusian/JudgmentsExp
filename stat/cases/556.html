The Applicant was however incorporated on 18 July 2000. The Respondentssubmitted that the alleged outstanding sums and the accrued cause of action took place before the incorporation of the Applicant.As the obligation to pay the Management Expenses was one of contract and arose out of the Deed of Mutual Covenant of the Estate,the Respondents submitted that the Applicant had no <em>locus standi</em> to bring this claim.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The Respondents submitted that an owners' corporation could not assume those benefits and burdens attached under a deed of mutualcovenant prior to its incorporation unless by a specific act of the corporation or by specific legislation. In making this submission,the Respondents relied on the cases of <strong>Hang Yick Properties Management Ltd. v. Incorporated Owners of Winner Building</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%203%20HKC%20574" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 3 HKC 574</a> and <strong>Koo Sun Yiu v. Victorison Delivery Ltd. &amp; Ors.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%204%20HKC%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 4 HKC 152.</a> In the case of Hang Yick, the plaintiff was appointed manager of a building in 1978 when a deed of mutual covenant was in place.The plaintiff was not a party to the deed of mutual covenant but the deed of mutual covenant confirmed that the plaintiff, as agentof the owners, was able to recover amounts unpaid. In 1994 the defendant was incorporated and the plaintiff was given notice of termination.The plaintiff claimed that the costs and expenses incurred prior to termination exceeded the management fees received and sued thedefendant for the deficit. The court was asked to decide the issue of whether the defendant was liable for the expenses incurredprior to its incorporation.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Beeson J. in the <strong>Hang Yick</strong> case held that there was no contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, nor was there an agency relationshipbefore or after the defendant's incorporation. In her judgment, Beeson J. said this:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The liabilities for management fees incurred prior to the termination of the plaintiff's appointment as manager could not be enforceableagainst the defendant in the absence of specific legislative provision requiring an owners' corporation to assume responsibilityfor pre-existing debts of that nature, or by some specific act of the corporation, once it came into existence, assuming responsibility,for debts previously incurred."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In fact, Beeson J. applied the decision of Cheung J. (as he then was) in the earlier case of <strong>Koo Sun Yiu</strong>, where it was also held that the corporation did not assume liabilities incurred prior to its incorporation. The <em>ratio</em> and deciding factor in the <strong>Hang Yick</strong> case was based upon fundamental principles of company law. At common law a company was not bound by a contract purporting to be enteredinto on its behalf by its promoters or other person before its incorporation. After incorporation it could not ratify or adopt anysuch contract because in such cases there was no agency and the contract was that of the parties making it. The Respondents submittedthat one could also use the fundamental principle of privity of contract to make a similar argument.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> In the present case, as submitted by the Respondents, there was no agency pleaded as between the former Owners' Association and theApplicant, nor was there any pleading of any act of the Applicant to ratify the contract or of any assignment as between the Owners'Association and the Applicant. The Respondent further submitted that there was nothing in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>, or anything pleaded, which provided for the automatic assignment of debts from one management entity to the next. The proper plaintiffin this case would have to be the former managers. However, the former managers did not have a <em>locus</em> <em>standi</em> to sue based on the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> and the <strong>Hang Yick</strong> Case. The former Owners' Association might have abandoned its right to sue for the alleged outstanding management fees.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> By reason of the aforesaid, the Respondents submitted that the Applicant did not have a right to sue the Respondents, and the Applicant'spleadings ought to be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Applicant, on the other hand, submitted that the applicable principles in striking out were well founded and set out in the HongKong Civil Procedure 2002, Volume 1, Order 18 rule 19. The Applicant summarized the relevant principles as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"a. The application should always be made promptly and as a rule before the pleadings are closed.</p>        <p class="quote">b. It is only in plain and obvious cases that the Court should exercise its power summarily to strike out the claim.</p>        <p class="quote">c. The claim must be obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for theclaim to succeed before the Court will strike it out.</p>        <p class="quote">d. If there is a point of law which requires serious discussion an objection should be taken on the pleadings and an application madefor determination of the point of law under Order 33 rule 3.</p>        <p class="quote">e. It is for the party seeking to strike out a pleading to demonstrate that the case is a plain and obvious one in which the otherparty's claim is bound to fail.</p>        <p class="quote">f. A reasonable cause of action means a cause of action with some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading areconsidered. The mere fact that the case is weak and not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The Applicant submitted that the Respondents had failed to satisfy the Tribunal of the matters referred to in the above principlesand the burden was on them to do so. In particular, the Respondents were late in making this application. The Notice of Applicationwas issued on 12 October 2000. The present Application was made more than 2 years later and no explanation was given for the lateness.The Applicant submitted that on this point alone, the Tribunal should exercise its discretion not to entertain such an application.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Applicant also submitted that it had at least a good arguable case. The Applicant referred to section 16 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap. 344</a> ("the BMO"), which reads as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"When the owners of a building have been incorporated under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8</a>, the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the owners in relation to the common parts of the building shall be exercised and performedby, and the liabilities of the owners in relation to the common parts of the building shall, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance,be enforceable against, the corporation to the exclusion of the owners, and accordingly-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) any notice, order or other document which relates to any of the common parts of the building may be served upon the corporationat its registered office; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b) any proceedings in the tribunal in respect of any of the common parts of the building may be brought and pursued by or againstthe corporation."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In <strong>Grenville House Ltd &amp; Ors v. Incorporated Owners of Grenville House</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20HKLR%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] HKLR 235</a>, McMullin J. found that under section 16 of the Multi-storey Buildings (Owners Incorporation) Ordinance (now the BMO), the rightsand duties of the corporation in matters of suit touching the common parts of the property were limited to circumstances which concernedall the owners as a result of their joint interest in the due maintenance management and control of those parts. At page 243, McMullinJ. concluded that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"For those limited purposes the body of the owners may be said to consist of every individual who ever has been a constituent of thecorporation. It matters not that at the time of issuing the writ the body of the constituents is not the same as it was at the timeof accrual of the action any more than it would matter that that body is not the same at the time of judgment even though it hadbeen the same at the time of issue of the writ. In pursuing those purposes it is serving the interests of all including those whoare no longer constituents but have been damnified and those who are now constituents and have never been damnified. For a majorpurpose of the incorporation of the owners is to facilitate convenience in suit."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In the <strong>Koo Sun Yiu</strong> case, Cheung J. considered the <strong>Grenville House</strong> case and said that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is clear from the facts of <em>Grenville House</em> that the corporation there came into existence before the tort was committed. Although McMullin J said that it matters not that atthe time of issuing the writ the body of the constituents is not the same as it was at the time of accrual of action, the learnedjudge was not dealing with a situation such as the present where the corporation only came into existence after the tort was committed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Whilst Cheung J. acknowledged the <strong>Greenville House</strong> case as binding authority in respect of liabilities arising after incorporation, he pointed out that in the <strong>Koo Sun Yiu</strong> case the tortious liability had arisen before the incorporation and therefore distinguishable. Accordingly Cheung J. held that thecorporation was not responsible for the tort committed prior to its incorporation.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The Applicant submitted that the Estate in the present case, i.e. Greenland Villas, was previously managed by Chiap Hua PropertyManagement Limited as the Manager appointed under the Deed of Mutual Covenant. Chiap Hua was the Manager from 1986 to 1989 and thereafterresigned from the job. The Owners' Association was then managing the Estate until the incorporation of the Applicant on 18th July2000. But the fees collected by the Manager did not belong to the Manager. The Manager was only acting as agent collecting the feeson behalf of all the owners in the Estate. With or without the appointment of the Manager, the Respondents were required to pay thefees to the owners.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Just before the date of incorporation of the Applicant, all the owners in the Estate would have a cause of action against the Respondentsfor the arrears of fees and therefore could have joined in to sue the Respondents. With the incorporation, the owners had a furtherchoice under the BMO to sue the Respondents in the name of the Corporation (i.e. the Applicant) as the owners have a common interestin the management fees as provided under section 18(2)(g) of the BMO.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In the case of <strong>Incorporated Owners of Block F1-F7 Pearl Island Holiday Flats v. Incorporated Owners of Pearl Island Garden &amp; Anor.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%204%20HKC%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 4 HKC 424</a>, the Court of Appeal had to consider the meaning of section 18(2)(g) of the BMO. At page 428, Liu J.A. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I agree with my Lord Godfrey JA's conclusion on locus standi on a purposive construction of s18(2)(g). It would seem to be an interpretationendorsed by common sense for avoiding the joinder of a great many flats owners in litigation and other matters.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18(2)(g)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap 344</a>) reads:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">A Corporation may, in its discretion - act <em>on behalf of</em> the owners in respect of any other matter in which the owners have a common interest.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In the other paragraphs of sub-s (2), the corporation may act on its own to 'pay', 'retain and remunerate', 'retain and remunerate','insure and keep insured', 'purchase, hire or otherwise acquire' and 'establish and maintain'. There is little to be said for theproposition that the corporation must not sue in its own name in the last paragraph. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18(2)(g)</a> has not sought to introduce the relationship of agency which would necessitate the observance of the robust common law rule for suingin the names of the principals. After all, the phrase 'on behalf of' has no strict legal meaning and may be used in conjunction witha wide range of relationships.....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In the long title of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap 344</a>), its purpose is given as facilitating 'the incorporation of owners of flats in buildings or groups of buildings, to provide... for matters incidental thereto or connected therewith'. In this way, a multitude of flat owners may simply be represented bythe body corporate. When introducing this legislation in the Legislative Council, Sir Denys Roberts, the then Attorney General statedits object as enabling 'the owners of multi-storey buildings to form themselves into a corporation which would have the power todeal on their behalf with matters of common interest to them as co-owners'."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Applicant further submitted that in the <strong>Hang Yick</strong> case, the Court was concerned with liabilities of the corporation. The manager there sued the corporation for arrears of fees beforeits incorporation and failed. But the manager could have sued all the owners for the respective period of default. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> of the BMO did not deal specifically with liabilities prior to the incorporation nor did it specifically restrict the extent of theliabilities. Similarly, the <strong>Koo Sun Yiu</strong> case was concerned with liabilities of the corporation. The injured plaintiff there could have sued all the owners of the propertyat the time of the tortious act.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The Applicant also referred to the recent case of <strong>Incorporated Owners of Million Fortune Industrial Centre v. Jikan Development Ltd &amp; Anor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%204%20HKC%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 4 HKC 33</a>, where the major point taken on behalf of the first defendant was that the plaintiff could not sue in respect of any wrongs whichhad been committed prior to its incorporation. The Court of Appeal in that case did not find favour with the restriction on the rightto sue for wrongs committed prior to incorporation and held that the plaintiff incorporated owners had the right to take action onbehalf of the owners collectively by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the BMO to enforce reimbursement of the parking fees which had been passed to the first defendant. At page 40, Rogers VP saidthis:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"However, the major point taken on behalf of the first defendant was that the plaintiff could not sue in respect of any wrongs whichhad been committed prior to its incorporation. It was said that any right of action was a personal right which did not run with theland but was a right which belonged to each individual owner at the time that the wrong was committed. The upshot of the argument,from which Mr. Ho did not shrink, was that if parking fees which should have been paid into the management sink fund were otherwisediverted, the right of action lay in each individual owner. If the manager were not prepared to take action, then every person orcompany who was an owner at the relevant time would have to take action to enforce the provisions of cl 8(b) of the DMC in orderto ensure that the monies were paid over. This, it was said, was despite the fact that the owners individually were not entitledto any sums and that claimed monies recovered were required to be credited to the management sink fund.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This wholly unattractive argument would lead to litigation which could only be described as inconvenient and cumbersome. But in myview there is a short answer to this point. The monies which the manager received as parking fees in respect of car and lorry parkingin the common parts was money which was impressed with a trust."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The Applicant therefore submitted that the Respondents owed the Management Expenses under the Deed of Mutual Covenant to all theother owners of the Estate and the owners were pursuing their claim in the name of the Applicant by virtue of the BMO. This casewas not concerned with liabilities of the Applicant. The Applicant had taken over the duties and rights of the owners and was suingfor outstanding Management Expenses.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> In the circumstances, the Applicant submitted that it had at least a good arguable case in respect of the defence of "incorporation".</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> I accept the submissions of the Applicant. I agree with the general principles in striking out applications as summarized by theApplicant above. I should therefore strike out the Applicant's claim only if it is plain and obvious that the Applicant cannot makea claim for debts owed to the owners of the Estate prior to the incorporation of the Applicant. However, from the above authorities,I cannot come to that conclusion. In particular, the case of <strong>Incorporated Owners of Million Fortune</strong> does give a strong support to the Applicant's contention that it can make a claim for the Management Expenses owed before its incorporation.The cases of <strong>Hang Yick</strong> and <strong>Koo Sun Yiu</strong> relied on by the Respondents are only in relation to pre-existing liabilities of owners' corporation. They are not direct authoritieson whether an owners' corporation can bring an action for pre-incorporation debts. So I agree with the Applicant that there is atleast an arguable case for the Applicant to bring the present action.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> As the Respondents are not making an application to seek for a determination in this preliminary issue, it is not necessary for meto decide whether the Applicant can indeed make a claim for pre-incorporation debts. I shall therefore leave that decision to theappropriate stage. I do however find that the Applicant has a reasonable cause of action by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the BMO. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> stipulates that when the owners of a building have been incorporated, the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the owners inrelation to the common parts of the building shall be exercised and performed by the corporation to the exclusion of the owners.The Management Expenses were incurred in relation to the common parts of the Estate. Although <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> does not expressly state that it applies to pre-existing rights, the case of <strong>Incorporated Owners of Million Fortune</strong> makes it at least arguable that the incorporated owners has the right to enforce reimbursement of pre-existing debts by virtue of<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16.</a> By the same token, it is also arguable that the Applicant can claim the pre-incorporation Management Expenses in the present case.In fact, it is the Respondents' own submission that an owners' corporation cannot assume those benefits and burdens attached undera deed of mutual covenant prior to its incorporation, unless by specific legislation. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> may well be such a specific legislation conferring the benefit and burden to the owners' corporation.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> I do not agree with the Respondents that the Applicant has to plead in its pleadings the matters concerning agency, or any act ofthe Applicant to ratify the contract or of any assignment as between the Owners' Association and the Applicant. The Applicant's caseis not based on agency or any act of ratification or assignment, but by the operation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the BMO. The operation of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> is purely a matter of law. It is trite law that it is unnecessary to plead points of law in the pleadings. I therefore do not findany objection in the Applicant's pleadings when they do not contain the matters referred to by the Respondents.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Thus, I am of the view that the Applicant's pleadings are not bad in their present forms, and the issue concerning <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the BMO does require serious discussion. I cannot say that it is impossible for the Applicant's claim to succeed at the trial,and as such there must be a reasonable cause of action for the claim to proceed.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Moreover, in their Notice of Opposition dated 4 November 2000, the Respondents have already raised the contention that the Applicantis not empowered by the BMO to recover the Management Expenses prior to its date of incorporation. Nevertheless, the Respondentshave only taken out the application for striking out the Applicant's pleadings more than 2 years later on 6 November 2002. Althoughthe Respondents have tried to explain at the hearing of the application that there were some negotiations going on between the parties,I do not accept that it is right for the Respondents to take out such an application at such a late stage when the case is in factready for trial. Negotiations should be conducted in parallel to the court proceedings, and there is no reason at all to wait forabout 2 years for the outcome of the negotiations. I therefore agree with the Applicant that on this ground alone I should not entertainthe application for striking out.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In the circumstances, I do not find any merit in the Respondents' application and I order as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The Respondents' application by way of Inter Partes Summons dated 6 November 2002 be dismissed; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) Costs order nisi: The Respondents do pay the costs of the said application to the Applicant in any event with certificate forcounsel, to be taxed if not agreed. If there is no further application on costs by any party within 14 days from the date hereof,the costs order nisi shall become absolute.</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Deputy Judge WONG</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Presiding Officer</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Lands Tribunal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. Dennis LAW, instructed by M/S Wong, Hui &amp; Co., for the Applicant.</p>        <p>Mr. Alex LOK, instructed by M/S F.
