Hosier &amp; Dickinson Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%201%20WLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 1 W.L.R. 146</a> upon the meaning of the conclusive evidence clause, c1. 30(7) which for some time appeared in the RIBA form of contract in England.In the Court below the argument had proceeded upon the basis that that clause was conclusive in the contractor's favour, unless certainspecial arguments prevailed. These had failed below, and failed again in the House of Lords. But during the course of the argumentLord Diplock suggested a fresh construction of this clause to the appellant's counsel. This was to the effect that the Certificateonly operated at its date, and did not relate back or exclude all liability for consequential loss. In the event the majority declinedto receive or pronounce upon so novel and late an argument, although both Lord Wilberforce and Lord Pearson made useful commentsupon it. Lord Diplock dissented and gave his reasons for preferring his construction, which was that the Certificate did not excludea particular head of consequential loss, namely loss consequential to a defect arising after practical completion and suffered beforethe same was remedied by the contractor.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It is, I think, quite unnecessary for me to express any view on clause 30(7) or upon the differing views of H.H. Judge Stabb Q.C.in H. Fairweather Limited v. Asden Securities Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2012%20BLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 12 BLR 40</a> and H.H. Judge Newey Q.C. in H.W. Nevill (Sunblest) Limited v. William Press &amp; Son Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2020%20BLR%2078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 20 BLR 78.</a> But the authority is of value in two ways. The first is the reasoning of the Law Lords who considered the argument. The second isLord Diplock's reasons for drawing a distinction between pre and post practical completion consequential loss. Lord Diplock foundno necessary implication excluding post practical completion loss, p.166. But he did in respect of the earlier period relying inpart upon the liquidated damages clause. He did not think that the preservation of any right in damages made "business sense". "Provided",he said, "that the contractor puts it right timeously I do not think that the parties intended that any temporary disconformity shouldof itself amount to a breach of contract by the contractor." This approach would be insufficient to save the present Statement ofClaim, and Mr. Lane invited me to reject it. He asked me to apply Lord Diplock's post practical completion reasoning to the wholeperiod, and conclude that these certificates have no conclusive effect upon any consequential loss.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Having carefully considered all that was put before me, I have no hesitation in concluding that the arguments in favour of Mr. Auld'sconstruction are overwhelming. The words used in the Side Agreement, and especially the phrase "the Sub-Contractor has duly performedall his obligations in respect of the Sub-Contract Works save and except for" (my emphasis) could hardly be broader or more specific.Unlike the RIBA Clause 30(7), the relationship between the Certificate and the state of the premises is clear and explicit. The changeof tense between clause 3(b) of the Schedule "are in all respects"; and clause 5(e) "has duly performed" seems to negative any semanticargument. There is a direct pointer to the past. Four exceptions are expressly named, and consequential loss of any kind is not oneof them.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I accept the force of Mr. Lane's criticism of Lord Diplock's temporal split, and that the necessary implication argument appliedto clause 30(7) can more readily attach either to the whole period or not at all. But in relation to clause 5(e) this same approachleads inexorably I think to a whole period conclusion. The adoption of Mr. Lane's argument (and to a considerable extent Lord Diplock'salso) would lead to the conclusion that a Certificate of apparent value to a Sub-Contractor, and deliberately provided for by theplaintiffs in their own documentation, is in truth almost completely valueless. Its issue is the condition precedent to the releaseof the retention monies. This suggests what Lord Wilberforce called in J. Jarvis and Sons v. Westminister Corporation  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20WLR%20637" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) W.L.R. 637</a>, at-p.650: "Such final and verified completion as enables certificates to be given, final payment to be made and the party clearedof all obligations under the Contract". It also suggests in Lord Pearson's words in Kaye v. Hosier at p.163 the conveying of "approvaland absolution not only in respect of the final result, but also in respect of the series of operations leading up to the final result".But if Mr. Lane is right there would in fact be no finality, no absolution, and no release of the retention monies at all. The employercould at once meet any claim for the retention monies with his set off for consequential loss.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> In my judgment therefore the issue of a Certificate to a Sub-Contractor under clause 5(e) is conclusive evidence in his favour thathe has performed all his obligations in respect of the Sub-Contract Works, which phrase must at least cover the contractual obligationsunder that Side Agreement and the rrelevant Sub-Contract referred to, unless one of the given exceptions applies.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Mr. Lane sought to rely upon exception (i) and clause 1(b) and an alleged conflict between the two. The argument fails. The typeof warranty envisaged by clause 5(e)(i) is a continuing warranty or one given for some future period under for example clause 1(a).No such warranty is alleged to have been given here. There is no conflict between clause 1(b) and clause 5(e). The former simplysupplements the latter, and picks up post Certificate defects (if any) which emerge during the succeeding year.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> These Certificates of 16th February 1984 therefore operate conclusively against all the plaintiffs claims in Contract. I shall turnnow to the claim in tort.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>(2)             This defendant did not seek to argue. that these Side Agreements were inconsistent with the existence of any dutyin tort, or deny that under such authorities as Anns v. Merton London Borough Council  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) A.C. 728</a> and Junior Books v. Veitchi  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20AC%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) A.C. 520</a>, the proximity created by the Contracts might justify the imposition of a duty in tort. The contention was that assuming Lord Wilberforce'sfirst question. in Anns at p.571 might be answered in the plaintiff's favour, when one came to consider his second question the termsof the Side Agreements operated "to reduce or limit the scope of that duty".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> This submission seems to me prima facie to be well founded. There is now ample authority for the proposition that notwithstandingthe existence of a contractual duty relationship, the law can impose a parallel duty in tort. But his is usually "one and the sameduty" in the words of Lord Denning M.R. in Esso Petroleum Limited v. Mardon  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20QB%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) Q.B. 801</a>, 820: and not one which conflicts with the express or implied terms of the contract per Shaw L.J. in Esso at p.833 and Midland Bankv. Hett Stubbs &amp; Kemp  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20Ch%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) Ch. 384.</a> Lord Roskill's dictum in Junior Books at p.546 supports this approach. Equally significant to my mind is Lord Fraser's observationin the same case at p.533 that a duty not to produce a defective article "has to be judged largely by reference to the Contract".If, as must be the case here, the standard by which this defendant's workmanship is to be judged is the same whether the duty isexpressed in contract or in tort, and is the reasonable satisfaction of the named consultant: it is not easy to see why an expressionof satisfaction by such consultant should Not equally apply to the performance of both duties.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> However the precise point has already been decided in the defendant's favour by the Court of Appeal in England in William Hill OrganizationLimited v. Bernard Sunley &amp; Sons Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%2022%20BLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 22 BLR 1.</a>  I need, therefore, do no more than gratefully adopt the reasoning of Cumming-Bruce L.J. in that decision at pps. 29-30. The followingobservations are particularly apposite:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"The short answer to this case (in tort) is that the breaches relied upon arose out of the Contract. ..... There is no pleaded allegationof any fact which added to or modified the defendant's contractual duty. (The same is admittedly true here) ..... The Contract itselfcircumscribed the boundaries of that duty and defined its content ..... It is not open to the plaintiffs in effect to disregard thoseclauses of the Contract which provided for the conclusive effect of the Final Certificate but to claim a remedy for breaches whichwere only capable of ascertainment by reference to the Contract itself ..... The plaintiffs are not entitled to claim a remedy intort which is wider than the obligations assumed by the defendants under their Contract. So (the relevant) clause of the Contracthas the effect of limiting and restricitng the plaintiff's right to a remedy for the defendant's failure to comply with their obligationto perform the Contract according to its terms."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In my judgment, therefore, these Certificates operate conclusively against the plaintiffs in tort.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>(3)            Finally Mr. Lane argued that it was not open to the court to construe clause 5(e) on a striking out application. Thisdefendant's proper course, he submitted, was to file a defence and then ask for and argue the matter upon a preliminary issue. Itwas not suggested that the court or the parties would then have been in any better or different position. But on the authority ofHubbuck and Sons Limited v. Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281899%29%201%20QB%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1899) 1 Q.B. 86</a> it was said, in the words of Lindley M.R., that the preliminary issue procedure "is appropriate to cases requiring argument and carefulconsideration. The second and more summary procedure (striking out) is only appropriate to cases which are plain and obvious". Thereforesubmitted Mr. Lane the court should do no more than say that the matter was not plain and obvious and defer its decision. on constructionto some future date. The submission echoes the discussion in other authorities, when the court's summary powers are invoked purelyon a question of law, as to whether the court is free to decide the point, or whether it has first to decide whether it is a sufficiently''plain case" to be decided in that particular manner, see for example Bigg v. Boyd Gibbins  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%202%20All%20ER%20183" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 2 A.E.R. 183.</a></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Whilst recognising the value of the warning given in Hubbuck's case, I cannot accept that it can be said literally to represent themodern practice. A glance at some of the major rulings given on striking out applications in recent years such as Rondel v. Worsley  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%201%20AC%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 1 A.C. 191</a> and Arenson v. Arenson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20AC%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) A.C. 405</a> shows the Court's readiness not to postpone, but. to decide difficult questions on such an application, when appropriate. In a casewhere all the relevant, facts are known and undisputed, and were the point in issue is purely one of law or construction, I thinkthat the court can and should decide the point at any convenient stage in the proceedings. If all the necessary material is beforethe court, it would be lamentable to postpone a decision and force the parties to incur further costs. I think that Lord DenningM.R.'s observations in Tiverton Limited v. Wearwell Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20Ch%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) Ch. 145</a>, 156, about the futility of repeating the same argument at a trial, and the court's practice of deciding "difficult and arguablepoints" under both O.14 and O.86 are really of general application, and apply in proper circumstances to O.18 r.19. Carl- Zeiss-Stiftungv. Rayner (No.3)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%203%20All%20ER%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 3 All E.R. 397</a>, per Buckley J. at p.908. In my judgment this application is a proper time to decide the points of law raised, and further to decidethem without any preliminary claim or assertion to the effect that they were "plain and obvious"; see Forster v. Outred &amp; Co. <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20WLR%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 W.L.R. 86</a>, per Dunn L.J. at p. 98.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The very peculiar nature of this action supports and encourages this approach. By naming 18 defendants and by producing a Statementof Claim over 500 pages long, the plaintiffs have launched something which may prove to be uncontrollable and (without radical severance)untriable. If the claim pleaded against this defendant is representative, essential particulars will increase the documentation manytimes over. Considerations such as these may explain the failure to serve so many defendants. Although I have very real reservationsabout the permissibility of this practice, I will say no more because the first anniversary of the writ is just round the corner.But given this background, a court, should, I think, hesitate long before dismissing an application like this as premature.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In these circumstances in my judgment this application succeeds. I direct that as against the 8th defendant the Statement of Claimbe struck out and that the action do stand dismissed with costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(D.S.
