Tamar,Hong Kong. The principal contractors upon that site were Messrs. Technic Construction Co. Ltd. and Messrs. V.S.L. Engineers (HongKong) Ltd. were subcontractors working upon the same site. They were respectively the second and the first defendants in the action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> On the morning of the 19th of May 1978 YEUNG Chun-chung was engaged in work upon the site. The cage in which he was working uponthe 29-storey building became detached and he was precipitated to the ground, a distance of some 110 feet. He sustained injuriesfrom which he dies a short time later.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The deceased's father, YEUNG Wing, took action on behalf of himself and other family members as dependants under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap.22</a>) and on behalf of the estate of the deceased under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform Consolidation Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a>).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The case was tried by Sir Denys Roberts, C.J. and following his example I will for convenience refer to these legislative provisionsrespectively as "Fao" and "Larco". At the hearing the defendants admitted liability and by agreement between them the first defendantaccepted liability to the extent of 60% and the second defendant 40% for the consequences of the accident.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The deceased was one of a family of seven children, several of whom were contributing, together with the mother but not the father,to the "pool" of family financial resources. The evidence established a dependency, as claimed, in the father, mother and three ofthe younger children of the family. The deceased died intestate and it was accepted that the beneficiaries of his estate would bethe father and the mother only.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On the evidence before him, by a series of calculations and estimates of the kind familiar in such actions, the learned Chief Justicefound that the total dependency under Fao amounted to $56,640. He awarded interest at 5Â½% on the $18,240 which he had estimatedas the sum of the pre-trial dependency damages.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> He next awarded a sum of $15,000 in respect of the loss of expectation of life. This was an upward revision by $5,000 of the "conventional"award under this head in Hong Kong. This he did to offset the decline in the value of money since 1977 the year in which, as he found,the conventional award of $10,000 had become generally applicable in such cases. No issue is taken upon this appeal as to the appropriatenessof these awards. Indeed, the figures employed by the Chief Justice in arriving at his awards under the various heads have not beenin controversy and none of the individual sums awarded has been challenged so far as mere quantum is concerned.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> We come now however, to the award of damages in respect of the "lost years" under Larco. The Chief Justice came upon the action beforehim at an interesting stage in the law's development. It had already been established in <u>Pickett</u> v. <u>British Rail Engineering Ltd</u><sup>(1)</sup> that a living plaintiff is entitled to claim damages representing the loss of such moneys as would have accrued to him from earningsin the years which, in the estimate of the court, would be lost to him through the shortening of his life as a result of the injurycaused by the tortious act of the defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> At the date of trial the Court of Appeal in England in <u>Gammell</u> v. <u>Wilson</u><sup>(2)</sup> had by a majority found that a similar claim was available under the equivalent of Larco at the suit of a deceased person's legalrepresentative for the benefit of his estate following upon his death as a result of such a tortious act. This establishes what isin effect a new head of damage separate and distinct from the familiar and conventional award in respect of the loss of expectationof life.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In following the decision of the majority in the Court of Appeal the Chief Justice acknowledged that it was not an authority whichwas binding upon the courts of Hong Kong. He was however disposed to follow it as a "powerful persuasive authority". Since then theprinciple in <u>Gammell</u> has been affirmed by the decision of the House of Lords and has thus become a binding principle for these courts also. (See <u>de Lasala</u> v. <u>de Lasala</u><sup>(3)</sup>).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> There has been no debate before us as to the existence of this new head of damage. The relevant provisions of the Law Reform (MiscellaneousProvisions) Act 1934 are to practical intent in identical terms with those of Larco, the local provision. There has however beenlively debate as to the proper interpretation of those provisions in the light of the judgments in both <u>Gammell</u> and <u>Pickett.</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Many of the judges who have dealt with this matter in the recent cases have expressed dissatisfaction with the speculative characterof the calculations to which the court is put in estimating this head of damage and all of the judges in <u>Gammell's case</u> without exception, both in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords, expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of thelaw. What has caused this concern is the combined effect of the provisions of paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of section 1 and thedeclaration contained in the opening words of subsection 5 of section 1 of the English Act the material terms of which are identicalwith the corresponding provisions in section 20 of the Ordinance and are as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">"(2) Where a cause of action survives as aforesaid for the benefit of the estate of a deceased person, the damages recoverable forthe benefit of the estate of that person-</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="86%" class="quote">.........</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="14%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="78%" class="quote">Where the death of that person has been caused by the act or omission which gives rise to the cause of action, shall be calculatedwithout reference to any loss or gain to his estate consequent on his death, .....</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5) The rights conferred by this Act for the benefit of the estates of the deceased persons shall be in addition to and not in derogationof any rights conferred on the dependence of deceased persons by the Fatal Accidents Acts 1846 to 1908..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Of the eight judges who dealt with <u>Gammell's case</u> only Megaw, L.J. in the Court of Appeal interpreted paragraph (c) as excluding from recovery by the estate damages which would havebeen recoverable by the deceased if he had not died i.e. damages for the lost years. All the remaining judges construed that provisionin the opposite sense as excluding from recovery by the estate only such damages as would not have been recoverable by the deceasedin his life time. This depends on a fine but necessary distinction between damages which are "consequent upon death" and damageswhich are consequent upon the tortious act. Lord Wright in <u>Rose</u> v. <u>Ford</u><sup>(4)</sup> dealing with this provision said (at p.368):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Obvious instances of what are referred to are such items as, on the one side, insurance moneys falling due on death, and, on theother, annuities ceasing on death."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The life insurance policy seems to have attracted universal approval as an example of a gain to the estate which is not to be regardedin estimating damages but the instance of annuities, as an example of a possible loss to be so excluded, has not. The effect of paragraph(c) (corresponding with paragraph (b) in section 20 of the Ordinance) is succinctly stated by Lord Edmund-Davies at page 586 in <u>Gammell's case</u> where he says:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But its effect, in my judgment, is that the fact that death has occurred as a result of the defendant's wrongful act is not to increaseor reduce such damages as would have been recoverable by the plaintiff when alive."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He then refers to Chapman's Statutes on the Law of Tort (1962, p.6) which gives as examples of relevant loss and gain respectively:(a) the untimely falling due of death duties which might have been avoided if the deceased had survived a little longer and (b) benefitto the estate deriving from family settlements by reason of the deceased having died upon a particular day.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The effect of all this is that by the consensus of all these judges - with Megaw, L.J. as a lone dissentient - damages may be awardedto the estate of the deceased in respect of lost earnings in the lost years and are not to be regarded as a gain to the estate "consequenton his death". It was the view of Megaw, L.J. that that provision prevented the recovery of damages on behalf of the estate in respectof any earnings other than those which had been forfeited as a result of the tortious act while the deceased still lived but noneof the other judges was prepared to follow this view nor was the Chief Justice in the present case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The present state of the law, thus interpreted, is regarded in these many judgments with distaste because it is perceived as likelyto occasion in justice to defendants. This may occur in actions brought under both of these ordinances (as many actions are) wherethe result of the litigation is to secure to the successful plaintiff an unmerited enrichment of the kind which has been describedeither as a "windfall" or else as double recovery of damages. Unless I misunderstood the arguments of counsel the terms were usedmore or less synonymously but, as used by Griffiths, J. in <u>Kandalla</u> v. <u>British Airways Corporation</u><sup>(5)</sup> where the expression seems to have originated, they appear to refer to two quite different situations. Where the dependants of thedeceased are also the beneficiaries entitled to his estate (as in the present case) they will recover under Fao a sum calculatedto compensate them for the loss of his support. The court awarding damages under Larco will be entitled to award a sum of preciselythe same size in respect of the lost years. But this will not be paid to the dependants in addition to what they have already recoveredunder Fao. They will take only what is in the estate over and above the sums of damages awarded in respect of the loss of expectationof life and of the lost years after the court has made a due deduction in respect of the estimated living expenses of the deceasedduring those years.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Where, as in the present case, the principal beneficiaries of the deceased's estate are the parents of the deceased it is clear thathad he lived his life through then, in the ordinary course of things, they would have pre-deceased him and consequently would neverhave had a share in his estate at all. Since they have received under Fao a sum estimated to compensate them for the support whichthey would have had from the deceased during the lost years this additional and accelerated distribution of his assets to them underLarco may indeed be regarded as a "windfall". There is, in this case, however, no question of double recovery of damages.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Such double recovery is said to arise in the case where the deceased has by testamentary disposition left his estate away from thedependants. The consensus of opinion in the House of Lords in both <u>Pickett</u> and <u>Gammell</u> appears to be that in such circumstances the beneficiaries might be entitled to a sum equivalent to the amount of the earnings lostover the lost years even although the dependants in the fatal accident claim stood to be, or had already been, compensated in a likeamount. Nevertheless I confess that I have some difficulty in seeing why that must be so. Since in calculating the amount by whichthe estate is to be compensated for the results of the tortious act allowance must be made, as is conceded universally, for whatthe deceased would have spent upon himself during the lost years and since this would inevitably have included some spending uponfriends and companions what reason can be assigned for treating the moneys notionally expended upon his dependants in any differentway? Both are alike expenditures proceeding out of his conscience and free will (albeit at different levels of moral obligation)and both are equally opposed to the accumulation of assets for transmission after his death. Moreover, if the basis of the actionunder Larco is the recovery of such sums as the deceased would have been entitled to recover has he brought the action when livingany court, especially when both actions are brought simultaneously, would surely be entitled to resist the suggestion that, merelybecause there are two different sets of claimants, these very different beneficiaries of the deceased's notional bounty are bothto be gratified. The assumption underlying each claims is that the deceased would have gone on contributing to the support of hisdependants. No doubt the court finds itself in a dilemma: there are two perfectly viable claims each seeking to lay hold of compensationfor the lost dependency. But where the calculations involve much that is already suppositious and speculative, to compound theseunrealities with a final pretence that the deceased has honoured his obligations twice over is an extremity which must surely beavoidable if only on the common sense basis that the actuality of the dependency makes the claim of the dependants paramount.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In rejecting the argument that the principle established by the House of Lords in <u>Pickett</u> was equally applicable in an action brought under the Law Reform Act as in one brought by a living claimant, Megaw, L.J. consideredthe various arguments advanced to show that the judges in the House of Lords must have intended their conclusion to extend to LawReform cases. He was not convinced that they had considered the matter, in particular the difficulty posed by section 1(2)(c) ofthe Act. He discounted the references to "overlapping damages" in the speeches in the House as affording any indication that theyhad done so. He said (P.596 3 W.L.R.)</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The risk of such double recovery would not exist if, in a Law Reform Act action, the estate was not entitled to recover anythingin respect of the earnings of the lost years."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He escaped from the dilemma by construing the section in a sense which disposed of its power to create anomalies. He did so by holdingthat the removal of the deceased's power to earn in the lost years was a "loss consequent on his death" and thus excluded from considerationin awarding damages. No one has followed that lead, nor, with respect, would I. It must be on a different understanding, if at all,that the anomalies are to be avoided.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Counsel in the present case are content to accept that the present state of the case and statute law may give rise to anomalous results.They each take issue with the learned Chief Justice over the manner in which, applying the law in its latest development in <u>Gammell</u> and <u>Pickett</u>, he has calculated the amount of damages to be awarded under the two ordinances. Following <u>Gammell</u> the Chief Justice concluded that no distinction should be drawn between the case of a live plaintiff claiming damages for the lostyears and that of his representative claiming on behalf of his estate. He said (page 12 of his judgment):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This means that the judge would have to assess what the earnings for the lost years would have been and deduct from this total anestimated sum to represent the victim's probable living expenses during those years. This follows the principle that the basis forrecovery lies in the provision which he would make for his dependants out of the surplus of his income."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He adopted what he described as a practical approach which went upon the assumption that the deceased like any young man of his kindwould in the course of his natural span of life have accumulated over and above his spendings a certain surplus which could be representedas a percentage of income over those years. The Chief Justice went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I realise that any percentage which I take cannot be justified by logic, but I believe that such a figure is necessary to provideat least a starting point for courts faced with the task of estimating a future surplus of income on inadequate material. Of course,if there is evidence which suggests a different figure, this will replace the proposed conventional percentage which I will set at10%."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> He found nothing in the evidence to suggest that that percentage would not be the correct one in the case before him. On the basisof a monthly income of $2,000 and a multiplier of 15 he arrived at a total of $360,000 for the lost earnings. 10% of this gave afigure of $36,000. That was the valuation of what had accrued to the estate through the forfeiture of earnings in the "lost years".To this he added the $15,000 awarded in respect of the loss of expectation of life bringing the figure to a total of $51,000 underLarco. He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The award for loss of expectation of life of $15,000 will merge with the award under Fao. The award for lost years will not so merge.This will leave a total award of $92,640."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Swaine for the appellants complains that in refusing to merge the lost years damages with the Fao damages the Chief Justice wasin effect granting the plaintiff double recovery of damages.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> On the cross-appeal Mr. Denis Chang for the respondent upholds the method of calculation of the Chief Justice all but for his provisionas to the $15,000 damages for loss of expectation of life. Mr. Chang says that on the basis adopted by the Chief Justice there wasno reason in logic to distinguish between the lost years damages and the loss of expectation of life damages and therefore the finalaward should have been increased by $15,000.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> So far as the estimate of damages for the lost years is concerned the difference between counsel comes down to a single simple point.Mr. Swaine says that in arriving at his final figure of $36,000 the Chief Justice has had regard to everything which he estimateswould have been earned by the deceased during the lost years and everything which the deceased would have spent either upon himselfor his friends or in other personal ways but has not made allowance for the contributions which would have been made by the deceasedduring those years to his dependants. Therefore, he says, this final figure, being the surplus available after that calculation,must be held, as it were, in reduction of the obligation to his dependants which, by common assent, the deceased would have honouredduring those years.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> It is true that the Chief Justice addressing himself to the problem has referred only to the need to deduct the deceased's own probableliving expenses from what he earned during those years. Nevertheless, I am quite satisfied that Mr. Denis Chang has correctly interpretedhis award as having taken account of the fact that he had already found what the deceased would have allocated to the needs of hisdependants in the lost years, It is true that the process of his mere arithmetic does not disclose that he has done so. The surplusto which he is referring is to my mind as counsel maintains. the notional savings of the deceased over the whole extent of his putativenatural span.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I believe that this idea of savings surplus to expenditure over the lost years is the key both to an understanding of the approachof the Chief Justice and to such a reconciling of the disparate demands which may arise under these two statutes that justice canbe done without affronting common sense. It is true that in the several speeches in the House of Lords in <u>Gammell</u> specific reference is made only to the deceased's own personal expenses as necessary deductions from his earnings but, throughout,the import of these observations is to establish what the deceased would have "saved so as to increase his estate" (See the quotationfrom the judgment of Lord Atkin in <u>Rose</u> v. <u>Ford</u> which appears in the speech of Lord Edmund-Davies at p.584h). I see nothing here to indicate that any of those learned judges wouldhave excluded expenditure upon dependants from any computation of savings which had followed the line taken by the Chief Justicein the present case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> If that be the proper way. of looking at the award then it is inconceivable that in arriving at his figure the Chief Justice hadnot already marked off the amount of the dependency in fixing the amount by which the estate was to be replenished to compensate.for the effects of the tortious act. If we were to hold otherwise it seems to me that we would be saying that the Chief Justice.regarding the matter from the Fao angle, was satisfied that the sum awarded, $56,640, would in fact have been expended upon the dependantsby the deceased whereas, looking at it from the Larco angle, he had come to the conclusion that in the end the deceased would havebeen unable folly to honour his obligations even though he had wished to do so. For my part I am quite satisfied that the Chief Justicerightly ordered that the Larco damages to the extent of $36,000 should not merge with the Fao damages.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> That leaves, only the question of the cross-appeal. It is quite true as Mr. Swaine points out that the merging of lost expectationof life damages has been over many years, an almost automatic affair in fatal accident cases. But the ground rules have changed drasticallyfollowing upon the decisions in <u>Pickett</u> and <u>Gammell</u> and before them in the case of <u>Kandalla</u>. Is there any reason why these damages should merge if the others do not? No reasons are given by the Chief Justice for the distinctionwhich he drew between them. I appreciate that this order relating to the lost expectation of life award follows the distinction betweenpecuniary and non-pecuniary loss to which reference is made at paragraph 1352 of the 14th edition of McGregor on Damages. For myown part I cannot see why such a distinction should be made. The text at that ponnt appears to rely principally on <u>Murray</u> v. <u>Shuter</u><sup>(6)</sup> where the Court of Appeal approved the deduction from a fatal accidents award of a sum awarded in respect of loss of amenities wherethe deceased had survived the accident for some four years. On the other hand, in <u>Gammell</u> v. <u>Wilson</u> both Brandon L.J. and Sir David Cairns in the Court of Appeal express dissatisfaction with this distinction and I do not find itapproved in any of the judgments in the House of Lords. I can find no good reason to distinguish between these two heads of damage.Both are accretions to the estate of the deceased which, to use a distinction applied by Lord Russell in <u>Rose</u> v. <u>Ford</u> and approved by Lord Edmund-Davies in <u>Gammell</u> (p.586G):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">".... are not for loss to the estate consequent on the death, but for loss to a living person consequent on the wrongful act of thedefendant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Both are sums which, had he lived, the deceased could have claimed in respect of the lost years. I am unable to see why they shouldbe treated differently in the final assessment and to this extent only I would depart from the decision of the Chief Justice.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> In cases of this kind henceforward it would seem that where awards are made under both ordinances the Larco figure will almost invariablyovertop that given under Fao. It was no doubt this consideration which moved Lord Scarman in <u>Gammell</u> to remark (page 595):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The logical, but socially unattractive, way of reforming the law would be to repeal the Fatal Accidents Act, now that the rule actiopersonalis moritur cum persona has itself belatedly perished."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">This would not be feasible in Hong Kong since we lack what the learned judge went on to refer to as the "final safeguard of the Inheritance(Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975". But it does indicate an abrupt alteration in the manner in which courts must viewsuch claims in the future.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The method (as I have understood it) employed by the Chief Justice in the present case to meet the new situation would seem to offera logical and readily comprehensible manner of honouring the intention of the existing legislation and of accommodating the requirementsof the different claims which may arise under it. Clearly it is not the only method. In some cases, it may be thought preferableto make no award at all under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> which is what was done by the trial judge in <u>Gammell.</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Counsel in this court have not sought to quarrel with the adoption of a "conventional" percentage of 10% in estimating the possiblesurplus available to the estate. This is no doubt, as the Chief Justice indicated, to be regarded merely as a starting point andit should not be used by the courts to avoid the task of closely scrutinising the evidence in order to determine whether that percentageor a different percentage or no percentage at all ought to be applied in a given case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">John Swaine, Q.C. and William Lane instructed by Deacon for the appellant.</p>        <p align="left">Denis Chang, Q.C. and Miss A.

The onlyquestion left was one of quantum of damages.

This appeal and cross-appeal is confined to the narrow compass of the Chief Justice's order of merger and non-mergerof Heads 2 and 3 respectively.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Issue</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> On behalf of the appellants it is contended that the learned Chief Justice is wrong in law in holding that the award of $36,000 under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap. 23</a> for lost years does not merge with the award of $56,640 under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap.22</a>. In his Notice of Appeal the respondent contends thatthe Chief Justice erred in his findings that the sum of $15,000 awarded in respect of loss of expectation of life merged with thedamages awarded under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap.22</a>. In the course of the hearing of this appeal, the respondent obtains leave to file a Respondent's Noticein support of the Chief Justice's decision not to order that the $36,000 awarded for lost years be merged with the award under theFatal Accident Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap.22</a>).</p>    <p align="left"><u>Arguments</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> On behalf of the appellant Mr. Swaine contends that since both the awards for the loss of expectation of life and for lost yearsin the sums of $15,000 and $36,000 respectively were made under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a> a total of $51,000 should be merged with the sum of $56,640awarded under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap.22</a>. This is particularly so when the Chief Justice ordered the merger of $15,000 for loss of expectation of life.In support of his argument he cites the passage in McGregor On Damages para. 1349 to the effect that the Court should deduct damagesawarded under the Law Reform Acts and from damages awarded under the Fatal Accident Acts but not vice versa. The principle is toavoid double dependency. He days that the respondent and his wife as parents would become heirs of the deceased under Section 4(6)of the Intestate's Estate Ordinance <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/73">Cap.73</a>. As dependants they were apportioned <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of the award of $56,640 on the ground of dependency. If they get another $36,000 from the deceased's estate it means that they receiveddouble compensation. Counsel submits that the Chief Justice misinterpreted the <u>Gammell's case</u> by taking it as authority for refusing to deduct the lost years award from the dependency award. That is not warranted in that case.He contends that both in <u>Gammell's case</u> and in <u>Kandalla</u> v. <u>British European Airways Corporation</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20WLR%20730" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 W.L.R. 730</a> the judges refer to recovery for lost years as 'windfalls' to the dependants.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Mr Chang for the respondent argues that the Chief Justice started with the sum of $360,000 as representing the lost years of earnings.He had made allowances for the various sums that the deceased, had he lived his normal life, would have spent on himself and in supportof his dependants before he found that the net savings accrued to the estate was $36,000. By so doing it is obvious that the ChiefJustice had taken into consideration of the $56,640 awarded for the dependency claim. He had already applied the merger once. Ifthe $36,000 were to be merged with the $56,640 that would be, in effect, a double merger of at least $36,000. He contends that thededuction of the $15,000 for loss of expectation of life from the $56,640 award is wrong. He contends that the principle of mergerapplies in a sense that awards under the Fatal Accident Ordinance or the Law Reform Amendment Consolidation Ordinance will mergewith one another. In short whatever greater sum is awarded under either Ordinance would absorb the smaller sum.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> In the present case the learned Chief Justice had started off with the highest figure of $360,000 awarded under the Law Reform Ordinanceto which must be added the $15,000 awarded under the same Ordinance. The award of $56,640 was a smaller sum which had been accountedfor when the Chief Justice arrived at the sum of $36,000 as net savings after all expenses. Since the Chief Justice had already assessedthat the deceased's contribution to the family was $56,640 that sum must be deemed to have already been deducted from the $375,000before the Chief Justice came to the net saving of $36,000.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The learned Chief Justice assessed the damages for lost years of earnings as $360,000. In his further assessment and calculationshe said at p.39 as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This means that the judge would have to assess what the earnings for the lost years would have been and deduct from this total anestimated sum to represent the victim's probable living expenses during those years. This follows the principle that the basis forrecovery lies in the provision which he would made for his dependants out of the surplus of his income...................... I guessthat a normal young man, having made a generous contribution to the family income, would see little reason not to spend most of thebalance on himself and his friends. But as he grew older he might well see more clearly the virtues of saving a larger part of hiswages and living below his income. I am prepared to assume, however, that a person will, during the course of his working life, spendon the average somewhat less than his income."</p>    </blockquote><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Thus it is obvious that in arriving at the figure of $36,000 the Chief Justice had taken into consideration that the deceased wouldhave contributed to his dependants to the sum of $56,640 though he did not expressly say so.<br />    <br />    <p align="left"><u>The Law</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In the earlier part of his judgment the learned Chief Justice had examined and considered the English authorities and come to theconclusion that the lost years of earnings should be assessed as a separate head of damages even in cases of fatal accidents. Healso concluded that this head of damages should be awarded under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a>. I do not propose to go through the authorities apart fromsaying that, with great respect, I agree entirely with him in his conclusion. Nor do counsel for both parties argue to the contraryof such authorities The only argument by Mr. Swaine is the suggestion that it is a 'windfall' and a double compensation. Be thatas it may Lord Edmond-Davies said in <u>Gammell's case</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20All%20ER%20578" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 A.E.R. 578</a> at 587 as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">But, my Lords, such 'windfalls' have not appeared inadvertently on the legal landscape. On the contrary, the legislature had themclearly in contemplation when it provided by s.1(5) of the 1934 Act that -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          'The rights conferred by this Act for the benefit of the estates of deceased persons shall be in addition to and not inderogation of any rights conferred on the dependants of deceased persons by the Fatal Accidents Acts, 1846 to 1908 ...........'</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left" class="quote">          At p.588 Lord Fraser said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "It is particularly difficult to justify the law in cases such as the present, in each of which the deceased was a youngman with no established earning capacity or settled pattern of life. In such cases, it is hardly possible to make a reasonable estimateof his probable earnings during the 'lost years' and it is, I think, quite impossible to take the further step of making a reasonableestimate of the free balance that would have been available above the cost of maintaining himself throughout the 'lost years', andthe amount of the free balance is the relevant figure for calculating damages. The process of assessing damages in such cases isso extremely uncertain that it can hardly be dignified with the name of calculation: it is little more than speculation. Yet thatis the process which the courts are obliged to carry out at present."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Speaking for myself and with the greatest respect to their Lordships, I cannot say that the award for lost years is a 'windfall'to the dependants. Had the injured of the accident survived he would, without the authorities of recent decisions, been able to recoverdamages for his future loss of earnings as a separate item of damages. He might spend all or part of them - and most likely partonly for himself and his dependants. Whatever is saved will go to his estate. The dependants are receiving no more than the amountof dependency in the ordinary way plus what is left in the estate in their capacity as beneficiaries. Applying the common conceptof human behaviour I suggest that the beneficiaries and the dependants are most likely to be the same persons. That being the caseit is only a question of converting an expectant interest into a vesting interest as far as the leftover of the lost year award isconcerned. It cannot be said that the tortfeasor has been required to pay twice over. He is responsible for the consequences of hisown wrongful act. He only pays for the lost years of earnings once the sum for dependency is deducted from the award for lost years.Whoever benefits from the compensation payable by him is not his concern. The only remaining question is whether there could be amutual merger i.e., the lesser award either under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap.22</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a> merges with the greater figure.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In this connection I do not accept the statement in para. 1349 of McGregor on Damages as conclusive. The passage in that paragraphreads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<u>Davies</u> v. <u>Powell Duffryn Collieries</u> settled not only that a deduction was proper but that the Law Reform Act award went to reduce the Fatal Accidents Act award and notvice versa. This is clearly the correct method analytically, but there had previously been doubts as to the rule in practice by reasonof the views expressed obiter on the question by Lord Atkin and Lord Wright in <u>Rose</u> v. <u>Ford</u>."</p>    </blockquote><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> However, in another paragraph, namely para. 1352 of the same work, having considered the case of <u>Murray</u> v. <u>Shuter</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20QB%20972" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] Q.B. 972 (C.A.)</a> the same authority wrote as follows:-<br />    <br />    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The result must be that, to the extent that the award to the estate represents damages in respect of earning capacity throughoutthe lost years, it will fall to be deducted from the award under the Fatal Accidents Act if, as will normally be the case, the dependantsinherit the estate. Since the deceased's earnings less his own living expenses must always equal or exceed his contribution to hisfamily from those earnings, <u>Pickett</u> would seem, unless legislation intervenes, to eliminate the great bulk of Fatal Accidents Act claims, and to render largely otiosethe great bulk of this chapter."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> To this I may add that <u>Davies's case</u> was decided well before the concept for award for loss of years of earnings was established. This clearly implies that award underFatal Accidents Acts may merge with awards under Law Reform Acts if the former happens to be less.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> In any event, it is not Mr. Swaine's principal argument. The very notion of a "windfall" as accepted from the English authority indicatesthat there can be such a merger otherwise the dependants will indeed be compensated twice over.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Conclusion</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> For the aforesaid reasons I am of the opinion that the Chief Justice is correct in not ordering the $36,000 to merge with the $56,640award. He has made it quite clear as to his mode of his calculation in the passage of his judgment I have cited. On the other handthe $15,000 for loss of expectation of life being awarded to the deceased's estate should be added to the sum total recoverable forthe estate. There is no reason why it should not be added to the notional $360,000 for the lost year. Accordingly, I will dismissthe appellant's appeal and allow the cross-appeal by the respondent in terms.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Simon F.S.
