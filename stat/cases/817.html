I have no idea how it became listed for trial before the Commercial Court, which took little or no partin its case management, but in the event it has some history; accordingly it may assist to set the commercial context against thebackground of which the actions of the key players took place.</p>    <p class="heading">The factual background</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The activities/personalities of two individuals bestride this case.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Although the plaintiff, âLibertarianâ, is a Hong Kong limited company, this is wholly owned and is the corporate personificationof a wealthy gentleman, Mr Alan Woods (sadly now deceased), who had gained a considerable reputation in the gambling world, and withit a commensurate fortune in the hundreds of millions of US dollars, by utilizing his actuarial skills and perfecting, via usageof software he had developed, computerized betting systems on horse racing in Hong Kong and elsewhere.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The defendant, Mr Hall, an erstwhile friend and business associate of Mr Woods, is a Hong Kong based businessman whom himself appearsto have inhabited the opaque penumbra of the commercial betting world, although it is fair to say that his presence therein was onnothing like the scale or position occupied by Mr Woods.  It appears that Mr Woods came to know Mr Hall in mid 2002 through Mr Hallâsthen involvement in gaming and online casino businesses, and at one stage Mr Hall wanted Mr Woods to invest in Mr Hallâs company,ESL.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  It also is clear that it was Mr Hall who had introduced Mr Woods to the idea of purchasing shares in an English private company,âThe Sporting Exchange Ltdâ (âTSEâ), as to the prospect of which Mr Woods, after initial hesitation, became increasinglyenthusiastic.  It is TSE, and the purchase of a certain parcel of shares therein, which forms the primary focus of this case.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  For introductory purposes, however, suffice it to say that Mr Hall and Mr Woods initially appear to have âtalked the same languageâ,having a commonality of interest in gambling and gaming related investments, and certainly in the early stages of their relationshipat least a degree of trust existed between them; regrettably however that trust gradually eroded as events unfolded and, it is nowalleged, Mr Hall has been less than full and frank as to what has happened, and that tranches of money originally entrusted to MrHall upon the direction of Mr Woods have been misappropriated.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Urgent interlocutory activity on the part of the plaintiff, contemporaneous with the issue on 16 November 2006 by Libertarian ofthe Writ in these proceedings, resulted in the grant of a worldwide <i>Mareva</i> injunction by Sakhrani J on the same date.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  That Order speaks for itself.  It is worth, however, indicating the main parameters of what then was happening in terms of actiontaken by plaintiff against defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Paragraph 1 of that Order by Sakhrani J, after an application which was made <i>ex parte</i> on notice, sets out the parameters of the restrictions upon dealing with the defendantâs assets, and to an extent this set thetone for much of what occurred thereafter; there were four material subparagraphs of paragraph 1, viz:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(a)    any property acquired with or otherwise representing the funds of the plaintiff which, in 2003 or 2004 the defendant causedto be transferred out of trust account No 21446.00001 maintained by M/s Berwin Leighton Paisner, London solicitors, in the totalsum of Â£13, 646,708 (âthe plaintiffâs fundsâ); and/or</p>        <p class="quote">(b)    all entitlements or rights of action acquired in 2004 by the defendant using the plaintiffâs funds to 1,777,700 shares inthe Sporting Exchange Limited (âTSEâ) of England (âthe TSE Trust Sharesâ), plus all dividends which have accrued on thoseshares; and/or</p>        <p class="quote">(c)    all proceeds of sale of all or part of the TSE Trust Shares or of the entitlements or rights of action to the TSE Trust Shares;and/or</p>        <p class="quote">(d)    all interest or other profits which have accrued on the property in (a) to (c) above since the property first came under thecontrol of the defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  This injunction was granted subject to, <i>inter alia</i>, a fortified undertaking in the sum of HK$5 million offered by the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  True it is that over the ensuing months the court record reveals several variations to this primary order, but these variationsrepresent essentially matters of detail, and have no bearing upon the basic thrust of this case as argued before this court.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The substance of the worldwide <i>Mareva</i> as granted by Sakhrani J in November 2006 was subject to a substantive contested hearing for the continuation thereof until trial,an argument heard by Fung J in Chambers in late May/early June 2007, and which resulted in his judgment, the Reasons for which aredated 11 June 2007, wherein the learned judge ordered that the injunction be continued until trial <i>save that</i> the amount of Â£13,646,708 as initially enjoined be reduced to Â£8,314,680.64.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Reasons for Decision of the learned judge hearing this application set out in concise form the nub of the present dispute betweenthese parties.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  It is common ground that in 2003 Mr Woods had asked Mr Hall, his then business associate, to acquire shares in âTSEâ, an Englishprivate company which had begun operating an on-line betting website named âBetfairâ; it is also common ground that this site,which essentially had introduced a new business model wherein, as an online intermediary, it held the ring between gamblers takingcontrary positions, had begun to cause ripples of financial concern within the worldwide gaming industry, which hitherto had beenrun upon more traditional lines.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Be that as it may.  It is clear that Mr Woods, as an astute international investor in addition to being a phenomenally successfulgambler, after some initial hesitation came to the view that the âBetfairâ model was a potential investment goldmine, and thusasked the defendant, Mr Hall, whom, as I have said, earlier had informed Mr Woods that he was in a position to acquire shares forhim in TSE, to purchase some shares on his behalf; the evidence is that as his ultimate target Mr Woods was interested in acquiringabout 10% of the issued TSE share capital.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Accordingly, monetary transfers were effected for this purpose, and on 13 May 2003 Mr Woods arranged for the sum of in the orderof Â£35 million to be deposited into the trust account of a London firm of solicitors, Berwin Leighton Paisner (âBLPâ); thiswas accomplished by Mr Woods arranging for the transfer of EUR50 million (then equivalent to approximately Â£35.79 million) froman account at Morgan Stanley in the name of Assanzon Development Corp â a company wholly owned by Mr Woods â into a BLP trustaccount held with Barclays Bank in the name of Axdale Overseas Corporation, Axdale being a company controlled and wholly owned byMr Hall. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In fact, Mr Hall had requested Mr Woods to remit the money to the BLP account reference âfor Momentum Limited/Assanzonâ, a requestwith which Mr Woods duly complied.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It is said, and I have no reason to doubt this assertion, that at the time Mr Woods understood that the funds thus remitted wouldbe held in the BLP account in the name <i>either</i> of Momentum Limited, a company controlled and managed by Mr Woods which was the intended vehicle to acquire the TSE shares, <i>or</i> in the name of Assanzon, also wholly owned by Mr Woods, which was the vehicle which was to be the conduit for the purchasing funds.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  This deposit of funds into the aforesaid BLP Trust Account constitutes the commencement of a series of financial dealings of somedetail and complexity, and for present narrative purposes there is no need to go into the minutiae of each and every such transaction,or attempted transaction, undertaken by Mr Hall in order to obtain for Mr Woods the desired TSE shares.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In fact, as matters transpired, a First General Tender for TSE shares was unsuccessful, due to the exercise of pre-emption rightsby existing shareholders, but a Second General Tender for TSE shares thereafter eventuated.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On 12 August 2003 Mr Hall forwarded to Mr Woods an email setting out the anticipated timetables for this Second General Tender.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  By a message dated 27 August 2003 Mr Hall advised Mr Woods that funds <i>additional</i> to those earlier remitted would be required in the amount of Â£5.5 million, and on 11 September 2003 the respective sums of Â£3,449,994and Â£2.5 million were transferred to the credit of the same BLP account at Barclays Bank in London.  In the broad scheme of thingsit does not greatly matter, but it transpires (and this is undisputed) that Mr Wood exceeded the amount he was required so to transferby some Â£500,000, simply putting the overpayment down to âa mistakeâ, which perhaps give some indication of this gentlemanâsrelative wealth.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It also seems from the available records that the second tranche of Â£2.5 million was, somewhat curiously, sent from the HSBC accountof Mr Woodsâ domestic helper, one Marietta Q. Cao, who was asked by Mr Woodsâ secretary âif he could use my bank account inorder to make a payment into and out of the accountâ, a request to which she agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Once again, this is an incidental fact which in itself has little resonance in the overall scheme of things, save to emphasise thatMr Woods was an extremely rich man occupying a high profile position in the world of international gambling, and that on occasionundoubtedly he used unconventional means to transfer large monetary sums: in many ways, therefore, this is not the âstandardâtype of commercial case, and contains what, to put it at its lowest, might be thought to be unusual and perhaps even âquirkyâmonetary transfer practices, which the court is given to understand often are employed in the world of international gambling.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Unlike the First, the Second General Tender in TSE shares yielded fruit. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr Hall used his own company, Axdale Overseas Corporation, to bid in both the First and Second Tenders, and on 22 December 2003an email from a Mr Sean Patterson of TSE advised Mr Hall that, following closure of the existing shareholdersâ pre-emption period,shares amounting to 5.71% of the TSE issued share capital (about 5.598 million TSE shares) would be allocated. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Accordingly, by email dated 24 December 2003 Mr Hall informed Mr Woods of the allocation of 5,598,918 shares in TSE; in the sameemail, Mr Hall stated that he would be happy to continue with his efforts to obtain additional equity in TSE for Mr Woods, albeithe also indicated that he did not know if he had <i>âthe energy or desire to keep chasing this equity.  The extra we are talking about is 2.2% to 3.1% from 2-3 people so probably worthfinishing off when I am there in January unless you want me to cease now.â</i></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Consequent upon the allocation of shares following the Second General Tender, Momentum Limited thus had acquired 5,598,918 sharesin TSE at a price of Â£3.10 per share, making a total outlay of Â£17,356,645. </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  This was the âsecond trancheâ of such shares acquired for Mr Woods, which shares were onsold to Momentum through the mediumof Mr Hallâs company, Axdale Overseas Corporation; a âfirst trancheâ, namely some 125,000 shares (which had become 1,250,000after a 10:1 split in 2003) earlier had been secured in December 2002, and which had been acquired through a company known as Jamesteer,which shares then were onsold to Growthline Ltd, and thereafter had been held through a trust structure.  However, by this stageMr Woods still had not attained the 10% shareholding he desired.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Upon allocation of the âsecond trancheâ of TSE shares, Momentum was required to undertake to TSE that it would not purchaseany further shares in TSE which would result in Momentum holding more than 6.5% of the issued share capital of TSE; a further elementof this undertaking â âthe Momentum Undertakingâ â was that it represented that, at the date of the undertaking, neitherit, its subsidiary, its parent nor any subsidiary thereof, had any direct or indirect interest in any securities, including shares,of TSE.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  It is common ground that Momentum issued this Undertaking, the precise terms and form thereof being in the documentary evidencebefore the court; by this document Momentum also agreed not to acquire further TSE shares unless with the prior approval of the TSEBoard.  More pertinently, it is said by the defendant, Mr Hall, that Mr Woods was at all material times aware of the âMomentumUndertakingâ, and of its implications, albeit as a result of Mr Hallâs efforts on behalf of Mr Woods it appears that by thatstage Mr Woods already had become the indirect owner of approximately 6.998% of the total issued share capital of TSE.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Be that as it may.  The share transactions thus far detailed form part of the overall factual matrix, but do not as such give riseto this litigation, which has as its focus the alleged acquisition of an <i>additional</i> parcel of 1,777,700 TSE shares, referred to in this trial as the so-called âthird trancheâ of such shares, which purchase would,if successful, have made Mr Hall owner of his desired 10% holding.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In or about early 2004, Mr Hall informed Mr Woods that he indeed had acquired such additional TSE shares; a Note sent by Mr Hallto Mr Woods read thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>âDAVIES â SAMOS and CALEDONIAN INFORMATION</b></p>        <p class="quote"><b>1,770,700 shares in Samos and Caledonian Holding Coâs are held by Momentum Limited by way of Davies Family Settlement. Copy of relevantinfo to be forwarded to Alan to complete file.â</b></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  It is common ground that this Note contains a typo: the figure of 1,770,700 should in fact have read <b>1,777,700</b>; indeed, as at January 2004 the share register of TSE showed that 1,777,700 shares were held by Samos Investments Limited and CaledonianHeritable Investments Limited.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The defendant pleads that his intention in giving Mr Woods this Note was to indicate that he had obtained the consent of the registeredowners, Samos and Caledonian, to hold that which has been referred to as the âTSE Trust Sharesâ for the ultimate benefit of Momentum,but that Momentum itself could not receive the TSE Trust Shares by reason of the earlier âMomentum Undertakingâ.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I have no reason to doubt the evidence (and do not so do) that as the result of this Note Mr Woods took it to mean that the additionalTSE shares had been acquired and were being held for Momentum in like manner as had been the situation with the shares earlier acquiredin the Second General Tender <i>via</i> arrangements put in place by Mr Hall on behalf of Mr Woods/Libertarian.  I also have no reason to doubt that, at this relativelyearly stage, Mr Woods did not attach his mind to the precise mechanics/manner of holding the TSE shares obtained on his/Libertarianâsbehalf by Mr Hall; in short, at that stage his trust clearly reposed in Mr Hall.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The purchase of this âthird trancheâ of TSE shares, as registered in the name of Samos and Caledonian, subsequently was confirmedby Mr Hall in a document entitled <i>âSummary Overview as at 5/6/04â</i>, which once again is in the documentary evidence and which records, <i>inter alia</i>, that out of a total of 8,626,618 TSE shares, 7,867,166 were due to Libertarian under the rubric: <i>âAll shares acquired through momentum (sic) Limited and Samos/Caledonian to be assigned 100% to Libertarian plus balance of Growthline</i> <i>acquired sharesâ â </i>this latter being a reference to 1,250,000 TSE shares earlier purchased for Growthline (via that which was termed âthe Levene Settlementâ).</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The next material development was that on 17 March 2004 Mr Hall emailed Mr Woods a document he had prepared entitled <i>âBLP and Tarlo Lyons Consolidated General Ledgerâ</i>, which contained information relating to the funds held in the BLP account and also in the account held by another firm of Londonsolicitors, Tarlo Lyons, indicating, <i>inter alia</i>, that a sum of Â£5,546,424.00 had been used for <i>âPayment to Trust for 1,777,700 shares at GBP3.11</i>â plus GBP27,732.12 (Stamp Duty).</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Thereafter, in a 7 June 2004 email Mr Hall reiterated these details, and in a further email of 10 June 2004 Mr Hall provided a spreadsheetrecording an allocation of 1,777,700 shares to the plaintiff at a price per share of Â£3.11 under the title <i>âDavies/Samos/Caledonian allocation</i>; on 26 June 2004 Mr Hall emailed Mr Woods a similar Table to like effect, these reports indicating that the total of 1,777,700 TSETrust Shares as having been bought for the plaintiff, Libertarian.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  It is clear on the evidence, and once again is not disputed, that it was in 2005 that the hitherto amicable and mutually trustingrelationship between Mr Woods and Mr Hall had begun progressively to break down; the details are of no direct relevance to the presentdispute, although the deterioration involved the breaking down of a deal to buy shares in a company called Playtech Limited.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In this latter regard, Mr Woods seems to have been unhappy about Mr Hallâs role in the collapse of this deal, which he believedhad been done at an agreed price, and apparently felt that Mr Hall had not been full and frank, and that he, Mr Hall, had alignedhimself with the Playtech interests and not those of Mr Woods, despite the fact that Mr Hall supposedly was representing Mr Woodsin this transaction.  There further has been reference to Mr Hallâs failure to repay certain personal loans to Mr Woods.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  For the avoidance of doubt, save to record the apparent provenance of the personal falling out between these two men, I take nothingfrom this episode in terms of resolving the current dispute, by now it being tolerably well known (I hope) that the Commercial Courthas little interest in prejudice.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  It was in late 2005 that Mr Woods decided that he had to sort out/get to grip with his problems with Mr Hall, and in particularthe outstanding questions he then had about the 1,777,700 TSE Trust Shares, as to the existence of which, save for the brief informationto-date volunteered by Mr Hall, Mr Woods had seen no objective documentation/substantiation verifying the statements hitherto madeto him on the subject by his erstwhile friend. </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The matter of this tranche of 1,777,700 shares had become more than usually immediately relevant, given that in March 2006 a financialinstitution, Softbank Ltd, had made a formal open cash offer to all TSE shareholders to purchase TSE shares at a price of Â£13.2005per share, which offer was to remain open for acceptance until 31 March 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Accordingly Mr Woods had asked an intermediary, a Mr Thomas Levene â formerly an executive with TSE and at that time working forcompanies owned by Mr Woods â to intercede with Mr Woods on his behalf; Mr Woods knew Mr Levene was a friend of Mr Hall, and thushe asked Mr Levene to contact Mr Hall and to instruct him to make all of the 1,777,700 TSE Trust Shares available for sale into theSoftbank cash offer.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The evidence, which I accept, was that on 24 November 2005, Mr Levene had met with the Mr Hall specifically to discuss this thirdtranche of 1,777,7000 TSE shares, and that at that meeting Mr Hall had asserted for Mr Levene that, by reason of the âMomentumUndertakingâ, the plaintiff was precluded from becoming a registered TSE shareholder, and that for that reason the defendant hadbeen made sole beneficiary of a formal written trust whereby the TSE shares were held on trust for the plaintiff, but that the relevanttrust documents had not yet formally been completed.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  As matters transpired, the Softbank offer of March 2005 was over-subscribed, and as a consequence Softbank acquired 42% of the TSEshares as were offered for sale. <b><i> </i></b>On this basis, therefore, it is said by the plaintiff that <i>if</i> the sale of the entire parcel of 1,777,700 shares had been attempted (which it appears it was not), a total of 746,634 of such shareswould have been realized at the offer price, thereby yielding proceeds of Â£9,855,942.10.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In the event, in or around mid-August 2006 the plaintiffâs solicitor, Mr John McClellan of Haldanes, was informed by the solicitorsfor the defendant that only 414,700 of the TSE Trust Shares had been sold to Softbank at the offer price, yielding proceeds of Â£5,474,247.35,funds which Mr Hall stated were in his possession and were available to return to Libertarian, and that 1,355,300 of the TSE sharesthereby remained. </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Correspondence relevant to this aspect of the case formed part of what by then were ongoing settlement negotiations between Mr Woodsand Mr Hall; in fact, a 2007 Settlement Agreement â which had as its subject matter allegations made by Mr Woods regarding thepurchases of the âfirst trancheâ and âsecond trancheâ of TSE shares, had been entered into, and forms no part of this case. However, the correspondence to which objection now is taken by the defendant relates to the âthird trancheâ of 1,777,700 shares,and is expressed to be âSubject to Contractâ and âWithout Prejudiceâ; with the agreement of counsel these documents havebeen read by the court on a <i>de bene esse</i> basis, subject to a subsequent ruling in this judgment as to admissibility.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In any event, it is common ground that the aforesaid sale proceeds from the Softbank purchase of 414,700 TSE shares in the amountof Â£5.474 million <i>never</i> were remitted to the plaintiff by Mr Hall; in fact, when Mr Levene checked the TSE share register it indicated that, as at 31 August2006, the amount of 1,587,700 TSE shares still were held by Samos and Caledonian; it appeared that the shareholding of TSE sharesin the name of Samos had decreased by 190,000, whilst the shareholding listed in Caledonianâs name had remained the same as wasthe position <i>prior to</i> the instruction to sell issued by Mr Woods.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The remaining history of this unfortunate matter can be dealt with in relatively short compass.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In around February 2006 the evidence, which I further accept, was that the defendant, Mr Hall, had informed Mr Levene that he hadestablished, <i>qua</i> settlor, an irrevocable Channel Islands trust called âthe Hall of Fame Trustâ, which was said wholly to own a company named HoflimLimited, which in turn wholly owned the beneficial entitlements to the TSE Trust Shares by virtue, it was claimed by Mr Hall, ofirrevocable Declarations of Trust made in favour of Hoflim by the two registered shareholders of the TSE shares, Samos and Caledonian.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  On 25 April 2006 Mr Woods attended a meeting with Mr Hall and a Mr Chris Parker, but despite his earlier assurances so to do, MrHall failed to produce any of the relevant documentation which had been requested of him; as a consequence, the matter became steadilyembroiled in the hands of litigation lawyers.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In July 2006 Mr Levene contacted the London solicitors, BLP, on behalf of the plaintiff to request information regarding the moniesas originally deposited in 2003 in the BLP trust account, and as a result a copy of the âBLP Axdale Ledgerâ was obtained on 30July 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  This turned out to be a significant document.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Information gleaned therefrom showed that on 14 October 2003, a sum of Â£5,463,508.46was paid out âas instructed by Axdaleââ and thus, it seems by necessary inference on the instructions of Mr Hall, who owned and controlled Axdale â to an Axdale accountat Bank Von Ernst in Switzerland; thereafter, notwithstanding further requests for particulars to the London firm of solicitors,no additional relevant information was forthcoming from BLP.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In fact, this copy of the BLP ledger for the BLP trust account indicated that the defendant had made a number of money transfersâ said by Mr Wood to have been <i>un</i>authorized â from the BLP trust account to the Axdale Swiss bank account in the total sum of Â£13,646,718.18 million, these transfersoccurring on 15 May 2003 [in the sums of Â£7,110,758.97 and Â£404,919.57 respectively], on 14 October 2003 [in the sum of Â£5,463,508.46],and on 20 April 2004 [in the sum of Â£667,521.18].</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In addition, two other transfers out of the BLP account, once again said by Mr Woods to be <i>un</i>authorized, apparently had occurred on 20 August 2003 [in the sum of Â£158,000] and on 28 August 2003 [in the sum of Â£600,000], albeitit is <i>not</i> now alleged (as originally was the case) that these latter two transfers went to Axdaleâs Swiss bank account, and, the plaintiffmaintains, in breach of certain discovery orders to this date Mr Hall has not revealed where such funds in fact went.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  It also is clear that such reports/financial information/data as had been produced by Mr Hall to Mr Woods does not match the datain the BLP ledgers as obtained by Mr Levene in August 2006; in particular, for example, hitherto there had been no mention whateverby Mr Hall to Mr Woods of the withdrawal from the BLP Trust Account of the sum Â£5.463 million on 14 October 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In fact, Mr Hall earlier had reported that the payment for the âTSE Trust Sharesâ had been made on 19 January 2004 in the sumof Â£5,546,424.00, whilst out of the overall sum totalling Â£13.646 million which had been transferred from the BLP account on theinstructions of the defendant to the Swiss bank account of Axdale, Mr Hall has maintained that the transfer of 14 October 2003 [inthe sum of Â£5.46 million] was transferred to <i>âa nominee appointed</i> <i>by the beneficial owners of the sharesâ</i>, a person subsequently identified by Mr Hall on affidavit as one <i>âMr</i> <i>Michael Schultzâ</i>, whom Mr Hall claims to have been made a nominee of Samos and Caledonian, the registered shareholders of the TSE Trust Shares, inorder to facilitate the acquisition of such shares<i>.</i></p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Finally, in this narrative of the principal historical events, it remains only to add, as a matter of objective fact, that in theReasons for Judgment of Mr Justice Fung of 11 June 2007, the learned judge observes (at paragraph 24 thereof) that shortly priorto the hearing which took place before him, the plaintiff, Libertarian, had been informed by Samos and Caledonian that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)    they had <i>not</i> dealt with the defendant or with a âMr Michael Schultzâ (their nominee as alleged by the defendant);</p>        <p>(2)    they did <i>not</i> make any agreement with the defendant in relation to the 1,777,700 shares; and</p>        <p>(3)    they did <i>not</i> execute any declaration of trust in respect of the 1,777,700 shares.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The learned judge â whom, it will be recalled, had continued until trial the worldwide Mareva injunction then in place, save forvarying downwards the amount enjoined â not only accepted this evidence, as I now do given that it was not queried in this trial,but also noted (at paragraph 25 of his Reasons) that it had been revealed that in the sale of the original tranche of 5.5 millionTSE shares to Momentum, Samos and Caledonian had received only Â£2.71 per share, instead of Â£3.11.</p>    <p class="heading">The respective cases</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Against the foregoing background, in which, save for minor detail there is little if anything of substance/primary fact that isdisputed, the plaintiffâs case in outline is that the defendant wrongfully had accessed and utilized the plaintiffâs funds <i>absent</i> authorization so to do, that he had failed to obey the plaintiffâs/Mr Woodâs instructions, and that, in the period 2004â2006,Mr Hall had set up a UK trust/ private corporate structure whereby the net amount of TSE shares (that is, those remaining outwiththe Softbank sale) plus the sale proceeds were held, and yet he had resisted to account to the plaintiff for these assets, includingin particular the Â£5.643 million, which Mr Hall had claimed, it is said falsely, simply to have handed over to the aforesaid âMrShultzâ, notwithstanding that the plaintiff says that the tracing discovery, effected pursuant to the interlocutory injunctiongranted by Sakhrani J, amply had demonstrated that Mr Hall had used this money for his own, and as yet, unrevealed purposes.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In light of these allegations, the plaintiff seeks the remedies outlined in paragraphs (1), (3) and (5) of the Re-Re-Amended Statementof Claim â namely an order that the defendant account to the plaintiff upon the basis of wilful default for the trust property,and in particular for the plaintiffâs funds transferred on the instructions of the defendant from the BLP trust account â andfor equitable damages or restitution âof at least Â£21,424, 503 to restore the plaintiff to the position it would have been inhad the defendant honoured his trust obligationsâ, together with compound interest compound, costs and (at paragraph (7)), theumbrella plea of âall necessary orders, accounts and inquiriesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  To the contrary, the defendant, Mr Hall, whilst admitting having had <i>indirect</i> control of the plaintiffâs funds, and also that the sum of Â£5.474 million has <i>not</i> been returned to the plaintiff, nevertheless denies having been a trustee or fiduciary of or in terms of the plaintiffâs funds,pleading in this context that the registered owners of the 1,777,700 TSE shares, namely Samos and Caledonian, had and have not executedany declaration of trust to the effect that they hold the TSE shares for the benefit of any other party, and further totally denyingâthat the defendant is accountable to the plaintiff in respect of any property, as alleged or at allâ.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  It is specifically denied that Mr Hall reported to the plaintiff on 12 December 2005 that the 1,777,700 shares were held under writtendeclarations of trust, and that if it be alleged that the plaintiff says that the defendant was the trustee of âbeneficial entitlementsâto 1,777,700 shares in TSE, such allegation also is denied. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Mr Hall further says that the so-called âDavies-Samos and Caledonian Noteâ [<i>vide</i> paragraph 35 above] was intended only to indicate that he had obtained the agreement of Samos and Caledonian to sell shares in TSEfor the ultimate benefit of Momentum, and he further denies that Mr Woods reasonably could have understood that at that time theplaintiff, Libertarian, had acquired proprietary rights in the 1,777,700 TSE shares, given that Mr Woods knew, or ought to have known,by reason of the âMomentum Undertakingâ and the content of the TSE Articles of Association, that the plaintiff was unable toacquire such proprietary rights, and further that Samos and Caledonian had not executed any declarations of trust with regard tothe TSE shares they were registered as holding.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Mr Hall maintains that whilst Mr Levene indeed had asked that the 1,777,700 shares should be placed under the plaintiffâs directcontrol, he personally had told Mr Levene that given the Undertaking and the Articles of TSE, that the plaintiff could not directlyor indirectly become the beneficial owner of the additional shares in TSE; he also accepts that he had told Mr Levene that he wasthe settlor of the âHall of Fame Trustâ, and that the latter was wholly owned by Hoflim, and he accepted that whilst Mr Levenehad asked him to arrange for the sale of as many TSE shares as possible to Softbank, he, Mr Hall, had said only that he would âpassthe request onâ to Caledonian and Samos, but that in the prevailing circumstances he could do no more.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  As to the transfers of funds out of the BLP trust account to the Bank Von Ernst in Zurich, Mr Hall says that transfers of Â£7.51million and Â£0.66 million were part of the Â£17.35 million used for the acquisition of the first tranche of 5.5 million TSE shares(ostensibly at Â£3.11) by Momentum, and that, following these earlier similar transactions, the transfer to Bank Von Ernst of thesum of Â£5,456,508.46 was made with the consent of the plaintiff, and that these funds subsequently were transferred to a nomineeof Samos and Caledonian, namely the aforesaid âMr Shultzâ, for the purpose of acquiring interests in shares of TSE. </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  It is also denied that the defendant is accountable to the plaintiff in respect of any property, as alleged or at all, and thatthe defendant was in breach of any obligation owed to the plaintiff, as alleged or at all.  As a final piece of the jigsaw, Mr Hallalso mounts a âset offâ defence, asserting that he had used his own monies to place the mysterious âMr Schultzâ, whom heclaims to have been a nominee of the two registered shareholders of the âthird trancheâ of TSE shares, in funds in the amountof Â£5.456 million.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The foregoing summary attempts to represent no more than a relatively linear outline in a sequence of events in what, even today,remains a tangled historical picture, with perhaps a more than usual number of questions remaining unanswered â a situation, saysthe plaintiff, which is entirely due to the consistent reticence/dishonesty of the defendant, Mr Hall, who always has refused toâcome cleanâ as to precisely what had happened, and when, to the funds as remitted to him and/or as to the parcel of 1,777,700TSE shares.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Hence the present dispute with which this court now is required to resolve â albeit, if I may say so, this 9 day trial demonstrablyhas not produced the degree of factual clarity normally emerging from such hearings, and on certain significant matters the courtis left none the wiser.</p>    <p class="heading">The evidence </p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The plaintiff centrally prayed in aid the content of three affidavits of Mr Woods, sworn prior to his death. </p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The first was on 16 November 2006 and was made on behalf of the plaintiff in aid of the ex parte on notice interlocutory injunctiverelief as was granted by Sakhrani J on that date; the second, dated 15 February 2007, was sworn in support of the continuation ofthe existing injunction, and in response to the defendantâs affidavits of 24 November 2006, 21 December 2006 and 8 January 2007;and the third in response to Mr Hallâs affidavit of 9 March 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  <i>Viva voce</i> evidence on behalf of the plaintiff was given by Mr Timothy Levene â whom, it will be recalled, was the intermediary asked by MrWoods to intercede with Mr Hall â and by two members of the plaintiffâs legal team, Mr John McClellan and Mr Patrick Rattigan.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Mr Levene helpfully recounted his role in events, with specific reference to his interaction with Mr Hall upon Mr Woodsâ behalf,including reference to statements made to him by Mr Hall at various meetings commencing in 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Mr McClellanâs evidence primarily concerned inter-solicitor (including in particular the âsettlement correspondenceâ, to whichobjection on behalf of the defendant formally was taken), whilst Mr Rattiganâs evidence was directed at making coherent sense ofthe mass of diverse figures involved in this case, and in proffering an analysis of the monetary transfers occasioned by Mr Hall;in particular he prepared and produced some extremely helpful and detailed flow-charts, the content of which was derived from theavailable data, a painstaking exercise which must have occupied a huge amount of time and which was of considerable assistance tothe court in trying to make some broad sense of what had gone where, to whom and when.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  In addition, a Hearsay Notice tendering a witness statement of a Mr Mark Davies dated 5 August 2010 was superceded by an affidavitof the said gentleman dated 24 August 2010; and, finally, an affidavit of Marietta Q Cao, the domestic helper whose bank accountonce had been used by Mr Woods for an international monetary transfer, also was placed in evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  For the defendant, only Mr Hall gave <i>viva voce</i> evidence, although given the history of the case his oral evidence before the court had been prefaced by a great deal of accumulatedaffidavit evidence, Mr Hall having sworn a total of 6 affidavits in the period 24 November  2006 â 29 August 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  I refer shortly to what I have made of the evidence given on both sides of this dispute; before so doing, however, I should grapplewith, and rule upon, the âadmissibility issueâ, which is a facet of this case to which earlier I have made passing reference[<i>vide</i> paragraph 52]; under this head there are two elements which require separately to be considered.</p>    <p class="heading">Admissibility of certain evidence</p>    <p class="heading">(i)  <u>âWithout prejudiceâ correspondence</u></p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Early in the course of this trial Mr Wright, on behalf of Mr Hall, objected to reliance by the plaintiff on âwithout prejudiceâcommunications, mainly with respect to Mr McClellanâs evidence, and invited the court to exclude these communications, either byruling immediately (which the court declined to do), or, as now within this judgment, after considering at trial the communicationson a <i>de bene esse</i> basis.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  I shall not rehearse the normal standard principles/authorities relating to âwpâ correspondence, save to refer to M/N24/5/41in the 2009 edition of the Hong Kong White Book; as Mr Wright correctly pointed out, the purpose of the rule rendering all negotiationsfor the settlement of a dispute inadmissible is to protect a litigant from subsequent embarrassment should the case (as, sadly, here)fail so to settle.  He stressed that the established rule is founded first, upon public policy in the encouragement of parties tonegotiate and settle, and second, on an implied agreement arising out of what commonly is understood to be the consequences of offeringor agreeing to negotiate âwithout prejudiceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  For his part, Mr Barlow SC naturally does not take issue with general principle.  However he attacks on two fronts.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  First, he complains that an indiscriminate âblanketâ challenge is made to the 54 emails between instructing solicitors in thiscase, which were exchanged over a period of 3.5 months between 14 June 2006 and 28 September 2006, of which 46 were written in âopenâcorrespondence and 8 were marked âwithout prejudiceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  He referred to the history of this matter, whereby the defendantâs objection has been canvassed before a Master and, on appeal,before a Recorder, and thereafter before Deputy Judge Carlson, who sensibly had stood the matter over to the trial judge.  Mr Barlownoted further that later âopenâ correspondence in fact referred back to earlier âwpâ correspondence, and maintained thatof the 8 âwpâ emails, 2 were so marked by the plaintiffâs solicitors, and that any surviving privilege had been waived by them.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Mr Barlow also relied on the so-called âfraud exceptionâ, whereby no privilege comes into existence regarding communicationsmade to get advice for the purpose of carrying out a fraud, citing Viscount Finlay in <i>OâRourke v Darbishire</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1920%5d%20AC%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1920] AC 581</a>, at 604<i>,</i> and also like observations by Goff J (as he then was) in <i>Crescent Farm</i> <i>(Sidcup) Sports Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%201%20Ch%20553" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 1 Ch. 553</a>, at 565D, who observed that in this connection âfraudâ âis not limited to the tort of deceit and includes all forms of fraudand dishonesty, such as fraudulent breach of trustâ¦trickery and sham contrivancesâ¦â and of Lord Denning MR in <i>Buttes Gas &amp; Oil v Hammer (No 3),</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20QB%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 QB 223</a>, at 246G-H, who emphasized that to do away with the privilege âthere must be strong evidence of fraudâ.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Following this theme, Mr Barlowâs premise was that in the present case the factual assertions within the defendantâs correspondencewere steps taken by Mr Hall (through the medium of his solicitors) to conceal his frauds/wrongdoings committed with the plaintiffâsfunds, and were intended to render irrecoverable trust assets and to defeat the plaintiffâs causes of action â and that againstthis backdrop the defendant thus should not be permitted âto hide behind the cloak of privilegeâ in order to cover up the truesituation and to impede the process of uncovering the truth of the defendantâs dishonest breaches of trust/fiduciary duty, andof the identification of the remedies to which such breaches should give rise.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  That at least was the gist of the submissions on both sides of the fence, and I have had now reviewed the entire correspondencein question in light of the established principles which have been brought to the attention of the court.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  My conclusion on this aspect of the admissibility argument â a conclusion which in the circumstances of this case has caused melittle conceptual difficulty â is that in my view the âwpâ correspondence (which in any event I have, as I have said, alreadyscrutinized <i>de</i> <i>bene esse</i>) is in fact admissible upon the bases canvassed by Mr Barlow.  I so hold.</p>    <p class="heading">(ii)  <u>Aspects of Mr Rattiganâs evidence</u></p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  This is a lesser element of the admissibility argument, and is not one to which I attach a great deal of importance in the overallscheme of things.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  On behalf of the defendant, objection is taken to the admission in evidence of paragraphs 8-12, 14, and 18-29 of Mr Rattiganâswitness statement, which he adopted as his evidence in chief.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  These paragraphs contain both objective analysis of the data collated by Mr Rattigan in the course of the case, together with narrativecomment, <i>inter alia,</i> upon the merits of Mr Hallâs âoffsetâ argument, and yet further observations upon what certain shareholdings do, or do notreveal, and also Mr Rattiganâs discovery, and consequent submission, to the effect that the defendant has been less than full andfrank in his existing statement of assets produced for use in the interlocutory proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  My view is that what may be characterized as the âcommentary aspectsâ of these paragraphs strictly speaking is inadmissible,in that these observations purport to tell the court what to think about certain aspects of the evidence. With respect, I have nointerest in being told by anybody of what to make, or not to make, of certain evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  However, if I may say so, this is the Commercial Court and it is tolerably capable of making up its own mind in the face of objective(and apparently incontrovertible) data; nevertheless, and for the avoidance of doubt, with regard to Mr Rattiganâs <i>personal</i> <i>opinions/commentary</i>, which clearly were expressed in good faith after what was undoubtedly his total immersion over hundreds of hours and literally thousandsof pages of documents, resulting in the impressive collation of the available data, I have given no weight at all.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  So that at the end of the day I do not consider this pure âadmissibilityâ objection to be of any practical relevance, albeitsuch evidential comment/opinion as has been ventured by this witness has not influenced my mind and certainly has <i>not</i> affected my view of the merits of the plaintiffâs claim as brought.</p>    <p class="heading">Credibility/Findings of fact</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  If I may say so, I am surprised that this case has found its way to court, far less to completion of a hard-fought 9 day trial,given what strikes me as the overwhelming merit of the plaintiffâs case; in fact, it is unclear to me why this case, which as earlierI have noted has as its primary focus the âthird trancheâ of 1,777,700 TSE shares, has not been the subject of settlement inlike manner to the 2007 Settlement Agreement (which I am told was effected upon payment by Mr Hall of some Â£1.8 million or thereaboutsin respect of the Momentum overpayment for âsecond trancheâ of 5,523,918 TSE shares.)</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  Be that as it may.  The court has to deal with the evidence and with the arguments propounded before it.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  In blunt terms, I accept the plaintiffâs evidence virtually in its entirety; there may be minor incidental matters of detail whichdo not entirely âmeshâ, but at the end of the day, given the evidence before the court and the content of such contemporaneousdocuments as the plaintiff to-date has been able to uncover, in my view there can be no real argument about the truth of the factualunderpinning of the plaintiffâs case.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Mr Woods, regrettably, was unavailable for cross-examination, but in light of the other evidence and the mass of assembled documentation,I have no reason to believe that the content of his extensive affidavit evidence, sworn before his untimely demise, is other thanfundamentally true.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  I accept the evidence of Mr McClellan and Mr Rattigan (no latter as circumscribed in the manner outlined above), and I also acceptthe evidence of Mr Levene, Mr Woodsâ intermediary with Mr Hall, and in particular his account of his dealings with and his effortsin meetings with Mr Hall, to sort out this particular matter.  I found him an impressive witness.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  The correlative side of this coin, I am afraid, is that Mr Hall does not emerge at all well from this case in terms of this courtâsestimate/opinion of his overall probity/veracity.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  It seemed to me that, at bottom, his defence evidence amounted to little more than denial: denial of lack of authority to use theplaintiffâs funds, denial of responsibility in respect of his handling of these funds, and in respect of the beneficial entitlementsto the TSE shares allegedly purchased with these funds, and further, and in the round, a complete denial of any wrongdoing whatsoever. In this regard I have not overlooked that which Mr Barlow characterized as Mr Hallâs âunashamedâ late changes to his witnessstatements only <i>after</i> the plaintiff had closed its case, with the result that fundamental discrepancies emerged between the content of Mr Hallâs prioraffidavit evidence, sworn in one context, and his oral evidence before this court.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Notwithstanding a certain insouciant and, if I may say so, a degree of personal charm, Mr Hall struck me essentially as a âchancerâ,who whilst probably not setting out to be dishonest, clearly permitted himself to do as he wished with the considerable amounts ofmoney with which he was entrusted in response to his personal circumstances at any given time: his treatment of the money placedin the BLP trust account, for example, smacked of âteeming and ladingâ in as much as when Mr Hall faced monetary requirements,in my judgment he allowed the obvious trust initially reposed in him, and the opportunities created thereby, to yield to the temptationto use these funds for his own purposes; indeed, as earlier observed, even now I am far from sure that the true story about all thathas happened properly has emerged, and Mr Hallâs own evidence â upon which he strenuously and effectively was cross-examinedâ pointedly did <i>not</i> reveal the whole truth about the sequence of events which thus far have been discovered to have occurred, consequent upon the attemptsby the plaintiff accurately to âpiece togetherâ a complex financial jigsaw puzzle without necessarily being in possession ofall the relevant pieces.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Moreover, even allowing for the âidiosyncrasiesâ and relative financial informality of the international gambling world, andthe obvious casualness with which large sums of money often were transferred, some of Mr Hallâs evidence seemed to me to be whollyfar-fetched and unbelievable, and if I may say so more fitting to the stories of Lewis Carroll than hard reality: in this connectionthe alleged transfer of Â£5.46 million via Macau âjunket roomsâ to the apparent stranger âMr Schultzâ (whose provenance wasand remains wholly unidentified), <i>qua</i> alleged nominee for Samos and Caledonian, provides a prime example, and in my view in order to take that at face value any hard-nosedcourt simply would have to suspend disbelief or any element of critical analysis.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In this latter regard, Mr Barlow pointed out that there was no mention whatever in the contemporaneous documents of âMr Schultzâ,or for that matter any agent or nominee of Santos and Caledonian in or around 2004 when the transaction in relevant tranche of 1,777,700shares was supposed to be taking place, and in fact the first occasion on which Mr Hall refers to âMr Schultzâ by name was onlyin his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit dated 21 December 2006, that is, nearly 3 years after the alleged event.  He also observes that Mr Schultz deposed to paymentsbeing made to this mysterious gentleman through Macau âjunket roomsâ, and thereafter claimed in March 2007 correspondence withthe plaintiffâs solicitors that he had âlostâ the contact details of this person.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  As to the alleged involvement of Samos and Caledonian Mr Hallâs story similarly was internally contradictory.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Initially he had reported to the plaintiff that he had set up the trust company/structure to hold the beneficial entitlements tothe TSE Trust Shares, but this position subsequently moved to the allegation that, after receipt of payment in full, Samos and Caledonianwere not prepared to complete the transaction and that, as a consequence, no beneficial ownership of the tranche of 1,777,700 shareswas acquired for the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  Mr Barlow goes on to suggest, not without cause, that Mr Hallâs various accounts in terms of the acquisition of the precise numbershares and at what price varied from time to time, and that this internal inconsistency with the relevant figures as presented toMr Woods was, as Mr Barlow put it, âindicative of his lies and of the fact that he could not keep track of his own liesâ.  Itis difficult in the circumstances to disagree with this pithy characterization.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  In the Samos/Caledonian context, it is also worth specifically noting that the defendant <i>admits</i> that Samos and Caledonian have not executed any declaration of trust declaring that they hold the TSE shares for anyone, and alsoit is notable that in cross-examination the defendant made no challenge to the truth of the Samos/Caledonian hearsay evidence (referredto in the interlocutory judgment of Fung J), nor to the affidavit evidence of Mark Davies â evidence which I am also minded toaccept.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  In short, I regret to say that in my judgment Mr Hall â who evidently has accumulated not inconsiderable wealth in his own rightas a result of his presence in and around the fringes of the business of international gambling, and whose keen eye for the âmainchanceâ coupled with a superficially appealing personal manner clearly to-date has provided a measure of personal success â did<i>not</i> tell the truth to this court.  I regret to say that in my view he continually âbobbed and weavedâ, evaded and dissembled, andin terms of any internal cohesion within his version of events, unsatisfactorily at that.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  As to the myriad of factual conflicts between his account, and the account of events as put forward by the plaintiff, on the mainissues for decision I have no hesitation whatever in accepting the plaintiffâs evidence and in disbelieving Mr Hall; to take aprime example, there simply can be no doubt that Mr Hall made wholly unauthorized transfers from the BLP trust account into, <i>inter alia,</i> the Axdale Swiss account â I reject unequivocally the idea that was floated by Mr Hall that any such transfers were effected withMr Woodsâ consent â and it is plain that the trust initially reposed by Mr Woods in Mr Hall, coupled with Mr Woodsâ apparentlack of interest in mechanics (no doubt a trait of extremely wealthy men who are in the habit of delegating matters of detail totrusted aides) enabled Mr Hall effectively and, I am driven to say, ultimately dishonestly, to do as he wished when he wished withsignificant funds which were at his practical disposal, absent any material degree of oversight by Mr Woods, who no doubt assumedthat Mr Hall would do his best to effect his wishes regarding the acquisition, and subsequent holding, of the TSE shares.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  It is clear (and I so find) that the contemporaneous documentation amply demonstrates that, consequent upon Mr Hallâs falsifiedand misleading reports as to what was happening, Mr Woods was operating under the understanding that the purchases of TSE shareseither were to be conducted through Momentum, for the benefit of the plaintiff, or through a similar trust structure to the Growthline/LeveneSettlement (regarding the âfirst trancheâ of TSE shares) for the benefit of the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  I also do <i>not</i> find, as was suggested, that there was any voluntary assumption of risk by Mr Woods or the plaintiff, and that by transferring fundsto the BLP client account for Momentum/Assanzon â both or which Mr Woods controlled â that somehow Mr Woods/the plaintiff wasaware that they would be dealing with Axdale as vendor; in fact, I am driven by the evidence to the finding that Axdale fraudulentlywas interposed in the sequence of events in order to hide Mr Hallâs wrongful and unauthorized activities/secret profits; in otherwords, as a convenient (and perhaps initially plausible) cover for Mr Hallâs illegitimate activities, and it is equally evidentthat Mr Hall never at any time disclosed to Mr Woods Axdaleâs true role in the transactions with which this case is concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  I do not wish to be personally unfair to Mr Hall, who, as I have said, in giving evidence demonstrated a certain element of charmand, on occasion, a quite disarming acceptance of the wholly obvious and egregious nature of aspects of his conduct, but upon theevidence currently available â and I repeat that I do <i>not</i> consider that the full story even now has yet emerged notwithstanding the significant efforts made on behalf of the plaintiff inthe preparation of this case for presentation to this court â drives me to the foregoing unpalatable, but I fear, inevitable conclusions.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  It was, no doubt, with a shrewd eye upon that which the court was likely to view the broad factual merits, and the probable findingsof fact consequent thereon, which persuaded Mr Wright, who has said everything that properly could be said on behalf of his client,to rely upon what might be characterized as legal/technical defences in opposition to this claim - and it is to these arguments thatI now turn.</p>    <p class="heading">Legal defences</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Mr Wrightâs keynote theme to this element of the defendantâs case has as its provenance the words of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in<i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 669</a>, wherein his lordship observed (at 704H):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦wise judges have often warned against the wholesale importation into commercial law of legal principles inconsistent with thecertainty and speed which are essential requirements for the orderly conduct of business affairs.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Warming to this theme, which he expanded in his helpful written closing addresses, Mr Wright says that in the present action, theplaintiff is asking the court to grant equitable relief in what <i>par excellence</i> is a âmere commercial disputeâ, and that the plaintiffâs attempt to extend these principles to this âwholly inappropriatefactual situationâ is both flawed and demonstrates a âfundamental lack of understandingâ of applicable equitable principles. He stresses also the use in the partiesâ affairs of limited liability companies, and thus submits that the manner in which theplaintiffâs claim has been advanced ignores basic principles of company law.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  Against this conceptual backdrop, counsel takes the following âtechnicalâ points.</p>    <p class="heading">(i)  <u>Wrong plaintiff</u></p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  Since the fact is that the funds in question in this case were transferred by Assanzon to the BLP trust account, it is now saidthat Assanzon is the correct (and only plaintiff), rather than the current plaintiff, Libertarian.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  It is not in question â indeed, I fail to see how legitimately it can be doubted â but that Mr Woods wholly owned both companies,and that he caused Assanzon to transfer the funds in question to the BLP trust account for and on behalf of the plaintiff, Libertarian;indeed this seems to have been expressly recognized by Mr Hall, who in his witness statement acknowledges: âI understood that Assanzonwas one of Alan Woodsâ companiesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  I accept the contention by the plaintiff that the uncontroverted evidence, was both to the mass of documentary evidence and, infact, in Mr Hallâs oral evidence, was that the funds belonged to the plaintiff, and it seems to me, with respect, that this âdefenceâis scraping the forensic barrel.  I reject it.</p>    <p class="heading">(ii)  <u>Wrong defendant</u></p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  The defendant alleges that the funds were transferred to BLP for the account of Axdale, his company, and not for himself, so thatthe correct defendant should be Axdale, and not Mr Hall personally.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  Mr Barlow points out that in the original version of the defendantâs witness statement dated 3 March 2009, the defendant refersto the BLP trust account as being âmy client account with BLP in the name of Axdaleâ, which position pointedly (and unashamedly)was changed at trial at the eleventh hour, by amendment to Mr Hallâs witness statement prior to its formal adoption into evidence,to ââ¦<i>the</i> account with BLP in the name of Axdaleâ¦â and consequent deletion of the word â<i>my</i>â.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  I note also that both parties plead that the funds in the BLP trust account were under the control of the defendant through hiscontrol of Axdale, and whilst Mr Barlow accepts that the plaintiff also could have sued Axdale for torts committed by the defendantthrough his wholly-owned and solely-controlled company, what, Mr Barlow asks rhetorically, would be the point, since there can beno doubt whatever that by now Axdale has been stripped of its assets?</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  The plaintiff further argues that as a matter of law if a trustee or fiduciary misapplies trust funds which are under his control,then he commits a breach of trust: see, for example, <i>Belmont Finance (No 2)</i> and <i>Agip Africa Ltd, infra.</i></p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  For my part, I see no merit whatever in the obviously self-serving amendments as so belatedly made to the witness statements ofMr Hall, and in the circumstances of this case I reject as firmly as I may the notion that Mr Hall is the incorrect defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">(iii)  <u>The âMomentum Undertakingâ/Terms of the TSE Articles</u></p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  The point also is taken on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff is debarred from receiving the TSE Trust Shares by eitherthe terms of the âMomentum Undertakingâ or by the terms of TSEâs Articles.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  It further is alleged that the performance of the Samos/Caledonian deal for the acquisition of the TSE shares was impossible orunlawful by reason of the âMomentum Undertakingâ.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  The relevance of this latter point is contained in the maxim âhe who seeks equity must do equityâ, and thus, so the defenceargument goes, the âclean handsâ maxim should rule, and that when exercising its equitable jurisdiction the court should notenforce/recognise the transaction, thus finding that the plaintiff could <i>not</i> have acquired any beneficial interest in the âthird trancheâ of 1,777,700 TSE shares.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  This struck me as an intriguing and ambitious argument in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendantâs dishonest behaviour,and his clearly cavalier attitude to dealing with the responsibilities he had assumed with regard to the interests of the plaintiff/MrWoods, and to the sums of money entrusted in good faith to his care.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  Be that as it may.  So far as the âMomentum Undertakingâ is concerned, neither the plaintiff nor Mr Woods was privy thereto,and I note that Mr Woods has deposed that he neither knew of or consented to the Undertaking being signed, the latter apparentlyhaving been executed by Momentumâs sole director, Sovereign Managers Ltd, through Mr Hallâs friend, one Mr Howard Bilton.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  So I do not consider this point to have a great deal of resonance in the broad scheme of things, and I pay no further attentionto it.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  As for the âTSE Articlesâ argument, Mr Barlow has noted that in any event it was the 2002 TSE Articles, and not those adoptedin 2004, that are relevant, and indeed Mr Hallâs email Statement of Account showing, <i>inter alia</i>, that Â£5.56 million had been used to purchase the 1,777,700 TSE Trust Shares had been sent on 22 April 2004, that is, prior to theimplementation of the 2004 Articles.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  Moreover, in terms of the 2002 Articles, Mr Barlow quoted <i>in</i> <i>extenso</i> Article 36 thereof in his written closing argument, the point of which was that under UK law any attempt in TSEâs Articles to regulateor restrict âany interest in sharesâ [<i>vide</i> Art 36.1(a)] is <i>ultra vires</i> and unenforceable, and in any event â and in the circumstances this seems to me to be the better point â clearly there was nocontract between TSE and the plaintiff and/or Mr Woods, so that it is difficult to see how or why either the Momentum Undertakingor the TSE Articles created any enforceable legal or equitable rights against the plaintiff.  In this regard Mr Barlow further submitsthat there is no rule or maxim of equity that would prevent (or have prevented) the plaintiff from acquiring the beneficial rightsto TSE shares, if the defendant indeed ever had secured them (which he previously had claimed to have done, but appeared now to deny).</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  Accordingly, I do not think this line of argument is worth powder and shot, and in my view does not amount to any defence to theplaintiffâs present claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Substantive defences: Legal status of the defendant</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  For the purpose of this judgment I draw a distinction between the so-called âtechnicalâ points taken, and that which usefullymay be termed âsubstantiveâ legal argument, which in this instance has the parties locking horns as to the defendantâs legalstatus â the answer to which, of course, necessarily informs the appropriate remedy to which the plaintiff may be entitled.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  The plaintiffâs case unequivocally is that the defendant, Mr Hall, was acting <i>qua</i> trustee for the plaintiff of the plaintiffâs funds which were deposited in the BLP Trust Account. </p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  It is, I think, accepted that as a matter of law that funds held by a solicitorâs firm in a client account are held on trust onbehalf of the owner of the funds, who will usually be the client, albeit in the instant case (and, it is said, and as I accept, unbeknownstto the plaintiff/Mr Woods) the account into which the monies were deposited was in the name of Axdale, Mr Hallâs company.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  The defendantâs argument in this regard, flagged by Mr Wright in his opening skeleton argument, and thereafter further extensivelydeveloped in his closing submission, is that Mr Hall was not a trustee of the plaintiffâs funds in the solicitorâs trust account,because BLPâs designated client was Axdale, and not Mr Hall.</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Mr Barlowâs riposte is that this is nonsense, and that this argument is unsustainable on the known facts, not least in light ofMr Hallâs deception in relation to the designation of the account into which the plaintiffâs funds were transferred (via Assanzon).</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  Mr Barlow says that it is well-established that where one party accepts and takes control and responsibility over property belongingto another, such first party acts <i>qua</i> trustee/fiduciary, and irrespective of whether this relationship is formalized, the resultant trustee/fiduciary will be held accountablefor any breach.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  I dare say that this is trite law, but if any authority be needed for this proposition counsel points to <i>Belmont Finance Ltd v</i> <i>Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2),</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20All%20ER%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 All ER 393 (CA)</a> and <i>Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson and ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20Ch%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 Ch. 265</a>, per Millett J (as he then was) at 290BâF.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  In the alternative, Mr Barlow relies on the factual matrix as having created what is commonly referred to as a â<i>Quistclose</i> trustâ, so named after <i>Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20AC%20567" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] AC 567 (HL)</a> wherein a person makes money available to another on the basis that the latter does not have free disposition over the money andis admitted to use it for a particular identified purpose: see also Lord Millett in <i>Twinsectra v Yardley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 164</a>, at 184; <i>Typhoon 8 Research Ltd v Seapower Resources International Ltd &amp; anr</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20HKLRD%20660" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 HKLRD 660 (CA)</a>, per Le Pichon JA at 668-670.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  In his helpful and detailed supplemental closing submissions, Mr Wright mounts a strong argument that in no sense was Mr Hall atrustee, and goes to considerable lengths to distinguish the <i>Agip (Africa)</i> line of case law.  He also submits that Mr Hall was not a fiduciary, repeating once more his opening thesis that the courts frequentlyhave warned against the extension of equitable principles governing fiduciaries into the domain of commercial relationships, so asnot to âstrainâ the relevant principles and to maintain them within their proper limits.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  Mr Wright observes that equity traditionally was prepared to supervise fiduciaries in order to prevent them from misusing theirposition to their own advantage, and that for a person to be a fiduciary he must have bound himself to protect/advance the interestsof another, and that it is precisely this requirement that prevents most commercial relationships from giving rise to fiduciary obligations,for example, the relationship between shareholders/shareholders, and directors/shareholders.  He says, further, that no fiduciaryrelationship arises where one party to a contract has âfailed to protect himself adequately by accepting terms which are insufficientto protect his interestsâ, and there is thus no basis for the imposition of fiduciary obligations in order âto overcome the shortcomingsin the relationship between themâ.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  Persuasive though he was in his final address, I fear that in the present case Mr Wright has been unable to convince me to âringfenceâthe current commercial factual matrix from the intervention of equity.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  With respect to Mr Wrightâs argument, it seems to me to be tolerably clear that when one party trusts and remits to a businessassociate funds for the specific purpose of buying certain shares (in this case the âthird trancheâ of 1,777,700 TSE shares),which funds, unknown to the remitting party, are promptly deposited in a solicitorâs trust account <i>not</i> in the name of the donor but in the name of the associateâs own company, and thereafter, together with other funds, wrongfullyand dishonestly are abstracted into the associateâs Swiss bank account held in the name of that associateâs own company, onceagain entirely without notice to, and absent the consent of the remitting party, in my view it does not represent a huge juridicalleap (or, for that matter, a misplaced infringement of the âacceptedâ confines of commercial law) to find, as I do, that theactions of such associate amount to breach of trust and/or fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  In the instant case, Mr Barlow has stressed that the actions of the defendant in misappropriating the plaintiffâs funds, throughunauthorized transfers patent on the face of the copy of the BLP trust account ledger â <i>vide</i> the pleaded particulars contained in para 37 of the Re-re-Amended Statement of Claim, which themselves are amplified in his writtenopening and closing submissions, and wherein finally it is said that the total of the defendantâs <i>known</i> misappropriations is in the amount of Â£8,024,590 â clearly constitute breaches of trust, not least since Mr Hall has admittedin evidence that the funds concerned were <i>not</i> used for any purposes of the plaintiff/Mr Woods, let alone the <i>agreed</i> designated purpose, which was the acquisition of TSE shares; to the contrary, I find that Mr Hall wrongfully abstracted and usedthese funds for his own entirely unauthorized purposes, absent the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff/Mr Woods.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  Leading counsel also submits that Mr Hallâs alleged âoffsetâ defence (wherein he claimed to have used funds of his own tomake payments to âMr Schultzâ via Macau âjunket roomsâ), even if true â which, he argued, quite palpably was a figmentof Mr Hallâs imagination â would be unable to assist the defendant, unless such âpaymentsâ had resulted in the acquisitionfor the plaintiff by Mr Hall of TSE shares, or a clear beneficial entitlement thereto â albeit most certainly this was <i>not</i> the defendantâs case.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  I agree with this submission also.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  In my view on the accumulated evidence before the court â and I so find â Mr Hall misappropriated funds of the plaintiff/MrWoods, through the five unauthorized payments in breach of trust and/or fiduciary duty, for which the plaintiff has an equitableremedy, suggested âjuridical constraintsâ upon the Commercial Court notwithstanding.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiffâs remedy(ies)</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  Mr Barlow submits that the obligation to provide an account of the trust assets is a basic and fundamental obligation of all trustees,and, in the absence of such an account being provided, in its equitable jurisdiction the court will compel a trustee to provide it,and if the process of an account uncovers (as clearly it has in this case) an absence or shortfall of trust assets, the court dulywill make necessary ancillary orders, such as, for example, restitution <i>in specie</i>, or an order that the trustee make a monetary payment to the trust to make good the value of an omission: <i>Snell (31<sup>st</sup> ed.)</i>, at paras 18-01 â 18.04.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  That Mr Hall has misappropriated trust property in breach of his obligations <i>qua</i> trustee/fiduciary in my view is not in doubt in this case; it also is wholly clear, as I have earlier observed, that even now thecourt (or for that matter, the plaintiff) does not know the full story of how much money went where, when, and indeed, preciselyhow many TSE shares now actually remain to be reclaimed by the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  I appreciate, also, that there must be demonstrated to be some causal connection between the breach of trust in question and theloss to the trust estate for which compensation is recoverable: see in this regard the seminal consideration of applicable principleby the House of Lords in <i>Target Holdings v Redferns</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20AC%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 AC 421.</a> </p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  That which has provided me cause for concern, however, is how far this court should go <i>at this stage</i> in terms of truncating the usual procedural form of remedy in terms of the formal âtaking of an accountâ.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  In the Re-re-Amended Statement of Claim Mr Barlow has spread his net extremely wide in terms of remedies sought: see in particularPrayers (1), (3) and (5), all of which are predicated on the basis, which I now have found to be established, of wilful default onthe part of Mr Hall in relation to the monies deposited in the BLP trust account in London; in fact, the plea at prayer (5) of equitabledamages or restitution of at least Â£21,424,503 â which, as I understand it, is based on the premise that Mr Hall is liable tocompensate the plaintiff by providing restitution for Mr Hallâs inability to restore the trust by paying the value of that whichthe plaintiff <i>would have received</i> but for the defendantâs default; this sum apparently is comprised of the Â£9,855,942.11 which should have been generated from thesale of TSE shares to Softbank, plus the sum of Â£11,568,560 that <i>should have</i> <i>accrued</i> from the sale of the apparently remaining 1,031,066 TSE shares, even with a 15% discount to the Softbank price â which latter percentagederives from Mr McClellanâs evidence wherein Mr Hall, through his solicitors, had stated that he was negotiating with the registeredshareholders of the remaining TSE Trust Shares for them to purchase those shares at a discount of 10 to 15% of the price paid bySoftbank Corporation, namely Â£11.88 or Â£11.22 per TSE share.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  On behalf of the plaintiff, Mr Barlow argues strongly that, in the particular circumstances of this case, there is no necessityor good reason now to order the formal taking of an account, and that the like result may be achieved immediately on the basis ofthe available evidence presently before the court.</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  To the contrary, Mr Wright argued equally strongly that, as a matter of fundamental principle, <i>if</i> liability for breach of trust/fiduciary duty were be established against his client (which, he submitted, should not be the case),then the court simply cannot ride roughshod, at the plaintiffâs instigation, over the established principles/procedure relatingto the taking of an account, as set out in some detail in the provisions of Order 43, Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011.</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  This debate as to the form of appropriate remedy took place on the final morning of this trial, on 6 October 2011 (in fact, andsomewhat oddly, the issue first was raised by Mr Wright in the middle of Mr Barlowâs final submission), and I have now had theopportunity of reading the transcript of that which passed between Bench and Bar on the subject, and the opposing contentions ofcounsel in this regard.</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  In the submissions the court permitted Mr Wright ultimately to make on this point, Mr Wright stressed that, as at the date of trial,liability as such had <i>not</i> been established against his client, and he maintained that as the result his client had been prejudiced; to take but one example,in having no particulars of the allegation that his client should have purchased X shares in TSE on Y date, and at what price.  Hemade the point that whilst the plaintiff had identified the payments made from the BLP account, in accordance with the requirementsof Order 43, rule 5 RHC, no notice had been given of the items in the account which the plaintiff sought to charge.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  Mr Wright naturally accepted that <i>if and in so far</i> as his client lost on the main heads of claim, clearly the defendant would be required to provide a formal account, but that at thisstage the court simply could not âskipâ this step and behave as if this trial, in addition to generating a finding of liability,in fact <i>also</i> should constitute the taking of an account â which was precisely that which Mr Barlow now was urging the court to do, to the obviousprejudice of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  I confess that my initial reaction to this argument was less than sympathetic, but after some degree of reflection I can see themerit and fairness in Mr Wrightâs submissions on this aspect of the case, and I have decided in the circumstances not to indulge,however tempting it may be in the current unfortunate circumstances, in blithely adopting a form of âprocedural shortcuttingâ.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  The short and ineluctable point is that after hearing the evidence the court has decided, as a matter of <i>primary liability</i>, that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     a trust/fiduciary relationship has been established;</p>        <p>(b)     that to-date the defendant manifestly has failed to provide any or any true statement of account for the trust assets, whichinitially took the form of the funds transferred to the BLP account;</p>        <p>(c)     that the plaintiffâs allegations of misappropriation of such trust funds, and the diversion of those funds from their intendedand designated purpose, have been made out; and</p>        <p>(d)     that the plaintiff now must render a true and correct account, which upon the taking of such account <i>may</i> include an order that the trust be restored to the position that it would have been in absent the defendantâs dishonest and wilfulbreaches of trust.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  However, as I have said, I do not consider it appropriate now to jump the âaccount fenceâ simply because the plaintiff considersâ with perhaps understandable cause â it convenient so to do.  I do not have any idea, for example, of whether and at what priceSoftbank indeed would have bought the remaining TSE Trust shares at the discount now claimed, and/or if the entire amount of the1,777,700 shares had been offered to Softbank (which it appears in fact they were not), how many shares eventually could have beensold in light of the evidence, which is undisputed, that the Softbank purchase offer was over-subscribed.</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  I also bear in mind that Mr Barlow takes the position, understandably in these circumstances, that as the result of Mr Hallâsnon-disclosure his client is in a position to ask the court to take every available adverse inference, but it strikes me that thecourt has more power to enforce the proper taking of an account (if necessary by an order for contempt) <i>if</i> it is satisfied that consequent upon this judgment â which effectively is a judgment upon liability and not quantum â Mr Hallstill is refusing to yield up salient information as part and parcel of the due account taking process.</p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  This therefore begs the question as to the correct form of Order to be made as a consequence of this judgment, and the findingstherein.</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  In this connection I have not overlooked the fact that, <i>on the</i> <i>defendantâs own case</i>, the sum of Â£5,474,247.35 represents funds which were and are available to return to the plaintiff, and which have not been so returned,and that a total of 1,355,300 TSE shares still remain (<i>vide</i> paragraph 51 above), albeit I am bound to observe that I presently have no idea of the veracity/accuracy of this latter number.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  In the circumstances therefore, I have decided that the appropriate course, indeed the best that this court is able properly todo in the current unsatisfactory circumstances, is to make the Order in the terms particularized below.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  Accordingly, consequent upon this judgment, the order of this court is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)     That within 21 days of the date hereof the defendant do pay to the plaintiff the sum of Â£5,474,247.35, together with interestthereon compounded with quarterly rests at the rate of 2% over sterling prime rate prevailing from the date of the writ to the dateof judgment herein;</p>        <p>(ii)    That pursuant to the provisions of Order 43, RHC, the defendant do render to the plaintiff a true and proper account upona wilful default basis for the trust property, and in particular for the plaintiffâs funds as transferred on the instructions ofthe defendant from the BLP trust account and/or the beneficial entitlements to the 1,777,700 TSE Trust Shares (or such TSE sharesas may remain) as purchased with the plaintiffâs funds and/or all property now representing the trust property, including any dividendswhich have accrued on the TSE Trust Shares and/or other profits which have accrued upon the trust property;</p>        <p>(iii)   That if and in so far as monies be found to be due to the plaintiff from the defendant consequent upon the taking of suchaccount, that credit be given for the repayment (if such payment has been effected) of the aforesaid sum of Â£5,474,247.35, togetherwith interest accruing thereon;</p>        <p>(iv)   That absent agreement thereon, appropriate directions be made by a Master for the taking of such an account, and that applicationtherefor be made within 28 days of the date of judgment herein;</p>        <p>(v)    That there be an order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of these proceedings be to the plaintiff to be taxed and paid by the defendant upon a common fund basis, such orderto become absolute unless written objection thereto is made within 14 days of the date of judgment herein.</p>        <p> </p>        <p> </p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(William Stone)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Barrie Barlow SC and Mr Chan Pat Lun, instructed by Messrs Haldanes, for the plaintiff</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Colin Wright, instructed by Messrs Kennedys, for the defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text --><appeal><p>Application by the defendant for a stay of excution pending  appeal dismissed by Court of First Instance.
