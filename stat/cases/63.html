We do not consider an exhaustive discussion of those decisions essential to the disposal of this relativelystraightforward appeal.  This is not to say that we have any quarrel with any of those decisions.  Indeed we consider them helpful. Mr John Scott SC for Kensland has submitted that those decisions, or at least some of them, have put a gloss on the legislationconcerned.  As to that, we would say this.</p>    <p>Purposive construction â¦</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Statutes of limitation seek to provide potential defendants with a measure of repose.  They seek to do that without unduly curtailingthe right of would-be plaintiffs to pursue their claims.  So they always involve striking a balance between competing interests. The balance struck by way of any given limitation provision would reflect a legislative policy.  We would not rule out the possibilityof a limitation provision that is open to a constitutional challenge, for example, because it so favours defendants as to fall foulof the access to the courts clause of art.35 of the Basic Law.  But subject to that possibility, which is always remote and certainlydoes not arise in the present case, there can be no doubt as to the judiciaryâs duty when a limitation provision calls for construction. That duty is to construe such provision so as to promote its underlying legislative policy.  Construing a provision of course involvesmore than reciting its terms.  Considerably more is often needed, especially where there are substantial difficulties to be resolvedin a purposive way.  Putting a purposive construction on a provision is not to be equated with putting a gloss on it.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  There is nothing unprecedented in the idea of purposive construction aimed at promoting underlying legislative policy.  Look atwhat the Barons of the Exchequer said in Stradling v. Morgan (2 Eliz. I) 1 Plowden 199. They said (at p.205) that âthe sages ofthe law â¦ have ever been guided by the intent of the Legislature, which they have always taken according to the necessity of thematter, and according to that which is consonant to reason and good discretionâ.  The phraseology may be dated, but the idea isthere.  Then there is the statement which Chief Justice Abbott famously made in R v. Hall  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281822%29%201%20B%20%26%20C%20123" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1822) 1 B &amp; C 123</a> at p.136 when giving the judgment of the Court of Kingâs Bench.  He said that the meaning of a statutory provision âis to befound not so much in a strict etymological propriety of language, nor even in popular use, as in the subject or occasion, on whichthey are used, and the object that is intended to be attainedâ.  That statement now bears the imprimatur of the Privy Council,for Lord Romilly MR cited it with approval in The âLionâ  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281869%29%20LR%202%20PC%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1869) LR 2 PC 525</a> at p.530 in the course of delivering their Lordshipsâ advice.  </p>    <p class="heading">â¦ of statutes of limitation in particular</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  We move now from the general to the particular.  It is well-known that statutes of limitation have been described as statutes ofrepose.  That description was first made famous by Story J in Bell v. Morrison 26 US  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Pet%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1 Peters) 350</a> (1828) at p.360 when giving the judgment of the United States Supreme Court.  It has been repeated in the House of Lords (by LordSimon of Glaisdale in The Ampthill Peerage Case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%20547" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] AC 547</a> at p.575H) and in this Court (by Chief Justice Li in Wong Tak Yue v. Kung Kwok Wai No.2  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d98%29%201%20HKCFAR%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-98) 1 HKCFAR 55</a> at p.67 D-E).  What we wish to draw attention to in particular is Story Jâs statement on construction.  He said (at p.359) thatthe construction of a statute of limitation should âproceed upon principles â¦ adapted to carry into effect the real objects ofthe statuteâ.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The case of Haward v. Fawcetts   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> has been made the subject-matter of a case commentary by Ms Janet OâSullivan.  That commentary is to be found in PRFN 2006, 22(2)127.  We will not conceal our admiration for the refreshing candour of Ms OâSullivanâs observation at p.130 that âthe wordsof the statute may require some bending when dealing with cases of negligent professional adviceâ.  That is of course not to denythe desirability of legislation free from any need of such treatment.  Hence the call at the conclusion of the commentary for legislativereform.  But such reform is another day and somebody elseâs work.  Meanwhile the Court has the present case to deal with on currentlegislation.</p>    <p class="heading">Circumstances of the case</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Turning to the circumstances of the case at hand, they are shortly stated as follows.  On 13 January 2004 Kensland Realty Ltd (âKenslandâ),now the appellant, commenced an action against its former solicitors Messrs Tai Tang &amp; Chong (âTTCâ), now the respondent. The action is for damages sustained as a result of acting on legal advice tendered to Kensland by TTC, which advice Kensland complainsagainst as negligent.  In striking-out proceedings taken out by TTC, the Court of Appeal (Rogers VP and Le Pichon JA) reversed theHigh Court (Deputy Judge Gill) and dismissed Kenslandâs action as time-barred.  Kensland now appeals to this Court, seeking thereinstatement of its action.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Kensland had entered into an agreement to sell certain shop premises to a company named Whale View Investment Ltd (âWhale Viewâ). Since Kensland was selling as a confirmor, the agreement not surprisingly provided for payment of the balance of the purchase priceby such cashierâs orders or cheques in favour of such persons as Kensland may direct.  The agreement provided that completion wasto take place between 10:00 am and 1:00 pm on 2 September 1997 and that time was of the essence.  Whale View did not tender the balanceof the purchase price until six minutes after the 1:00 pm deadline.  But there was a question of whether the missing of that deadlinewas due to Kenslandâs lateness in giving Whale View a split payment direction.  Nevertheless Kensland treated the missing of the1:00 pm deadline as a repudiatory breach on Whale Viewâs part, refused to complete and forfeited Whale Viewâs deposit of $8.25million.  According to Kensland, it took that course on TCCâs advice that such a course might result in Kensland being sued byWhale View for the return of its deposit but that such a suitâs chances of success would be very low.  As it turned out, the suitsucceeded.  We will come to its details later.</p>    <p class="heading">Obviously out of time under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Where negligent advice gives rise to a cause of action, that cause of action accrues when the person who is given such advice actson it.  So the cause of action on which Kenslandâs action against TTC is based would have accrued on 2 September 1997.  As hasbeen noted, that action was commenced more than six years after that date.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> provides that an action founded on simple contract or tort shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date onwhich the cause of action accrued.  Obviously therefore Kenslandâs action against TTC is out of time under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4.</a></p>    <p class="heading">Turning to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  So the question becomes whether that action was commenced within the time allowed by the ameliorating effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.

The other was the registration of that action as a lispendens (pending action) against the shop premises concerned, which step would so deter other purchasers as to block any attemptthat Kensland might make to sell those premises to someone else.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Initially Whale Viewâs sought specific performance.  But after the property market fell, as it had by November 1997, Whale Viewsought instead the return of its deposit and damages representing the profit which it would have made if the sale and purchase hadbeen completed and it had then on-sold the shop premises within a few weeks of completion on 2 September 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Whale Viewâs action against Kensland proceeded to trial in the High Court.  It was dismissed by the High Court on 5 April 2000. The matter then went on appeal to the Court of Appeal, and that appeal succeeded.  On 23 January 2001 the Court of Appeal enteredjudgment for Whale View against Kensland in the sum of $16.25 million (made up of a returned deposit of $8.25 million and damagesof $8 million) with interest at the rate of 10.5% from the issue of the writ until the Court of Appealâs judgment and with thecosts of the action and of that appeal.  Kensland then appealed to this Court.  On 10 December 2001 this Court (by a judgment nowreported at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%204%20HKCFAR%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) 4 HKCFAR 381)</a> dismissed that appeal with costs nisi. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  By 14 November 1997 if not before, Kensland realised that the fall in the property market had resulted in the shop premises becomingworth much less than the $55 million for which it had agreed to sell and Whale View had agreed to purchase those premises.  Thatis attested by the fact that on that day Kensland sought counselâs advice on whether it could successfully reverse course so asto hold Whale View to that sale and purchase by admitting Whale Viewâs claim.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It is also to be noted that by November 1997 Kensland had already been billed for $78,300 by way of costs incurred in defendingWhale View action up to that time.</p>    <p class="heading">Knowledge</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  One sees the reference in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31(1)(a)</a> to âthe knowledge required for bringing an action in respect of the relevant damageâ.  And one sees what <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31(5)(a)</a> to (d) say as to what such knowledge means.  Mr Scott submits that Kensland did not have such knowledge until this Court gave judgmenton 10 December 2001 affirming the Court of Appealâs decision to enter judgment for Whale View.  Alternatively, Mr Scott submitsthat Kensland did not have such knowledge until, at the earliest, the Court of Appeal entered judgment for Whale View on 23 January2001.  For the reasons which we are about to state, we are unable to accept either of those submissions.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Among the decisions on s.14A of the Limitation Act 1980 which this Court was shown is that of the House of Lords in Haward v. Fawcetts(the case the subject-matter of the case commentary which we referred to earlier).  It was a case of allegedly negligent advice. The advice was that of an accountant in reliance on which the claimant had acquired a controlling interest in a company.  And theHouse of Lords was concerned with the question of knowledge in the s.14A sense on the part of the claimant.  In regard to the degreeof certainty required, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead endorsed the guidance given by Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in Halford v. Brookes <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20WLR%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 WLR 428</a> at p.443.  Doing that, Lord Nicholls said (in para.9) that âknowledge â¦ means knowing with sufficient confidence to justify embarkingon the preliminaries to the issue of a writ, such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking advice, and collectingevidenceâ.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Lord Nicholls then turned to the degree of detail required, noting that questions as to that have mostly arisen in the context ofthe need for the claimant to know that the damage was attributable in whole or in the part to the act or omission which is allegedto constitute negligence.  In para.10 he considered what had been said in Wilkinson v. Ancliff (BLT) Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20WLR%201352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 WLR 1352</a> at p.1365, Hendy v.

He concluded (in para.11) that âparaphrasing, time does not begin to run against a claimant until he knows that thereis a real possibility his damage was caused by the act or omission in questionâ.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Statutory provisions are typically expressed in general terms which are sometimes far from happily worded.  But they always haveto be applied with a view to doing practical justice in real life situations.  So they often call for construction, and the constructionthat they receive should be a purposive one.  It is in the nature of purposive construction to give practical guidance for the applicationof a statutory provision according to its true meaning and effect.  Giving such guidance is, in our view, precisely what Lord Nichollsdid in Haward v. Fawcetts.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  As to the language of our s.31 (modelled on the legislation with which the House of Lords was there concerned), one sees what subsection(5) says âknowledgeâ means.  One sees what subsection (6) says about the irrelevance of knowledge that any acts or omission involvenegligence.  And one sees what subsection (7) says about knowledge which a person might reasonably have been expected to acquire. Lord Nichollsâs approach is, we think, amply accommodated by the language of the legislation read as a whole, in context and purposively.</p>    <p class="heading">Facts known and the knowledge to which they amounted</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  By the end of November 1997 Kensland obviously knew that acting on TTCâs advice had (i) prevented it from on-selling the shoppremises quickly, (ii) exposed it to the drop in value which those premises had undergone, (iii) involved it in already considerablecosts and (iv) left it facing a substantial and triable claim.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Knowing those facts must amount at least to knowing that there was a real possibility that it had suffered damage caused by TTCâsadvice on which it had acted. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Although the agreement for sale and purchase provided for completion âbetween the hours of 10:00 am and 1:00 pmâ, the correctsplit payment direction was not given until 11:48 am.  And when it was eventually given, it was for nine cheques and complying withit involved eight cheques and two cashierâs orders.  On Kenslandâs case, the only thing which TTC warned that Whale View mightsue for was the return of its deposit.  There was no warning that TTC might sue for specific performance and damages in additionto or in lieu of specific performance.  Nor was there any warning that Whale View might register its action as a <i>lis pendens</i> against the shop premises, effectively preventing Kensland from on-selling those premises to someone else.  And, despite the latenessof the split payment direction, TTC advised that a suit by Whale View would have no more than a very low chance of success. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Those omissions were highly material in themselves.  Moreover there was another dimension to them.  As soon as it appeared thatthere was much advice that should have been given but had been omitted, it became natural to wonder about the accuracy of such adviceas had been given.  Rather like the thirteenth stroke of the clock that falsifies all that went before, the omissions called intoquestion the accuracy of the advice which had been given.  In this case the thirteenth stroke of the clock sounded loud and clearon the following day.</p>    <p class="heading">Time barred on any approach</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  By reason of the knowledge which Kensland had by the end of November 1997.  The limitation period for its action against TTC havingexpired long before Kensland commenced it on 13 January 2004, that action is plainly time-barred.  We have proceeded on the approacharticulated by Lord Nicholls in <i>Haward v. Fawcetts</i>, but would reach the same conclusion on any of the approaches to be discerned from the speeches of the other Law Lords in that case.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  For the purposes of our s.31, we would take the precaution of drawing attention to an observation which Lord Walker of Gestingthorpemade in para.56.  This is that â[t]he wide range of claims to which section 14A may extend suggests that general observations madeby the court in one type of case may not be directly apposite in a case of another typeâ.  At the same time, we would point outthat of the principles stated in Lord Nichollsâs speech, the ones which we have treated as the most significant come essentiallyfrom paras 10 and 11.  And in para.80 Lord Walker described those principles â accurately in our view â as âsettledâ.</p>    <p class="heading">Result</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In the result, we would dismiss this appeal with costs (the parties having accepted at the hearing that costs should follow theevent).</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Mr Justice Chan PJ:</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ in draft. I entirely agree with his detailed and comprehensiveanalysis of the provisions in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a> and the case law relevant to these provisions. For the reasons he has given, I agree that this appeal should be dismissedwith costs.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The purpose of having limitation provisions is to ensure on the one hand, that a defendant is not unduly vexed by stale claims tohis disadvantage particularly when the relevant evidence has been lost and the memory of the witnesses has failed; and on the otherhand, that a plaintiff is not unfairly prejudiced by a lack of knowledge of the relevant facts required to bring a claim until afterit is time barred. This is what <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> is aimed at achieving in relation to actions based on non-personal injury negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  As Mr Justice Ribeiroâs analysis amply demonstrates, the construction of that section and its application to the facts of a particularcase is by no means an easy task. The reason is that this provision (closely following the English equivalent in s.14A of the LimitationAct 1980 as amended by the Latent Damage Act 1986), to quote the words of Ms Janet OâSullivan in her helpful and enlightening article,Limitation, latent damage and solicitorsâ negligence, âwhich was enacted primarily with claims for property damage in mind andbased closely on the drafting of the parallel provisions for personal injury claims, is not easily applied to claims for economicloss arising from the alleged negligence of solicitorsâ at p.219 of Professional Negligence, Vol. 20 No. 4, 2004.  This is evidentfrom the increasing volume of jurisprudence purporting to apply this provision (or its equivalent) in professional negligence claimsin England and Australia. No doubt, the legal and other professions here would also be anxious to have some clear guidance on hows.31 operates in practice. A legislative review of the relevant statutory provisions may well be necessary in future.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Whether a plaintiff can invoke s.31 is a question of mixed law and fact. This involves an examination of a host of issues, suchas, what was the defendantâs act or omission complained of, what is the cause of action relied on, when did the cause of actionaccrue, what was the damage caused to the plaintiff, how much did the plaintiff know about these facts or ought he reasonably tohave known about these facts, would a reasonable person having such knowledge or imputed knowledge consider the damage sufficientlyserious to justify instituting proceedings for damages, when did the plaintiff first have actual or imputed knowledge of such facts,did the plaintiff know or ought he reasonably to have known that the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the defendantâsact or omission, and if so, when did he first have actual or imputed knowledge of this. Needless to say, all the circumstances ofthe case have to be considered.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Applying s.31 to the facts of this case, one cannot escape the conclusion that Kensland had acquired the necessary knowledge requiredto bring the present action at the latest by November 1997 and that the present action is clearly statute-barred. </p>    <p> </p>    <p>Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ:</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The appellant (â<u>Kensland</u>â) seeks to overturn the decision of the Court of Appeal striking out its action alleging professional negligence against the respondents,a firm of solicitors (â<u>TTC</u>â).  The action was struck out on the ground that it is statute-barred under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a> (â<u>the Ordinance</u>â). </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In the courts below, Kensland conceded that its writ had been issued after expiry of the primary limitation period of six yearsunder section 4 of the Ordinance.  However, Kensland was allowed to withdraw that concession without opposition so that on this appeal,the Court is asked to decide whether the action should be permitted to proceed on the basis either that it was started within theprimary limitation period or that the secondary limitation period provided for by section 31 of the Ordinance applies. </p>    <p class="heading">A.      The original proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The present action arises out of a property transaction which led to legal proceedings culminating in an appeal to this Court decidedin 2001.<a>[1]</a>  The course of events was as follows. </p>    <p class="heading">A.1    The underlying property transaction</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In June 1997, with TTC acting as solicitors on its behalf, Kensland agreed to purchase certain shop premises for HK$53 million andcontracted to re-sell them to a purchaser named Whale View Investment Ltd (â<u>Whale View</u>â) for HK$55 million.  The solicitors acting for Whale View were Messrs Tam, Pun and Yipp (â<u>TPY</u>â).  Deposits totalling HK$8.25 million were paid by Whale View and completion was agreed to take place on or before 2 September1997 between the hours of 10.00 am and 1.00 pm at TTCâs offices, with time made of the essence.  An important clause of the contractentitled Kensland to direct that payment should be by a specified number of cashier orders or solicitorsâ cheques in stated amounts,designed to enable Kensland to pass on appropriately denominated cheques to the head vendor.  Unless payment was made in accordancewith Kenslandâs directions (referred to in the original proceedings as the â<u>split cheque directions</u>â) Whale Viewâs payment obligations would be deemed not to have been discharged.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  It was therefore necessary for Whale View to receive the split cheque directions in good time.  However, they were not receivedfrom TTC until 11.13 am (with a correction made at 11.48 am) on 2 September 1997, that is, until rather less than two hours beforethe 1.00 pm deadline for completion.  Whale View was keen to complete its purchase since the property market was very buoyant and,as the parties later agreed, the shop premises were then worth some HK$63 million.  But despite the urgent efforts of TPY and WhaleViewâs bankers, the 1.00 pm deadline was not met: the payment instruments arrived at TTCâs offices at 1.06 pm, six minutes late.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In an affirmation filed in the present proceedings by Yvonne Yeung Han Yi (â<u>Ms Yeung</u>â), one of Kenslandâs directors, Ms Yeung states that shortly after 1.00 pm on that day, she was advised by TTC that Whale Viewâstender of payment after the deadline entitled Kensland to rescind the contract and forfeit the deposits.  She affirms that Kenslandacted on that advice.  It will be necessary later to consider more closely the exchanges between Ms Yeung, TTC and TPY surroundingthat decision.</p>    <p class="heading">A.2    The original proceedings brought by Whale View</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Whale View issued proceedings against Kensland on the very next day, 3 September 1997, claiming specific performance and alternatively,return of the deposits with damages, interest and costs.  The writ was immediately registered against the property as a lis pendens.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The original proceedings were dismissed by the trial Judge on 5 August 2000<a>[2]</a> on the basis that sufficient time had been allowed for completion.  Whale View had sued  TPY in an alternative claim for negligencein their preparation of related banking documents.  That action succeeded with damages being awarded against TPY.  However, the Judgeâsdecision was reversed by the Court of Appeal on 23 January 2001.<a>[3]</a>  It held that Kensland was in breach of an implied term and had itself repudiated the contract.  It ordered Kensland to return thedeposits and to pay damages of $8 million to Whale View with interest (agreed to run at the rate of 10.5% from 3 September 1997)and costs.  It also allowed TPYâs appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Kenslandâs appeal to this Court was dismissed on 10 December 2001, for reasons differing in some respects from those of the Courtof Appeal.  It was held that Kenslandâs provision of the split cheque directions at such a late stage constituted breach of animplied term that such directions had to allow the purchaserâs solicitors a reasonable time to comply.  Kensland was thereforenot entitled to take advantage of its own wrong by invoking the âtime of the essenceâ clause and refusing completion.  It washeld to have repudiated the contract, entitling Whale View to the relief granted by the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">B.

We are accordingly concerned only with Kenslandâs claimin tort and, for the purposes of this first argument, with the date when Kensland first incurred damage.<a>[9]</a> </p>    <p class="heading">C.1    Damage which completes the cause of action in tort</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Scott seeks to argue that no damage was suffered âuntil the Court of Appeal handed down judgment in the [original proceedings]â<a>[10]</a> and therefore that the cause of action only accrued on 23 January 2001, putting issue of the writ well within the primary limitationperiod.  In the draft Reply, there is a suggestion that damage was only incurred even later, that is, when this Court handed downits judgment on 10 December 2001.  In my judgment, neither proposition is sound and Kenslandâs argument must be rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  A cause of action in tort accrues when the damage which results from the tortious conduct is real, as distinct from minimal or negligible<a>[11]</a> and is actual, as opposed to purely contingent.<a>[12]</a>  The concept of âdamageâ is given a broad meaning.  It encompasses damage consisting of âany detriment, liability or loss capableof assessment in money terms.â<a>[13]</a>  Where economic loss is involved, it includes loss suffered âby payment of money, by transfer of property, by diminution in thevalue of an asset or by the incurring of a liability.â<a>[14]</a>  Whether damage has been incurred in any particular case is a question of fact.<a>[15]</a>  Its precise quantification may only be possible at a later date, by which time it may have become more serious, but that does notdetract from the earlier accrual of the cause of action.<a>[16]</a>  The damage must, however, be recoverable as falling within the measure of damages applicable to the defendantâs wrong in question.<a>[17]</a></p>    <p class="heading">C.2    When damage was incurred in the present case</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Applying these principles, there can be no doubt that Kenslandâs cause of action accrued on 2 September 1997.  The applicablemeasure of damages for negligence aims to put Kensland in the position that it would have occupied had there been no breach of dutyby TTC.<a>[18]</a>  Kenslandâs case is that it would have completed the sale but for TTCâs negligent advice.  If that had happened, then havingpurchased the property for HK$53 million, it would have on-sold to Whale View for HK$55 million, making a profit of HK$2 millionless transaction expenses.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Instead, acting upon TTCâs advice, it refused to complete and immediately incurred a liability in damages to Whale View, laterquantified at HK$8 million. It also incurred a liability to pay interest on that amount which, as noted above, Kensland later agreedshould run from 3 September 1997.  On that date, Kensland was made a defendant in the action brought by Whale View and began incurringlegal costs in mounting its defence and prosecuting its counterclaim.  Kensland now claims damages from TTC in the sum of HK$2,767,407.33representing accumulated legal costs.  It also found itself saddled with a property which was encumbered by the registration of alis pendens in a volatile property market, effectively rendering it unsaleable until the encumbrance was vacated.  It now claimsthat it suffered a loss of HK$17,980,000 âbetween 9 September 1997 and 19 May 1998â representing âthe diminution in value ofthe premisesâ during that period. </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Mr Scottâs argument that no loss was incurred until the handing-down of the courtsâ decisions is untenable in the light of theabovementioned facts.  Those decisions merely declared that the immediate legal consequence of Kenslandâs refusal to complete on2 September 1997 was the incurring of liability in respect of the heads of loss set out above.  Kenslandâs proceedings were thereforecommenced outside the primary limitation period and the concession made below was correct.</p>    <p class="heading">D.

The barring of the plaintiffâs claim is postponed to the extent, if any, that the secondarylimitation period expires later than the six-year primary limitation period.  However, by section 32, the potential period of postponementis subject to an overall cap of 15 years from the occurrence of the last act or omission alleged to constitute negligence (whetheror not the resultant damage has by then been incurred).</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Since the secondary limitation period allows a period of only three years from the â<u>date of knowledge</u>â, that is, the date when the plaintiff first acquired the relevant knowledge, for starting proceedings,<a>[19]</a> the section can only help a plaintiff who did not acquire such knowledge until over halfway into the six-year primary limitationperiod.  Earlier knowledge would not result in any extension of time for issuing the writ. </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The controversial provisions which have given rise to some difficulties of construction are subsections (1), (5), (6) and (7) ofsection 31, setting out the conditions for applicability of the secondary limitation period.  They must be construed in the contextof their statutory purpose.</p>    <p class="heading">D.2    The origins and purpose of section 31</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The objective of limitation periods is well known.<a>[20]</a>  A defendant who is forced to defend an action long after the events which gave rise to the plaintiffâs claim is likely to sufferinjustice.  Evidence required in his defence may no longer be available or may, over time, have diminished in cogency.  From thecourtâs point of view, such cases are much more difficult to try.  The various statutes of limitation therefore require plaintiffs,in the public interest, to pursue their claims within a reasonable time.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Limitation periods generally run from the date of accrual of the cause of action.  With the tort of negligence, as we have seen,this is when damage is incurred, âdamageâ being broadly defined as encompassing any detriment, liability or loss capable of monetaryassessment.<a>[21]</a>  The great breadth of the concept means that the consequences which immediately follow upon a defendantâs breach of duty will oftenqualify as âdamageâ so as to set time running for limitation purposes.  This is so even if such damage is imperceptible at thatstage and is not reasonably discoverable until much later â by which time the limitation period may already have expired.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Plainly, a limitation statute works an injustice if it bars a plaintiffâs claim in such circumstances.  And well-known cases ofsuch injustice have arisen.  As Lord Nicholls points out:<a>[22]</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThey were high-lighted in decisions of your Lordshipsâ House in appeals such as the pneumoconiosis case of <i>Cartledge v E Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20AC%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] AC 758</a> and the defective chimney case of <i>Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Faber &amp; Partners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 AC 1.</a>  There claimants were held to be statute-barred before they knew or could be expected to know they had suffered damage.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The legislative amendments introduced in England and Wales to remedy that injustice are now contained in the Limitation Act 1980(â<u>the Act</u>â).  The provisions presently relevant derive from those amendments which were shadowed in our Ordinance.  Section 11 of the Act,which introduced a secondary limitation period in personal injury cases, is reproduced in section 27 of the Ordinance.  And section14A of the Act, inserted by the Latent Damage Act 1986 in respect of non-personal injury negligence actions, is replicated in section31. </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The essential purpose of section 31 is therefore to redress the injustice of barring a plaintiffâs claim by limitation where thelatency of the damage incurred has deprived him of the knowledge required to bring proceedings within the primary limitation period.</p>    <p class="heading">D.3    The main features of section 31</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I will begin by mentioning three features of section 31 which appear to me to be of importance.</p>    <p class="heading">D.3a  The method of approach under section 31</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  First, section 31 provides an indication of how it should be approached from what it implicitly assumes.  It presupposes the existenceof an action for negligence brought by a plaintiff, stating in section 31(1)(a) that it relates to an âaction for damages for negligence.â<a>[23]</a>  Indeed, if there were no action being prosecuted, there would be no defendant raising a plea of limitation.  It also presupposesthat the action is brought both after the cause of action has accrued and after the primary limitation period has expired since itis only necessary to consider the section if the six-year period has gone by.  Accordingly, section 31 assumes that in applying itsprovisions, the court will be able to refer to a pleaded negligence claim, in which the plaintiff has identified the defendant whois alleged directly or vicariously to be responsible for acts or omissions said to constitute negligence and to have resulted inspecified damage.  What section 31 addresses is the question of when the plaintiff first acquired knowledge of the matters whichhe has since been able to set out in his pleadings.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Section 31 focuses on the four aspects of knowledge set out in section 31(5).  These concern knowledge about the seriousness ofthe damage incurred;<a>[24]</a> the linkage between that damage and the acts or omissions alleged to constitute negligence;<a>[25]</a> and the identity of the defendant.<a>[26]</a>  Time does not begin to run until the plaintiff acquires all four aspects of knowledge.  But since the identity of the defendantis not in issue in the present case, I will confine myself to a discussion of the first two aspects, the seriousness of the damageand its attributability dealt with in paragraphs (a) and (b). </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  It is established<a>[27]</a> that where a defendant raises a limitation defence and the plaintiff invokes the section 31 secondary limitation period, it is theplaintiff who bears the burden of proving that he did not acquire the required knowledge until a point of time within the three yearperiod immediately preceding the issue of the writ.</p>    <p class="heading">D.3b  The plaintiffâs actual and imputed knowledge are taken into account</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Secondly, the knowledge which sets time running under section 31 consists both of the plaintiffâs actual knowledge and knowledgewhich is imputed to him.  When sections 31(1)(a) and 31(5) speak of the plaintiff having knowledge of certain matters, they are naturallytaken to be referring to the plaintiffâs actual knowledge.  However, an objective standard is clearly also applicable.  Section31(7) provides that for the purposes of the section, âa personâs knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably havebeen expected to acquire (a) from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or (b) from facts ascertainable by him with the helpof appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek.â  It follows that the extended meaning given to âknowledgeâby section 31(7) is part of the definition of that word wherever it appears in section 31.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Of course, on the facts of a particular case, it may be unnecessary to resort to any concepts of imputed or constructive knowledge. If the court finds that a plaintiff had actual knowledge of the matters set out in section 31(5), it needs to go no further.  Butif a plaintiff lacked actual knowledge but could reasonably have been expected to have acquired the relevant knowledge in accordancewith the provisions of section 31(7), then such knowledge is to be imputed to him. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  I should mention one aspect of the House of Lordsâ judgment in <i>Haward v Fawcetts</i><a>[28]</a> that may at first sight appear puzzling.  Their Lordships approached their decision on the footing that it was not open to them totake into account any constructive knowledge within the meaning of section 14A(10) of the Act (the Hong Kong equivalent being section31(7)).  Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe thought this an âunusual featureâ<a>[29]</a> of the case and both Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood<a>[30]</a> and Lord Mance thought that this hampered their decision-making.  Lord Mance stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI have not found this an easy appeal to resolve on the facts, bearing in mind that all that is in issue is actual knowledge.  Thedifficulty I have found would have been unlikely to exist had the issue of constructive knowledge been squarely raised before thejudge.  The House was not invited to depart from the Court of Appealâs conclusion that it was not open to Fawcetts to assert constructiveknowledge within section 14A(10).â<a>[31]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  In my view, their Lordships should not be understood as suggesting that the <i>applicability</i> of section 31(7) (which is in terms materially identical to section 14A(10)) is somehow a matter dependent upon the attitude takenby one of the parties or indeed, by the lower court.  It is part of the statutory definition of what constitutes âthe knowledgerequired for bringing an actionâ referred to in section 31(1)(a) as elaborated upon in the subsections following and it is obviouslynot open to a party to opt out of part of a statutory definition.  A plaintiffâs invocation of the secondary limitation periodrequires the court to construe the word âknowledgeâ wherever it arises in section 31 and in doing so, it inescapably takes intoaccount what the statute, including section 31(7), says that term does and does not include.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Their Lordships should, in my opinion, be understood merely to have been expressing regret that factual issues relevant to the applicationof the equivalent of section 31(7) had not been aired.  Consequently, they reached their decision on grounds which dispensed withany need to consider imputed knowledge.  They held that Mr Hawardâs case for being allowed to rely on the secondary limitationperiod had been misdirected, the inquiry having been addressed not to knowledge of the relevant damage (the plaintiffâs loss oflarge sums invested) but to damage falling outside the proper measure of damages (the failure of the company acquired).  Accordingly,Mr Haward was held not to have properly addressed, and therefore not to have discharged, his burden.<a>[32]</a>  Nevertheless, their Lordships did indicate that even on the evidence as it stood, Mr Haward could have had imputed to him knowledgeof the relevant damage and its attributability.  Thus, Lord Nicholls commented that the disparity between the advice received andthe companyâs disastrous losses had âstared Mr Haward in the faceâ well before the relevant cut-off date.<a>[33]</a>  And Lord Mance referred to âthe obviousness of the companyâs problems from the outset in contrast with the optimism of the 1995business plan and of Fawcettsâ alleged advice and attitudeâ as supporting his decision to allow the appeal.<a>[34]</a>  Other members of the panel took a similar view.<a>[35]</a></p>    <p class="heading">D.3c  The required knowledge relates to damage, not liability</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Thirdly, section 31 is concerned with the plaintiffâs knowledge relating to the damage incurred and not with the defendantâsliability.  This is in accordance with the statutory purpose of postponing limitation in cases of latent damage.  Section 31 centreson whether the plaintiff had âthe knowledge required for bringing an action for damages <i>in respect of the relevant damage</i>â.  This is made to depend on the state of his knowledge, actual or imputed, regarding the damage incurred and its attributability,in other words, on whether the damage should in the circumstances be considered latent.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Postponement of the limitation period has nothing to do with whether the plaintiff knew that the defendantâs conduct amountedin law to negligence or that he had a good claim against the defendant.<a>[36]</a>  Thus, in laying down the standard for deciding whether the damage is known to be sufficiently serious, section 31(5)(a) posits anobjective test involving a defendant who does not dispute liability, so that negligence is hypothetically assumed.  And section 31(6)expressly provides that âknowledge that any acts or omissions did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence is irrelevant.â This is consistent with the lawâs general approach to limitation periods, dismissing a statute-barred action whether or not itwould otherwise have been a good claim.</p>    <p class="heading">D.4    Section 31(5)(a) </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Against this background, I turn to consider more closely the construction of section 31(5)(a) which materially provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn subsection (1) âthe knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damageâ means knowledgeof such facts about the damage in respect of which damages are claimed as would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such damageto consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liabilityand was able to satisfy a judgment ...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Obviously, by the time the action is commenced and the case is pleaded, the plaintiff will have considered the damage to be of asufficient magnitude to justify initiating legal proceedings.  However, the fact that the plaintiff needs to invoke the secondarylimitation period means that he has only commenced the proceedings after expiry of the primary limitation period and accordinglythat there has for some reason been a delay. </p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  A legitimate reason recognized by section 31(5)(a) as justifying postponement involves the case where the plaintiff did not commenceproceedings because he only realised the seriousness of the damage incurred at a late stage: a typical case of latent damage.  Theother paragraphs of section 31(5) identify the other matters considered legitimate reasons for delay (up to the maximum of 15 years):lack of knowledge of the linkage between the damage and the relevant acts or omissions and ignorance of the identity of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Section 31(5)(a) imposes an objective standard to judge the plaintiffâs delay from the aforesaid perspective.  It postulates areasonable personâs assessment of the facts known to the plaintiff about the damage and deems his knowledge sufficient to triggerthe secondary limitation period at the point in time when a reasonable person would have considered the damage sufficiently seriousto justify starting proceedings against a hypothetical solvent defendant who does not dispute liability.  Gaining such knowledgemay of course involve a process during which additional facts become known over time.  It is a question of fact, applying the objectivestandard, when the plaintiff should be taken to have acquired the relevant knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Section 31(5)(a) establishes a low threshold.  If a reasonable person knows that the defendant will not contest liability and willpay up, quite minor damage may be thought to justify the cost and effort of issuing a writ.  It follows that where a plaintiff becomesaware or has imputed to him knowledge of <i>some</i> actual damage, provided that it is not so trivial as to be not worth bothering about, the knowledge requirement of section 31(5)(a)is likely to be satisfied.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  In adopting this low threshold, section 31(5)(a) mirrors the rule concerning objective accrual of the cause of action in a negligenceclaim.  Thus, in <i>Cartledge v Jopling</i>,<a>[37]</a> Lord Reid held that the cause of action is complete where the injury suffered is âbeyond what can be regarded as negligibleâand Lord Evershed spoke of  âreal damage as distinct from purely minimal damage.â<a>[38]</a>  Section 31(5)(a) treats knowledge of damage with similarly slight dimensions as sufficient for the purposes of section 31(1)(a).</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  A potential source of confusion involves the different contexts in which section 31 introduces separate objective standards whichinteract with the subjective knowledge possessed by the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  As we have seen in Section D.3b above, one such objective standard, introduced by section 31(7), relates to the knowledge whichis to be imputed to the plaintiff where he might reasonably have been expected to acquire knowledge about the damage and its attributabilityfrom facts observable or ascertainable by him, with appropriate expert help if necessary. </p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  That standard obviously differs from the standard introduced by section 31(5)(a) just discussed.  The latter operates to assessthe seriousness of the damage which the plaintiff knew about or is (pursuant to section 31(7)) taken to have known about.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The distinction between these two standards was emphasised in Lord Hoffmannâs analysis of sections 14(2) and 14(3) of the Act(parallels of our sections 31(5)(a) and 31(7) in the English personal injury context) in the recent decision of the House of Lordsin <i>A v Hoare</i>.<a>[39]</a>  His Lordship stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe test for imputing knowledge in section 14(3) is by reference to what the claimant ought reasonably to have done. It asks whetherhe ought reasonably to have acquired certain knowledge from observable or ascertainable facts or to have obtained expert advice. But section 14(2) is simply a standard of seriousness applied to what the claimant knew or must be treated as having known.  Itinvolves no inquiry into what the claimant ought to have done.  A conclusion that the injury would reasonably have been consideredsufficiently serious to justify the issue of proceedings implies no finding that the claimant ought reasonably to have issued proceedings.He may have had perfectly good reasons for not doing so. It is a standard to determine one thing and one thing only, namely whetherthe injury was sufficiently serious to count as significant.â<a>[40]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  As we shall see, a third objective standard, performing yet another different function, has been introduced by the case-law.  Thatthird standard is applied to assess the quality and scope of the plaintiffâs knowledge, as discussed below.  It is important thatthe different roles played by each of these different standards be recognized and kept analytically separate.</p>    <p class="heading">D.5    Section 31(5)(b)</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Section 31(5)(b) relevantly provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn subsection (1) âthe knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damageâ means knowledgethat the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  As noted in Section D.3c above, section 31 does not concern itself with any knowledge on the plaintiffâs part concerning the defendantâsliability.  The courts have emphasised that the words âknowledge that the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the actor omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ do not invite any such discussion.  As Hoffmann LJ stated in <i>Dobbie v Medway Health Authority</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â...the words âwhich is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of dutyâ serve to identify the facts of which theplaintiff must have knowledge without implying that he should know that they constitute a breach of a rule, whether of law or someother code of behaviour.â<a>[41]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Those words indicate the method of approach discussed in Section D.3a above, pointing the court in the direction of the plaintiffâspleaded case regarding the acts or omissions alleged to constitute the defendantâs negligence. </p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Sir Thomas Bingham MR, in the <i>Dobbie</i> case, illustrated the way the equivalent of section 31(5)(b) works with the following example:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTime starts to run against the claimant when he knows that the personal injury on which he founds his claim is capable of beingattributed to something done or not done by the defendant whom he wishes to sue. This condition is not satisfied where a man knowsthat he has a disabling cough or shortness of breath but does not know that his injured condition has anything to do with his workingconditions. It is satisfied when he knows that his injured condition is capable of being attributed to his working conditions, eventhough he has no inkling that his employer may have been at fault.â<a>[42]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">D.6    Further issues</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  In most cases, the application of section 31 presents no difficulty. </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="1">        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="90%">Having identified, from the pleadings and, in so far as relevant, any other materials,<a>[43]</a> the damage and the acts or omissions from which such damage is said to have resulted, it becomes a question of fact when the plaintifffirst had actual knowledge of the damage and its level of seriousness (applying the objective standard of seriousness laid down bysection 31(5)(a)), as well as actual knowledge of the attributability of that damage to the acts or omissions in question.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="90%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="90%">If the court finds that such actual knowledge did exist as from a particular time, the secondary limitation period is deemed to commencerunning from that moment on and no further consideration of the sectionâs operation is required.

These are issues concerningthe quality and scope of the knowledge possessed by or imputed to the plaintiff.  Having gone through the process described in thepreceding paragraph, the court may arrive at the conclusion that the plaintiffâs actual or imputed knowledge was incomplete orlacking in detail or involved a significant degree of uncertainty.  Does knowledge with such characteristics qualify as knowledgewithin section 31 so as to set time running?  What tests or standards should one apply for drawing the line between knowledge whichis too uncertain or too vague and knowledge which suffices?</p>    <p class="heading">D.6a  The quality and scope of the knowledge</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  These issues stem from the immense variety of possible types of damage and their interaction with the almost limitless permutationsof conduct which may be alleged to constitute negligence.  They are issues which can arise in the context of both section 31(5)(a)and section 31(5)(b): To what degree of certainty must the plaintiff know (or be taken to know) that he has in fact suffered damageand that such damage is sufficiently serious?  How certain, complete and detailed must his knowledge (or imputed knowledge) be ofthe attributability of such damage to the acts or omissions subsequently alleged to constitute negligence?</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  One example of a case where such issues arose in the personal injury context is <i>Nash v Eli Lilly &amp; Co</i>,<a>[44]</a> which concerned wide-ranging side-effects experienced by users of a drug called âOprenâ, licensed to be used in the treatmentof arthritis.  Some plaintiffs suffered from photosensitivity and others from onycholysis, being a condition damaging to finger andtoe nails.  Some suffered from conditions said to be âto a large extent subjective, eg irritation, pain, dizziness, etc,â<a>[45]</a> with little to be seen by way of organic damage.  Yet others suffered from serious complications such as liver and kidney failure,resulting in some cases, in death.<a>[46]</a>  Plainly, it would not have been easy for some of these plaintiffs to be confident of the fact and extent of the damage sufferedor confident of attributing their particular side-effects to the drug.  There would in some cases have been difficulty in drawinga âdistinction between an expected, or accepted, side effect, and an injurious and unacceptable consequence of taking a prescribeddrug.â<a>[47]</a>  At what point is equivocal knowledge of this sort, located somewhere in a spectrum of suspicion and belief, sufficient to starttime running under section 31?  I turn to consider the solutions developed in the case-law.</p>    <p class="heading">D.6b  Where knowledge has a significant degree of uncertainty</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  It has, of course, always been acknowledged that the knowledge which triggers the secondary limitation period does not have to involvethe plaintiff knowing anything âfor certainâ.  Life seldom lends itself to such certainty and such a high standard would in practicebe likely to mean that the secondary limitation period is routinely extended to the limit of the 15 year cap under section 32.  Thus,in <i>Halford v Brookes</i>,<a>[48]</a> Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR stated (as to the degree of certainty of knowledge regarding the identity of the defendant):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe word has to be construed in the context of the purpose of the section, which is to determine a period of time within whicha plaintiff can be required to start any proceedings.  In this context âknowledgeâ clearly does not mean âknow for certainand beyond possibility of contradictionâ.  It does, however, mean âknow with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on thepreliminaries to the issue of a writ, such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking legal and other advice and collectingevidenceâ.  Suspicion, particularly if it is vague and unsupported, will indeed not be enough, but reasonable belief will normallysuffice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  <i>Halford v Brookes</i> was an unusual case.  A mother, suing as the personal representative of her daughter whom she had strong reason to believe had beenmurdered by either one or other of two defendants, could not be sure to which of these menâs actions her daughterâs death shouldbe attributed.  The court held that âattributableâ in the equivalent of our section 31(5)(b) meant âcapable of being attributedâ<a>[49]</a> and that this applied to both men who could be made defendants in the alternative, there being no need for the plaintiff to haveany greater degree of certainty to start time running.  On the strict application of the secondary limitation period, the case washeld to be time-barred since the mother had possessed the requisite knowledge at an early stage.  But as it was a personal injuryclaim, the court had, and decided to exercise, a discretion to override the limitation period and permit the action to continue.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  In <i>Nash v Eli Lilly &amp; Co</i>, the âOprenâ case, Purchas LJ proposed a standard of certainty similar to that suggested by Lord Donaldson MR:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn applying the section to the facts of these cases, we shall proceed on the basis that knowledge is a condition of mind whichimports a degree of certainty and that the degree of certainty which is appropriate for this purpose is that which, for the particularplaintiff, may reasonably be regarded as sufficient to justify embarking upon the preliminaries to the making of a claim for compensationsuch as the taking of legal or other advice.â<a>[50]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  The answer which their Lordships gave in these two cases was therefore a pragmatic one: the plaintiffâs knowledge is to be treatedas sufficient for setting time running from the moment when a reasonable person would have regarded it as certain enough âto justifyembarking upon the preliminaries to the making of a claim for compensation such as the taking of legal or other adviceâ.  He wouldthen have three years to bring preparations to a stage when a writ could be issued.  However, a reasonable person could be expectedto refrain from taking such steps while the knowledge remained too scanty or too vague or amounted only to speculation or unsubstantiatedsuspicion.  This introduces the third objective standard mentioned above.  It obviously plays a role different from the two objectivestandards previously discussed.  It is an approach which has often since been adopted.<a>[51]</a></p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  It is my respectful view that this approach involves an entirely legitimate and necessary purposive construction of section 31. That provision is centred around ascertaining when the plaintiff first had âthe knowledge required for bringing an action fordamages in respect of the relevant damageâ as stated in section 31(1)(a).  That concept is defined in subsections (5), (6) and(7).  But those definitions have been found not to be exhaustive, leaving further issues concerning the quality and scope of theknowledge possessed by or imputed to the plaintiff to be dealt with.  In seeking to address the issue concerning the degree of certaintyrequired, Lord Donaldson MR and Purchas LJ returned to the central concept of âthe knowledge required for bringing an action.â The pragmatic threshold of certainty which they adopted implements the basic statutory purpose of section 31, asking: At what pointin time did the knowledge become certain enough objectively to justify taking the first steps in the bringing of an action? </p>    <p class="heading">D.6c  Uncertainty in the context of legal liabilities</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  As noted above, one form of damage which completes the cause of action in negligence is the incurring of legal liability.  Thisraises two particular issues in relation to the certainty of knowledge. </p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  In the first place, since the incurring of such a liability is a legal construct and not in itself physically perceptible, theremay be cases where the plaintiff has no knowledge whatsoever that he has incurred such damage and only finds out when he is visitedwith some palpably detrimental consequences, such as when a demand is made by mortgagees in respect of a debt which he did not previouslyknow had been secured on the property in question.<a>[52]</a>  It was on this basis that the House of Lords in <i>Haward v Fawcetts</i> overruled <i>HF Pension Trustees v Ellison</i>,<a>[53]</a> a case where trustees of a pension scheme were wholly unaware that a reorganization and transfer of surplus monies effected underlegal advice constituted an invalid exercise of a fiduciary power which attracted potentially irrecoverable tax liabilities.<a>[54]</a> </p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  Secondly, even where a plaintiff knows that he has attracted a potential liability to a third person as a result of the acts oromissions of the defendant, uncertainty may exist as to whether such liability will ultimately crystallize in favour of that thirdperson so as to be translated into actual financial loss.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Issues of this kind are resolved by applying the pragmatic objective test referred to above.  If the potential for being made liableto the third party is real enough to lead a reasonable person to conclude that steps preliminary to the commencement of proceedingsagainst the defendant ought to be taken, the plaintiff is taken to have sufficiently certain knowledge to set time running for thepurposes of section 31.  Consistently with this approach, Lord Nicholls held that time does not begin to run against a claimant untilhe knows there is âa real possibilityâthat his damage was caused by the act or omission in question.<a>[55]</a>  And Lord Brown considered it sufficient if Mr Haward âknew that his loss <i>might well have</i> resulted from an investment made on Fawcettsâ advice.â<a>[56]</a></p>    <p class="heading">D.6d  Where knowledge is incomplete or lacking in detail</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  In the plaintiffâs pleadings, the acts or omissions alleged to constitute negligence are likely to have been particularised ina number of alternative ways aimed at covering a variety of findings that may be made at the trial.  Such particulars may have beenfashioned for various legal purposes, such as for bringing the case within a precedent favourable to the plaintiff.  They are obviouslynot intended to describe what the plaintiff actually came to know about the attributability of the damage to the defendantâs actsor omissions now said to amount to negligence.  Nor should section 31 be construed as requiring the plaintiff to have detailed knowledgeof the matters set out in such particulars before he is treated as having the knowledge required to set time running.  What mattersis the plaintiffâs knowledge of what lies at the core of the pleaded case.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  That is the principle developed in the case-law.  As Hoffmann LJ put it in <i>Broadley v Guy Clapham &amp; Co</i>:<a>[57]</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSection 14(1)(b) [the equivalent for our purposes of section 31(5)(b)] requires that one should look at the way the plaintiff putshis case, distil what he is complaining about and ask whether he had, in broad terms, knowledge of the facts on which that complaintis based.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  The requisite knowledge is not of the acts or omissions as pleaded, but knowledge of the facts constituting âthe essence of thecomplaint of negligenceâ distilled from such pleading.<a>[58]</a>  Lord Nicholls summarises some of the authorities in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âConsistently with the underlying statutory purpose, Slade LJ observed in <i>Wilkinson v Ancliff (BLT) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20WLR%201352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 WLR 1352</a>, 1365, that it is not necessary for the claimant to have knowledge sufficient to enable his legal advisers to draft a fully and comprehensivelyparticularised statement of claim.  Where the complaint is that an employee was exposed to dangerous working conditions and his employerfailed to take reasonable and proper steps to protect him it may well be sufficient to set time running if the claimant has âbroadknowledgeâ of these matters.  In the clinical negligence case of <i>Hendy v Milton Keynes Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%203%20Med%20LR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 3 Med LR 114</a>, 117-118, Blofeld J said a plaintiff may have sufficient knowledge if she appreciates âin general termsâ that her problem wascapable of being attributed to the operation, even where particular facts of what specifically went wrong or how or where preciseerror was made is not known to her.  In proceedings arising out of the manufacture and sale of the drug Opren Purchas LJ said thatwhat was required was knowledge of the âessenceâ of the act or omission to which the injury was attributable: <i>Nash v Eli Lilly &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20782" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 782</a>, 799.  In <i>Spargo v North Essex District Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20PIQR%20P235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] PIQR P235</a>, P242 Brooke LJ referred to âa broad knowledge of the essenceâ of the relevant acts or omissions ...â<a>[59]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  These formulations make the important point that the section does not require the plaintiff to have had knowledge of the full-blownpleaded facts.  But it may well be said that notions like âthe essenceâ of the complaint, âbroad knowledgeâ of the facts,an appreciation of the problem âin general termsâ and âa broad knowledge of the essenceâ are not very informative as standardsto be applied.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Once again, as Hoffmann LJ held in <i>Broadley v Guy Clapham &amp; Co</i>, a purposive construction leads to application of the pragmatic objective standard discussed above for guidance as to when the plaintiffâsknowledge should be regarded as sufficiently complete and detailed.  His Lordship stated:<a>[60]</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHow does one determine the âessenceâ of the act or omission? The purpose of s 14(1), as Lord Donaldson MR pointed out in <i>Halford v Brookes</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%203%20All%20ER%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 3 All ER 559</a> at 573,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20WLR%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 WLR 428</a> at 443 is to determine the moment at which the plaintiff knows enough to make it reasonable for him to begin to investigate whetheror not he has a case against the defendant. He then has three years in which to conduct his inquiries and, if advised that he hasa cause of action, prepare and issue his writ. Ordinarily it will suffice that he knows that the injury was caused by an act or omissionof the defendant. But there may be cases in which his knowledge of what the defendant did or did not do is so vague and general thathe cannot fairly be expected to know what he should investigate.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">D.6e  The knowledge must extend to all the essentials</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  The proposition that the plaintiff must know âthe essenceâ of the complaint has two aspects.  We have seen that it means thathe does not need to know all the pleaded details.  But it also means that he must know or be taken to know all the essential factsnecessary to constitute the claim before time starts running against him.  That is not to say that he must know he has a good claimin law.<a>[61]</a>  Such knowledge is plainly made irrelevant by section 31(6).  What it does mean is that he must be shown to have actual or imputedknowledge of all the facts which are essential to the complaint which is eventually formulated as his negligence claim.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  As Lord Mance points out, this is indicated by the language of section 31(5)(b):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTurning to the phrase âthe act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ, the word âconstituteâ is in my viewsignificant.  It indicates that the claimant must know the factual essence of what is subsequently alleged as negligence in the claim.â<a>[62]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  As Hoffmann LJ explains in <i>Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates</i>,<a>[63]</a> it would be an over-simplification to read section 31(5)(b) as merely requiring the plaintiff to have known that his damage had beencaused by an act or omission of the defendant.  That provision:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... speaks of the damage being attributable to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence.  In other words,the act or omission of which the plaintiff must have knowledge must be that which is causally relevant for the purposes of an allegationof negligence. ... He must have known the facts which can fairly be described as constituting the negligence of which he complains. It may be that knowledge of such facts will also serve to bring home to him the fact that the defendant has been negligent or atfault.  But that is not in itself a reason for saying that he need not have known them.â<a>[64]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  This passage has often been followed and was approved in <i>Haward v Fawcetts</i>.<a>[65]</a>  However, deciding what facts should be characterised as part of the essentials can give rise to difficulty.  This is illustratedby <i>Dobbie v Medway Health Authority</i>,<a>[66]</a> a case in which the plaintiff, who had detected a lump in her left breast underwent surgery, believing that this was in order tohave the growth removed and diagnostically examined.  However, upon excising the lump, the surgeon thought it appeared to be cancerousand he proceeded, without her prior consent, to perform a mastectomy.  The growth was in fact found to be benign.  On coming roundfrom the anaesthetic, the plaintiff was horrified to learn that her left breast had been removed but accepted the view of the surgeonand the nurse âthat she was very fortunate that the growth had not proved to be malignantâ.  But she was devastated by loss ofher breast and suffered not merely that physical injury but also serious psychological harm in consequence.  It was not until some15 years later that she realised, from hearing about a similar case, that the breast should not have been removed prior to a biopsy. She issued the writ a year later.  The issue was whether her state of knowledge had been such as to have triggered the secondarylimitation period long before it could save her action from being time-barred.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Sir Thomas Bingham MR held that âthe essential thrust of the case was that the breast should not have been removed until the lumphad been microscopically examined and found to be malignant.â<a>[67]</a>  On this footing he found that she had, from an early stage, knowledge of all the essentials so that the secondary limitation periodhad long expired:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe personal injury on which the plaintiff seeks to found her claim is the removal of her breast and the psychological and physicalharm which followed.  She knew of this injury within hours, days or months of the operation and she, at all times, reasonably consideredit to be significant.  She knew from the beginning that this personal injury was capable of being attributed to, or more bluntlywas the clear and direct result of, an act or omission of the health authority.  What she did not appreciate until later was thatthe health authorityâs act or omission was (arguably) negligent or blameworthy.  But her want of that knowledge did not stop timebeginning to run.â<a>[68]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  In <i>Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates</i>,<a>[69]</a> Hoffmann LJ, illustrating by reference to the <i>Dobbie</i> case the need for the plaintiff to have actual or imputed knowledge of all the essential facts which constitute the claim, emphasisedthat it would not have been enough merely to assert that she knew, as she obviously did, that her left breast had been removed. The essential additional fact which she had to know to constitute the required knowledge and to set time running was that it wasa healthy and not a cancerous breast that had been removed :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf one asks on common sense principles what Mrs Dobbie was complaining about, the answer is that the surgeon had removed a healthybreast.  It would in our view be a seriously incomplete statement of her case to say that it was simply that the surgeon had removedher breast.  This is not a matter of elaborating the detail by requiring knowledge of precisely how he had come to do the act complainedof, such as this court rejected in Broadley.  It was part of the essence of her complaint.  Nor is it requiring knowledge of faultor negligence. The courtâs emphatic rejection of such a requirement is entirely consistent with characterising the act complainedof (and of which knowledge was therefore required) as the removal of a healthy breast.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  One readily sees the necessity of requiring the plaintiff at least to know that the removed breast had not in fact harboured a cancerousgrowth and that there had been no diagnostic examination before its removal, if time was to run against her.  One can, however, alsosee the attraction of characterising the essentials of her complaint as having additionally to include the proposition that removalof a breast merely on the surgeonâs suspicion that the growth was cancerous and without a biopsy was not accepted medical practiceâ something that she did not discover until 15 years later.  However, it is understandable that such argument was rejected as shadingtoo far into a requirement for knowledge that the surgeon had acted negligently, which is territory forbidden by section 31(6). I venture to suggest that in the light of <i>A v Hoare</i>,<a>[70]</a> a similar case to <i>Dobbie</i> occurring in the future might well find the court more willing to exercise the personal injury discretion to override the limitationperiod, especially in the light of the plaintiff having been advised by the surgeon and the nurse that she had had a fortunate surgicaloutcome, thereby putting her off the scent and contributing greatly to her delay.<a>[71]</a> </p>    <p class="heading">D.7    Legal advice and section 31(7)</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  The position taken by both parties during submissions was that section 31(7), which deals with imputed or constructive knowledge,has no application to the taking of legal advice.  In my view, that is too broad and undifferentiated a proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  Two matters might be suggested in favour of excluding section 31(7)âs application to the giving of legal advice, namely:</p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="1">        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="90%">that section 31(6) provides: âKnowledge that any acts or omissions did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence is irrelevantfor the purposes of subsection (1)â; and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="90%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="90%">that section 31(7)(b) confines the imputation to knowledge which the plaintiff might reasonably have been expected to acquire âfrom<i>facts</i> ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek.â</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  To take the first of these, section 31(6) operates to make it clear that time may run against a plaintiff even though he has noidea that the acts or omissions of the defendant involved negligence as a matter of law.  It follows that it is never relevant toask whether the plaintiff knew that such acts or omissions involved negligence on the defendantâs part.  It also must follow thatit is never relevant to invoke section 31(7) with a view to establishing that the plaintiff ought to have such knowledge of the defendantâsnegligence imputed to him.  But that is the limit of section 31(6)âs impact on section 31(7).  There is nothing in section 31(6)to suggest that it operates so that the expert advice of a lawyer on topics other than the defendantâs liability to the plaintiffcan never be âappropriate expert adviceâ or advice âappropriate to act onâ within the meaning of section 31(7)(b).</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  The second matter centres on the word âfactsâ in section 31(7)(b).  A person, it might be said, goes to a lawyer for adviceon the law and not about facts.  Accordingly, one would not expect the plaintiff to acquire knowledge from facts which he has ascertainedwith the help of expert legal advice since that is not the function of such advice.  Therefore, so the argument runs, section 31(7)has no role to play in connection with legal advice.  In my view, this argument over-simplifies the nature of the advice which aclient seeks and obtains from his lawyer.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Section 31(7) might of course have no application in a situation where the plaintiff seeks advice purely on some point of law, forinstance as to whether under Hong Kong law a company can operate with only one director or whether we have the equivalent of Americananti-trust legislation.  However, it must be very rare for advice to be sought purely on a point of law.  A client does not go toa lawyer for an academic seminar but to ascertain matters of factual relevance to himself.  He may for instance wish to find out,to use commercial rather than legal terms, what his âexposureâ is or what financial consequences he faces in a particular situation:how much he might have to pay or be able to recover following a failed transaction; whether he may have difficulties realising securitytaken for a loan; or whether his insurers might refuse to indemnify him for a loss; or how much tax he has to pay; and so forth. These are all factual matters and may constitute damage which has already occurred or which may be looming in the future.  Simplybecause the lawyer, in giving the advice is likely to refer to a statutory provision or principle of the common law in support ofhis conclusions, does not eclipse the factual dimensions of the advice given which may be important in a limitation context.  Itis therefore my view that advice obtained from lawyers in such circumstances is capable of being characterised as advice about âfactsascertainable by [the plaintiff] with the help of appropriate expert adviceâ, although, as it happens, resort to such imputed knowledgeis unnecessary in the present case.</p>    <p class="heading">E.      Kenslandâs claim and the secondary limitation period</p>    <p class="heading">E.1    Kenslandâs case on knowledge</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  In Section B.1 above, the damages claimed by Kensland have been set out together with the factual basis of such claims: HK$8 millionto recover the damages Kensland was held liable to pay to Whale View; HK$2,767,407.33 to recover legal fees incurred; and HK$17,980,000to compensate for âthe diminution in value [of the premises] between 9 September 1997 and 19 May 1998â.  They are all pleadedto be attributable to the ânegligent legal advice by [TTC]â consisting of the particularised acts and omissions referred to above.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  Financial detriment of this magnitude is plainly sufficiently serious on the objective standard imported by section 31(5)(a).  Neithercan there be any doubt that insofar as Kensland knew or is taken to have known that it had incurred such damage, it must have knownor could be taken to have known that it was attributable to the advice given by TTC and acted upon by Kensland.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  So the crucial question is: When, as a matter of fact, did Kensland first have knowledge (or to the extent necessary, imputed knowledge)that it had incurred such damage?  Unless its date of knowledge fell within the three-year period immediately preceding 13 January2004 when the writ against TTC was issued, the secondary limitation period does not save the claim from being statute-barred. </p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  Kensland puts forward as its date of knowledge, 23 January 2001 which does fall within that three-year period.  That was when theCourt of Appeal handed down judgment in the original proceedings.  Kensland argues that it did not have the required knowledge untilit knew, as a result of that judgment, that the advice it had received from TTC was wrong:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... it is necessary to know that the advice was wrong, because without that knowledge, there was no knowledge of a loss and sono knowledge of the facts which constitute the cause of action.â<a>[72]</a> </p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">E.2    The facts relating to Kenslandâs actual knowledge</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  To put Kenslandâs argument in a proper context, the facts relating to its rejection of the tendered purchase monies and the eventswhich followed must be examined.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  According to Ms Yeung, shortly after payment had been tendered by Whale View at 1:06 pm on 2 September 1997 she received a phonecall from a Mr Tang of TTC who advised her that Whale View had repudiated the contract and that Kensland was entitled to rescindthe agreement and to forfeit the deposit.  She adds:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... Mr Tang said to me that if I decided to rescind the Agreement, the other side might argue that the late delivery of the chequeswas caused by [Kenslandâs] delay in giving the instructions on the split cheque arrangement.  However, he then said to me thathe thought âone and a half hourâ would be regarded as sufficient time for the preparation of the split cheques.â<a>[73]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  Ms Yeung records that when she went to Mr Tangâs office a little later that afternoon, he advised her that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... the other side might sue [Kensland] to get back the deposit.  However, he told me that the chances of their succeeding werevery low.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  Later that day, TTC received a letter from TPY (which TTC forwarded to Kensland) asking whether TTC had instructions to accept serviceof proceedings and stating:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe â¦ wish to place on record that [after a fax received at 11:12 a.m.] ... correct instructions were only given to us by telephone... at around 11:45 a.m.  You have given us effectually one hour and fifteen minutes to arrange for the issue of cashier orders forcompletion. ... Your delay in advising us the manner in which the balance of the purchase price is to be paid has left us with anunreasonably short period of time to arrange the cashier order for completion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  On the following day, Whale Viewâs writ claiming specific performance and damages was served and a <i>lis pendens</i> registered.  In the Statement of Claim which followed on 16 October 1997, Whale View pleaded an implied term that the split chequedirections should be given within a reasonable time before the deadline for completion, that the time allowed was not reasonableand that Kensland was accordingly not entitled to rescind and was liable for the relief claimed.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  On 28 October 1997, Kensland filed a Defence stating: âIf, which is not admitted, there was an implied term [to give the directionsallowing a reasonable time] the defendant says that such reasonable time is 1 hourâ.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  By mid-November 1997, the property market had collapsed and on 14 November 1997, reflecting Kenslandâs realisation that the valueof the property had fallen sharply, TTC wrote to counsel instructing him to advise on questions including the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)      Can [Kensland] bind [Whale View] to purchase the said property at the price of HK$55,000,000 if we take out a Summons(or write a letter) admitting [its] claims or submitting to judgment as claimed?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)        In such event, can [Whale View] amend ... to avoid purchasing the property if [it] takes note that the property is nowworth much less than HK$55 million? ...</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)        If [Kensland] successfully admits [Whale Viewâs] whole claim and [Whale View] accepts such admission, what is the likelyquantum of damages which [Whale View] can recover?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)        If [Whale View] withdraws its claim for specific performance, can [Kensland] successfully apply to vacate the lis pendensfrom the Land Registry?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  By this time, some HK$78,300.00 in legal costs had been incurred.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  On 19 December 1998, Kensland changed its solicitors, TTC ceasing to act, although no evidence was filed as to why this occurred.</p>    <p class="heading">E.3    What Kensland knew</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  On the foregoing facts, there can be no doubt that Kensland had actual knowledge of its having incurred serious financial damagefrom the outset and well before the start of the relevant three-year period in January 2001. </p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  The first head of damage consisted of the liability to Whale View arising upon Kenslandâs refusal to complete on 2 September 1997. Kensland knew full well on that very day that in doing so, it ran the risk of being held liable for breach of the agreement.  Thatwas what Ms Yeung was told by Mr Tang, even before Kensland decided to refuse the payment.  This is not one of those cases wherethe plaintiff contracted a liability without having any inkling that this has occurred. </p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  The risk of being held liable to Whale View was manifestly brought home to Kensland by TPYâs letter delivered later on 2 Septemberand by Whale Viewâs writ issued the next day.  The particulars of Whale Viewâs claim based on an implied term â essentiallyupheld in the Court of Appeal and in this Court â were set out in the Statement of Claim so that by 16 October 1997 Kensland knewin detail how it was at risk.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  What Mr Scottâs argument actually amounts to is the contention that Kensland was not fixed with the required knowledge becauseit did not know <i>for certain</i> that liability for breach of the agreement would be established until the court declared that such was the position.  But, as wehave seen,<a>[74]</a> knowledge as a certainty is not the standard.  Rather, applying the objective standard developed by the courts regarding certaintyof knowledge,<a>[75]</a> one must ask at what point in time the potential for being held liable to Whale View would have been regarded by a reasonable personas sufficiently real to lead him to conclude that taking steps preliminary to the commencement of proceedings against TTC would bejustified.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  It is true that on 2 September 1997, Ms Yeung was being advised by Mr Tang that the risk was low.  But on any objective assessment,the risk ought to have been seen as very significant.  The precariousness of Kenslandâs position is brought out by the plea inits Defence that a âreasonable timeâ for completion âis one hour.â  Bearing in mind that Whale View had written on 2 Septembercomplaining that 1 hour and 15 minutes had insufficiently been allowed, Kenslandâs defence rested on the slim margin of about 15minutes.  Concepts of âreasonablenessâ are obviously to some degree impressionistic and commonsense dictates that no one couldbe confident in drawing such a fine line to separate what would, from what would not, constitute a âreasonable timeâ in thiscontext. </p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  Moreover, whatever confidence might have been exuded in the advice received on 2 September, it is clear from the letter to counseldated 14 November that, at least by then, Kensland fully appreciated that if it lost or admitted the other sideâs case, an awardof damages would be faced and was seeking advice as to its likely quantum.  Additionally, the possibility that the advice receivedmay have been wrong and that the advising solicitors may have been negligent must have occurred to Kensland when they saw Whale Viewjoining TPY as alternative defendants in their writ.  There can accordingly be no doubt that, so far as damage in the form of liabilityto Whale View was concerned, Kenslandâs actual awareness was at an ample level of certainty and detail to qualify as knowledgewithin section 31.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  Furthermore, as we have seen, Kenslandâs case is not merely that it had suffered damage in the form of such liability.  It alsoclaims damages in respect of damage incurred by having to pay legal costs and in suffering the propertyâs fall in value.  By 15November 1997, Kensland knew that it had already incurred legal costs totalling $78,300.00 and that the property was âworth muchless than HK$55 millionâ.  There was no element of uncertainty or vagueness regarding such damage although the precise quantificationof each head of loss was something for the future.  As noted above,<a>[76]</a> the need for quantification does not detract from the earlier accrual of the cause of action.  Moreover, as previously noted, Kenslandagreed with Whale View that its liability to pay interest should date from 3 September 1997.  Additionally, in its own pleadings,Kensland crystallizes the loss in the value of the premises, presumably a matter within its own knowledge, in the sum of $17.98 millionas at 19 May 1998, a date well before the start of the relevant three-year period.  There was, in brief, nothing latent about thedamage incurred.</p>    <p class="heading">F.      Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Kensland plainly had actual knowledge about the relevant damage with a sufficient degree of certainty for section 31 purposes commencingon 2 September 1997.  The damage and actual knowledge thereof were added to in the period leading to mid-November 1997 and supplementedfurther in the period up to 19 May 1998, all well before the secondary limitation period can make any difference.  It is unnecessaryto consider any imputed knowledge.  Kenslandâs case is that the damage flowed from its acting on TTCâs advice when it refusedto complete the contract.  It obviously knew that it was acting on such advice.  It therefore knew that such damage was attributableto TTCâs acts and omissions representing the advice tendered.  Kenslandâs claim is accordingly, in my view, statute-barred andthe appeal must be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  I would finally add that where a plaintiffâs reliance on section 31 is sought to be challenged in advance of the trial, this shouldgenerally be by trial of a preliminary issue so that all relevant evidence can be adduced and tested.  As it happens, the materialsavailable to the court in the present case were sufficient to allow the claim to be struck out in the exercise of the courtâs inherentjurisdiction.  However, even then, certain issues of possibly relevant fact were unresolved, such as why Kensland changed solicitorsin December 1998 and on what basis the value of the property was said to have dropped by HK$17.98 million as at 19 May 1998.  Issuessuch as these ought to be investigated, with oral evidence if necessary, on the trial of a preliminary issue.  If the facts had beenless unequivocal, adoption of the striking-out procedure would have involved a waste of time and costs since an arguable questionof whether Kenslandâs case was time-barred would have had to be examined afresh at the trial.</p>    <p class="heading">Mr Justice McHugh NPJ:</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  Kensland Realty Limited (in compulsory liquidation) (âKenslandâ) appeals against an order of the Court of Appeal which orderedthat Kenslandâs action for damages for negligence against Tai, Tang &amp; Chong (âTTCâ), the respondent be dismissed.  Thefirst question in the appeal is whether Kenslandâs action was commenced outside the six-year limitation period mandated by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ)?  If it was, two further questions arise.  First, when did Kensland know such facts about its damageas would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify instituting proceedings? Second, when did it know that that damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitutenegligence on the part of TTC?  If Kensland first obtained knowledge of either of these two matters within three years of commencingits action against TTC, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> of the Ordinance entitled it to bring the action, despite the action otherwise being barred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  In my opinion, Kenslandâs claim against TTC was barred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the Ordinance, and it was not entitled to the benefit of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> of the Ordinance because, over three years before it commenced its action, it knew facts about its damage that would lead a reasonableperson to conclude that the damage was sufficiently serious to institute proceedings against TTC and knew that that damage was attributableto the acts or omissions of TTC that it alleges constitute negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">The material facts</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  TTC were Kenslandâs former solicitors who had advised Kensland on 2 September 1997 that it could lawfully terminate a contractfor the sale of premises on the ground that the purchaser of the premises had tendered payment of the sale price after the expirationof the time for completion.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  In June 1997, Kensland, which had agreed to buy shop premises from Delight Holdings Limited for HK$53 million, agreed to sell thepremises to Whale View Investment Ltd (âWhale Viewâ) for HK$55 million.  The contract with Whale View had to be completed by1 pm on 2 September 1997 at the offices of TTC.  Under the contract, Kensland was entitled to direct how the balance of the purchaseprice was to be paid, and Whale Viewâs obligation to pay that balance was not discharged unless payment was made in the mannerstipulated.  On three occasions â the last on the morning of 2 September 1997, Whale Viewâs solicitors asked TTC for the breakdownof the cheques and the persons in whose favour they should be drawn.  TTC did not answer any of the requests until 11:13 am on 2September.  And it was not until 11:48 am that Whale Viewâs solicitors were finally informed of the correct amounts to be paidto various parties.  In all, eight cheques and two cashierâs orders were required to be drawn and paid.  Realising that they wouldnot meet the 1:00 pm deadline, the solicitors for Whale View asked TTC for an extension of time to complete, but TTC, after sayingthat it would seek instructions, did not contact the solicitors for Whale View before 1:00 pm.  In the result, the solicitors forWhale View did not arrive with the required cheques and cashierâs orders until 1:06 pm.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  According to para.15 of Kenslandâs Statement of Claim in the present action, TTC spoke to a director of Kensland shortly afterthis time and informed her that Whale Viewâs solicitors had failed to complete the purchase in time and that this constituted abreach of a material term of the agreement.  TTC advised her that, because Whale View had repudiated the contract, Kensland was entitledto rescind the contract and forfeit the deposit.  TTC also informed her that Whale View might challenge the rescission and seek thereturn of the deposit but its chance of succeeding in an action for these purposes was very low.  Relying on this advice, Kenslandterminated the contract.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  On the following day, Whale View commenced proceedings against Kensland in which it claimed that the rescission was invalid, thatthe Court should order specific performance of the contract of sale and that the Court should assess its damages.  It registeredthe writ as a lis pendens against the property.  Kensland was kept fully informed of the progress of the action and the allegationsmade in Whale Views pleading and the terms of Kenslandâs Defence to the action.  By November 1997 Kensland had been invoiced forHK$78,300 for the costs of defending the action brought by Whale View.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  On 14 November 1997, Kensland instructed TTC to admit Whale Viewâs claims.  It also sought counselâs advice on the possibilityof admitting those claims and requiring Whale View to complete the purchase.  This turnaround was motivated by the fact that âtheproperty is now worth much less than HK$55 millionâ.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  The trial of the action came before Deputy High Court Judge Gill who held that Whale View had repudiated the contract and that Kenslandwas entitled to damages.  However, on 23 January 2001, the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against these findings and held thatit was Kensland who had repudiated the contract.  It ordered Kensland to repay the deposit of HK$8.25 million and damages of HK$8million together with interest at the rate of 10.5% from 3 September 1997.  On 10 December 2001, this Court upheld the orders ofthe Court of Appeal but for different reasons.  It held that, in the absence of an express clause to the contrary, where a contractfor sale contains a clause empowering the vendor to give a direction concerning the manner of payment, there is an implied term arisingfrom business efficacy to the effect that, if a direction is given, it will allow the purchaser a reasonable time to do what hasto be done to comply with the direction prior to the time for completion.  This Court held that the direction given at 11:13 am didnot allow Whale View reasonable time to complete by 1:00 pm.  Accordingly, Kensland had breached the implied term.  Furthermore,because a party to a contract cannot take advantage of its own breach and because Kenslandâs breach was the direct cause of WhaleViewâs failure to complete in time, Kensland could not treat that failure as a ground for terminating the contract.  To the contrary,Kenslandâs failure to accept the tender at 1:06 pm was itself a repudiatory breach of the contract entitling Whale View to damages.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  Over two years after this Courtâs decision and almost three years after the Court of Appealâs decision, on 13 January 2004 theliquidators of Kensland commenced an action for damages and interest thereon against TTC for negligent advice.  Paragraph 19 of theStatement of Claim alleged that as a result of TTCâs negligent handling of Kenslandâs affairs, it âhas suffered damagesâ. Paragraph 21 gave âthe particulars as to damages suffered by Kensland as the result of TTCâs negligent handling and advice concerningthe sale and purchase of the propertyâ: (1) HK$8 million, payable âas damages pursuant to the judgment of the Court of FinalAppealâ; (2) HK$2,767,407.33, âpaid by Kensland as legal feesâ; and (3) HK$17,980,000, âbeing the diminution in value ofthe property following the non-completion of the saleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  Paragraph 20 of the Statement of Claim pleaded six particulars of negligence.  The first alleged that âTTC, for no good reason,failed to provide the instructions to [Whale View] within a reasonable timeâ.  The second and third particulars alleged that TTCwrongly advised Kensland that Whale Viewâs late tender constituted a repudiation of the agreement and that instructions were givenwithin sufficient time for the preparation of the cheques and cashierâs orders.  The fourth particular alleged that TTC failedproperly to review and consider the agreement, failed properly to advise on the basis thereof and in particular failed to advisethat in law Kensland would not be entitled to take advantage of its own breach of the implied term.  The fifth particular allegedthat TTC failed to advise that, if Kenslandâs delay in completion was due to its default, it would not be entitled to treat theagreement as repudiated.  The sixth particular alleges that TTC failed generally to inform Kensland of the impact of the late instructionsin the circumstances and failed to point out and advise fully of the risks involved in refusing to complete and of the very realrisk of having to compensate Whale View.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  On 26 May 2005, TTC issued a summons under RHC O.18 r.19 for an Order that the Statement of Claim be struck out on the ground thatit was frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.  By a subsequent order, the parties were given leaveto file and serve evidence in support of or opposition to the Orders sought.  At first instance, Deputy High Court Judge Gill dismissedthe Summons by TTC, but the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by TTC and ordered that the action brought by Kensland be dismissed. Subsequently, this Court by a determination of the appeal committee gave leave to appeal against the order of the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">The application to strike out</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  An order striking out a Statement of Claim, which is based on a limitation defence, can only be sustained if that defence is âmanifestlyand immediately destructive of the Plaintiffâs claimâ: <i>Ronex Properties v.

However, once a limitation defence is raised, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove that the cause of action reliedupon accrued within the limitation period.  In form, a limitation defence appears to be a defence of confession and avoidance.  Ifit were, the onus of proof would lie on the party raising it.  Indeed, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria has decidedthat, where the action concerns the occurrence of latent damage, the onus is on the defendant to plead and prove that the cause ofaction fell outside the period specified in the statute of limitations: <i>Pullen &amp; Another v.

Moreover, the damage must be damage in a âreal and substantial senseâ: Bank of East Asia v.

In the usual case of an action based on the negligent advice of a solicitor, the cause of action arises whenthe advice is acted upon: Forster v. Outred &amp; Co.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20WLR%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 WLR 86</a>; D W Moore &amp; Co. v.

It argued that the outcome of its action in acting on the adviceof TTC was unpredictable and that it suffered no damage before the decision of the Court of Appeal on 23 January 2001.  Only then,so Kensland argued, could it or anyone else know that it had suffered damage.  Until then, its liability to pay damages was contingent,not actual.  Kensland sought to reinforce the argument by pointing out that it had succeeded at first instance in the High Court. Hence, so Kensland argued, its damage had not occurred earlier than 23 January 2001.  Consequently, it contended that it could havecommenced the present action at any time before 23 January 2007, and the present action, which was commenced on 13 January 2004,was well within the six-year limitation period specified by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  In the courts below, Kensland conceded that it suffered damage and its cause of action arose in September 1997 when it acted onthe advice of TTC in refusing to accept the late tender of payment by Whale View.  In this Court, however, it sought to withdrawthe concession.  TTC did not oppose the withdrawal provided that it could rely on an affidavit whose tender had been rejected byDeputy High Court Judge Gill because of the concession.  Kensland did not oppose TTC tendering and relying on the affidavit in question. Because that is so and the question is one of law on undisputed facts, it is a proper case for the Court to exercise its discretionand allow Kensland to withdraw its concession, despite the disadvantage of not having the benefit of the judgments of the courtsbelow on the point: Adams (Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (Victoria)) v. Chas. S. Watson Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR 545</a> at 548.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  In my opinion, however, the concession made by Kensland in the courts below was correct.  A plaintiff suffers damage when that personincurs a liability to pay damages, and that is so even though the quantification of the damage is not then ascertainable: WardleyAustralia Ltd v. State of Western Australia  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a> at 536 per Brennan J cited with approval by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in Nykredit Mortgage Bank Plc v. Edward Erdman Group Ltd(No.2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201627" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 1627</a> at 1634 and by Lord Hoffmann in Law Society v.

Thus, when a defendantâs negligent breach of a duty of care causes physical harm to the plaintiff or the plaintiffâsproperty, the defendant incurs a liability to pay damages from that moment.  The time for bringing the plaintiffâs action runsfrom the moment that the plaintiff suffers damage.  That the damage cannot be quantified, or is not known, at that moment is notrelevant.  If the plaintiff acquires a benefit at the same time as acquiring the liability, however, it may not be possible to determinewhether the plaintiff has suffered damage until an adverse balance is struck between the benefit and the burden of the liability:Wardley Australia Ltd v. State of Western Australia  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a> at 536 per Brennan J.  Similarly, if the damages are not payable until the happening of a further event, the plaintiffâs liabilityis contingent only and damage is not sustained until the event occurs: Wardley Australia Ltd v. State of Western Australia.  Personalguarantees are cases that usually fall within this category.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Paragraph 21 of Kenslandâs Statement of Claim sets out three heads of damage that it incurred as the result of TTCâs breachof duty.  They were the liability to pay the damages that Whale View ultimately received â HK$8 million, the loss that it sufferedin the diminution of the value of the property following non-completion of the sale â HK$17,980,000 and the consequential lossof legal fees incurred â HK$2,767,407.33.  In acting upon the advice of TTC, Kensland did not obtain any benefit from Whale Viewor TTC.  So no question of balancing benefit and burden arises.  It is true that both the fact of its liability and the quantificationof that liability had to await a judicial determination.  But once that determination was made, both the liability and its quantificationwere fixed as from the date when Kensland acted upon the advice of TTC â 2 September 1997.  Whale View was entitled to damagesand interest thereon as from that date, and Kenslandâs damage was incurred as at that date.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>   In contending that it had suffered no damage before the Court of Appeal gave its decision, Kensland sought to rely on the decisionof the High Court of Australia in Wardley Australia Ltd v. State of Western Australia  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514.</a>  In <i>Wardley</i>, the High Court unanimously held that a claimant who had been induced by misleading conduct to give an indemnity did not suffer damageuntil it was called on to meet the indemnity.  The Court rejected the argument that the indemnifier suffered damage on entering intothe indemnity agreement.  However in <i>Wardley</i>, the indemnifier did not, and could not suffer, damage until it was called on to make good the indemnity.  Until that time, its liabilityto pay damages was contingent only because it might never be called on to indemnify the party indemnified.  The principle of thatcase has no application to a case such as the present where the determination of liability and damages is dependent upon a judicialdecision.  Judicial decisions determine the rights and liabilities of parties as at the date when the facts giving rise to thoserights and liabilities arose.  If the contrary were true, no defence under limitation statutes could succeed.  Nor is there any validanalogy between the situation in <i>Wardley</i> and the present case.  The rights and liabilities of Whale View and Kensland were not fixed as at the date of the Court of Appealâsdecision or the date when this Court affirmed that decision.  The Court of Appeal and this Court declared the rights and liabilitiesof Kensland and Whale View as they existed as at 2 September 1997, not January 2001 or December 2001.  Neither the liability northe damage suffered by Kensland arose on the handing down of those decisions which merely declared the pre-existing rights and liabilitiesof the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  Accordingly, Kenslandâs damage was suffered on 2 September 1997.  As from that date, it had a liability to pay damages and interestthereon to Whale View.  It was liable to pay nominal damages for its breach of contract as at that date even if Whale View had notsuffered any actual damage.  The damage flowing from that breach increased as time passed and eventually included the three headsof damage to which I have referred.  However, for the purposes of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the Ordinance, Kensland suffered its damage on 2 September 1997, the date on which Whale Viewâs cause of action for damagesarose.  The present action, having been commenced more than six years after 2 September 1997, is therefore barred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> of the Ordinance unless the case falls within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.31</a> of that Ordinance.</p>    <p class="heading">(b)     <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 31</a></p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  Section 31 of the Ordinance ameliorates the stringency of the operation of s.4.

Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20AC%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] AC 758</a>, the United Kingdom Parliament enacted the Limitation Act 1963, whose meaning gave rise to controversy with various courts and judgesinterpreting it differently.  In 1975, Parliament made a second attempt to cure the injustice that arose from <i>Cartledge</i>.  To overcome the perceived ambiguities in the 1963 legislation, it enacted what later became s.14 of Limitation Act 1980, whichwas a consolidation Act.  As will appear, decisions on s.14 of that Act have been influential in interpreting s.14A.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  However s.14 was also deficient.  It applied only to actions for damages consisting of or including personal injuries or death. It did not apply to actions for latent damage to property.  Consequently, in Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v. Oscar Faber &amp;Partners  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 AC 1</a>, the House of Lords held that, because the plaintiff suffered damage when cracks first occurred in the chimney of its factory eventhough the plaintiff did not discover the damage until seven years later, the plaintiffâs action was commenced after the expirationof the limitation period.  Accordingly the House held that the action was statute barred.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  To overcome the injustice that the decision in Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd exposed, the Parliament enacted the Latent DamageAct 1986 (UK) which inserted s.14A in the Limitation Act 1980.  Although there are differences both in form and verbiage betweens.14A and s.31 of the Ordinance, these differences are not material.  Consequently, decisions of the United Kingdom courts on s.14Awould normally be persuasive authorities on the meaning of s.31 of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  As often happens with a much litigated section, however, the United Kingdom courts now tend to apply the judicial exposition ofs.14A rather than its words.  Unfortunately, as I see it, the judicial exposition in the United Kingdom has so far not been notablysuccessful.  This Court is not bound by judicial expositions by Courts in other jurisdictions, no matter how eminent is the statureof those Courts.  That reminder is particularly important when the issue concerns the meaning of a statute.  It is the text of theenactment, not the judicial expositions on similar statutes in other jurisdictions, that is binding.  My preference would be to disregardthe dicta with which the equivalents of s.31 have become encrusted, except in so far as they are helpful in applying it in particularcircumstances, and apply what is to me, at least, the reasonably clear intention of the legislative text.  I would have preferredthis Court to develop its own jurisprudence on s.31.  However, the parties conducted their cases within the framework of the judicialexposition of the equivalents of s.31.  Because that is so, it would not be proper on this occasion to look at the section, strippedclean of the judicial exposition on the statutory equivalents of s.31 in the United Kingdom. </p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  However, it does not follow that this Court should automatically apply the United Kingdom decisions.  Judges develop the commonlaw and interpret statutes against a background of the social, moral, economic and political values and assumptions of the societiesin which they work.  Inevitably, these values and assumptions influence the development of the common law and the interpretationof legislative texts.  But the values and assumptions of societies are not necessarily the same.  This is the reason why the courtsof former United Kingdom colonies have legitimately developed the common law of their countries so that it no longer retains itsunity with the common law of the United Kingdom: Invercargill City Council v. Hamlin  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20624" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 624</a> at 640 â 644 per Lord Lloyd of Berwick.  It is also the reason that identical legislative texts may legitimately have differentinterpretations in different countries even in those countries that have inherited the rule of law and their legal systems from theUnited Kingdom: Geelong Harbor Trust Commissioners v. Gibbs Bright &amp; Co.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20810" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 810</a> at 818 â 820 per Lord Diplock.</p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  In interpreting s.14 and s.14A of the Limitation Act 1980 (UK), the United Kingdom courts have given those sections a restrictedmeaning with the result, as the great majority of the leading cases show, plaintiffs have difficulty in obtaining the benefit ofthose sections.  Whether or not these restrictive interpretations reflect an underlying assumption that justice requires that defendantsshould not have to litigate stale claims, as may well be the case, it does not follow that this Court should slavishly follow thereasoning and dicta in the United Kingdom cases.  Despite the parameters in which the parties litigated this case, the rational developmentof s.31 of the Ordinance requires this Court to depart from the reasoning and dicta of those cases when it is persuaded that theirreasoning and dicta cannot be justified by the legislative text of s.31.</p>    <p class="heading">(d)     The construction of s.31</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  As the opening words of s.31 show, neither that section nor its UK counterpart is confined to cases of physical injury or physicaldamage.  Cases of pure economic loss also attract the application of the section.  In Haward v. Fawcetts  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> at 698, however, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe warned that the âwide range of claims to which section 14A may extend suggests thatgeneral observations made by the court in one type of case may not be directly apposite in a case of another typeâ.  Although,as reported cases on s.14A in the United Kingdom show, the section is sometimes difficult to apply in cases of physical injury orproperty damage, it is usually harder to apply in cases of economic loss.  This is especially so when the provisions of s.31(5)(a)and (b) have to be applied to cases of economic loss resulting from a solicitorâs negligence, as in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  Section 31(5)(a) is readily understandable and often easy of application when it has to be applied to the paradigm case of latentdamage to property.  In that case, it usually poses no difficulty to determine whether the plaintiffâs knowledge of âfacts aboutthe damageâ would lead a reasonable person to consider the damage sufficiently serious to institute proceedings against a defendantwho would not dispute liability.  If the plaintiff knew that a chimney had cracks and also had constructive knowledge from âfactsascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert adviceâ, s.31(7), that the chimney was liable to collapse, it is a simplematter of judgment as to whether a reasonable person would think those facts âsufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedingsâ. Cases of latent physical injury may sometimes be more difficult of decision, but s.31(5)(a) also readily applies to them.  The difficultcases are those of pure economic loss where the loss results from acting on professional advice.  In cases concerning the professionaladvice of solicitors in particular, s.31(7) often does not have the scope for the operation that it has in other situations: seeOâSullivan, Limitation, latent damage and solicitorâs negligence  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=20%20PN%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">20 PN 218</a> at 219, 225.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  The chief reason for this is that, in solicitorsâ negligence cases, often there are no facts about the damage in any sense meaningfulto a non-lawyer.  It is legal advice or the lack of it in conjunction with facts in their ordinary sense that brings about the plaintiffâsdamage in many cases concerned with a solicitorâs negligence.  Without legal advice, facts â such as the contents of a documentâ may have no significance for the lay plaintiff.  For example, a plaintiff who suffers damage because she executed a mortgagedocument with an âall moneysâ clause in it may have no idea that she has suffered damage until she learns either from legal adviceor the enforcement of the mortgage that she has suffered damage.  And in such cases, it is the solicitorâs failure to give suchadvice that constitutes the case against him.  It is unrealistic to conclude that, because a plaintiff had read or ought to haveread the mortgage, that person knew the facts about the damage that he or she has suffered.  As Janet OâSullivan points out inLimitation, latent damage and solicitorâs negligence  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=20%20PN%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">20 PN 218</a> at 225:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[I]n cases of solicitorâs negligence it is impossible to retain this sharp division between the facts and the law.  At its simplest,the claimantâs case may be that he suffered damage as a result of incorrect advice about the law: he cannot know he has suffereddamage unless he knows that the legal advice was incorrect.  Or the claimant may have read a particular document revealing that hehas suffered damage (and thus have knowledge of its contents), but may not have appreciated its meaning or its legal significance,primarily because his solicitor has not taken care to explain it to him.  Or a solicitor may fail to give advice in circumstancesin which the claimant, quite reasonably, does not appreciate that the solicitor owed her any duty of care at all.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In a nutshell, the problem once again is that the âthe fact v lawâ distinction was first enacted to solve a personal injury issue,more particularly the problem of claimants suffering from asbestos related industrial disease, who knew the facts of their injuryand that it had been caused by their working conditions, but had not been advised that they had a cause of action against their employer. This wording was adopted wholesale for cases other than personal injury in the Latent Damage Act 1986, with no mention or discussionof it in the proceeding Law Reform Committee Report, and is, it will be suggested, wholly ill-suited to cases of solicitorâs negligence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  But even if the fact v law distinction is glossed over, there are other problems.  The âfacts about the damageâ in pure economicloss cases are often not observable or ascertainable by the plaintiff and, because it is often reasonable for the plaintiff to relyon the advice of the solicitor, it cannot be said that the plaintiff âmight reasonably have been expected to acquireâ knowledgeof facts âwith the help of appropriate expert adviceâ even if legal opinions and predictions concerning legal or curial eventsare treated as âfactsâ. Because of the reliance factor, it is also often difficult to determine whether the plaintiff had knowledgeâthat the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ.</p>    <p class="heading">The United Kingdom decisions</p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  The similarities in the terms and purpose of s.14 and s.14A are such that the United Kingdom case law on s.14 assists in consideringthe meaning of the comparable or identical terms in s.14A.  Indeed, the speeches in the House of Lords in the leading case of <i>Haward v. Fawcetts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> â a s.14A case â are replete with references to the case law on s.14.  Because of the high similarity in the language of s.14Aand s.31 of the Ordinance, the United Kingdom cases do give guidance on the meaning and application of s.31.  But, as appears below,there are arguable difficulties in reconciling the judicial interpretation of the term âknowledgeâ with the text of the UnitedKingdom equivalents of s.31.</p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  In <i>Halford v.

In <i>Broadley v. Guy Clapham &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%204%20All%20ER%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 4 All ER 439</a> at 449, Hoffmann LJ agreed that this was the purpose of the section.  And, in my view, it is also the purpose of s.14A and s.31 ofthe Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  As s.31(1) shows, the section is concerned with âthe earliest date on which the plaintiff â¦ had both â¦ the knowledge requiredfor bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage; and â¦ a right to bring such an actionâ.  In the presentcase, it is common ground that Kensland had a right to bring the action.  What is in dispute is whether it had the requisite knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  The âknowledge required for bringing an actionâ means knowledge of the four matters specified in s.31(5).  Time does not beginto run against the plaintiff for the purposes of the section unless that person had knowledge of those four matters: <i>Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 1234</a> at 1247 per Steyn LJ.  If the plaintiff can establish that he or she did not have knowledge concerning any one of these matters untila date within three years of the commencement of his action in cases where the cause of action accrued more than six years beforethe action was commenced, the plaintiff obtains the benefit of s.31(4)(b).  The legal onus is on the plaintiff to prove that he orshe did not have knowledge of one or more of the matters in s.31(5) until a date within the three-year period in such cases.  Forensically,however, the defendant will seek to show the opposite for the purpose of rebutting the plaintiffâs claim or, if possible, to establishpositively that the plaintiff knew of each of the four matters more than three years before the commencement of an action that isotherwise statute barred.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  In <i>Halford v.

He then has three years in which to conduct his inquiries and,if advised that he has a cause of action, prepare and issue his writ.  Ordinarily it will suffice that he knows that the injury wascaused by an act or omission of the defendant.  But there may be cases in which his knowledge of what the defendant did or did notdo is so vague and general that he cannot fairly be expected to know what he should investigate.  He will also not have reached thestarting point if, in an unusual case like <i>Driscoll-Varley v. Parkside Health Authority</i>, he thinks he knows the acts and omissions he should investigate but in fact he is barking up the wrong tree.â (emphasis in original)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  The courts have taken a strict view of a plaintiffâs obligation to investigate.  In <i>Forbes v. Wandsworth Health Authority</i> [1997]QB 402 the plaintiff had two operations on his leg which was subsequently amputated.  Nine years later he consulted a solicitorwho obtained an expert report which indicated that the leg could have been saved but for the negligent delay in carrying out thesecond operation.  The Court of Appeal held that the claimant was fixed with constructive knowledge from about 12 to 18 months followingthe operation.  Stuart-Smith LJ said (at 412):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt seems to me that where, as here, the deceased expected, or at least hoped, that the operation would be successful and it manifestlywas not, with the result that he sustained a major injury, a reasonable man of moderate intelligence, such as the deceased, if hethought about the matter, would say that the lack of success was âeither just one of those things, a risk of the operation, orsomething may have gone wrong and there may have been a want of care; I do not know which, but if I am ever make a claim, I mustfind out.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In my judgment, any other construction would make the Act unworkable since the plaintiff could delay indefinitely before seeking expertadvice and say, as the deceased did in this case, âI had no occasion to seek it earlier.â  He would therefore be able, as ofright, to bring the action, no matter how many years had elapsed.  This is contrary to the whole purpose of the Act which is to preventdefendants being vexed by stale claims which it is no longer possible to contest.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  Nothing in s.14, s.14A of the Limitation Actor s.31 of the Ordinance expressly refers to the investigation of a plaintiffâs case. But that requirement seems the inevitable construction of s.31(7) and its UK equivalents.  The reference in that sub-section toâknowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire â¦ from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or â¦ fromfacts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seekâ necessarily impliesthat the plaintiff will be fixed with facts whose observation or ascertainment can be determined objectively when they could reasonablyhave been obtained.  And the words âwhich he might reasonably have been expected to acquireâ imply a course of investigationby the plaintiff during which the plaintiff could be expected to observe or ascertain those facts.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  But judicial statements about investigating whether the plaintiff has a claim or has a case or statements about beginning to investigateneed to be read with care.  They are relevant to the issue of constructive knowledge, not actual knowledge.  They are concerned withthe process by which the plaintiff becomes fixed with knowledge of facts that that person ought to have known.  As will appear, Ithink that three of the Law Lords in <i>Haward v. Fawcetts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> overlooked this vital distinction and led them into error.  The questions posed by s.31(5)(a) â (d) are required to be answeredby the actual knowledge of the plaintiff as supplemented by the deemed knowledge of those facts that âhe might reasonably havebeen expected to have acquiredâ.  But questions about whether the plaintiff has or might have a claim or should embark on an investigationof the claim have nothing to do with answering the questions posed by those four paragraphs.  Not only does s.31(7) exclude negligenceas an issue but s.31(5)(a) is concerned only with the extent of the damage being sufficient to institute proceedings on the hypothesisthat the defendant does not dispute his or her liability.</p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  The knowledge of a plaintiff that is relevant for the purposes of s.31 is (1) his actual knowledge concerning the matters referredto in s.31(5)(a) â (d) and (2) the deemed knowledge of those matters that âhe might reasonably have been expected to acquireâ(i) from facts observable or ascertainable by him and (ii) from facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advicewhich it was reasonable for him to seek.  The Court is then required to make a judgment as to whether the combination of actual anddeemed knowledge constitutes âknowledgeâ of those four matters.  The fact that s.31(7) requires constructive knowledge to betaken into account means that the ultimate issue of knowledge does not depend on the mental state of the plaintiff.  Knowledge forthe purpose of s.31(5) is a legal construct consisting of the plaintiffâs actual knowledge and the deemed knowledge that is imputedto that person.  Because that is so, to my mind, âknowledgeâ in s.31(5) simply means âawarenessâ or ârecognitionâ.  Indealing with each paragraph in that sub-section, the Court asks itself whether it was more likely than not that the plaintiff wasaware of or recognised the existence of the matters specified in that paragraph.</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  Properly understood, I do not think that the statements of Lord Nicholls, Lord Donaldson MR, Purchas LJ or Hoffmann LJ to whichI have referred were intended as an exhaustive description of the term âknowledgeâ in the United Kingdom equivalents of s.31(5). Rather they should be read as referring to the point in time when the plaintiff is required to find out more about bringing an action. In other words, they are directed to the s.31(7) situation; they are directed to the time when the plaintiff âmight reasonablyhave been expected to acquireâ (s.31(7)) further information about his or her case.  If their Lordships had meant that a plaintiffhad âknowledgeâ for the purpose of s.31(5)(a) â (d) as soon the plaintiff knew âenough for it to be reasonable to begin toinvestigate furtherâ, the constructive knowledge provisions of s.31(7) would seem superfluous.  It is hardly to be supposed thatthe plaintiff was to be fixed with knowledge of the facts referred to in s.31(7) before he had sufficient knowledge to require furtherinvestigation.  If that is so, the point at which the plaintiff has âknowledgeâ for the purpose of s.31(5) cannot be the pointat which it was reasonable for the plaintiff to investigate further.</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  Although a literal reading of what was said by Lord Nicholls, Lord Donaldson MR, Purchas LJ and Hoffmann LJ supports a contraryview, I do not think that their statements should be so read.  It would mean that time would run against a plaintiff not from whenhe or she had knowledge of all the matters specified in s.31(5)(a) â (d) but from the time when the plaintiff should begin to investigatewhether those matters were present and whether he or she had a valid or arguable claim.  That seems contrary to what the legislatureintended to be the case.</p>    <p class="heading">Knowledge âof such facts about the damageâ â s.31(5)(a) </p>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  The first matter to which s.31(5) refers is knowledge âof such facts about the damage in respect of which damages are claimedas would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedingsfor damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgmentâ.  This paragraph draws a distinctionbetween âthe damageâ and the âdamagesâ that are claimed.  It is knowledge of the âfacts about the damageâ that is relevantfor the purpose of this paragraph, not knowledge of the damages that the plaintiff claims in the action.  Section 31(5) also distinguishesbetween knowledge of âfacts about the damageâ in para.(a) and knowledge of âthe damageâ in para.(b).  </p>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  It seems reasonable to conclude that âfactsâ in s.31(5)(a) include not only phenomena that are perceptible by or through thesenses but also intellectual constructs such as systems, methods and expert opinions including predictions.  Whether âfacts aboutthe damageâ are âsufficiently seriousâ is a value judgment, and it is not to be supposed that the âreasonable personâ ofwhom s.31(5)(a) speaks must always make that judgment unaided by expert advice as to the seriousness of the facts concerning thatdamage.  It seems likely that s.31(7)(b), which refers to âfacts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert adviceâ,was enacted so that expert opinions that could reasonably be obtained would be considered in respect of the issues arising unders.31(5) whether the issue relates to the seriousness of damage under para.(a), attributability under para.(b) or identity under paras(c) and (d).  Much expert advice consists of opinion, and there is no reason to confine the facts of which s.31(7) speaks to thosephysical phenomena that only the expert can see or identify and relate to the plaintiff.  Section 31(5)(b), for example, raises thecausal issue whether âthe damage was attributable â¦ to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ.  Inmany cases, the issue of attributability is one on which expert opinion is required.  Again, it is not to be supposed that the legislatureintended this causal issue to be determined by reference only to the knowledge or judgment of a hypothetical reasonable person unassistedby expert opinion.  Furthermore, I see no reason to confine opinions to past or current matters or events.  In the context of theissues raised by s.31(5), there is no good reason for excluding âpredictionsâ from the concept of âfactsâ.  Suppose a plaintifflearns or could have learned from an expert: (1) that the cracking of a building was caused by defective foundations; (2) that thecracking is continuing; and (3) that the foundations are so defective that the building is likely to collapse.  It would be astonishingif the legislature intended to exclude item (3) from the âfactsâ to be considered in determining whether the facts about thedamage were sufficiently serious to justify proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a>  Speaking generally, in cases concerning physical injury or property, the only issue under s.31(5)(a) is whether what is acceptedas damage and was known to the plaintiff was sufficiently serious to justify instituting proceedings.  As s.31(6) emphasizes, questionsof whether any acts or omissions involve negligence is irrelevant to the s.31(5) issues, and s.31(5)(a) operates on the hypothesisthat the defendant does not dispute that he is liable for the damage caused.  Cases concerning economic loss, however, do raise difficultquestions as to whether the plaintiff knew that he or she had suffered damage.  Some cases of physical injury or property damagealso raise questions as to whether the plaintiff knew that he or she had suffered damage.  These cases raise the question whetherbare physical facts alone constitute the existence of damage of which the plaintiff knew or whether the existence of damage requiresan evaluation of those physical facts, an evaluation which will require either expert advice or the existence of an additional fact. The problem is illustrated by <i>Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 1234.</a></p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  In <i>Dobbie,</i> the plaintiff had had an operation to remove a lump in her breast.  Thinking that the lump was cancerous, the surgeon removed thewhole breast without having the lump pathologically tested.  In fact, the lump was benign, which the plaintiff learned shortly afterthe operation.  Fifteen years passed before the plaintiff discovered that the surgeon should have had the lump tested before removingher breast. Dismissing her appeal against a lower court finding that the claim was statute barred, Sir Thomas Bingham MR said (at1243):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âShe knew of this injury within hours, days or months of the operation and she at all times reasonably considered it to be significant. She knew from the beginning that this personal injury was capable of being attributed to, or more bluntly was the clear and directresult of, an act or omission of the health authority.  What she did not appreciate until later was that the health authorityâsact or omission was (arguably) negligent or blameworthy.  But her want of that knowledge did not stop time beginning to run.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  Beldam LJ said (at 1245):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe injury in respect of which the plaintiff claims damages is the loss of her left breast and the severe psychological symptomswhich followed.  The act or omission of the defendant on which she relies is the act of the surgeon in removing the breast and theomission to carry out a test before doing so which would have indicated that the removal of her breast was unnecessary.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Thus the plaintiff had actual knowledge as required by section 14 within a few days of the operation being performed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  The difficulty about this reasoning is that the damage that the plaintiff suffered was not the loss of her left breast, as BeldamLJ found.  If the breast had been cancerous, its removal would have caused her no damage.  No one could sensibly say that a personsuffers damage when a cancerous growth is removed.  The plaintiffâs damage was the loss of a healthy breast.  Until she learnedthat her breast should not have been removed, she did not know âthat the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the actor omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ.  The Court of Appeal subsequently recognised this in <i>Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates</i> [2001] Lloydâs Reports PN 178 where Hoffmann LJ, giving the judgment of the Court, said (at 181):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf one asks on common sense principles what Mrs Dobbie was complaining about, the answer is that the surgeon had removed a healthybreast.  It would in our view be a seriously incomplete statement of her case to say that it was simply that the surgeon had removedher breast.  This is not a matter of elaborating the detail by requiring knowledge of precisely how he had come to do the act complainedof, such as this court rejected in <i>Broadley</i>.  It was part of the essence of her complaint.  Nor is it requiring knowledge of fault or negligence.  The courtâs emphatic rejectionof such a requirement is entirely consistent with characterising the act complained of (and of which knowledge was therefore required)as the removal of a healthy breast.  But the judge [ie in the present case], as it seems to us, has read <i>Dobbie</i> to mean that knowledge that the surgeon had removed her breast would have been enough.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">If one asks what is the principle of common sense on which one would identify Mrs Dobbieâs complaint as the removal of a healthybreast rather than simply the removal of a breast, it is that the additional fact is necessary to make the act something of whichhe would <i>prima facie</i> seemed entitled to complain.  She was suspected of having a cancerous lump and if this had been the case, the removal of the breastwould not have been a matter for complaint.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  The analysis of <i>Dobbie</i> by Hoffmann LJ was directed at the United Kingdom equivalents of s.31(5)(b) âthat the damage was attributable in whole or in partto the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ.  The difficulty I have with the reasoning of the Court of Appealin explaining <i>Dobbie</i> is that it re-writes the terms of s.31(5)(b).  It substitutes the plaintiffâs complaint in a broad sense for the words âact oromission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ.  By referring to the âremoval of a healthy breastâ, the Court substituteda compound conception of s.31(5)(a) and s.31(5)(b).  I would have thought it was the failure to test the lump in her breast thatwas relevantly the âact or omissionâ and that losing a healthy breast was âthe damageâ.  Nevertheless, Lord Justice Hoffmannâsanalysis indicates that <i>Dobbie</i> was wrongly decided on para.(a) of the UK equivalents of s.31.  </p>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  In <i>Haward v.

LordNicholls said (at 687) that the essence of the claimantâs case in <i>Dobbie</i> was that âshe had suffered injury by the removal of a healthy breast, that is, her breast had been removed unnecessarily and somethinghad gone wrong.  These were the acts and omissions she alleged constituted negligence.  Under the statute, time did not begin torun until she knew of these acts or omissions.  Until she was aware of these matters she could not know her injury was attributableto themâ.  Lord Nicholls said that he agreed with the observations concerning <i>Dobbie</i> that the Court of Appeal made in <i>Hallam-Eames v.

It may be that his Lordship did not think his analysis of <i>Dobbie</i> applied to the United Kingdom equivalent of s.31(5)(a), but this seems unlikely.  In <i>Haward v.

The term âsignificantâdoes not appear in s.14A or s.31 but Lord Mance in <i>Haward v. Fawcetts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> at 717 and Chadwick LJ in <i>3M United Kingdom Plc v.

In <i>Haward</i>, Lord Mance said (at 717):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â106 â¦Subsection (6) of section 14A distinguishes two aspects of the knowledge required.  The first aspect relates to the seriousnessof the damage, the second to âthe other facts relevant to the current actionâ including in particular that such damage was attributablein whole or part to the act or omission alleged to constitute negligence and the identity of the defendant.  The seriousness of thedamage is relevant because there may be cases where, although it is known that loss has been suffered due to the negligence of anotherperson, the loss may appear for a time so minor that no one would contemplate instituting proceedings.  That is I think more likelyin the area of personal injuries and fatal accidents, covered by section 14 on which section 14A (7) - (10) were modelled, than inthe area covered by section 14A itself.  In both areas, the statutory language assumes that it is known that there has been someinjury (under section 14) or damage (under section 14A).  But this too can give rise to difficulty.  If a doctor advises that itis necessary to operate, or to remove a breast, in order to remove a malignant tumour, one would not usually speak of the patientsustaining an injury until one knew that the diagnosis was misconceived and there was no such tumour.  Similarly, if a financialadviser advises in favour of an investment, one would not describe the making of the investment itself as âdamageâ until onediscovered that it had been a bad or unsound investment from the outset.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">107.    In such cases, there is an interplay between knowledge of what would ordinarily be regarded as injury or damage and knowledgeregarding the factual circumstances in which the operation or investment occurred.  Yet, the first aspect of the knowledge requiredrelates to damage of sufficient seriousness âto justify [the claimant] instituting proceedingsâ â¦ whereas the knowledge requiredregarding the attributability of such damage to some act or omission of the defendants is, as will appear, not necessarily such knowledgeas to justify proceedings.  To maintain a coherent scheme, the better view therefore appears to be to treat the first aspect of knowledgeas relating solely to matters of quantum and all questions regarding the evaluation or classification of damage as such as fallingwithin the second aspect of the knowledge required.  This is also the view taken in the authority: see <i>Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 1234</a>, 1241 - 1242, per Sir Thomas Bingham MR.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  These passages were cited by Chadwick LJ in <i>3M United Kingdom Plc v.

One must first identify the damagebefore one can assess the quantum issue, and evaluation of facts may be necessary in determining whether damage has been suffered.</p>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  The difficulty of determining the issue of a plaintiffâs knowledge of damage in a solicitorâs negligence case is illustratedby <i>Bowie v. Southorns</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%20PNLR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] PNLR 135.</a>  It also shows that the United Kingdom courts meet this difficulty by looking at the issue of âfacts about the damageâ in verybroad terms.  In 1988, the claimant and her husband had executed a charge in favour of a bank over their matrimonial home to securethe husbandâs business debts.  Although a partner in the defendant firm of solicitors had signed an attestation clause confirmingthat he had explained the charge to the claimant, she alleged in an action brought in 2001 against that firm for negligence thathe had not done so.  She further alleged that she did not believe that the solicitor was acting for her in 1988 and, although shehad consulted solicitors and counsel in 1992 when she had unsuccessfully defended possession proceedings brought by the bank, shewas not told that she might have an action against the defendant firm.  Nelson J held that the action against the defendant firmwas statute barred.  He found (at 148) that the plaintiff knew that she had signed the legal charge over her home which secured repaymentof some of the husbandâs debts, that, when the bank commenced proceedings for possession, she knew there was a risk she might losethe home, that she thought that the solicitor acted for her husbandâs business, that he had not explained the nature of the chargeto her before she signed it, that she knew that the attestation clause was false and that she would not have signed the charge ifhe had explained what the document meant for her.  His Lordship said (at 152):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhat is required is that the claimant must have in <i>broad terms</i> knowledge of the facts on which her complaint is based.  She does not in my judgment have to know how a claim in damages might bepresented by the lawyers.  If she knows that she has suffered damage or loss <i>or potential damage or loss</i> that is sufficient â¦ Here [the plaintiff] knew that there was a risk that she might lose her home, that that risk would becomea reality if the bank succeeded in its action, and that that loss arose from her signing a legal charge which, if [the solicitor]had explained it to her properly, she would not have signed.  I am satisfied on the evidence that she had this knowledge by November1992.  She did not need expert advice in order to have that knowledge which was in my judgment sufficient to lead her to the view,after the bank had commenced possession proceedings, that she had suffered damage such as to consider it sufficiently serious tojustify the institution of proceedings.  I am further satisfied that on the facts as I have found them, she knew that the damagewas attributable in part to [the solicitorâs] failure to explain the charge to her, as but for that failure she would not haveentered into the transaction.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  Just as in <i>Dobbie</i>,âan additional factâ was necessary to convert the facts that the plaintiff knew into âdamageâ, so, in <i>Bowie v. Southorns</i>, it is difficult to see how the bare facts that Mrs Bowie knew constituted knowledge of âfacts about the damageâ unless therewas added an element of legal knowledge, an element that did not exist until 2000.  As Janet OâSullivan points out in her commenton that case (<i>Limitation, latent damage and solicitorâs negligence</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=20%20PN%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">20 PN 218</a> at 238):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âUnfortunately, justifying the result by reference to attribution in âbroad termsâ does not explain how the solicitorâs omissionto explain the charge to the claimant makes her damage attributable to the omission - unless you add that the solicitor was undera duty to her, he stands in the same position as âeveryone else in the worldâ who gave no advice about the charge!â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  However, not all cases concerning a solicitorâs negligence raise difficult questions concerning the plaintiffâs knowledge ofdamage in the context of s.31(5)(a).  In <i>3M United Kingdom Plc v. Linklaters &amp; Paines (A Firm)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%20PNLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] PNLR 543</a>, three related companies who were members of the 3M corporate group, held leases expiring in 2012.  Each lease contained a breakclause, personal to the tenant, which allowed the tenant at a price to determine the lease on one yearâs notice ending on 4 December1997.  As part of restructuring the group in 1989, the defendant solicitors drafted assignments of the leases without noticing thatthe break clause in each lease was personal to the tenant.  The loss of the right to terminate came to the knowledge of the groupâsin-house lawyer during negotiations on 30 August 1995 for an extension of the break date to 31 March 2001.  The landlord took thepoint that the option to terminate could no longer be exercised as a result of the assignments, and 3M lost the opportunity to moveits operations penalty free to new premises it had obtained.  The 3M companies did not commence their action against the solicitorsuntil 1999 but it was agreed that it should be treated as started on 1 September 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a>  The Court of Appeal held that the action was statute barred.  The Court rejected the argument that 3M did not know that it had suffereddamage before 1 September 1995 because it did not know until after that date that the landlord could and would rely on the fact thatthe option had been lost which was knowledge acquired after 1 September 1995.  Chadwick LJ said that the damage to the plaintiffwas the loss of the options when the leases were assigned in 1989.  He said (at 557) that it was impossible to contend that, becausethe landlord had agreed in principle to defer the options before 30 August 1995 when it thought that they were exercisable in 1997it could be taken as an indication that it would be willing to affirm the agreement in principle once it knew the options were notexercisable.  His Lordship said (at 557):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe true position on August 30, 1995, as the judge appreciated, was that the claimant companiesâ¦well knew what they had lostby the assignments in 1989.  And they knew that that loss was serious, unless the problem could be solved.  The hope that [the landlord]would not receive informed advice as to the strength of its position has not been advanced: there could be no basis for a suggestionthat the landlord would not be properly advised by its solicitors.  The hope that there could be a solution to the problem by negotiationwas founded on sand: there was no basis for negotiation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  The foregoing discussion shows that there are difficulties in applying s.31(5)(a) in some cases, particularly when the case concernsa solicitorâs negligence and more so when it concerns a negligent omission. There is also, as I have indicated, judicial supportfor the view that s.31(5)(a) is concerned <i>solely</i> with quantum and does not concern itself with âquestions regarding evaluation or classification of damageâ, a view which I thinkis erroneous.</p>    <p><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a>  The questions under s.31(5)(a) aided by s.31(7) then are:</p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="1">        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="90%">when did the plaintiff know enough to make it reasonable for him to begin to investigate whether or not there are other facts thatare relevant to the issues under that paragraph;</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="90%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="90%">what facts about the damage did the plaintiff actually know with or without that investigation;</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="90%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="90%">what facts about the damage should the plaintiff have known by reason of the hypothetical investigation; and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="90%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="5%"> </td>            <td width="5%" valign="top">(4)</td>            <td width="90%">would the plaintiffâs actual or constructive knowledge of  facts about the damage have led a reasonable person to consider thatthey were sufficiently serious to justify instituting proceedings against the defendant on the assumption that the defendant didnot dispute liability and would meet a resulting judgment?</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p class="heading">Section 31(5)(a) and the present case</p>    <p><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  Whatever difficulties may be present in some cases in determining whether the plaintiff had knowledge of the âfacts about thedamageâ for the purpose of s.31(5)(a), no difficulties arise in this case.  Paragraph 19 of the Statement of Claim alleged thatas a result of TTCâs negligent handling of Kenslandâs affairs, it âhas suffered damagesâ. Paragraph 21 gave âthe particularsas to damages suffered by Kensland as the result of TTCâs negligent handling and advice concerning the sale and purchase of thepropertyâ: (1) HK$8 million, payable âas damages pursuant to the judgment of the Court of Final Appealâ; (2) HK$2,767,407.33,âpaid by Kensland as legal feesâ; and (3) HK$17,980,000, âbeing the diminution in value of the property following the non-completionof the saleâ.</p>    <p><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  Kensland almost certainly did not know the quantum of this damage until the litigation against Whale View had concluded.  But itknew each of the three heads of damage that are the basis of its claim for damages no later than the end of November 1997.  It knewon 3 September 1997 that it was being sued for specific performance of the contract and for damages as the result of acting on theadvice of TTC that it could terminate the contract for the sale of the premises.  By November 1997, it had been required to pay HK$78,300to defend the action brought by Whale View.  On 14 November 1997, it sought counselâs advice on the possibility of admitting WhaleViewâs claim because âthe property is now worth much less than HK$55 millionâ.  Thus, by the end of November 1997, it kneweach of the three heads of damage that now form the basis of its action for damages against TTC, and these three heads of damageare âthe facts about the damageâ that are relevant for the purpose of s.31(5)(a).  </p>    <p><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  Kenslandâs knowledge of these heads of damage then raises the question whether they would lead a reasonable person to considerthem sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against TTC.  Section 31(5)(a) does not make time runwhen a plaintiff knows âthe damageâ; it makes it run when the plaintiff knows â<i>the facts about</i> the damageâ which would lead a reasonable person to conclude that proceeding are justified.  On this aspect of the present case,it is not even necessary to adopt the approach of Nelson J in <i>Bowie v. Southorns</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%20PNLR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] PNLR 135</a> and look at the facts about the damage in â<i>broad terms</i>â orlook at the â<i>potential damage or loss</i>â.  No later than the end of November 1997, Kensland had knowledge of the specific facts concerning the damage which is the subjectof its damages claim. </p>    <p><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  Given the hypothesis upon which s.31(5)(a) proceeds â that the defendant does not dispute its liability and is able to satisfya judgment against it â there can be no doubt that a reasonable person would have considered the facts about the damage in thiscase sufficiently serious to justify instituting proceedings by the end of November 1997.  As I have indicated, this paragraph isconcerned with quantum.  What it requires is the judgment of a reasonable person as to whether the facts about the damage are sufficientlyserious and therefore the likely amount of damages recoverable sufficiently large to justify bringing an action against a defendantwho will not be disputing that he is liable for the damage and can satisfy the judgment obtained.  Thus, the s.31(5)(a) issue inthe present case must be decided on the basis that TTC did not dispute its liability to Kensland for damages for the three headsof damage which is the basis of its damages claim.  Each of those heads of damage was substantial and exposed Kensland to a liabilityto pay large sums of money to Whale View.  To my mind, there can be no doubt that in these circumstances a reasonable person wouldregard the facts about the damage sufficiently serious to justify proceedings against a hapless defendant who cannot dispute itsliability and can satisfy the judgment against it.</p>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  Accordingly, in my opinion by the end of November 1997, Kensland had the relevant knowledge for the purpose of s. 31(5)(a).</p>    <p class="heading">Section 31(5)(b)</p>    <p><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  Section 31(5)(b) raises the issue whether, by reason of actual or constructive knowledge or both, the plaintiff knew âthat thedamage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ.  It is necessarythat the plaintiff know the act or omission that allegedly constitutes negligence, but the plaintiff does not need to know âthat,as a matter of law, such act or omission involve negligenceâ: <i>Haward v. Fawcetts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> at 719 per Lord Mance.  As I earlier indicated, this paragraph concerns âthe damageâ as opposed to para.(a)âs concern withthe âfacts about the damageâ.</p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  If one simply examined the terms of s.31 and its United Kingdom equivalents, the meaning of s.31(5)(b) would seem clear enough. By reason of the provisions of s.31(6), all that s.31(5)(b) requires is for the Court to identify the damage and the act or omissionalleged to constitute negligence and ask whether the plaintiff had knowledge that the damage was attributable to that act or omissionwithout its negligent quality.  Unfortunately, as I see it, the clear meaning of the paragraph has become encrusted with judicial<i>dicta</i> that have substituted judicial exposition for the meaning of the paragraph.  One of the best known expositions of the paragraph isfound in the judgment of Hoffmann LJ in <i>Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates</i> [2001] Lloydâs Reports PN 178 when he explained the operation of the United Kingdom equivalent of s.31(5)(b).  He said (at 181):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn other words, the act or omission of which the plaintiff must have knowledge must be that which is causally relevant for thepurposes of an allegation of negligenceâ¦ It is this idea of causal relevance which various judges of this court have tried to expressby saying the plaintiff must know the âessence of the act or omission to which the injury is attributableâ (Purchas LJ in <i>Nash v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20782" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 782</a>, 799) or âthe essential thrust of the caseâ (Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <i>Dobbie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 1238)</a> or that âone should look at the way the plaintiff puts his case, distil what he is complaining about and ask whether he had inbroad terms knowledge of the facts on which that complaint is basedâ (Hoffmann LJin <i>Broadley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%204%20Med%20L%20R%20328" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 4 Med L R 328</a>, 332).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  Lord Scott cited this passage with evident approval in <i>Haward v. Fawcetts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> at 695, as did Lord Walker at 700-701.  In the same case, Lord Nicholls cited with approval the above passage in the judgment ofHoffmann LJin <i>Broadley v. Guy Clapham &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%204%20Med%20L%20R%20328" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 4 Med L R 328</a>, 332.</p>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  The various tests to which Hoffmann LJ refers represent, with great respect to those that have formulated them, a departure fromthe statutory text.  What s.31(5)(b) and its United Kingdom equivalents require is knowledge âthat the damage was attributablein whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ.  They do not require knowledge of the âessenceof the act or omissionâ, âthe essential thrust of the caseâ or âin broad terms knowledge of the facts on which that complaintis basedâ.  They require identification of the âact or omissionâ that the plaintiff says is negligent.  And the inference tobe drawn from s.31(6) is that the âact or omissionâ must be stripped of its negligent quality.  If the plaintiff says that hewas negligently advised, the act or omission is the advising.  The issue under para.(b) then becomes when, as in <i>Haward v. Fawcetts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a>, whether the plaintiff knew that the loss of money invested (the damage) was attributable to that advising.  If the plaintiff saysthat she lost a healthy breast by reason of the surgeonâs negligent failure to test the lump to see whether it was cancerous beforeremoving it, as in <i>Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 1234</a>, the issue becomes when the plaintiff knew that the loss of her breast was attributable to not testing the lump to see whether itwas cancerous before it was removed.</p>    <p><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  Three cases illustrate the operation of para.(b) in the United Kingdom.  The first is <i>Broadley v. Guy Clapham &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%204%20All%20ER%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 4 All ER 439</a> where the plaintiff sued her solicitor for negligence in failing to commence an action for negligence against Mr Lowy, a surgeon,who had operated on her to remove a foreign body from her knee.  As a result of the operation â which took place in August 1980â the plaintiff âhad left foot dropâ.  In June 1983, she consulted the defendant who arranged for her to see another orthopaedicsurgeon who told her that the operation on her knee might have been negligent, but the solicitor did not receive a report from thatsurgeon and he did not issue a writ against Mr Lowy.  It was not until 17 August 1990 that the plaintiff issued her writ againstthe defendant for negligence.  The solicitor defended the action by asserting that, if he was negligent, it caused the plaintiffno damage because her claim against Mr Lowy was barred by theLimitation Act when the alleged negligence occurred.  Hence, as BalcombeLJ said (at 442) âthe plaintiffâs cause of action against the defendant is barred if her knowledge of her cause of action againstMr Lowy and the hospital existed before 19 August 1981â.  Strictly speaking, knowledge of a cause of action was not the issue. At first instance, Turner J found (at 442 â 444) that, by reason of the plaintiffâs actual and constructive knowledge, she knewbefore the relevant date in August 1981 all the matters to which the United Kingdom equivalent of s.31 refer.  The Court of Appealaffirmed his decision.</p>    <p><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  Hoffmann LJ said (at 449):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn this case the plaintiff knew, or could have known with the help of the medical advice reasonably obtainable, that her injuryhad been caused by damage to the nerve resulting from something which Mr Lowy had done or not done in the course of the operation. In my judgment this was all the knowledge or imputed knowledge which she needed to have.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  With respect, this decision and this reasoning seem plainly correct.  <i>Broadley</i> and the facts in <i>Forbes</i> to which I earlier referred illustrate how the operation of s.31(7) with its constructive knowledge provisions works smoothly inmost physical injury cases.</p>    <p><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  The second case is the leading case of <i>Haward v. Fawcetts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> where, on 9 December 1994, relying on the advice of Mr Austreng, a partner in a firm of accountants, the claimants acquired a controllinginterest in a company.  In addition, one of the claimants acquired the freehold of the companyâs leased premises for â¤100,000. Mr Austreng also forecast that, by investing about another â¤100,000, the company would be brought to reasonable profitabilityduring 1995.  However, although the claimants invested further substantial sums in the company in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, it failedto become profitable.  In 1998 the first claimant asked a specialist in corporate rescues to investigate the companyâs losses. On 6 December 2001 the claimants brought an action against the accountants for professional negligence.  The House of Lords unanimouslyheld that, before 6 December 1998, the claimants knew with sufficient confidence that the damage was attributable to the acts oromissions of the accountants.  That was because they knew in broad terms the facts on which their complaint was based and of theaccountantsâ acts or omissions and knew that there was a real possibility that those acts or omissions had been the cause of thedamage they had suffered.</p>    <p><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a>  I must confess that there are parts of the reasoning in <i>Haward</i> which I find puzzling and which supports the comment of counsel for TTC â who relied on the decision - that their Lordships haveput a âglossâ on the statute.  I think that some of the difficulties that I have with these parts of the reasoning arise fromsome of their Lordships equating âknowledgeâ with knowing enough to require further investigation.  I have already set out thereasons why that cannot be so, and I need not to repeat them.  The remaining difficulties that I have with parts of the reasoningis the re-writing of the equivalent of s.35(1)(b), a point to which I earlier referred.</p>    <p><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a>  Lord Nicholls said (at 688) that the conduct alleged to constitute negligence âwas the giving of flawed adviceâ.  He went onto say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â20 â¦This feature is the very essence of [the first claimantâs] claim.  Stated in simple and broad terms, his claim is thatMr Austreng did not do his job properly.  Time did not start to run against [the first claimant] until he knew enough for it to bereasonable to embark on preliminary investigations into this possibility.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">21.       There may be cases where the defective nature of the advice is transparent on its face.  It is not suggested that was sohere.  So, for time to run, something more was needed to put [the first claimant] on inquiry.  For time to start running there needsto have been something which would reasonably cause [the first claimant] to start asking questions about the advice he was given.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  Lord Nicholls said that the claimants had the burden of proving that they were not put on inquiry until after 6 December 1998 buthad not attempted to discharge this burden.  Accordingly, their claim for an extension of the limitation period failed.</p>    <p><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  With great respect, I find two features of this reasoning difficult to accept.  The first is the reference to being put on inquiry. In <i>Haward</i>, the accountants did not rely on the claimantsâ constructive knowledge, as Lord Nicholls acknowledged<i>.</i> So no question of investigation or inquiry arose.  It follows that the reference to start asking questions or an inquiry was irrelevant. Because the accountants did not contend that the claimants had constructive knowledge of any facts, the only issue was whether,on the facts actually known to the claimants, they had knowledge of each of the four matters referred to in the United Kingdom equivalentof s.31(5).  Of those four matters, the only live issue concerned whether before 6 December 1998 they knew âthat the damage wasattributable in whole or in part to the act or omissionâ that constituted the alleged negligence.  If they had that knowledge,their claim was barred.  Lord Nicholls did not address the issue posed by the United Kingdom equivalent of s.31(5)(b) in these terms. Instead of asking whether the claimants knew that Mr Austreng had advised investment in the company (which was the relevant actor omission when stripped of its negligent quality), his Lordship asked whether [the first claimant] âknew enough for it to bereasonable to embark on preliminary investigations into this possibilityâ.  That was a question that would be relevant if constructiveknowledge was an issue in <i>Haward</i>, but it was not an issue in that case.  The second feature is the characterization of the act or omission as flawed advice.  In substance,that seems to reintroduce by another name the element of negligence which the United Kingdom equivalent of s.31(6) renders irrelevant.</p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a>  With great respect, and independently of this last point, what his Lordship did in<i>Haward</i> was to apply the process for ascertaining facts that are imputed to the plaintiffâs store of knowledge to a case where facts constructivelyknown were not an issue.</p>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a>  Lord Scott said (at 696) that the damage that the claimants had suffered âwas the making of a bad investmentâ.  He went on tosay (at 696) that the essence of the claimantâs complaint against the accountants was that they did not give them the advice thatthe true state of the companyâs affairs warranted and that, if given, would have warned them against the disastrous investmentof their money.  Lord Scott said (at 697) that the first claimant knew what advice had been given and what advice had not been givenby the accountants.  He âknew by 6 December 1998 that the true financial state of the company had required, if the company wereto keep trading, the very substantial additional investment that had to be made, and was made, to cover the losses incurred in theyears 1995, 1996 and 1997â.  Lord Scott said that the trial judge had summed up the situation accurately and in accordance withthe requirements of the United Kingdom equivalent of s.31 when he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âit is the basis of [the claimants] claim that [the accountants] advised ongoing investment and it is hard to see how [the firstclaimant] could have failed to appreciate that he was spending money either on their advice or without their advice.  So far as [thefirst claimant] was concerned, there was nothing of a factual nature that was latent; all was patent.  The only thing that he didnot know was that [the accountants] had been, as he now alleges, negligent or that he had a claim against them but such matters areirrelevant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>With respect, I think that Lord Scottâs and the trial judgeâs approach was the correct one.  The damage was the loss of the moneysinvested, and the âact or omissionâ was the advice that was given or not given.</p>    <p><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a>  Lord Walker also thought that, although the trial judgeâs judgment was ânot without some defects and difficultiesâ, he âwasbasically right in his overall conclusionâ.</p>    <p><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a>  Lord Brown said (at 710):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â90.     What the claimant must know to set time running is the essence of the act or omission to which his damage is attributable,the substance of what ultimately comes to be pleaded as his case in negligence.  That essence or substance here could no doubt becharacterised in either of two ways: either as the act of recommending investment in the company (or omitting to caution againstit - on the particular parts of this case these are two sides of the same coin), or, with greater particularity, the act of recommendinginvestment without first carrying out the investigations necessary to justify such positive advice.  Having at first preferred thelatter characterisation, I have come to prefer the former.  True, under the former the claimant knows nothing beyond the fact thathis advisers led him into what turned out to be a bad investment; he does not know, as under the latter characterisation he would,that he has a justifiable complaint against his advisers.  But he surely knows enough (constructive knowledge aside) to realise thatthere is a real possibility of his damage having been caused by some flaw or inadequacy in his advisersâ investment advice, andenough therefore to start an investigation into that possibility, which section 14A then gives him three years to complete.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">91.      If the other approach is adopted, time only starts to run once the claimant recognizes that a fuller examination of the companyâsprospects should have been carried out than was in fact carried out, knowledge which [the first claimant] only learned here at someunascertained date after the investigation into [the accountants] conduct had itself begun in an May 1999 (when another accountantfirst suggested to [the first claimant] that a negligence claim might lie against [the accountants]).  But what if that suggestionand the investigation which it prompted had themselves been made at a later date still, perhaps very substantially later?  On thisapproach the limitation period would appear capable of almost limitless extension and for no sufficient reasonâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  With great respect, for the reasons that I gave in discussing Lord Nichollâs speech, I find part of the reasoning in these paragraphspuzzling.  Because the claimants did not have constructive knowledge of any facts, the only issue was whether, on the facts knownto them, they knew before 6 December 1998 âthat the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omissionâ thatconstituted the alleged negligence.  Lord Brown held that, for the purpose of the United Kingdom equivalent of s.31(5)(b), the claimanthad that knowledge although he knew ânothing beyond the fact that his advisers led him into what turned out to be a bad investmentâ. Earlier, Lord Brown had said (at 709) that â[g]iven, however, that [the accountants] case is based solely on [the first claimantâs]actual knowledge, to my mind it must fail if anything more is required than that [the first claimant] knew that his loss might wellhave resulted from an investment made on [the accountantsâ] adviceâ.  With respect, this analysis of the relevant act or omissionwas correct.</p>    <p><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  However, his Lordship then went on to comment that âhe surely knows enough (constructive knowledge aside) to realise that thereis a real possibility of his damage having been caused by some flaw or inadequacy in his advisersâ investment advice, and enoughtherefore to start an investigation into that possibility, which s.14A then gives him three years to completeâ.  In <i>Haward</i>, the accountants did not rely on the claimantsâ constructive knowledge<i>.</i> So no question of investigation arose, and the reference to the starting of an investigation seems irrelevant unless Lord Brown isspeaking hypothetically of a case whose facts are similar to those in <i>Haward</i>.  Having correctly identified the relevant act or omission, I find it difficult to see why his Lordship thought that the case turnedon the issue of investigation.  The claimants either had knowledge of that act or omission or they did not have it.  Lord Brownâsreasons show that they had that knowledge.  That, in my opinion, was enough to defeat their claim.</p>    <p><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  Lord Mance, like Lord Nicholls, saw the issue as being when the first claimant knew enough to make it reasonable for him to investigatewhether the claimants had a case against the accountants.  Lord Mance said (at 725):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe question is when [the first claimant] actually knew both enough of the acts or omissions now alleged to constitute negligenceand that the loss suffered was capable of being attributable thereto to make it reasonable for him to begin to investigate whetheror not the claimants had a claim against [the accountants].  That would be the case, taking the reasoning in <i>Hallam-Eamesâ</i>s case, once he realised that he had prima facie cause to complain of unsoundness from the outset of the investments; this would inturn suggest unsoundness in the advice given or not given by [the accountants].  In relation to the issue raised by this question,the onus was on the claimants.  It was for the claimants to displace the basic limitation period by showing, if they could, that[the first claimant] did not have the requisite knowledge prior to 6 December 1998.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  Lord Mance went on to hold (at 728) that the claimants had not discharged the onus that lay on them.  Lord Manceâs approach wassimilar to that of Lord Nicholls and, with respect, open to the same criticism.  Perhaps the source of his Lordshipâs error wasreliance on <i>Hallam-Eames</i> which turned on the potential availability of constructive knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a>  Thus, the reasoning of three of their Lordships is predicated on the assumption of a need to find that it was reasonable for theclaimants to have begun an investigation.  As I have indicated, this was not an issue in a case where constructive knowledge of factswas not a relevant issue.  It also led to the curious conclusion that time ran against the claimants not from when the claimantshad knowledge of the four matters specified in s.14A but when they should have commenced to investigate those matters.</p>    <p><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a>  Fortunately, as will appear, the present appeal can be disposed of without the necessity of invoking the reasoning of the Houseof Lords in <i>Haward.</i> Whether this Court should apply that reasoning should be left for another day.  Indeed, it is unlikely that future courts will needto apply its <i>ratio decidendi</i> and principal reasoning, helpful as much of its <i>dicta</i> is.  That is because much of what their Lordships said would be applicable in cases where constructive knowledge was in issue, whichit was not in <i>Haward</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a>  The third case is <i>Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates</i> [2001] Lloydâs Reports PN 178 which shows the difficulty of striking out a statement of claim on the basis of the plaintiffâsknowledge when the facts known or imputed to the plaintiff are not clearly admitted or established.  The claimants in that case wereLloydâs Names who suffered losses when syndicates of which they were members became liable to meet a number of large claims.  Thedefendants contended that all the plaintiffs could reasonably have been expected to acquire the knowledge required for bringing anaction in respect of the relevant damage from documents that had been sent to them or their agents more than three years before theissue of the first group.  The issue for decision was whether they knew that the damage was attributable in whole or in part to theact or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence.  At first instance, Gatehouse J found that the documents supplied wouldhave told the Names that they had suffered losses sufficiently serious to justify instituting proceedings and struck out the Namesactions.  However, the Court of Appeal held that the Gatehouse J had âunduly restricted the facts which s.14A(8)(a) [the equivalentof s.31(5)(b)] requires to be known and the material before him did not enable him or this court to decide â¦ as a preliminary issuethat the plaintiffâs claims was statute barredâ.</p>    <p class="heading">Section 31(5)(b) in the present case</p>    <p><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a>  The issue in this case under s.31(5)(b) is whether Kensland knew that the damage it suffered âwas attributable in whole or inpart to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligenceâ.  As I have indicated it knew the heads of damage that arethe basis of its action against TTC.  Paragraph 20 pleaded six particulars of negligence.  The first alleged that âTTC, for nogood reason, failed to provide the instructions to [Whale View] within a reasonable timeâ.  The second and third particulars allegedthat TTC wrongly advised Kensland that Whale Viewâs late tender constituted a repudiation of the agreement and that instructionswere given within sufficient time for the preparation of the cheques and cashierâs orders.  The fourth particular alleged thatTTC failed properly to review and consider the agreement, failed properly to advise on the basis thereof and in particular failedto advise that in law Kensland would not be entitled to take advantage of its own breach of the implied term.  The fifth particularalleged that TTC failed to advise that, if Kenslandâs delay in completion was due to its default, it would not be entitled to treatthe agreement as repudiated.  The sixth particular alleged that TTC failed generally to inform Kensland of the impact of the lateinstructions in the circumstances and failed to point out and advise fully of the risks involved in refusing to complete and of thevery real risk of having to compensate Whale View.</p>    <p><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a>  So the question under this part of the case is whether Kensland knew before 13 January 2001 that its liability to pay damages toWhale View was attributable in whole or in part to each of these six particulars of negligence.  Kensland bears the onus of establishingthat it did not know before that date that its damage was attributable to one or more of these acts or omissions of TTC.  In determiningthat question, it is necessary in accordance with s.31(6) to disregard so much of these particulars as âinvolve negligenceâ. Hence, the use of terms such as âno good reasonâ, âwronglyâ and âproperlyâ must be disregarded.</p>    <p><a name="p237" class="para" id="p237">237.</a>  In my opinion, by the end of November 1997, Kensland knew that its damage was attributable to the particularised acts and omissionsthat are alleged to constitute negligence on the part of TTC.  Once the descriptions of negligence are stripped from the particulars,Kenslandâs claim is that TTC gave it or failed to give it advice concerning the termination of the contract of sale or its constructionand failed to advise it of the risks involved in terminating the contract and that this led to the damage that it has suffered. However, Kensland knew what advice TTC had or had not given it.  By the end of November, it even knew from the Statement of Claimserved by Whale View and correspondence between the parties the respects in which this advice or lack of it was the basis of WhaleViewâs claim for damages.  By the end of November, Kensland knew that its liability to pay damages and costs and the drop in thevaluation of its property was the result of the advice and lack of advice that TTC had given it.  What it did not know was whetherthat advice or lack of it was negligent, but, for the purposes of s.31(5)(b) that is irrelevant.  Consequently, Kensland knew bythe end of November 1997 that the damage that is the subject of its action for damages against TTC âwas attributableâ¦to the actor omissionâ of TTC.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a>  It follows that TTC has established that by the end of November 1997, Kensland had knowledge of each of the four matters referredto in s.31(5) (two of them not being in dispute), that it cannot obtain the ameliorating benefit of s.31 and that its claim againstTTC is statute barred.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a>  The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ:</b></p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a>  The Court unanimously dismisses the appeal with costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Kemal Bokhary)<br />            Permanent Judge</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Patrick Chan)<br />            Permanent Judge</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(R A V Ribeiro)<br />            Permanent Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr John Scott, SC and Mr Charles Manzoni (instructed by Messrs Jonathan Rostron Solicitors) for the Appellant</p>        <p>Mr Michael Thomas, SC and Mr Andrew Bullett (instructed by Messrs Richards Butler) for the Respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <hr style="text-align:left" width="33%" />    <p><a>[1]</a>          Kensland Realty Ltd v Whale View Investment Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%204%20HKCFAR%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) 4 HKCFAR 381.</a></p>    <p><a>[2]</a>          HH Judge Gill, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20HKLRD%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 HKLRD 261.</a></p>    <p><a>[3]</a>           <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKLRD%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKLRD 342.</a></p>    <p><a>[4]</a>          HH Judge Gill sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, HCA 74/2004 (9 November 2005).</p>    <p><a>[5]</a>          CACV 44/2006 (18 October 2006) Rogers VP and Le Pichon JA.</p>    <p><a>[6]</a>          <i>Hendserson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 145.</a></p>    <p><a>[7]</a>          Appearing with Mr Charles Manzoni.</p>    <p><a>[8]</a>          <i>Nykredit v Edward Erdman (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201627" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 1627</a> at 1630 per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead.</p>    <p><a>[9]</a>          <i>Cartledge v E Jopling &amp;
