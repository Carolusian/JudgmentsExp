By a summons dated 14 July 2009, the Plaintiff applied to join the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in the action, they beingalleged to be partners in the 1st Defendant at the material time.  On 17 February 2010, Deputy High Court Judge Burrell ordered thatthe 2nd Defendant be joined (the 3rd Defendant having consented to the joinder).</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The 2nd Defendant appealed to this Court.  The issue before us was whether the joinder of the 2nd Defendant ought to have been disallowed(as the 2nd Defendant contended) by reason of the relevant limitation period having already expired at the time of the applicationto join (and having expired even at the time the action was commenced in 2008).  Deputy High Court Judge Burrell was of the viewthat it had not; at least arguably not.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  After hearing submissions from counsel, we allowed the appeal, set aside the order of Deputy High Court Judge Burrell joining the2nd Defendant and dismissed the joinder summons dated 14 July 2009.  Costs of the appeal and in the court below were also orderedto be paid by the Plaintiff to the 2nd Defendant, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.  It was indicated that the reasons for judgmentwould be handed down in due course.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Background</b></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Under the Guarantee, the Plaintiff and her husband (âWongâ) assumed joint and several liability as sureties for the indebtednessof their company, Shun Kai Bullion Co Ltd (âSKBâ) to a lender, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Co Ltd (âCTFâ), which had made a loanto SKB of $1.5 million.  As stated above, the Guarantee was executed on 23 June 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  A default or defaults having occurred in the repayment of the loan made to SKB, demands under the Guarantee were accordingly madeto the Plaintiff and Wong in 1998.  A Writ endorsed with a Statement of Claim was issued against the Plaintiff and Wong on 28 December1998.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The action was defended by the Plaintiff and Wong.  We have been provided with a copy of the Defence and Counterclaim.  Briefly,the defence run by the Plaintiff (and by Wong) was to the effect that before they signed the Guarantee, it had been represented tothem by a clerk of their solicitors (the 1st Defendant in the present action), who had acted for CTF as well, that the Guaranteewas a mere formality and not intended to be enforced.  Other defences based on the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Money Lenders Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap. 163</a> were also advanced.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 5 March 2007, judgment was entered by consent against the Plaintiff in the sum of $1,530,000, this sum inclusive of costs.  Thejudgment was apparently part of an overall settlement reached between the parties.  The consent judgment involved only CTF and thePlaintiff; on 6 October 2006, Wong had been adjudged bankrupt by Barma J.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The claim against the solicitors</b></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  As stated above, the 1st Defendant had been engaged as the Plaintiffâs solicitors for the purposes of entering into the Guarantee. In the present action, the Plaintiff claims against the 1st Defendant on the basis of both breach of contract and negligence.  Aspleaded, the particulars going to both causes of action and to the ensuing loss are the same : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â8.

The Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage, in that, in the event, by virtue of having signed the Guarantee and not otherwise,the Plaintiff has became liable to Chow Tai Fook and incurred a judgment debt of HK$1,530,000 and legal costs in High Court ActionNo. 22168 of 1998 â an action instituted and prosecuted by Chow Tai Fook against, inter alia, the Plaintiff upon the Guarantee,and resulting in a final order of the Court of First Instance dated 5<sup>th</sup> March , 2007.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">10.

The said loss and damage were caused by the Defendantâs above pleaded breaches of duty.  But for the said breaches, the Plaintiffwould not have signed the Guarantee and not become liable to Chow Tai Fook, nor incurred the aforesaid judgment debt or legal costs.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  There is no independent cause of action pleaded against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants : as stated above, their involvement is to theextent that they were allegedly partners in the 1st Defendant at the material time.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Is the claim against the 2nd Defendant time barred?</b></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  As Mr Samson Hung (for the 2nd Defendant) has pointed out, no person will be allowed to be joined as a defendant to proceedingsafter the expiry of the relevant limitation period : <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2010,</i> Vol.1, para. 15/6/3.  In the present case, the 2nd Defendant contends that not only was the action outside the limitation periodat the time of the joinder summons (14 July 2009), this was the position even at the date of the issue of the Writ in the presentaction (29 October 2008).</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I have approached this matter as though it had been an application to strike out.  In other words, the burden was on the 2nd Defendantto show that it was plain and obvious that the limitation period had expired.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The relevant limitation provisions are contained in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a> : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>4.   Limitation of actions of contract and tort, and certain other actions</b></p>        <p class="quote">(1)     The following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued,that is to say â</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)    actions founded on simple contract or on tort;</p>            <p class="quote">â¦..â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The question for this Court was when the causes of action, as pleaded in the Statement of Claim, accrued for the purposes of timebeginning to run under that provision.  As far as the claim based on contract was concerned, time began to run from the date of thealleged breach of contract : this was in June 1994 when the 1st Defendant committed the various breaches alleged in the Statementof Claim (see paragraph 8 above).</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The focus of the argument became therefore identifying the point when the action in tort (negligence) accrued for the purposes oflimitation.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Unlike contractual claims (when the cause of action accrues when a breach of contract takes place), by contrast, claims in tortaccrue when the damage attributable to the alleged tortious act, occurs.  In <i>Kensland Realty Ltd v Tai, Tang &amp; Chong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282008%29%2011%20HKCFAR%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2008) 11 HKCFAR 237</a>, at 259-60 (paragraph 51), Ribeiro PJ said this : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â51. A cause of action in tort accrues when the damage which results from the tortious conduct is real, as distinct from minimalor negligible and is actual, as opposed to purely contingent.  The concept of âdamageâ is given a broad meaning.  It encompassesdamage consisting of âany detriment, liability or loss capable of assessment in money terms.â  Where economic loss is involved,it includes loss suffered âby payment of money, by transfer of property, by diminution in the value of an asset or by the incurringof a liability.â  Whether damage has been incurred in any particular case is a question of fact.  Its precise quantification mayonly be possible at a later date, by which time it may have become more serious, but that does not detract from the earlier accrualof the cause of action.  The damage must, however, be recoverable as falling within the measure of damages applicable to the defendantâswrong in question.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In my judgment, the cause of action in tort relied on by the Plaintiff in the present action accrued in 1998, and for the purposesof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, time therefore began to run as from that date : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)    It is clear from the Statement of Claim, in particular paragraph 8 thereof, that the Plaintiffâs real complaint was thatshe had not been properly advised in relation to her liability (whether âactual, contingent or potentialâ) under the Guarantee.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)      The Plaintiffâs loss was her liability under the Guarantee â this loss was adjudged to be $1,530,000 (see paragraph 7above) together with her legal costs : - paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim (paragraph  8 above).</p>        <p class="quote">(3)    Although this loss was quantified only on 5 March 2007 when judgment was entered against her, the Plaintiffâs liability underthe Guarantee crystallized in 1998 when demands were made to her thereunder.  The latest point when a demand for payment under theGuarantee was made must have been 28 December 1998 when proceedings were commenced against her by CTF : see paragraph 5 above.  Thisis sufficient to enable time to begin to run.  The passage from the judgment of Ribeiro PJ in <i>Kensland</i> (see paragraph 15 above) refers, in the context of economic loss, to the incurrence of a liability as the point when a cause of actionbased on tort, crystallizes.  Specifically, in relation to guarantees and similar indemnity agreements, this point is reached upona demand being made : see <i>Kensland</i> at paragraphs 100, 157 and 159.  At this point, the liability crystallizes, and it is irrelevant (for the purposes of the limitationperiod becoming activated) that the <i>actual</i> quantification of that liability (through a judgment or otherwise) or the actual payment of that liability, occurs at a later stage.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)    I have not forgotten the argument advanced on behalf of the Plaintiff that the damage suffered by her consisted of the lossof her right of indemnity or contribution from SKB and her husband Wong, and that this damage did not occur (so it is said) untilSKB was wound up and Wong was made bankrupt.  Wong having been made bankrupt only in 2006 (see paragraph  7 above), time thereforeonly began to run as from that date.  One of the particulars of negligence pleaded in paragraph 8(viii) of the Statement of Claimwas the failure to advise the Plaintiff that she would lose her right of indemnity or contribution from SKB and Wong in the eventof their being wound up or made bankrupt.  Paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim pleads that the Plaintiff suffered loss and damagein these circumstances.  This argument eventually became the main plank of the submissions before us by Mr John Swaine (for the Plaintiff).</p>        <p class="quote">(5)    However, in my view, properly analyzed, the overall complaint made by the Plaintiff in the Statement of Claim has always beenthe failure on her former solicitorsâ part to advise her properly as regards her liabilities under the Guarantee.  The failureto advise in relation to the companyâs winding up or Wongâs bankruptcy (even if this can be sustained as a matter of law and,despite doubts as to this, I express no views on the allegation) stem from this overall complaint, and amount to no more than examplesof it.  It has never been the Plaintiffâs case that she was specifically seeking advice from the solicitors on her rights of recoveryunder an indemnity or contribution or otherwise.  If this had been the Plaintiffâs case, different considerations may have enteredinto the analysis.  It will be recalled that in the guarantee action instituted by CTF against the Plaintiff, the defence was basedon misrepresentation of the enforceability of the Guarantee (see paragraph  6 above).  This is more consistent with an allegationthat the solicitors had failed to advise properly in relation to the Plaintiffâs liabilities under the Guarantee than with an allegationof failure to advise on issues of contribution or indemnity.</p>        <p class="quote">(6)    Moreover, paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim clearly sets out the damage that the Plaintiff alleges she had suffered. It is said that but for the alleged acts or omissions pleaded in paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim, âthe Plaintiff would nothave signed the Guarantee and not become liable to [CTF], nor incurred the aforesaid judgment debt or legal costsâ.  This is repeatedin the affirmation evidence in these proceedings (paragraph 2(f) of the Plaintiffâs affirmation and paragraph 11 of the affirmationof Kuan Man Chun, the Plaintiffâs solicitor in these proceedings).  If one were to ask rhetorically the point in time when thePlaintiff incurred the liabilities identified in paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim, the answer would clearly be 1998, the timewhen her liability under the Guarantee crystallized.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The Plaintiffâs cause of action in tort having therefore accrued in 1998 (and the one in contract having accrued much earlierin 1994), at the time that the present proceedings were instituted and also when the joinder summons was issued, the action againstthe 2nd Defendant was already time barred.
