In so saying I would reiteratewhat Cons, J. A, has said earlier, in the course of the argument, deprecating the fact that this appeal has been brought on at allbefore the hearing of the inter partes application.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Respondent seeks to persuade us to extend the scope of the decision of the House of Lords in N<u>orwich Pharmacal Ltd</u>. v <u>Customs &amp; Excise Commissioners</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1974%20AC%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1974 A.C. 133.</a> By that case it was decided that an action for discovery lay against a party who had become involved in a tortious act to ascertainthe identity of the wrong doer, The involvement may be innocent and either voluntary or involuntary, as where it is in consequenceof the performance of a statutory duty. In such a case the action is necessary.to enable proceedings against the wrong doer to beinstituted: otherwise a wrong would go unrighted.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Here the discovery sought is to obtain evidence for the purposes of an action which has already been brought. The Respondent is aplaintiff which sues for breach. of a franchise contract. The Writ does not - at least up till the present - contain any allegationsof fraud, conspiracy or any other tort: it alleges that the 1st Defendant (a Singapore company) has failed to pay royalties whichare said to be due under the contract, and it seeks evidence as to the amount to which it is entitled. The appellant 2nd Defendantis a Hong Kong company associated with the 1st Defendant and is said to have been carrying on the 1st Defendant's business in HongKong. The judge has made an order for discovery against the 1st and the 2nd Defendants and against another defendant who is a shareholderand director of the 2nd Defendant.  Included in the Order is the following paragraph:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"And that the Plaintiff be at liberty to use any affidavit and any document and information obtained in accordance with this orderin any manner that should be required whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere for the protection or better protection of the rights ofthe Plaintiff the subject of this action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The 2nd Defendant contends that the order for discovery in the present action is an abuse of the process and is a device by whichthe Plaintiff seeks to obtain discovery which normally would not be available against a party to the action until a later stage inthe proceedings and which, as is conceded, would permit the use of any information disclosed solely for the purpose of the presentaction. Mr. Rogers submits that this is a case covered by the <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> principle. It is true that the Writ includes a claim for discovery, but I am not persuaded that the Plaintiff has established itsright to that relief, let alone shown that it has a right to discovery of this kind by way of interlocutory relief. As I understandthe speeches of their Lordships in the <u>Norwich Pharmacal Case</u>, they went no further than holding that discovery, as a form of final relief, would be ordered where it is necessary to enable aninjured party to decide against whom its action should be brought and to enable him to carry his action forward. In that case itwas the identity of the overseas suppliers which was wanted.  In <u>Moodalay</u> v <u>Morton</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281785%29%201%20BroCC%20469" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1785) 1 Bro.C.C. 469</a> it was whether the persons whose acts were complained of were acting as servants of the company, so that the plaintiff could decidewhether to sue the individual tortfeasors or the company. In <u>Banker's Trust Co</u>. v <u>Shapira</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1980%203%20All%20ER%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1980 3 All E.R. 353</a> it was information which would enable the plaintiff to trace where the money obtained from it by fraud had gone and who could besued for its recovery: there was alleged to be a breach of a constructive trust. In the present case Mr.Rogers told us early on inhis argument that he needed discovery to ascertain the amount of the royalties which his client should claim.  He says that discoverymight reveal that some other party has conspired with one or more of the existing defendants to the action, but discovery will notbe ordered to enable a party to embark upon a fishing expedition. He has subsequently suggested that the Plaintiff might need theinformation it now seeks to aid an action in Singapore. There is at present no action on the Hong Kong agreement in Singapore. Informationobtained on discovery under 0.24 would be available for such an action by leave of the court when the action has been commenced.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The truth is that the Plaintiff is trying to obtain evidence against the existing Defendants in quantification of its claim. TheBill of Discovery was never concerned with the obtaining of evidence. <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> may not be limited to obtaining the identity of a possible defendant and I would accept that <u>Radio Corporation of America</u> v <u>Reddington's Rare Records</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1975%20RPC%2095" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1975 R.P.C. 95</a> shows that in a proper case additional information may be sought which can be used as evidence, but the information must be necessaryfor justice to be done. In the present case I do not think it is necessary: the Plaintiff will in due course be entitled to applyfor discovery in the ordinary course and everything which could now be obtained on the order which has been granted will become available,and I see no reason why the present form of proceedings should be used to obtain discovery at an earlier stage than otherwise wouldbe available.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I therefore would allow this appeal and strike out that paragraph in the Order</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p>Cons, J.A.:</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I agree with my Lord that the appeal should be allowed and the offending paragraph struck out. I add a few words because we are disagreeingwith the judge below on a matter of some importance and one which we are told is of current practice</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On 6th June the Plaintiffs obtained from Garcia J. an ex parte Anton Pillar type order which included the paragraph which my Lordhas quoted. On 9th June that Order was made against the' 2nd Defendant, the 1st and 3rd Defendants not having been served. On 9thJune the 2nd Defendant applied to set aside that particular part of the Order and after hearing counsel the judge refused to makeany variation. The inter partes hearing of the Order as a whole takes place tomorrow, but in the meantime the 2nd Defendant has pursuedthis appeal in respect of the judge's refusal on 9th June.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The main point of Mr. Litton, who appears for the 2nd Defendant before us, is that the judge had no jurisdiction to make that kindof order. Mr. Rogers who appears for the Plaintiff puts in a simple answer. He says that although in a sense that paragraph is wrong,it is only wrong because it is unnecessary; the order made being of the type approved in <u>Norwich Pharmacal Ltd</u>. v <u>Customs &amp;.Excise</u> <i>[</i>1974<i>]</i> A.C. 133 he has a right to use the information which is disclosed and therefore does not need the paragraph complained of. He acceptedthat in order to make good his defence, in view of the way the argument on appeal had proceeded, he had to satisfy us on three propositions.The first was that <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> extended to information as well as to identity. That, I think, was in answer to a criticism raised by the court itself; and the twofurther propositions (which were in answer to matters raised by Mr. Litton) were that a <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> type order could be granted ex parte and that this was a proper case in which such an order should have been made. After some initialdoubts I was eventually persuaded that his first proposition is good. <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> is not limited to pure identity: information may be obtained and used in appropriate cases. I am satisfied that that is acceptedby the English authorities. But it seems to me the underlying fallacy of Mr. Rogers' argument is that that is not a proper case fora <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> order at all. The principle which was crystalised in that case is derived from the original equitable bill of discovery, wherebycourts of equity were willing to grant discovery so that the plaintiff in their court was not deprived of justice in other proceedings,whether in their own or in a court of law. That is clear from all the speeches in the <u>Norwich Pharmacal Case</u>, and every case since that time to which we have been referred is an example of that principle.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In my view the Plaintiff's case does not meet that criterion for three reasons. First, we are not concerned with another action.In a sense the action against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants is comprised of three separate actions brought together for the sakeof convenience, but the fraud which, as I apprehend it, will be alleged in due course in the Statement of Claim is the same for allthree, and it is for that action against the three Defendants and not against the Third Party, that the Plaintiff wishes to havethe information available. Secondly, it is not necessary at this stage of the proceedings that the Plaintiff should be told whathe is seeking. I see no reason why he shouldn't carry on with his action, and normal discovery will in due course provide him withthe information that he now seeks. And, thirdly, for myself I have grave doubts both on the facts and on the law, as matters nowstand, that this is a Norwich Pharmacal type of case at all. As to the facts, the affidavit contains nothing to show that anyoneother than the Defendants is likely, certainly not very likely, to have committed any wrongs against the Plaintiff. As to the lawI have doubts that <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> applies to torts of the kind that will be alleged against the Defendant. I appreciate that in the banking cases fraud was pleadedand relied on but the discovery that was given was not in support of the action for fraud, it was in support of an equitable actionto trace moneys said to be the subject of constructive trusts.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> If then, as in my view, this is not a <u>Norwich Pharmacal</u> case, the discovery granted by Garcia J. must have been what, for convenience, I will call "ordinary discovery". It is accepted thateven ordinary discovery may be used with the leave of the court for purposes outside the action in which it is given. It may evenbe possible that such leave can be justified ex parte, but I think it would need the most unusual circumstances and I see nothingof that unusuality in this present case.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> For these reasons I think the judge was wrong to make the order that he did and I respectfully agree that the appeal should be allowed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p>24th July 1985</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>H.
