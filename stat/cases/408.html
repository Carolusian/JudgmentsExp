Since 1999 the 4th defendant and the Gateway Companies had started to assist the 1st defendant in marketing anddistributing the 1st defendantâs products in countries other than Belgium and Germany.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> It was also the 4th defendantâs case that the Gateway Companies had concentrated on the development of model cars of three differentscales i.e. 1/12, 1/18 and 1/43.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The 1/18 models were manufactured by the 1st defendant until the end of November 2000 when it ceased operation and sold the factoryand operation to a buyer in China.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The 1/12 and 1/43 models were manufactured by a factory called Davidson Limited (âDavidsonâ).  The 1st defendant had never manufacturedmodels of these two scales for the 4th  defendant and its companies.  However the 1st defendant would at the request of the GatewayCompanies consolidate the products manufactured by Davidson and that of the 1st defendant for shipment purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The 4th defendant accepted that in respect of the 1st category of documents it should disclose documents relating to the purchaseof models from the 1st defendant and but only in respect of 1/18 models.  It, however, contended that documents relating to the purchasefrom Davidson of 1/12 and 1/43 models were irrelevant.</p>    <p><b><u>The evidence of the plaintiff</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The plaintiff had put in evidence of Mr. Morot-Gaudry a former employee of a company owed by the 2nd defendant that it was the 2nddefendant who was instrumental in setting up the 4th defendant and the Gateway Companies.  The purpose was solely to bypass the Agreementwith the plaintiff.  This was to be achieved by creating a fake company structure to re-brand the 1st defendantâs products (todeprive the plaintiff of its commission and exclusivity rights in Europe) and to compete head-on with the plaintiff by producingthe same types of products for the Gateway Companies.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> He also said that from his conversation with one Mr. Schmadalla who had helped the 2nd defendant with the scheme, Davidson was operatedby the 2nd defendant and that âhe uses an ex-employee as his front man to give the appearance of dissociationâ.</p>    <p><b><u>The principles</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The relevant principles for specific discovery under Order 24 Rule 7 of the Rules of the High Court can be summarised as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)  There is no jurisdiction to make an order under RSC, O.24, r.7, for the production of documents unless</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)  there is sufficient evidence that the documents exist which the other party has not disclosed;</p>            <p>(b)  the document or documents relate to matters in issue in the action;</p>            <p>(c)  there is sufficient evidence that the document is in the possession, custody or power of the other party.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)  When it is established that those three prerequisites for jurisdiction do exist, the court has a discretion whether or not toorder disclosure.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)  The order must identify with precision the document or documents or categories of document which are required to be disclosed,for otherwise the person making the list may find himself in serious trouble for swearing to a false affidavit, even though doinghis best to give an honest disclosure.  (See : <i>Berkeley Administration v. McCelland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20FSR%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] F.S.R. 381)</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><b><u>The real issue of relevance</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The real issue that has been focused at this hearing is whether the documents sought to be disclosed are relevant to the issues inthis case between the plaintiff and the 4th defendant.  In this context the issue must be one identified in the pleadings : <i>Sun Yuet Tai Ltd v. British American Tobacco Co. (H.K.) Ltd</i> (CACV No. 95 of 1999).  On the other hand the fact that an issue is raised in the pleadings is not determinative as to whether itrelates to a matter.  Discovery is not required of documents which relate to irrelevant allegations in pleadings which even if substantiatedcould not affect the result of the action : <i>Allington Investments Corp &amp; Others v. First Pacific Bancshares Holdings Ltd &amp; Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20HKC%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 HKC 139.</a></p>    <p><b><u>The first category</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Hingorani, counsel for the plaintiff, argued that an issue had indeed been raised in the pleadings on whether the 4th defendanthad placed orders with the 1st defendant for the manufacture of the 1/18, 1/12 and 1/43 scale models.  This is on the simple basisthat the plaintiff had alleged the 4th defendant had placed orders with the 1st defendant which was denied by the 4th defendant. Further the 4th defendant had revealed that it had placed orders with Davidson for the 1/12 and 1/43 models.  Discovery of the firstcategory of documents is required to show that the 4th defendant had indeed placed orders with the 1st defendant for all three scalemodels.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr. Hingorani further submitted that the defendants had carried out a conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff.  The plaintiff was notprivy to the covert operation and only came to know the details when a private investigator managed to obtain from the rubbish binof the 1st defendant documents relating to the 4th defendant and the Gateway Companies and the business they intended to carry out. None of these documents had ever revealed the existence of Davidson.  Mr. Hingorani did not accept Davidson even existed.  Alternativelyhe said Davidson must be an intermediate either for the 1st or 4th defendant in respect of the placing of orders by the 4th defendantwith the 1st defendant.  He submitted that in view of the secrecy of the operation, the plaintiff could not and should not be askedto formulate a claim as to the position of Davidson.</p>    <p><b><u>My view</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> One must have certain sympathy with the position of the plaintiff but the rule for specific discovery is based on the requirementthat an issue has been raised in the pleading which is relevant to the determination of the dispute between the parties.  In my view,even for the purpose of argument, an affidavit is to be regarded as pleading, the mere fact that the 4th defendant denied it hadplaced orders with the 1st defendant for the 1/12 and 1/43 scale models but only with Davidson will not by itself justify a discoveryof the documents relating to the sale between the 4th defendant and Davidson.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The issue now defined by the pleadings is whether the 4th defendant had indeed placed orders with the 1st defendant and distributedthese goods causing the 1st defendant to breach its contract with the plaintiff.  The burden of proof on this issue lies with theplaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The 4th defendant had in the defence stated that it had ordered goods from the 1st defendant only until November 2000.  It had furtherdisclosed in the affidavits filed in the discovery proceedings that those goods were only in respect of 1/18 scale model.  On thisbasis documents relating to the placing of orders with the 1st defendant of the 1/18 scale models must be disclosed because theywere relevant to the defined issue.  The 4th defendant had already disclosed those documents. </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> If the 4th defendant simply say it had only placed orders with the 1st defendant for the 1/18 scale models without any elaboration,it is not required to disclose all its other trading records at the relevant time in order for the plaintiff to ascertain if the4th  defendant had placed some other orders with the 1st defendant.  This is because the burden of proof lies with the plaintiffto show that the 4th defendant had indeed placed orders with the 1st  defendant and it cannot simply say to the 4th defendant âshowme your records so that I may check if what you said was correctâ.  The other trading activities carried out by the 4th defendantat that time were irrelevant to the defined issue unless these activities were also related to the unlawful interference by the 4thdefendant with the 1st defendantâs contractual obligations towards the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The position will be the same when the 4th defendant said that it had placed orders with Davidson of the 1/12 and 1/43 scale models. The plaintiff is still not entitled to these documents.  This is because at the moment there is simply no issue being raised asto the position of Davidson.  The fact that it may be a company set up by the 2nd defendant is irrelevant unless the plaintiff hasidentified in the pleadings that Davidson is somehow connected to the plaintiffâs cause of action against the 4th defendant.  Ifthe plaintiff itself is unsure about the status of Davidson, all the more the court should not be asked to speculate and order discoveryso that the true position of Davidson may be ascertained.  This will become a case of fishing for evidence which is not the functionof discovery.  For this reason the discovery of the first category of documents must be refused.</p>    <p><b><u>The second category</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I have already stated that the plaintiff had for the purpose of the present application identified the cause of action against the1st and 4th defendants.  Likewise it had also identified the breach of contract of the 2nd defendant.  The nature of the breach bythe 2nd defendant must be that it had in breach of clause 6.15 of the Agreement, not only not caused and procured the 1st defendantto comply with the restraint of trade provisions but that it had actually caused and procured the 1st defendant not to observe them. This is the only logical way of reading paragraph 16 of the Amended Statement of Claim which pleaded that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â In breach of the agreement..... the 1st , 2nd and/or 3rd defendants have ... embarked on a course of conduct to circumvent theircontractual obligations to the plaintiff....â. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> This breach by the 2nd defendant in turn caused the 1st defendant to breach its obligations towards the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In my view an issue has been raised on whether the 4th defendant and its subsidiaries were incorporated by the 2nd defendant as partof the scheme involving a breach of contract by the 1st and 2nd defendants.  The incorporation and company documents relating tothe setting up of the 4th defendant and its subsidiaries (which are foreign companies) must be disclosed. </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The plaintiff had conceded before the judge that it would provide the certificate of incorporation of the 4th defendant.  The onlyqualification is to the ambit of the nature of the statutory records of shareholders in the 4th defendant as identified by Item 6of the amended schedule.  Ms Eu submitted that they fall foul of the requirement in <i>Deak &amp; Co. (Far East) Ltd v. NM Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd &amp; Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20HKC%2078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) HKC 78</a> in that these documents are not shown to be relevant because they belonged to a class (by reason of their character) but only becauseof their content and it would be oppressive to search for and discover voluminous documents in order to ascertain the content.  Mr.Hingorani recognised the ambit is too wide and will confine the records to share certificates, bought and sold notes and trust instrumentsrelating to the beneficial ownership of the shares.  I agree that these will be the documents that should be disclosed under Item6.</p>    <p><b><u>The third category</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> As to the third category of documents, the 4th defendant had explained in the 2nd affirmation of Mr. Ibrahim that it had disclosedthe correspondence.  Since the plaintiff is not entitled to documents from the defendant relating to the 1/12 and 1/43 scale modelswhich it said was placed with Davidson, the plaintiff is likewise not entitled to documents under this category.</p>    <p><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Accordingly the appeal is allowed to the extent that the plaintiff is only entitled to the second category of documents as amended.</p>    <p><b><u>Costs</u></b></p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Although the 4th defendant only succeeded in opposing discovery of two of the three categories of documents, most of the argumentsbefore us were focused on the first category of documents which it had succeeded in opposing.  I will make an order <i>nisi</i> that the 4th defendant is entitled to three quarters of the costs before us and below.</p>    <p><b>Hon Suffiad J :</b></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Peter Cheung)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"><span>(A.
