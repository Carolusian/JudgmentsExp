to be therustic village of Sheung Wo Che ( ä¸ å è¼ ).  It is now separated from Shatin by Tai Po Road ( å¤§ å é ) and lies just immediatelywest of the KCRC East Rail line.  A footbridge from Lek Yuen Estate ( ç æº é¨ ), just north-east of Shatin New Town Plaza ( æ²ç° æ° å å¸ å»£ å ´ ), spans Tai Po Road and connects the village, allowing easy access to it and to the famous Lung Wah ( é¾è¯ ) pigeon restaurant located a few hundred metres nearby.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  For many generations the village was unaffected by modernity.  Now all that has changed.  What used to be a picturesque, arborealsetting for a few village-style houses has now become a patchwork of scorched earth, thrusting modern villas and one little crookedtin hut fully enclosed by a vegetation-laden fence.  In that hut still lives Mr. Li Wai Kin (âMr. Liâ) and his wife.  In an evensmaller similar structure within the fence lives Madam Wong Wor Hung (âMadam Wongâ).  Madam Wong aged almost 80 is the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in this proceeding and her son Mr. Li is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On the other side of this case are the 5 plaintiffs, who are indigenous New Territories villagers.  The family of the 4<sup>th</sup> plaintiff Mr. Nam Chi Cheung, Raymond (âMr. Namâ), have lived in the village for at least 10 generations.  The plaintiffs arethe various registered owners of 5 small Lots of land and claim that the Defendants have, by remaining in possession behind the fence,erecting the 2 structures and growing a few fruit trees, have trespassed and continue to trespass over their respective Lots. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The entire area of land within that fence and in the current possession of the Defendants is about 160mÂ² in size and is irregularlyrectangular in shape.  The land within the fence straddles: Lot  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">137 SA ss3</a>, Lot 137 SA ss 4, Lot 137 SA ss 5, and Lot 137 SA RP. (âthe disputed landâ).  Each piece of land has a different owner.  Governmentland is also within the fence.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Defendants have, however, also been, in general terms, on the other material piece of land in this case within the fence, Lot136 SB ss1, since 10 February 1974, when the first of 3 successive 10-year agreements to lease it was made.  That Lot is a smalland very narrow, triangular sliver of land about 22mÂ² (âthe rented propertyâ).</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>   </p>    <p style="text-align:center"><img width="479" height="678" src="http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/doc/judg/html/vetted/other/en/2003/HCA001454E_2003_files/image002.gif" /></p>    <p>The area A-B-C-Q-M-J-Z-I-A is 138.3mÂ².</p>    <p>The area A-B-C-Q-D-E-F-G-H-I-A is 91.7mÂ².</p>    <p>Lot 137 SA RP being D-E-F-G-H-I-Z-Q-D is about 25mÂ².</p>    <p>Lot 136 SB ss1 (the rented land) being Q-M-J-Z-Q is only about 22mÂ².</p>    <p>The area of the disputed land is A-B-C-Q-Z-I-A.  The Defendants claim all of it and, alternatively, several lesser versions of it. The larger temporary structure is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant's hut and the smaller one is occupied by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">Lot 137</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff is the registered owner of Section A sub-section 3 of Lot 137 (âLot  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">137 SA ss3â</a>).  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs respectively own Lot  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">137 SA ss4</a> and Lot  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">137 SA ss5.</a>  Since 5 June 1998 the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs have been the registered owners of the Remaining Portion of Section A in Lot 137 (âLot 137 ssA RPâ), having purchasedit from the Church Body of the Chinese Anglican Church in Hong Kong (âthe Churchâ): see s4 Chinese Anglican Church Body IncorporationOrd. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1012">Cap 1012</a> (repealed), now s4 Church Body of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Ord <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1158">Cap 1158</a>.  On the same day, 5 June 1998, the Churchhad also sold Lot  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">137 SA ss3</a>, 4 and 5 to the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs; they had in turn respectively on-sold on 22 September 1998, ss3, 4 and 5 to the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs.  The Church had been the registered owner of: ss3, 4, 5 and RP for years, well before 10 February 1974, the day whenMadam Wong entered the tenancy agreement with Mr. Lam Cheung Sing in relation to Lot 136 SB ss1.</p>    <p class="heading">Lot 136</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr. Lam Cheung Sing on 10 February 1974 rented a part of this Lot (âthe rented propertyâ) to Madam Wong for 10 years at $300a year.  It is common ground that the leased land did not include 136 SB RP.  In 1983 Mr. Lam Ping Hing inherited this land fromMr. Lam Cheung Sing.  On 10 February 1984 (âthe second tenancy agreementâ) Mr. Lam Ping Hing (the uncle of the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs) rented the land to Mr. Li, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  All terms, descriptions and conditions were otherwise identical to the first tenancy agreement, save that the annualrental was now $500.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The third tenancy agreement was identical to the second, except that the period commenced on 10 February 1994 and the annual rentalwas now $1,175 and the tenancy would expire on 9 February 2004.  The Defendants, however, still remain in occupation, despite thedetermination of that tenancy.  The 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs became the registered owners of the land under the third tenancy agreement on 10 June 2002. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Plaintiffs' solicitors first sent a letter addressed to the Defendants, demanding redress for trespass, on 17 January 2002. That letter was itself a response to a letter 5 days earlier from the Defendants' solicitors, claiming the land by adverse possession. The Plaintiffs issued the writ in this action on 25 April 2003. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Defendants deny they are trespassing and by defence and counterclaim seek a Declaration that by adverse possession they arenow the rightful owners of the disputed land.  The original pleaded counterclaim even sought title to Lot 136 SB ss1 (the rentedland) as well as to the Government land.  Both these scenarios were absurd â the former, because by actually paying rent the Defendantsnecessarily negatived any intention to themselves possess it adverse to the landlord; the second because it specially requires 60years of adverse possession against Government land and the Defendants had only entered upon the land in 1974.  By successive amendmentsduring the trial, the Defendants have eventually reduced their claim to the area A-B-C-Q-Z-I-A, as well as lesser included alternativesto that area. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Plaintiffs' case accepts that the Defendants did build in 1974 the tin hut in which Mr Li and his wife still live, just afterthe first agreement to lease had been entered.  Mr Li said in evidence it took him about 2 months to build the hut.  The case forthe Plaintiffs is that the hut is presently larger than it was after it was initially constructed.  Mr. Li accepted that he had overthe last 30 years modified and extended it from its original specifications.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The case for the Plaintiffs continues that the tin hut was not just built on the rented portion in Lot 136 sB ss1 but right from1974 it had extended into the land then owned by the Church; that the erection of the structure on the Church land was without anyconsent or approval from the Church; that the Defendants had therefore trespassed into that land; and that as Mr. Lam Cheung Singwas the landlord of the Defendants in relation to the contiguous rented land (from which the Defendants had trespassed forth), by1995 the Defendants' 20 years of encroachment into the Church land amounted to adverse possession of it, <i>not for them</i> â the Defendants â <i>but by them</i>, for and on behalf of the then owners of the rented land, and now for the benefit of the present successors-in-title, the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs.  For the Plaintiffs' reliance was particularly placed on the doctrine of encroachment and its presumption that any encroachment(even over the land of a third party) which occurs during the term of a lease is presumptively held for the landlord and not thetenant.  This doctrine was articulated in <i>Kingsmill v</i> <i>Millard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281855%29%2011%20Exch%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1855) 11 Exch 313</a>, 318-9 per Parke B and <i>Whitmore v Humphries</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281871%29%20LR%207%20CP%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1871) LR 7 CP 1</a>, 4 per Willes J.  The Defendants submit that this doctrine does not represent Hong Kong law and that in any event the conduct andcommunications between landlord and tenant successfully rebutted the presumption so that the encroached lands were held for the tenantsand not the landlord.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Plaintiffs' case is that it was not until about 1990 that the Defendants first enclosed the lands with a fence currently occupiedby them and planted trees and plants within it.  That case, at first blush appears internally inconsistent with the Plaintiffs' claimto adverse possession via the encroachment presumption, which is explicitly based on adverse possession by the tenants having occurredby 1995.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffs' Counterclaim to the Defendants' Counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Plaintiffs have also pleaded a counterclaim to the Defendants' counterclaim, stating that if, which is denied, that the Defendantsare found to be in adverse possession of the Plaintiffs' registered land, then basing themselves on the jurisprudence of the recentmajority judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>J A Pye</i><i>(Oxford) Ltd. v United Kingdom</i> application 44302/02, 15 November 2005, they claim compensation from the Defendants for the value of the land.  In <i>JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd. v United Kingdom</i> by a majority of 4:3 the Court concluded that where the <i>registered</i> owner of freehold land was successfully dispossessed by a trespasser's adverse possession then compensation was payable to the dispossessedformer <i>registered</i> owner. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In <i>J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd. v Graham</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20AC%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 AC 419 (HL)</a>, the precursor to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, Lord Bingham of Cornhill at 426G querried whether it was intrinsicallyfair and just for the <i>registered</i> owner of land, to lose title to his land without the party gaining title being ârequired to pay some compensation at least to theparty losing itâ.  By comparison, in the case of <i>unregistered</i> land, Lord Bingham accepted that the windfall to the squatter âcould no doubt be justified as avoiding protracted uncertainty wherethe title to land layâ.  But Lord Hope at 447A thought the unfairness did not lie in the lack of compensation, âbut in the lackof safeguards against oversight or inadvertence on the part of the registered ownerâ. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The need to adjudicate upon the counterclaim to the counterclaim only arises upon a finding of adverse possession.

The terms of that agreement to lease are handwritten in Chinese characters,witnessed and signed by the parties.  It is a very simple, homely document, reflecting the uncomplicated nature of landlord and tenantrelations in the village at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:center"><img width="565" height="349" src="http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/doc/judg/html/vetted/other/en/2003/HCA001454E_2003_files/image004.jpg" /></p>    <p style="text-align:center">Tenancy Agreement</p>    <p style="text-align:center" class="heading">(Translation)</p>    <p>The Lessor, Lam Cheung Sing, hereby agrees to lease to Wong Wor Hung a self-owned bare land at Lot No. 136B in D.D. 185, Sheung WoChe Village, Shatin located near the railway and âbeside' the footbridge leading to Lung Wah.  The Lot leased consists of 2 portions. One portion is located in front of the entrance of the golden house.

But an issue arises as to whether the areaactually intended by the parties to be let was that delineated by the reference to Lot 136B in DD185 as the Defendants submit, orthe much looser area partially described by local features, as the Plaintiffs submit.  The precise area of that Lot legally defined,had at the material times never been pegged or marked out on the ground.  Do the descriptors such as ânear the door of the goldenhouseâ, âin the vicinity of the lamp poleâ but âexcluding the refuse stationâ show that the original landlord erroneouslylet to Madam Wong, as the Plaintiffs submit, more land than he owned?</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On all the evidence I find that the original landlord was clearly aware that what he owned  was Lot 136 SB ss1 in DD185.  That wasall he let.  He did not intend to let what he did not own.  But he did not know, by examining the âbare landâ the physical boundariesof what he owned.  He knew it ran from about the door of the golden house (which still exists) to the vicinity of the lamp post (onestill exists, but may not be in the same place as in 1974), but did not go so far as to include the refuse station (which no longerexists).  The inadequacy of these references to 3 local features is obvious as they do not demonstrate the complete shape or sizeof the area.  They formed a casual, yet practical, geographical guide to the general location and were not intended to be definitivein any way.  They are themselves expressly conditioned by non-empirical words, like ânearâ and âin the vicinityâ.  Even ifthere had been an initial common mistake as to the real size of the rented land, a few months later in August 1974 any such issuewas resolved after a discussion between the parties.  This resolution is noted later in this judgment at paras [66], [79], [80],[83] and [84]. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The literacy standard of Madam Wong (who did not give evidence) was probably akin to that of the 2 other elderly witnesses fromthe village who did give oral evidence.  (Mr Yeung Sui Sang, who signed the 1974 agreement as a witness, could not read what theagreement said, and Madam Yau who signed her witness statement with a cross, could neither read nor write.)  All in all, I find thatMr Lam Cheung Sing only intended to let to Madam Wong what he owned, but that he was understandably unsure by mere visual referenceto the bare land exactly the boundaries of that land.  The annual rent of only $300 only underlines the intended informal natureof the contested descriptors in the agreement to lease.</p>    <p class="heading">Essential Factual Issues</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  It is agreed that the essential factual issues at trial are whether, when and where the Defendants erected the fence that currentlyencircles the property.

The separation point in the jurisprudence is structurally important in this area ofthe law, as the law in Hong Kong now is, that if a squatter in possession of land had the âintention to pay rent if the ownershad requested paymentâ (at 69E), that demonstrates that the squatter âwas not intending to exclude the owner with the paper title,but showed that he was treating himself as enjoying possession under a lawful title from the ownersâ.  See also the short concurringjudgments of Litton and Ching PJJ who each also held that the intention of the occupier to pay rent, if asked, was an express declarationagainst the claimant's interest and fatal to his case.  This reasoning is now fundamentally irreconcilable with the position of theHouse of Lords, which adopted the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Ocean Estates Ltd v</i> <i>Pinder</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20AC%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 AC 19</a>, which held that as a matter of principle, the willingness of a squatter to pay for occupation of the disputed land, if asked, didnot in law indicate an absence of an intention to possess the land by the squatter.

She confirmed that her father-in-law had passed away in 1983, when her husband inherited the property. Her husband, who had filed a witness statement, did not give oral evidence.  She had lived in the village for 55 years.  Her husband,on 10 June 2002, sold Lot 136 SB ss1 (the rented land) to the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs for HK$30,000.  That is the land now thrice let to the Defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In 1970, Madam Yau began renovating her own house, which was to the south of the âgolden houseâ.  At that time, Madam Wong occupieda small house near the garden of Madam Yau's place.  In 1973, Madam Wong was asked to move by Madam Yau, and for this reason, the1<sup>st</sup> tenancy agreement was entered into, in which Madam Wong would rent a piece of bare land further to the north of the piece of landshe was then occupying.  Madam Yau and her husband paid Madam Wong HK$1,500 as compensation, so that Madam Wong and her son, Mr Li,could build a new house on that rented land. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Madam Yau confirmed that after the Defendants had built the house on the property leased by her father-in-law, that they had installeda wire fence along the front of their house, parallel to the pavement under the footbridge.  However, Madam Yau stated that no fencehad been installed at the rear of the property, as she said that another family in the village, surnamed Wong (who reared pigeons),had already installed a wire fence some distance from the rear of the Defendants' house, so that there was no need for Madam Wongto install a fence at the back of the property.  Madam Yau said that that fence had been erected in 1965 and that it existed until2001, when it was pulled down by the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff as he had purchased the land over which that fence was built.  It was put to Madam Yau that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had erected another fence, parallel to the fence put up by the other Wong family, and very close to it.  Her reply wasthat because of the trees and vegetation she simply could not tell whether that was so or not.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Her evidence was that Madam Wong worked as a stay-in domestic helper, and only returned on the weekend to the rented property whereMr Li, his wife, and their 2 children lived.  She stated that Madam Wong retired in 1992 and only lived full-time on the site fromthat time.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Madam Yau denied that there was any oral agreement between her husband and the Defendants that they could live in the tenanted premisesfor life. </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  In the course of the Court's invaluable site visit to the property, Madam Yau gave further sworn evidence.  She stated that therefuse area, in the 1974 agreement to lease (and its 2 successors), had been right in the middle of the property now occupied bythe Defendants.  She demonstrated its dimensions and was insistent that it was so situated.  (All the other witnesses in the casewho gave evidence on this aspect were insistent that the refuse area was in fact not on the rented property at all, but was the smallpiece of land in front of the building called the Fire Prevention Committee Building.)  </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In addition, the witness confirmed that from as early as 1974, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had kept a dog at the rented premises and that throughout âthe area was cordoned off, as the dog was not fixed to a ropewithin the gardenâ.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The next witness was Mr Nam Chi Cheung, Raymond, the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff.   He and the 5<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff purchased all the land in Lot 137 Section A for HK$3,300,000 on 5 June 1998 from the Church.  This entire Lot comprised15 subsections as well as the Remaining Portion and totaled 2106.4mÂ².  Their intention was, in conjunction with a development company,to develop small village houses (each house consisting of 3 storeys of 700ftÂ²). </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In April 2000, notice of the proposed development had been placed at conspicuous locations around the village.  No one objected. As a result, the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff incurred the necessary costs of Building Licence fees prescribed by the District Lands Office (Shatin) under the smallvillage homes policy.  It was only in January 2002 that the Plaintiffs were ever aware that the Defendants alleged adverse possessionand because of that unresolved issue, the development could not proceed at least in relation to the land which the Defendants wereoccupying.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff's evidence was that the loss of profit from the inability to construct 4 houses (as only 3 can be built if the land isheld to be adversely possessed) was in the order of HK$3,300,000 â coincidentally, the same amount paid for the entire Lot 137â 15 subsections. </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  After he and his brother had purchased the property, Mr Nam said that on one occasion he saw Madam Wong planting ginger just outsidethe fence enclosing the Defendants' property, and he told her to desist as he was the owner of that land.  He also told her thatshe would have to return the rented property to him at the end of the tenancy in February 2004, as it was required for developmentpurposes.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Henry Chan, a qualified surveyor was called as an expert witness by the Plaintiffs.  He had prepared the plan incorporated inthis judgment (although the Court has itself modified it, by removing certain irrelevant matters and introducing 4 new co-ordinates(L, M, Q and Z), for the purposes of clarity).  In addition, he gave expert evidence in relation to the set of aerial photographsproduced by both sets of parties to the action.  He stated that the examination of aerial photographs (which was part of his usualprofessional requirements), depended on a number of factors including the height from which the photograph was taken, the time ofday, the angle of the camera to the object, the effects of shadows and the size of objects apparently within the photograph.  Hestated that an elevated structure generally will cast a shadow and that there can be relief displacement if the gradient of the underlyingland is undulating.  He accepted that it would be very difficult to identify from aerial photographs thin metallic posts supportingwire fencing from several thousand feet above.  If there was vegetation over that fence, the task became even more improbable, hefairly added.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In addition, Mr Chan stated that the location of the disputed fence, as it is now in 2006, is in a slightly wider position thandisclosed by the Defendants' own surveyor in 2002.  Mr Henry Chan accepted that the fence shown in DD5 (in 1998) was substantiallyin the place as the fence shown in C134 (in 2002), although at the points on the fenceline B-C, it was different and wider in themore recent survey.  The obtuse angle between A-B in C134 was also missing from DD5.   </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr Chan accepted that because the parties' different surveyors would have used Mr Li's hut as a measuring reference, it followedthat different surveyors may have used different parts of the hut as the reference point.  This was exacerbated by the fact thata temporary structure, such as the hut, did not have well-defined regular angles.  All of those facts he agreed, could affect theprecision of any measurements.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  While there is some difference between plan DD5 and C143, it is material to recall that even the Plaintiffs, who commissioned PlanDD5 in 1998, did not believe it to be reliable.  The scale is 1:400 and the Plan was designed as Mr Nam, the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff stated, as only a âprovisional draftâ, as the division of the whole of Lot 137 into the 15 sub-Lots had not even beenmade.  I agree that this Plan is of little utility as it was much less detailed as it covered a much wider area; it also saw thefenceline as a straight line whereas it never has been.  The Plan C143 prepared in 2002 and the Plan in para [6] herein preparedin 2006, are very substantially similar.  Any difference is truly de minimis.  The survey in 2006 by Mr Henry Chan of Henry ChanSurveyors Ltd on behalf of the Plaintiffs, is therefore fairly comparable to the Plan by Andrew Lau and Associates (China) Ltd preparedfor the Defendants in 2002.  The Plan prepared by Mr Henry Chan is more valuable being at a scale of 1:100; that by Mr Lau of 1:150.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Professor C Y Jim, who is the Chair Professor of the Department of Geography at the University of Hong Kong gave expert evidence,called by the Plaintiffs.  Prof Jim was clearly an eminent scholar at the top of his field, well qualified to give expert evidenceon the age of the trees found within the Defendants' fence.  After an exacting scientific survey and using statistical Pearson correlationcoefficients, he concluded that the jackfruit and wampi trees on the property were no older than 14.7 years.  His evidence was impressiveand ultimately unchallenged.  He did not give evidence about the age of the single longan tree referred to in the evidence of MrSammy Au, the expert called for the Defendants, as there were no comparator longan trees available in the surrounding areas whichcould be both measured by girth and for which reliable evidence of age was available.</p>    <p class="heading">Dendrochronology â An Unavailable Scientific Method for Trees in Hong Kong</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Prof Jim stated that the dendrochronological method, the science of tree growth rings, was not available because in Asia trees growcontinuously throughout the year without respite and without a marked difference in growth rate between the seasons, so that withouta clear distinction between wide rings (warm season with fast growth) and narrow rings (cold season with hardly any growth) withinan annual cycle, it is not possible to safely determine the age of trees, based on tree rings.</p>    <p class="heading">Mr Sammy Au</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Mr Sammy Au, a practising arborist, gave expert evidence, called by the Defendants .  His original report had given evidence ofthe age of the same trees as considered by Prof Jim.  Whereas Prof Jim found the oldest of those trees to be 14.7 years, Mr Au saidthat they were â30 years old or even moreâ â this is a huge difference and well outside the range of expected opinions between2 experts in such a matter.  I distinctly prefer the evidence of Prof Jim.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr Au was eventually asked only to give oral evidence about the single longan tree situated just northeast of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant's house (and not on the rented property).  This, in itself, was unsatisfactory as Prof Jim, for good reason, had not examinedthis tree.  One expert therefore was giving evidence about one tree which the other expert had deliberately excluded from consideration. In relation to this longan tree, Mr Au said it was also over 30 years old.  He had grown longan trees himself for much of his lifeand kept a nursery of some 60,000 different types of trees. </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  He said that particularlongan tree had poor drainage and growing space and that the soil was compacted around its roots restrictingits development.  He accepted that his opinion was simply based on recognising the ages of trees as a function of his own day today experience.  He emphasised that a tree is not necessarily columnar in shape that as the longan had a girth of about 0.5m measured1.5m from the ground, the age of 30 years plus was assured. </p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Despite Mr Au's zeal for his own conclusion as to the age of this tree, I am unable to find it established that it is more than30 years old; although it is, by its dimensions and proximity to the hut, obviously a tree though that had been there for some verysignificant time.  In the end, little turns on the age of this tree, as by itself it proves nothing.  The real issue in this caseis the fencing and the intention of the Defendants as deduced from the totality of their various actions in relation to the disputedland.</p>    <p class="heading">Aerial Photographs, Photographs and Plans</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  A large number of aerial photographs are in evidence dealing with views of the locality, from various heights.  The photographswere taken from 1973 and are generally in black and white and are inconclusive.  The disputed land in each of these photographs coversless than 1/2% of the total area shown, so detail is difficult.  The photographs have been relied upon to suggest or alternativelynot suggest, the existence of a fence surrounding the property.  In almost every photograph the alleged fenceline is obscured bythe massive overhanging crown of huge long-established trees (in the earlier photographs not being trees within the disputed property).</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The earliest fence on the property that can detected from any photograph is shown in photograph 2 on D6 â a photograph taken inMay 1998 from ground level, looking east southeast toward Shatin. </p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The Plaintiffs' pleaded case is that the Fire Prevention Committee had built the fence L-A-B-C, not the Defendants.  The Defendantshave never claimed to have built the alleged fence between L-A.   But Madam Yau, who on this point was reliable, stated that a fencethat existed near the line A-B had been built by the other Wong family; not the Fire Prevention Committee.  However, she would notexclude the fact that the Defendants had built A-B etc themselves, as thick vegetation prevented any person passing by from seeingwhether the Defendants had built a fence there or not.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  A number of Government Plans are in evidence.  They were designed for planning the neighbouring Lek Yuen Estate and generally concentrateon features over there.  None of the Government plans ever show the fence built by the other Wong family or the fence said to havebeen built by the Fire Prevention Committee.  It is not until 1998 that the Government plans ever identified a fence in the area. This is not surprising as the existence or otherwise of a fence in that area is of very little relevance indeed to the Lek YuenEstate, situated completely on the other side of Tai Po Road.  A surveyor's plan commissioned by the Plaintiffs does show a fencearound the Defendants' property in 1998. </p>    <p class="heading">Mr Li Wai Kin</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Mr Li, gave evidence.  He stated that shortly after his mother had taken up the 1<sup>st</sup> tenancy in February 1974, he built the hut and then a fence around it.  At that time he started rearing dogs.  The smaller hut wasbuilt in 1976-1977 and has been occupied throughout since then by his mother, Madam Wong.  His children grew up in his hut, withthe son being born in July 1979 and the daughter a few years later.  He was 23 years old when his mother entered into the 1<sup>st</sup> tenancy agreement. </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  No copy of the formal legal surveyed dimensions of the Lot referred to in the tenancy agreement had every been provided to the Defendantsby any landlord and only the general description in the tenancy agreement enabled him and his mother to loosely infer the area coveredby the tenancy, as it was all bare ground without markings or boundaries.  Mr Li and his mother built the hut, over a 2 month period. It was originally a very small hut, only designed to house himself and his mother.  Immediately after building the hut, his motherand himself built a wire-mesh fence to enclose the hut.  A gate with a lock was installed at the only entrance to the property; whichis still there.  They grew flowers, plants and trees within the fenced area.  They made the area within the fence their home.  Itwas partially paved with bricks and a little chicken coop was later built.   </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  About 6 months after taking up the tenancy, a building, known as the Fire Prevention Committee Building, was constructed just atthe southern end of the place occupied by the Defendants.  When that building was being constructed, one of the committee members,Mr Chan Kwan Lam, told Mr Li that the actual size of the area that his mother had rented from Mr Lam Cheung Shing was really rathersmall.  In the course of building that Committee Building, some attention had been paid to the formal boundaries on which that buildingwould sit, therefore, the size and shape of the land tenanted by the Defendants immediately north of it, came into consideration. Mr Chan stated to Mr Li that the bulk of the Defendants' hut had been built, not on the tenanted land, but was actually built onsome other party's land.  In the result, Mr Li, Madam Wong and Mr Yeung Sui Sang (who had been the witness to the 1<sup>st</sup> tenancy agreement) approached or confronted Mr Lam Cheung Sing, seeking to obtain a reduction in their rent, in the realisation thatthe actual area they had rented was tiny.  Mr Lam Cheung Sing, in the presence of his son Mr Lam Ping Hing (who had given a witnessstatement in these proceedings, which did not deal with this issue at all and who did not give oral evidence at the trial), acknowledgedthat he had only rented to Madam Wong the area he actually owned, which was very small indeed.  He refused to reduce the rent.  Becausehe was aware that the hut had been built over land owned by another party, he expressly stated that it was entirely the responsibilityof the Defendants to deal with any dispute that may occur or action that may be required because of their expansion into that land. He disclaimed any interest in or responsibility for the expansion and made it clear that he would be completely uninvolved in anymatter that may transpire in relation to that expansion.  Mr Lam emphasised that the agreed rental was not high, no matter how smallthe land actually owned by him was, and that the tenant had to continue to pay the original rent.  After further bargaining, it wasagreed that instead of the Defendants paying annually the rent would now only be paid half-yearly.  This was to show the dissatisfactioncaused by the non-disclosure by the landlord of the real size of the very small piece of land that he actually owned.  The Plaintiffsdid not cross-examine Mr Li to deny this incident.  Mr Yeung Sui Sang also gave evidence confirming that the conversation happened,in the full terms set out above.  He was not cross-examined about this matter. </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mr Li stated that from 1974 until an incident on 4 January 2002, when an excavator pulled down the fence surrounding the property,no one had ever challenged the right of himself, his mother, and family, to occupy and possess all the land within the enclosed fence. Mr Li stated that it was the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff who had directed that the fence be smashed by the excavator.  Mr Li reported this to the Police and instituted proceedingsagainst the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff in the Small Claims Tribunal seeking the cost of the damaged fence, the replacement of an electricity pole, TV antennaand cultivated plants and trees.  Those proceedings have been adjourned sine die by the Adjudicator pending a decision as to thisadverse possession claim.  In this case, there is no need for the Court to make any finding as to whether the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff was so involved or not â it is irrelevant for present purposes.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Upon completing the hut and the fence, Mr Li then began altering and expanding the hut by erecting a storeroom.  A cultivated gardenwas grown within the fence in 1976.  In 1984, Mr Li signed the 2<sup>nd</sup> tenancy which, as to the area rented, was identical to the 1<sup>st</sup> tenancy, ie the landlord made no claim to rent in relation to the area of land into the other Lots where the Defendants had trespassed.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Mr Li signed a 3<sup>rd</sup> tenancy agreement which on its face ended on 9 February 2004, although the Defendants have remained in occupation and possessionof that area.  No claim to the encroachment is made by the then landlord in the third tenancy agreement. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Mr Li stated that Mr Lam Ping Hing had orally agreed that he and his mother could stay and rent that area for life.  To my mind,that suggested conversation was unreal, and I need say no more about it, although I have certainly taken this into account in evaluatingthe rest of Mr Li's evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The first challenge to the Defendants' possession of the fenced area was when the excavator destroyed the fence in early 2002. Mr Li re-erected the fence, but as the land had been badly cut up by the excavator, the metal poles would no longer support the fenceat their original position so the new fence line A-B-C was erected about 1 metre inwards of the former fence line. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Under cross examination, Mr Li stated that he had not received the notice of the intention of small village home development dated17 April 2000.  He said, however, that even if he had ever received it, by looking at it he would be unable to identify from it thatthe property he had been living in since 1974 was to be affected by the development.  He was aware of the general development intention,but did not know until 4 January 2002 when his fence was smashed down by the excavator, that his land was involved. </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The hut in which he and his family have lived in was erected in 1974 before the Fire Committee Building was constructed.  Duringthe construction of the Committee Building, Mr Li permitted the builders to use the water but not the electricity at his home.  Hehad built the fence around his hut and that this was completed before the Fire Committee Building was constructed.  No fence hadever been constructed by the Committee.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  His mother, Madam Wong, had been a domestic helper, even before the 1970s.  She had baby-sitted for the So family in the village. On some occasions she stayed with her employers and on other occasions the So child stayed with her.  Madam Wong had retired in1981.  She had applied for public housing and did move in for 1 month with her younger son to a housing estate, in the winter of1981, before returning to live in the village.  Otherwise, she has continuously lived, apart from that month, in the rented premises.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Mr Li denied in cross-examination that the purpose of erecting the fence was to prevent his cats and dogs leaving the property. He reiterated that the main purpose of building the fence was to prevent other people coming in and to demonstrate the boundaryof his property â basic security of possession.  Plants and trees were grown inside the fence, but some were also grown outsidethe fence. </p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr Li said in 1976-1977, a longan tree was grown in front of the storeroom on the house.  At that time, he was expanding the house. A number of trees had been grown, but only that one from that era was left.  This was the tree examined by Mr Sammy Au.  The othershad been victims of typhoons and general decay.  Trees he had planted close together survived, but singletons had not.  I am unableto accept the age of this tree as being about 30 years of age or even more.  It has undoubtedly though been there for a large proportionof the time that the Defendants have been there.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Mr Li rejected the Plaintiffs' suggestion that he only expanded the fence line in the 1990s.  He said that A-J-K was there from1974 and had never been altered.  That the extension was in relation to A-B-C-K which had occurred in 1977. </p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Mr Li did not own any other land.  His 2 children have gone on to complete post-graduate tertiary education in Australia - one anaccountant, the other a mechanical engineer.  He and his wife had supported their education and living expenses throughout theireducation. </p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  He accepted that in August 1974 he learned that the land rented to his mother was very small.  Mr Li, who was paying the rent forhis mother, had stopped paying the rent for a short while in 1976 as a protest about the size of the land and the misrepresentation. He reiterated that Mr Lam Cheung Sing, on being confronted in August 1974 about the tininess of the land he actually owned, statedthat Mr Lam wanted nothing whatever to do with the other land into which the Defendants had trespassed.  Mr Lam's sole concern wasto obtain his money for his land.  That is all he wanted.  Mr Lam stated that even if it was only 1 square foot in size, that theDefendants still had to pay, otherwise they had to return that square foot of land back to him.  Mr Li said there had been 2 or 3separate discussions with Mr Lam before he finally did not dispute that the actual area of land he owned which they had rented, wasvery small indeed.  Mr Lam said he would not pay any attention to what had happened on the other land as, although the Defendantswere using it, it was nothing to do with him (Mr Lam), so if anyone claimed the land, in any dispute, Mr Lam would entirely disassociatehimself now, in relation to it.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  After this resolution, Mr Li had the incentive to further expand both the hut and to widen the area enclosed by the fence.  The2<sup>nd</sup> hut was also then built in 1976-1977 for his mother to live in, as he was getting married.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Mr Li said it was absurd for the Plaintiffs to suggest that he had between 1974 â 1990 only enclosed the front of his hut witha fence J-K leaving the back and sides completely open.  He stated that in 1990 he had replaced and upgraded the original fence asit was falling into disrepair.</p>    <p class="heading">Mr Yeung Sui Sang</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Mr Yeung Sui Sang, aged 75, gave evidence.  He lived in the village from 1953-1998.  He confirmed that the refuse collection pointin 1974 was at the place eventually built as the Fire Prevention Building.  He had done the leveling and formation work for the siteof that building.  He stated that after the Defendants had built their house, they then immediately built the fence enclosing it. He said the fence was expanded in about 1977 and in 2006 surrounds about the same area as it did in 1998, when he was previouslylast in the village.  He was a friend of Mr Lam Cheung Sing and of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  He witnessed the 1<sup>st</sup> tenancy agreement, although he was unable to read Chinese.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Mr Yeung was present when the Defendants challenged Mr Lam about the area and size of the property he had rented to them.  BecauseMr Yeung had witnessed the 1<sup>st</sup> tenancy agreement, he believed he owed a duty to uphold the fairness of the agreement, therefore, he was present when Mr Lam admittedthat Lot 136 SB ss1 was very small.  Mr Lam acknowledged that the Defendants had built much of their hut and garden on land ownedby other people, but he declined to reduce the rent, even though the piece of land he had really rented them was very small.  TheDefendants made it clear to Mr Lam that the rent was only for his land.  Mr Lam made it clear to the Defendants that his only interestwas getting the rent for his land.  In response, the Defendants said they would occupy the other land.  Mr Lam disclaimed any intentionto be involved in any way with that other land. </p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  As the matter had been settled by this conclusion, the Defendants thereafter extended their home boundary by erecting a wider fenceencompassing more land. </p>    <p class="heading">Mr Chim Yun Kwai</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Mr Chim Yun Kwai, aged 59, gave evidence.  He now lives in New York.  He lived in the village in 1974 and saw the existence of theDefendants' hut then.  He stated that the area currently enclosed by the fence is larger than it was in 1974.  In 1977 (on a daywhich was his son's 2<sup>nd</sup> birthday), he took his son to play at the Defendants' house and the property was then enclosed by a fence.  He was adamant that therefuse area was at the Fire Precaution Building and said it was âimpossibleâ that the refuse area was within Mr Li's propertyas Madam Yau had claimed.  The smaller hut of Madam Wong was present in 1977.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings of Fact</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  While Madam Yau was honest in giving her evidence, her reliability was generally very poor.  She was an amiable, elderly witness,who had only scant knowledge of the tenancy agreements â being completely illiterate.  Her contact with Madam Wong was virtuallynil after 1974 and her recollection as to the siting of the refuse area cannot be accepted.  She was emphatic that no oral agreementhad been reached with the Defendants that they could live on the site for life, although she did not give evidence that she was presentat the suggested conversation.  Her evidence as to whether Madam Wong did or did not live on the site, cannot be preferred to theother evidence, especially the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant's evidence on this point.  Also, her evidence that the 2<sup>nd</sup> hut erected on the site, in which Madam Wong lived, was only built in 1994-1995, after the 3<sup>rd</sup> tenancy agreement was signed, cannot be accepted. </p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Mr Nam's evidence was straightforward and there is no reason to disbelieve him in relation to the matters on which he gave evidence. The potential loss figure he referred to was general and globalised; even though he was oddly not cross-examined in relation toit.  He gave no sufficient oral evidence to make out the basis on which the case was opened, namely for a claim for aggravated orexemplary damages for trespass.  His witness statement did not deal with this issue either. </p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Mr Henry Chan's evidence was clear and given in a balanced way, completely consistent with an expert's duty to the Court.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  I believe the evidence of Mr Li that after February 1974 he spent the next 2 months or so building the house.  He immediately firstput up the fence along the line J-K to prevent any person entering the property, from the concrete footpath, as otherwise any passerbycould walk on to the land and avail themselves of anything there.  He then built up the sides of the fence and enclosed the propertywith a fence in the first few months after his mother entered the tenancy in 1974.  The original house was smaller than it now isand he expanded it over time.  He did so after Mr Lam Cheung Sing had unequivocally disclaimed any interest in or responsibilityfor the expansion on to the then Church land.  Mr Lam accepted that he let only the land he owned in Lot 136 and had no wish to beinvolved in any way in relation to any consequences of the Defendants' expansion, therefore Mr Li also expanded the fence in 1976-1977to approximately the position it is now in.  That fenceline position has changed for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the originalfence was falling into disrepair and was replaced in the 1990s.  It was gradually overwhelmed by the weight of the vegetation growingup, over and on it.  Secondly, the fence was knocked down by the excavator in January 2002 and had to be re-erected at a line abouta metre inside the original boundary.  That line was later widened back to about where the line had been.  It is now essentiallyin the same place as it was in 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  It is inherently probable that a family would wish to build a fence to surround their property, which would otherwise be open toall predations.  A locked gate in the fence yet with open sides or ends to the fence, is unreal.  Madam Yau, for the Plaintiffs,accepted that the Defendants' dogs were âcordoned offâ as early as 1974.  The evidence of Mr Yeung and Mr Tsim support Mr Liand I also believe their evidence.  I believe Mr Li's evidence as to the erection of the 1974 fence, the widening of it in 1976-7and the fact that the fenceline was generally maintained until the fence was destroyed by the excavator.  The necessary 20 year adversepossession period of the widened area was surpassed, at the very latest, by 1997.  I find that the fence line in 1997 and thereforethe boundary for the prior 20 years to then at least, is that shown by the plan at para [6] herein.  See para [53] earlier.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  The history of the aerial photographs is hardly conclusive but they do tend to reinforce the fact that the shape and location ofthe Defendants' perimeter has been broadly similar from 1977-2000.  In photograph D23, there is no trace of either the other Wongfence or the purported Fire Prevention Committee fence so it is not unreasonable to be unable to also identify the existence of theDefendants' fence, for all the balanced reasons given by Mr Chan the expert for the Plaintiffs. </p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Even if I were wrong as to this finding of fact and the other Wong fence did somehow partially mark the western boundary of thearea occupied by the Defendants at L-A-B, this would not alter my conclusion that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant's hut and the disputed land was from 1974 always enclosed by some fence.  On that alternative view, the Defendants' ownexertions in erecting the remainder of the fence would have âcompleted the circle' for the purpose of demonstrating possessionof the land. </p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  To be an adverse possessor a person does not have to construct the entire fence enclosure creating a defined boundary of controland possession; where the existence of a fence is in issue.  True, merely repairing an existing fence (see: <i>Wilson v</i> <i>Executors of the Will of Martin, Deceased</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20EGLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 EGLR 178)</a> or joining up a few missing parts may be, in many circumstances, too neutral a factor by itself to show  a wider intention to possess. But here, the Defendants, as a finding of fact, clearly manifested, through all their conduct of occupation, the intention to dispossessthe paper owners on the disputed land.  I apply the Court of Final Appeal's endorsement of <i>Buckinghamshire County Council v</i> <i>Moran</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20Ch%20623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] Ch 623 (CA)</a> as being the authoritative approach.  I also find, that Madam Wong was continuously present from 1974 until the present on the disputedland, notwithstanding her 1 month absence in 1981 and her occasional absences for domestic help employment.</p>    <p class="heading">Containing Animals by Enclosure</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  In <i>The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of</i><i>Hounslow v Minchinton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2074%20P%20%26%20CR%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 74 P&amp;CR 221 (CA)</a> (Butler-Sloss, Millett and Thorpe LJJ) the Court quickly dealt with an argument by the registered owner that a fence erected by asquatter to keep his dogs in, rather than other persons out, was not evidence of an intention to possess the land.  The Plaintiffsin the present case had taken the same approach in cross-examination.  In <i>Minchinton</i> at p233, Millett LJ (as he then was) said of the squatters:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBut their motive is irrelevant.  The important thing is that they were intending to allow their dogs to make full use of what theyplainly regarded as their land, and which they used as their land.  They wanted to keep their dogs within the boundaries of theirown land.  That was a perfectly understandable usage, but the enclosure which it made necessary was inconsistent with any continuanceof possession of the council.

If the tenant does this that land is presumed to be an addition to the land demised tothe tenant, so that it becomes subject to the terms of the lease and must therefore be given up to the landlord when it ends unlessthe tenant's conduct shows that he occupied the land for his own benefit, and not as part of the demised premises.  If the tenantholds possession of land belonging to a third party for the limitation period, the position is not entirely clear.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At p 484 the author also stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere have been very few cases where the rights of the landlord and tenant vis-Ã -vis a third party have been considered and thelaw is not entirely clear.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The third party situation is this case.  Neither of the 2 lessors of the rented land occupied by the Defendants since 1974, have everowned the other land encroached upon and enclosed within the fence built by Mr Li.  The issue is whether the Defendants as tenantsor the current owners of the rented land, have become, by adverse possession, the owners of the encroached upon disputed land.  Becausethe Defendants challenge both the validity and applicability of the encroachment doctrine, it is necessary to decide whether it representsthe common law in Hong Kong.  If it does, the next question is whether the presumption at common law has been rebutted so that theencroached lands have been held by adverse possession for the tenants, as opposed to their landlord.  </p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In <i>Whitmore v Humphries</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281871%29%20LR%207%20CP%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1871) LR 7 CP 1</a>, 4-5 Willes J said</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âBy the rule of law applicable to this subject the landlord is entitled at the determination of the tenancy to recover from thetenant, not only the land originally demised, but also any land which the tenant may have added to it by encroachment from the waste,such encroachment being deemed to be made by him as tenant as an addition to his holding, and consequently for the benefit of hislandlord, unless it is made under circumstances which shew an intention to hold it for his own benefit alone, and not as part ofhis holding under the landlordâ¦it is not confined to cases where the encroachment is upon land to which the landlord is entitled,it applies to cases where the land encroached upon does not belong to the landlord.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Genesis of the Presumption of Encroachment</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  The encroachment presumption that any encroachment by a tenant is for the benefit of the landlord âappears to be of considerableantiquityâ: <i>Earl of Lisburne v Davies</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281866%29%20LR%201%20CP%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1866) LR 1 CP 259</a>, 266 per Willes J; yet in 1795, both Lord Kenyon in <i>Doe d Colclough v Mulliner</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281795%29%201%20Esp%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1795) 1 Esp 460</a> and Thomson B in <i>Doe d Challiner v Davies</i> (1795) 1 Est 461, 462 did not accept that the presumption existed.

Theestoppel basis in those circumstances is compelling and a prima facie presumption in favour of the landlord is a proportionate complementto the landlord's rights of ownership and the grant of the tenancy, which have together provided the lawful opportunity for the tenantto be present on that land so as to be able to encroach on the other unrented land. The presumption in that scenario is a just solution.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  In terms of risk-analysis, the presumption in relation to third parties, which operates in favour of the landlord, appears to givethe landlord a windfall for little or no effort or anxiety.  The tenant exposes himself to the tort of trespass and mesne profits. The landlord has no liability for the encroachment, even if he has assented to or acquiesced in the trespass by his tenant ontothe third party's land.  Throughout the entire period of trespass (12, 20 or 60 years depending on the date of the trespass and whetherit is over Government land: ss 7(1) and 38A Limitation Ord) the tenant is presumptively annexing the encroached land for the landlord. At the effluxion of the necessary number of years of continuous adverse possession by the tenant, it is the landlord who is thebeneficiary of the consummated trespass, and who by operation of law extinguishes the former ownership and becomes by dint of verylittle the new title owner.  The landlord obtains all the benefit and has taken none of the risk: the tenant obtains no benefit andhas taken all of the risk. This scenario is conceptually and pragmatically distinguishable from an encroachment onto other land ownedby the landlord. In the former situation the landlord has evinced no conduct to unsettle his own lawful right of property so it ispresumptively maintained; in the second, the landlord is as much a stranger to the lawful rights of the real owner as is the tenant.No issue of the possible displacement of the landlord's pre-existing property rights exists.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  If I were realistically free to depart from the path-lighting of the settled English law, I would have held that the presumptiondid not apply in relation to the land of a third party and could only operate between the landlord and tenant and could not itselfderogate from or impact upon the proprietary rights of the third party owner of land encroached upon. The rebuttable presumptionof encroachment is on analysis the dynamic product of the passive estoppel arising out of the special contractual relationship betweenlandlord and tenant.  It is confined in its effect to the imputed or ascribed result which arises upon the reversion of the landlord'sown land at the determination of the tenancy. Notions of convenience and orderliness have in my judgment nothing to do with its diameteror rationale; it is all about a displaceable proprietary estoppel created by implied representation between landlord and tenant inrelation to the landlord's owned land.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  In Hong Kong there is no binding authority on the issue.  Indeed, there has not been any previous consideration of the <i>Kingsmill v Millard</i> common law line of authority at all; although in <i>Tam Mo Yin v Attorney General</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20HKC%20379" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 HKC 379</a>, <i>Smirk</i> was without contrary argument accepted as correct, in an orthodox case where interestingly the Government was landlord.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  In the present case, Counsel for the Defendants, has contended, but without any close argumentation, that <i>Kingsmill v Millard</i> should not be adopted, as here, in relation to third parties' land.  In âLimitation Periods' 1998, 3 ed, the author Andrew McGeeat p216 refers to the encroachment presumption doctrine as âa somewhat difficult line of authority.â</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  Any principled objection to the presumption though faces the formidable fact that in relation to third party land, as a conceptit has a 150 year pedigree.  English common law has always been widely followed in Hong Kong as providing a developed corpus of landlordand tenant and real property law as there is a real premium in predictability and certainty in those intertwined areas of the commonlaw.  In my judgment, the encroachment doctrine and the rebuttable presumption is a general principle of Hong Kong law, applyingto the land of third parties as much as to that of other land of any landlord.</p>    <p class="heading">The Presumption is Rebutted</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  I am well persuaded that the Defendants have rebutted the prima facie presumption by clear evidence, see paras [66], [79], [80],[83] and [84].  The most important evidence (which by itself is sufficient) relates to the Defendants' confrontation in August 1974with the then landlord as to the 1<sup>st</sup> tenancy agreement (at which his son, who subsequently entered the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> tenancy agreements as landlord, was also present). </p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  The substance and effect of that meeting, which was after 2 or 3 earlier meetings about the same subject, was that Mr Lam CheungSing wholly disclaimed any interest, right or entitlement to the encroachments.  He positively washed his hands of the whole issue. Although his motive may well have been based on a reluctance to become embroiled in downstream messy issues relating to the encroachments,he did assuredly inform the Defendants that âthey were on their ownâ in all respects pertaining to the encroachments.  He didnot claim the encroachments, he expressly disclaimed them : he disassociated himself from any interest in the encroachment.  He hadno wish or intention to annex the encroachments to his land; nothing could have been further from his mind.  He certainly did notcountenance the Defendants' actions which he plainly saw as being problematic and troublesome.  By conduct and by words he unequivocallylet the Defendants deal with the encroachments as a matter for their own exclusive benefit and risk.  This case is much strongerthan the facts in <i>Doe d Baddeley v Massey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281851%29%2017%20QB%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1851) 17 QB 373</a>, where the presumption was held to be rebutted.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  In <i>Stackhouse v Wade</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%2026%20MPR%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 26 MPR 312</a>, 317-319 Richards CJ of the New Brunswick Supreme Court concluded that the presumption may be rebutted where a lease is renewed andthe landlord does not include the encroachment in the new lease.  That is in accordance with <i>Attorney General v Tomline</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%2015%20ChD%20150" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 15 ChD 150 (CA)</a> where the same issue arose.  That is also what happened in the present case.  In the 3 agreements to lease the same piece of landwas let from 1974-2004; the encroachments were not included in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and third agreements to lease.  This is separately other evidence that also rebutted the presumption that the landlord was annexingthe trespassed land to his own title.

By a cross-appeal, the Plaintiffs sought tocontend that a larger area of the site should be the subject of a Declaration in their favour.  Harman LJ did not accept that thePlaintiffs could, without an amendment of the pleadings, seek a Declaration in terms different to that sought at trial.  At p361,he emphasised that relief had to be specifically claimed and stated âa Plaintiff ought not to be allowed to ask the Court to makea Declaration covering whatever area the Court shall after an inquiry conclude ought to be countedâ¦â.  He deprecated the Plaintiff'sapproach on appeal which he said âwas conducted after the manner of a Dutch auction where the auctioneer starts at the top priceand comes gradually down till he finds a bidder.

The fact that a Declaration is not specifically sought in the prayer for relief doesnot prevent one being granted: O15 r16 and O18 r15(1), <i>Hulton v Hulton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1916%5d%202%20KB%20642" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1916] 2 KB 642</a>, affirmed  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1917%5d%201%20KB%20813" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1917] 1 KB 813 (CA)</a>, <i>Loudon v Ryder (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1953%5d%20Ch%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1953] Ch 423</a>, 429 (itself curiously a decision of Harman J) and <i>Harrison-Broadley v Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%201%20WLR%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 1 WLR 456 (CA).</a>  It cannot be overlooked that, in an adverse possession case, the pleaded factual issues may permit of several possible variationsand permutations as to the edges or boundaries of the disputed land at the material time.  It would be unnecessarily demanding torequire the party to plead in the prayer every precise possible variation of the underlying factual dispute that could be ultimatelyfound to be proved.  It would be like pleading all the results of the peeling of an onion - in which every single layer generatesa slightly different and smaller variation of the one before it.  The real test is whether there is genuine prejudice caused by thisambulatory approach.  Here there was none.  It will always be a matter of degree; but the Court should not indulge pedantry as beingthe same thing as prejudice.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  It was objected that without absolute precision in the prayer the Plaintiffs did not know what they were facing and it was furthercontended that the Court would in effect be involved in an action to ascertain boundaries as in <i>Spike v Harding</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%207%20Ch%20871" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 7 Ch 871.</a>  I cannot agree with this submission.  The pleadings set out material facts and legal consequences which are sought to be drawn fromthose facts.  A party is not precluded at the trial from asking the Court to draw different legal consequences from the pleaded facts. We are no longer âback in the bad old daysâ when pleadings had to state the precise legal result: <i>In re Vandervell's Trusts (No 2), White v</i> <i>Vandervell Trustees Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20Ch%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 Ch 269</a>, 321G per Lord Denning MR.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  In <i>Zamir &amp; Woolf</i>, âThe Declaratory Judgment', 3<sup>rd</sup> ed p284, the authors conclude that the obiter remarks of Harman LJ in <i>Biss</i> should not now be regarded as of general application.  I agree as the emphasis in <i>Biss</i> was too austere.  <i>Biss</i> is also incompatible with the catechism in 16(2) High Court Ord.  Both O15 r16 and O18 r15(1) should now be viewed against that imperative. The authors also state</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn practice it frequently happens that it is only after the court has determined the facts that it will be possible to decide inwhat terms a declaration should be granted.  As long as the parties are given an opportunity to address the court on any proposeddeclaration it is highly desirable that it should retain as wide a discretion as possible as to the precise terms in which a declarationis granted.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  These pragmatic considerations correctly represent the proper approach in Hong Kong.
