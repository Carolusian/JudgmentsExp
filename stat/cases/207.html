As a result of the compromise the fatherâs action in fraud against the wife wasdiscontinued.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The course of the proceedings the wife had counterclaimed against the father, as 1st defendant in the counterclaim, and her husband,as 2nd defendant in the counterclaim, (the husband).  That counterclaim was for the tort of conspiracy to injure. As part of thecompromise, judgment on liability in the counterclaim in respect of a specific paragraph  in the prayer for relief was entered againstthe father and the husband, with damages to be assessed, such assessment to be determined at the wifeâs claim for ancillary relief.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 14 March 2011, I heard an application for directions in respect of the future conduct of both the ancillary relief proceedingsand the assessment of damages.  On 30 March 2011, while I was in the course of considering those directions, the wife wrote to thecourt seeking a direction that the assessment of damages be adjourned until the completion of the ancillary relief hearing whichwas set down in 2011.  That letter was copied to the solicitors for the father and husband.  They elected at that time not to respondto that letter, either to directly to the wife, or to the court.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  I accept that it is not a good practice that submissions or an application should be made in such a manner.  But it has, I regret,become a common practice.  The solicitors for both the husband and father were aware that the wife, although a solicitor herself,and who had formed a firm of solicitors to represent herself in these proceedings, was in reality an unrepresented litigant, whoseonly experience in litigation was these proceedings.  If they were concerned as to the fact of the letter or its contents, they shouldhave recorded their concern at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 4 April 2011, I handed down written directions in respect to the future conduct of both the ancillary relief proceedings andthe assessment of damages in the tort action.  I had this to say about that matter:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â22. It will be noted that none of the directions relate to the position of the father. I accept the submissions of Mr Whiteheadthat the father remains properly a party to the proceedings, first, because he is subject to an injunction in (the ancillary relief)proceedings in relation to his rights under the framework agreement, and second, because there is the outstanding issue of damagesclaimed by the wife against the father in the counterclaim in which she has succeeded, in the fraud action. These issues do not presentlyrequire directions but if any directions are required at any stage prior to the trial of the ancillary relief proceedings they maybe sought under the leave that will be reserved to apply.</p>        <p class="quote">23. For the avoidance of doubt, there will be an order that all issues relating to the damages sought by the wife from the fatherin the counterclaim in the fraud action are adjourned sine die, pending further orders, which may be sought by either party on 7days notice.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The directions that were subsequently given were confined to steps required to be taken in the ancillary relief proceedings, toput those proceedings in order for trial in October 2011.  It was my clear understanding at that time that the effect of the paragraphsset out above was that the trial of the assessment of damages would take place subsequently to, and separately from, the trial ofancillary relief issues.  Unfortunately, when the wife sealed the order reflecting the written directions of 4 April 2007, ordersto that effect were not included.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  I held a directions hearing in respect of the ancillary relief proceedings on 2 September 2011, at which time the father soughtdirections that the wife should file a schedule of damages in the tort action within 7 days.  I made an order to that effect.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  At a further directions hearing on 7 October 2011 the issue came before me again. The position adopted by the father and husbandwas, first, that the hearing of the assessment of damages at the same time as hearing of the ancillary relief proceedings was partof the compromise in February 2011. Second, it was argued that any damages the wife might receive constituted a resource which wasrequired to be taken into account in the sharing assessment in ancillary relief.  Reliance was placed upon <i>George v George</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20FLR%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 FLR 421.</a> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Following argument I ruled that the assessment of damages should be resolved at the hearing of the ancillary relief, but recognisedthat the wife might apply to adjourn that assessment.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 6 October 2011, a summons was filed by the wife seeking leave to amend the counterclaim and to adjourn the assessment of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I was satisfied that the terms of the compromise were such that it was not open to the wife to amend the provisions of the counterclaim,because the compromise, in terms, involved the father and the husband conceding to judgment in respect of specific paragraphs ofthe counterclaim, and a specific prayer for relief in that counterclaim.  In particular, paragraph 49 of the counterclaim containedparameters as to time.  The father and husband, having conceded to judgment within those parameters, were quite entitled to say thatthose parameters should not be extended or varied by subsequent amendment.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  I heard argument on the question of adjournment, and adjourned the assessment of damages, with reasons to follow.  These are myreasons.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Three arguments were advanced in opposition to the adjournment of the assessment of damages.  They are those set out in paragraph8 above, together with a further argument that the trial date was a milestone date which, having regard to the provisions of RHCO 25 r 1B, could not be varied, absent exceptional circumstances, which it was said did not exist.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  While it is right that reference was made in the exchange of correspondence leading to the compromise to the fact that the assessmentof damages would take place at the trial of the ancillary relief proceedings, and that fact was enshrined in the order that was subsequentlysealed, I am satisfied that trial at the same time as the ancillary relief proceedings was not an immutable part of the compromise,upon which the compromise might depend.  That that is so is clear from the fact that neither the father nor the husband found itnecessary to respond to the wifeâs letter of 30 March 2011, which, in plain terms, sought the adjournment of the assessment ofdamages until the completion of the ancillary relief hearing in October 2011.  The wifeâs solicitors had said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAccordingly, with a view to avoiding unnecessary expense, Ms Tsang requests his Lordship to direct that the assessment of damagespursuant to the above Order be adjourned until the completion of the ancillary relief hearing in October 2011 by which time the Courtwill have a much clearer picture as to the extent to which an assessment of damages would require further evidence and can give theappropriate directions.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In <i>George</i> there was an issue as to whether or not the husband owed a substantial debt to a third-party.  If that debt was owed, the pool ofassets available for distribution between the husband and wife would have been substantially reduced.  In such circumstances it issensible that the existence or otherwise of a debt should be determined prior to the assessment of ancillary relief.  Equally, ifa debt is arguably owed to one or other of the parties to the marriage, it would be sensible to determine that issue, as the existenceof debt has the potential to increase the pool of assets that is available.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The situation here is quite different.  In the present case a sum of damages, to be assessed, is owed to the wife by her husbandand his father, from tortious conduct on their part directly relating to, and arising directly from, the husbandâs the conductof the ancillary relief proceedings.  It cannot be right that that sum, what ever it might be, should be considered a resource availableto wife that might reduce any provision that the husband might otherwise have to make for her in ancillary relief. The effect ofsuch an argument is that the wife would effectively receive no damages at all from the husband.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In so far as the assessment of damages against the father is concerned, the question of ancillary relief provision for wife is irrelevant,except to the extent that the amount of the provision of ancillary relief will be a fundamental factor in the assessment of damagesagainst both the husband and the father.  If, as a result of the tort committed by the husband and the father against wife, the poolof assets available to meet her ancillary relief claim is reduced, and she should receive less that she might otherwise receive,there is a basis on which to measure the damages.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On the other hand, as the wife properly concedes, if there is no difference in the provision that would be made for her, then thedamages are likely to be nominal, there being no claim for either punitive or exemplary damages.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In those circumstances, it would unnecessarily complicate the trial of the ancillary relief to consider the assessment of damagesat the same time.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  It is right that a trial date is a milestone date, and that by O 25 r 1B(3), the court shall not grant an application by a partyto vary a milestone date unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying the variation.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  This is an exceptional case, with extraordinary circumstances, and I am satisfied that the circumstances set out in paragraphs 16-18are exceptional circumstances which justify the variation of a milestone date.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In any event, the requirement for exceptional circumstances does not exist under O 25 r 1B(1), which entitles the court, of itsown motion, to very any timetable fixed by it under O 25 r 1A.  Mr. Todd correctly acknowledged that that power would include thepower to adjourn a trial date.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  As I have said, this is an exceptional case with extraordinary circumstances.  In particular, it is entirely possible that the awardof ancillary relief to the wife will lead to circumstances in which all parties will recognise that the damages to be awarded arelikely to be nominal damages only.  Further, even without the amendment sought by the wife, additional valuation evidence would berequired to be presented by the wife, as it is the wifeâs case in the ancillary relief that she is entitled to 55% of the husbandâsavailable assets.  Such a case would require additional valuation evidence to establish a difference in value between the time ofthe ancillary award and the time parameters as pleaded in the counterclaim.  Such valuation evidence would add significantly to thelength of trial and the cost involved.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr. Pointer and Mr. Todd may rightly say that, in this respect, the wife should have put her house in order much earlier.  But havingregard to the procedural history of the matter, I am satisfied that the criticism is not such to justify forcing the wife to trialon the assessment of damages at the present time.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  For these reasons, I adjourned the trial of the assessment of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The wife failed in the application to amend the pleadings, but succeeded in obtaining the adjournment.  There will be an order nisithat there be no order for costs on the wifeâs summons dated 6 October 2011.</p>    <p> </p>	<p> </p>        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(John Saunders)<br />Judge of the Court of First Instance<br/>High Court</td>            </tr>        </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p> </p>	<p>Mr Charles Howard QC, leading Ms Lorinda Lau, instructed by Messrs Withers, for the Plaintiff by Counterclaim</p>    <p>Mr Martin Pointer QC, Mr Russell Coleman SC leading Mr Jeremy Chan, instructed by Messrs Stevenson Wong &amp; Co, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant by Counterclaim</p>    <p>Mr Richard Todd QC, Mr Robert Whitehead SC, leading Mr Robert Pang, instructed by Messrs Stephenson Harwood, for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendnat by Counterclaim</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2011/1484.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
