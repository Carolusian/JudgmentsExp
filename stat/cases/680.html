The plaintiff was the registered shareholder of a considerable number ofshares in the defendant bank. In May 1973 the certificates relating to those shares were presented to the bank together with completedshare transfer forms. The presentation was not made on behalf of the plaintiff or with his knowledge. It was made on behalf of aperson who had no title to the shares whatsoever. The signatures on the share transfer forms purporting to be those of the Bishopof Macau - the appropriate signature of the plaintiff: <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1006">Cap. 1006</a> - were forged. The bank attended to the presentation and in duecourse removed the plaintiff's name from the register, replaced it with the other name given and issued new share certificates accordingly.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The truth came to light a few months later and eventually the plaintiff brought this action to require the bank to reinstate it tothe register and make good the lost dividends, bonus shares, etc. The only defence raised by the bank was to deny that the signatureswere in fact forged. This defence was easily disposed of by the plaintiff and an order was made in favour of the plaintiff in Decemberlast year. Since then the plaintiff has taken no further part.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The third party proceedings are between the bank and the firm of stock-brokers who actually presented the share certificates andthe forged transfer forms. The first third party was the sole proprietor of the firm at that time. The other third parties are thepartners who took over the firm some time later but failed to issue a notice in accordance with the Fraudulent Transfers of BusinessesOrdinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/49">Cap. 49</a>. Fourth parties have also been added but I am not concerned with those at the moment.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Bank's Case</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The bank's case is that in presenting the shares for transfer the brokers both expressly and impliedly warranted that the transferforms and the signatures thereon were genuine. The express warranty depends upon the words of the covering letter sent by the brokers.That was in printed form with spaces left for the details of the particular transaction. The printed words were as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Dear Sir,</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          We beg to enclose herewith the undermentioned Certificate(s) for ................ shares in your Company with duly completedtransfer deed(s) attached in favour of</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">and shall be glad if you will kindly effect the transfer and send to us ....................... new Certificate(s) when ready as follows:</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          Thanking you for your kind attention to this matter.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="70%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="30%" class="quote">We are,</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="70%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="30%" class="quote">Yours faithfully,"</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> It is said for the brokers that the words "duly completed" mean no more than "completed properly so far as we know" or "completelyfilled in". I am not sure that I would agree with either interpretation. I would think the words more likely mean "validly completed"otherwise there is no need for them. But the point was not argued at length and I do not express any considered opinion upon it.There is no need. The case of <u>Sheffield Corporation</u> v. <u>Barclay</u><sup>(1)</sup> is good authority that in circumstances such as these the warranty is implied by law, that the person making the request is boundto indemnify the bank against any loss it suffers by reason of complying there with.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Defences</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The brokers put forward three lines of defence.</p>    <p align="left">(a) <u>The indemnity is a question of fact.</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> It is argued that although the law may allow an indemnity to be implied, whether it should be so implied in any particular case isa question of fact to be decided each time according to the particular circumstances. The argument is founded on certain passagesin <u>Dugdale and others</u> v. <u>Lovering</u><sup>(2)</sup>. At p.200 Brett, J., refers to the facts in the case as being</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"evidence on which the jury might find an implied promise to indemnify".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">And at p.201 Grove, J., says</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I should hesitate to say that in cases of this sort it can be an absolute proposition of law that the party making the request isbound to indemnify. Whether there is such an obligation must greatly depend on the circumstances of each individual case, the effectof which seems to be for the jury to determine."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> With every respect to counsel the case of <u>Dugdale</u> does not touch in any way upon the present circumstances. It was not concerned with the registration of shares. It was concernedwith the physical delivery of chattels to which there were rival claimants. There had been a suggestion that the indemnity couldbe implied by law but the court did not find it necessary to decide. It found that the indemnity was to be clearly implied from theparticular facts. The remarks of the judges were made in that context. They cannot detract from the law later laid down in the <u>Sheffield</u> case.</p>    <p align="left">(b) <u>The brokers did not request the transfer</u>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The letter requesting the transfer was headed in large type with the name and address of the brokers. It was signed by somebody ontheir behalf and chopped with their rubber stamp. It is nevertheless suggested that they should not be held responsible for it becausethey had not acted for the transferee in the purchase of the shares and were not paid for submitting the request on his behalf. Atthe time the transferee was not one of their customers. He was nothing more than an acquaintance of one of their messenger boys.Subsequently he became a regular customer. But I cannot see that these things matter. It was the brokers who in fact approached thebank. As a result of that approach the bank acted. And as a result of so acting the bank lost a great deal of money. It seems tome quite irrelevant and unnecessary to look into what decided the brokers to set that train of events in motion or to inquire whetherthey were paid or not for their part.</p>    <p align="left">(c) <u>The bank did not prove that it relied upon the implied warranty</u>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> My difficulty in considering this argument is that nothing was put forward to show why the bank should have proved this matter. Itis not a question of misrepresentation. That would apply if the bank were seeking to set aside a contract. Here it is not. It isseeking to enforce a contract, an implied promise by the brokers that they would indemnify the bank if subsequently it suffered loss.I do not see that the bank is required to prove that at the time it consciously took that promise into account.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In case I should be wrong in this view I should record that it was obvious that the staff of the bank's registry placed no storeupon the personality of those who submitted requests for transfers, whether those requests were made, as in the present instance,by letter or in person over the counter. In the latter instance no form of identification was ever required. Whether the conductof the staff of the registry would have been approved by those in authority in the bank I do not know. No evidence was called. Ishould also add, although the point was not know. No evidence was called. I should also add, although the point was not expresslyargued, that such conduct by the staff would not in my opinion amount to a waiver of the bank's rights.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It might also be convenient here to comment upon certain evidence given by Mr. Stanley Yeung, the first third party, to the effectthat whenever a broker dealt in a sale and purchase transaction of shares the broker put his chop upon the transfer form. In thepresent instance the transfer forms had no such chop, which, it is said, must have indicated to the bank that the brokers submittingthe forms had not dealt with the transaction and were therefore in no position to warrant that the applications were genuine. Andthen further presumably, by consenting to act with that knowledge, the bank had waived its rights against the brokers. Again I donot think that waiver would necessarily be established by those circumstances. But in any event the argument must fail unless whatwas in effect a trade custom was made out. Mr. Yeung was not an impressive witness. He did not appear to be very experienced in thebroking world. I am not prepared to accept trade customs on his evidence alone.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> If the brokers' defences fail - as they do - they seek to pass some of their liability back to the bank. Two suggestions need beconsidered:</p>    <p align="left">(i) <u>Contributory negligence</u>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It is suggested that with reasonable diligence the bank could have discovered that the signatures on the transfer forms were forgeriesand thus by their own negligence contributed to their own loss. The bank argues immediately that the suggestion is technically badin that the doctrine of contributory negligence is limited to an action in tort whereas their action against the brokers lies incontract. But a question that needs to be dealt with first is whether the bank is under any duty of care to the brokers, for if therebe no duty there can be no actionable negligence. And that prior question has already been answered by Lord Davey in the <u>Sheffield</u> case where at p.403 he says:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I am also of opinion that the authority keeping a stock register has no duty of keeping the register correct which they owe to thosewho come with transfers. Their only duty (if that be the proper expression) is one which they owe to the stockholders who are onthe register".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It is true that earlier in his judgment Lord Davey had referred to the need for the bank to act "without any default on (the bank's)own pat". But I do not read these words as imposing upon the bank duties which they would not otherwise have.</p>    <p align="left">(ii) <u>Contribution by a joint tortfeasor</u>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> It is suggested that if the plaintiff had so chosen it could have sued both the bank and the brokers as joint tortfeasors; then thebrokers would have been entitled to recover contribution from the bank under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19(1)(c)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a>. That reads as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"(1)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="14%" class="quote">(c)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="80%" class="quote">any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been,liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor of otherwise, so, however, that no person shall be entitled torecover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respectof which the contribution is sought."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> With respect one has only to read the paragraph through to the very end to see that this suggestion must inevitably fail. The bank<u>is</u> entitled to an indemnity against the brokers. Whether the bank is a tortfeasor as such or not - and it is not necessary to decidethis point - contribution cannot be recovered.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> If I am wrong in my conclusions on these two suggestions I would have held the bank and the brokers equally to blame. The bank shouldhave noticed that the signatures were forgeries. The discrepancies with the genuine were immediately obvious to the naked eye. Thebank had a genuine signature with which they could have made comparisons. It was kept for that very purpose. But I do not think thatin the particular instances it can have been so used. It was also suggested that other matters should have raised the suspicionsof the bank, for example, the size of the transaction, the fact that the plaintiff usually purchased rather than sold shares, thatthe address of the apparent purchaser was what might be thought a poor area of Hong Kong and that the signatures of the seller andpurchaser were both witnessed by the same person. I do not agree with these suggestions. They are not matters to which to my mindnecessarily suggest deceit. Then a great deal of time was also taken up with the examination of the internal procedures of the registryof the bank. Eventually it was shown that, perhaps due to pressure of work, the staff of the registry did not carry out those proceduresas thoroughly as they might. But that is a matter for the bank alone. The only aspect possibly relevant to this case is the failureto check the signatures.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The brokers were likewise to blame in that no effort whatsoever was made to check upon the identity or bona fides of the person onwhose behalf they consented to act.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> There remains only one further point to consider. It is raised by the third, fourth and fifth third parties. They argue that theplaintiff was to some extent the author of his misfortune. Before one set of transfers were registered, and perhaps both, the bankwrote to the plaintiff advising the plaintiff that a request for transfers had been lodged and indicated that unless they heard fromthe plaintiff by return of post they would assume that the transfers were in order. The plaintiff ignored the letter. It is easyto sympathize with the third parties. One would have expected an immediate reply. If so there would probably have been no fraud.The plaintiff in a sense could therefore have prevented the fraud. But that does not make the plaintiff responsible for it. The finalstep in the fraud was initiated by the brokers.
