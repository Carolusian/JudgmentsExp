It appears that he was not notified of the start date of thetrial. However, using a mobile telephone number that Mr Li had provided to the Court, the Court clerk managed to speak with him onthe morning of the start of the trial. The Court clerk informed me (and I so stated in open court) that Mr Li made it clear thathe had no wish to take part in the trial and did not wish me to adjourn the trial to enable him to do so. In these circumstancesthe trial proceeded in his absence. I should add that (unlike the other parties) Mr Li has not filed any witness statement.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In outline, the Plaintiff's claims against Mr Li are for repayment of a loan and for damages for his misrepresentations inducingthe Plaintiff to grant to the Bank a mortgage of a flat she owned ("the 1996 Mortgage" and "the Property"). The claims against theBank are for relief in respect of the 1996 Mortgage.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The specific claims as they have emerged during the course of the trial are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) As against Mr Li:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) A claim for the repayment of a loan of $3,301,960.27 advanced by the Plaintiff to Mr Li on 23rd December 1994 as to $2m and 28thDecember 1994 as to the balance.</p>            <p>(b) Damages for deceit alternatively damages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a> in respect of representations Mr Li made to the Plaintiff as to the terms and effect of the 1996 Mortgage.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(2) As against the Bank, a claim for financial relief in respect of the 1996 Mortgage on the ground that the Bank had constructivenotice that the Plaintiff's granting of the mortgage had been procured by Mr Li's above-mentioned misrepresentations and/or by undueinfluence exercised by Mr Li over the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The above position was reached after a number of changes to the Plaintiff's pleaded case during the trial, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) As against Mr Li:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) The Plaintiff's originally pleaded claims in relation to the 1996 Mortgage included a claim for damages for negligent misstatement(<em>Hedley Byrne</em> liability). However, by re-amendments made during the trial this claim was dropped.</p>            <p>(b) The Plaintiff pleaded claims for damages for deceit or for misrepresentation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3(1)</a> or for negligent misstatement in relation to a further mortgage of the Property which the Plaintiff granted to the Bank in 1998 ("the1998 Mortgage"). However, late in final submissions Leading Counsel for the Plaintiff conceded that the 1998 Mortgage did not makethe Plaintiff's financial position any worse as compared with her position under the 1996 Mortgage and that consequently there wouldbe no point in my deciding the Plaintiff's pleaded claim in respect of the 1998 Mortgage.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(2) As against the Bank:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) As stated above, one of the two limbs of the Plaintiff's case that the Bank had constructive notice of Mr Li's wrongdoing in relationto the 1996 Mortgage was that it had notice of Mr Li's misrepresentations which allegedly induced the Plaintiff to enter into thatmortgage. Such a claim was not pleaded. However, during final submissions, Counsel for the Bank elected not to take this pleadingpoint.</p>            <p>(b) The Plaintiff's originally pleaded claim against the Bank was for rescission of both the 1996 and the 1998 Mortgages. However,having regard to the fact that the Property was sold by the Bank pursuant to its power of sale in May 2000 to a bona fide purchaserwithout notice of the claims, the Plaintiff claimed financial relief in lieu of rescission.</p>            <p>(c) Since financial relief was claimed instead of rescission, there was no point pursuing the claim in respect of the 1998 Mortgage,for the same reason as in the case of the claim against Mr Li.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> I should also mention that in final submissions the Plaintiff made an application to re-re-amend the Statement of Claim to expandthe allegations of misrepresentation in respect of the 1998 Mortgage as against the Bank. I reserved my ruling. However, the applicationbecame academic when the Plaintiff elected not to pursue the claim in respect of the 1998 Mortgage. In case it might become relevant,I refuse the application, which was made far too late and, if granted, would inevitably have resulted in an adjournment of the trialto enable the Bank to prepare its defence to the new allegations. In these circumstances, I do not think it would be fair to theBank to allow the application.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's evidence</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The Plaintiff was educated at a school where Chinese was the medium of instruction, and where she reached Form 5. Although the Plaintifflearned English at school, she is not proficient in the language. She can, however, read straightforward letters and the like (forexample, she was able to read the Bank's letter of acknowledgment dated 3rd September 1996).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Plaintiff and her husband and sister have run a building materials supply business called Chung Ying Building Materials Co Ltd("Chung Ying") since 1974. She has a 25% shareholding in Chung Ying. By 1994 the company had an annual turnover of about $10m. ThePlaintiff appears to have played a general administrative role in the business.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The Plaintiff wholly owns an investment company called Perfect Target Investment Company Ltd ("Perfect Target") which was the Plaintiff'svehicle for property investments including the Property. The Plaintiff had had five or six property dealings by 1994. She acknowledgesthat, by 1994, she was not unfamiliar with the procedures for executing conveyancing documents.</p>    <p class="heading">The relationship between the Plaintiff and Mr Li: 1992-end 1994</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The Plaintiff's account of her relations with Mr Li in this period can be summarised as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The Plaintiff came to know Mr Li in about 1992 through his wife, whom she had known since 1990. They were introduced at a socialclub in Tak Hing Street, Kowloon, which Mr Li owned and operated. They became friends. They met about once a month at social gatherings,at dinners and at the club. In 1994 the Plaintiff joined a party of about 30 on a trip to Zhuhai which Mr Li paid for. It appearslikely that it was on this trip that she met Mr Ip Man On ("Mr Ip"), whom Mr Li introduced as his business partner.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The Plaintiff says by the end of 1994 her relationship with Mr Li remained that of good friends. They addressed each other as eldersister and younger brother, because they shared the same family name, they were good friends and he did not have a sister. From whatMr Li and his wife told the Plaintiff, she believed he had large investments in Zhuhai in hotels, restaurants, fashion outlets andland. The Plaintiff says that at one point he said he had turned down an offer of $200m to purchase his investments in Zhuhai. ThePlaintiff thought he was wealthy, generous, kind, dutiful to his mother and resourceful in business. She trusted him as a friend,having no doubts about his integrity.</p>    <p class="heading">Mr Li's purchase of building materials: 1994</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The Plaintiff's account of dealings with Mr Li over building materials can be summarised as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> In 1994 Mr Li started to order building materials from Perfect Target for delivery to Zhuhai. The Plaintiff says that Perfect Targetwas used as supplier rather than Chung Ying because Mr Li suggested that he should order from a company wholly owned by her (thoughthe reasoning was not explained).</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The materials were supplied on one month's credit. At first, Mr Li paid punctually. However, by about mid-1994 he had fallen intosubstantial arrears. By December 1994 he owed over $1m to Perfect Target. The Plaintiff chased him over the outstanding account,but without success. He said he could not pay because, although he had plenty of assets, he was short of cash. It appeared to thePlaintiff that he was genuinely unable to pay.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> This outstanding account was a significant receivable for Perfect Target and created a cashflow problem for the company. The Plaintiffproduced a contemporaneous summary of outstanding invoices on Perfect Target notepaper as at 9th December 1994 addressed to OpenCentre Co Ltd for the attention of Mr Li. The address given was the same as that of Mr Li's club. This summary shows $1,275,498.00to be outstanding, together with a Perfect Target invoice of the same date for $17,600.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Plaintiff says Mr Li stopped ordering building materials from Perfect Target in December 1994.</p>    <p class="heading">The investment: 1994-1995</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The Plaintiff's account of how she came to make an investment in a property venture with Mr Li can be summarised as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> About a month after the trip to Zhuhai in 1994, Mr Li invited to dinner at his club all those who had gone on the trip and announceda venture he had in mind involving purchasing two ground floor shops in a building in Hillwood Road, Kowloon, and running there arestaurant the income from which would service the mortgage loan to be taken out to part finance the acquisition. He was bullishabout the property market, and his idea was to sell off the shops at a profit after the market rose. The Plaintiff shared his bullishview and thought the venture would produce a handsome profit.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> By this time the Plaintiff's brother-in-law, Lau Wai Leung ("Mr Lau"), had become friendly with Mr Li and his wife. Mr Li persuadedMr Lau to look at the Hillwood Road shops, which apparently he did, and sought to persuade Mr Lau to invest in the venture. Mr Lauformed the view that the proposed investment would be a good one, and suggested to the Plaintiff that they should invest in the projecttogether. Mr Li's wife also expressed bullish views and sought to persuade the Plaintiff to invest. The Plaintiff also spoke to MrLi on a number of occasions when he expressed the view that the prospects of the venture were good. She shared his view.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The information Mr Li gave the Plaintiff (and, presumably, Mr Lau) about the proposed investment was as follows. Mr Li was stilllooking for further investors. The value of the shops was about $32m. A deposit of about $12m would be necessary. The investmentswould take the form of shares in two limited companies, Fairsheen Ltd ("Fairsheen") and Bright Wick Ltd ("Bright Wick") which wouldown the shops. The investments would be the subject of formal documentation executed at a firm of solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> She was under the impression that her and Mr Lau's share in the venture would amount in total to one twelfth, on the basis that thedeposit would be $12m and her and Mr Lau's investment would amount to $1m.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The Plaintiff deliberated on the matter, taking time to work out how much money was available to her and how much to put up. Eventually,she agreed to invest $750,000 and Mr Lau agreed to invest $250,000. She decided to make the investment because she thought the venturewould be profitable and would be within her means.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> In her witness statement the Plaintiff says she gave Mr Li two cheques, each for $500,000, the payee's name left blank, coveringboth her contribution and Mr Lau's (because he did not then have the money). However, there was no supporting evidence of the drawingor payment of such cheques. On the last day of the trial, the Plaintiff was recalled to give further evidence. She stated that herand Mr Lau's investments were paid for by four cheques, which she produced, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:center" width="3%"></td>                <td width="15%"><em>Date</em></td>                <td width="15%"><em>Drawer</em></td>                <td width="30%"><em>Drawee</em></td>                <td width="20%"><em>Amount($)</em></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%">1.</td>                <td width="15%">20.4.94</td>                <td width="15%">Plaintiff</td>                <td width="30%">                    <p align="left">Blank</p>                </td>                <td width="20%">200,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%">2.</td>                <td width="15%">20.6.94</td>                <td width="15%">Lau</td>                <td width="30%">                    <p align="left">"</p>                </td>                <td width="20%">200,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%">3.</td>                <td width="15%">3.6.94</td>                <td width="15%">Plaintiff</td>                <td width="30%">                    <p align="left">Open Centre Co.

As to the second cheque, she says she waswith Mr Lau when he cashed the cheque and paid the cash to Mr Li. She says she gave the last two cheques to Mr Li and she drew themin favour of Open Centre Co Ltd at his request. This is the company to which Perfect Target's summary of outstanding invoices andthe invoice mentioned in paragraph 16 above were addressed.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In November 1994 the restaurant was opened, and the investors (including the Plaintiff and Mr Lau) went to the opening ceremony.She recognized some of the investors there, including Mr Patrick Chung.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The Plaintiff said in her oral evidence that she thought it was some time after the restaurant was opened, and probably at Mr Li'sclub, that she was given a handwritten document headed "The following details should be registered in each of Fairsheen Ltd and BrightWick Ltd". This document was annexed to the Plaintiff's witness statement without any explanation except that it was a "scheduleof investors". The first column lists 12 names, which, according to the Plaintiff's description of the document in her statement,must be the names of the investors. Against each name is a number or a cross. The Plaintiff's name appears twice, once with 75 andonce with a cross. Against Mr Lau's name is 25. The Plaintiff interprets these numbers as referring to her investment of $750,000and Mr Lau's of $250,000. As to the entry of the Plaintiff's name with a cross, which the Plaintiff interprets this as representinga budgeted or hoped for further investment she might make. The rest of the document, consisting of three further columns of figureshas not been explained.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The Plaintiff says it was not until April or May the following year, 1995, that Mr Li made arrangements for the Plaintiff to attendthe offices of a firm of solicitors (John F.W. Lau &amp; Co) to execute documents as to her share in the Hillwood Road venture. Thereshe met Mr Li and signed various documents. Mr Lau was there, as were other co-investors. They all signed similar documents. Thedocuments she signed were all undated save for the year, which was 1994. The documents were as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) There was agreement between the Plaintiff and Bright Wick signed on Bright Wick's behalf by Mr Ip. By the terms of this agreementthe Plaintiff agreed to lend Bright Wick $1,011,690 to pay for an issue of an unspecified number of shares in Bright Wick to her.However, she says that in fact she never agreed to make a loan to Bright Wick, a name which means nothing to her. She says she signedthe document without having read it or having had it interpreted or explained. She just signed it as asked because it was a "usualsort of document", she trusted Mr Li and the solicitors and anyway Mr Li told her it was only a temporary document.</p>        <p>(2) There were instruments of transfer and bought and sold notes for the transfer by Mr Ip to the Plaintiff of a total of 1605 Fairsheenshares. Again, the Plaintiff says she did not read the documents and no one explained them to her.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's loan to Mr Li and the 1994 Mortgages</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> On the Plaintiff's evidence, by December 1994 she had allowed Mr Li to run up an account of over $1m for building materials, whichhe was unable to pay for and she had paid for her investment but had not yet received any shares. It was against this backgroundthat the Plaintiff says Mr Li asked her for a loan.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The Plaintiff says Mr Li explained he was short of cash, having spent a lot of money to open the restaurant and on his Zhuhai investments,and not having collected from all the investors. He expressed confidence that his investments would yield big profits. He said alot of money would be coming in. He said he would be able to repay her in six months or at most a year. He promised security. Atfirst the Plaintiff refused him, telling him she did not have the money. He continued to press her, but she continued to resist andto chase him for payment of the outstanding account for building materials. He asked her if she had any property which could be mortgagedto raise a loan to him. Having ascertained from her that she owned the Property, and that it was mortgaged to the Nanyang CommercialBank ("NCB") for about $3.2m, Mr Li proposed that he should use his contacts to find a lender prepared to refinance the Propertyfor a larger loan.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The Plaintiff says Mr Li told her he had found lenders who would advance a loan of $6.5m on the security of the Property to be repaidwithin 12 months. In re-examination the Plaintiff said Mr Li told her that the loan would be repayable by instalments.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Eventually the Plaintiff agreed to help Mr Li out of his financial difficulties by refinancing the Property to raise $3.2m whichshe would lend him. The Plaintiff left it to Mr Li to chose a lender. In evidence she stated that she lent Mr Li the money becauseshe trusted him not to cheat her and she did not realise the risks she was running. She also said that, because she was under theimpression she was the borrower under the mortgage, the Property was safe (i.e., presumably, it would not be mortgaged for a higheramount without her consent). According to the Plaintiff (to summarise various parts of her evidence) the following terms were agreed:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The outstanding amount due to Perfect Target would be paid out of the loan money.</p>        <p>(2) The loan would be repayable in six months.</p>        <p>(3) The loan would be secured by additional shares in the Hillwood Road venture.</p>        <p>(4) The Plaintiff would be named the borrower under the mortgage.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) Mr Li would pay the principal and interest due to the lenders, but the amount representing what the Plaintiff would have paidNCB under the redeemed mortgage would be deducted from the Plaintiff's loan to him.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The payment of the outstanding amount due to Perfect Target had a positive effect on the Plaintiff's cashflow, and in chief she acknowledgedher need of working capital, though she says that in 1994 she had no borrowing requirement.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> In relation to the agreed security for the loan, the Plaintiff's evidence is that Mr Li told her that the security should put hermind at ease, that she thought the security was acceptable and that it did in fact give her comfort in lending to him.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Mr Li asked the Plaintiff to attend the offices of the mortgagee's solicitors (Ho &amp; Wong) to execute the necessary documents.This she did on 23rd December 1994. Mr Ip joined them. Two mortgages were executed ("the 1994 Mortgages"), one in favour of Yu TaiHing Co Ltd ("Yu Tai"), the other in favour of Sinohill Holdings Ltd ("Sinohill"). The Yu Tai mortgage was a first charge securinga facility of $5m to Fairwealth Industries Ltd ("Fairwealth", later renamed Keeland Ltd), for which the Plaintiff was jointly liable,the whole repayable in 12 months (without instalments of principal), with interest at 1.5% per month and default interest at 1.8%per month. In fact, Fairwealth was substantially owned by Mr Ip, and the 2nd Defendant was a director and nominee shareholder, thoughthere is no evidence the Plaintiff was aware of this. The Sinohill mortgage was a second charge securing general credit facilitiesto Fairwealth to an unlimited extent repayable on demand, for which the Plaintiff was jointly liable.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Although the Plaintiff maintains Mr Li told her that under mortgage(s) the $6.5m loan was repayable within 12 months, she also maintainsthat he promised to repay the loan within six months.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The Plaintiff's witness statement contains no account or criticism of the way the mortgages were executed. However, she gave a gooddeal of oral evidence as to this which can be summarised as follows. (I should add that it appears from her evidence that the Plaintiffdid not distinguish between the two mortgages.)</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) She said the attending solicitors' clerk presented the documents to her in a stack (so presumably there were, in addition to thetwo mortgages, other, related, documents to sign).</p>        <p>(2) She says the solicitors' clerk gave her a partial explanation of the documents. According to the Plaintiff, the clerk told her:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) the mortgage loan was $6.5m (which was true so far as it went, but there was no limit to the amount secured by the Sinohill mortgage);</p>            <p>(b) the repayment period was one year (which was true as to the Yu Tai mortgage but untrue as to the Sinohill mortgage);</p>            <p>(c) what the repayment instalments were (there were none);</p>            <p>(d) what the rate of interest was.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(3) She claims the clerk did not tell her the borrower was Fairwealth. She gave differing accounts as to whether the clerk explainedshe was the borrower under the mortgages. At one stage she appeared to be saying this was a matter of assumption on her part. However,later in the evidence she positively stated that the clerk had misrepresented that she was the borrower.</p>        <p>(4) She says there was neither signature nor seal of Fairwealth (which i.e. they were added later).</p>        <p>(5) She maintains that, had she realised Fairwealth was the borrower under the mortgages, she would not have executed them since sheknew nothing of Fairwealth.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The distribution of the mortgage loan</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> $6.5m was advanced under the 1994 Mortgages. The NCB mortgage was redeemed on the same date at a total cost of $3,225,173.60. Therewas therefore a surplus of $3,274,826.40. The cost of redemption included $27,133.87 for penalty interest which Mr Li had agreedto be responsible for and be included in his loan, so the agreed loan amount was $3,301,960.27. This is the amount claimed. However,this was not the net sum actually realised from the mortgages, because there were deductions for the Plaintiff to settle in respectof what Mr Li told her were commission payments and solicitors' fees (and presumably stamp duty). The net amount paid to her was$3,092,313.94.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> At Mr Li's suggestion, on the same date, the Plaintiff opened a savings account with the Bank of East Asia. The passbook is in evidenceand it shows that on the same date there was a deposit of $3,092,313.94 and a withdrawal of $2m in cash. (There is no evidence asto the manner in which the $3,092,313.94 came into the Plaintiff's hands.) The Plaintiff says that on the same date she handed overthe $2m cash to Mr Li. The passbook also shows that on 28th December 1994 she withdrew $1,092,025, leaving a very small balance.She says the $1,092,025 was used to settle the outstanding amount due to Perfect Target for building materials, pursuant to the agreementshe had reached with Mr Li.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1995 Mortgage</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The Plaintiff's witness statement does not deal with the mortgage she executed in favour of Luk Fai Investment Ltd ("Luk Fai") on4th August 1995 ("the 1995 Mortgage"). This mortgage was entered into while the Fairwealth mortgage still had over four months torun. It secured a six-month loan of $6.5m to the Plaintiff, the named borrower, the whole loan being repayable on 4th February 1996(i.e. without instalments of principal) with interest at 21.6% per annum payable in equal monthly amounts of $117,000 and with defaultinterest at 4% per month. This interest was of course very much higher than under the Yu Tai mortgage. The $6.5m paid off the 1994Mortgages.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The Plaintiff's evidence of this mortgage can be summarised as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> As stated above, it was the Plaintiff's evidence that Mr Li promised he would repay the mortgage loan in 6 months and the 1994 Mortgageswere executed on 23rd December 1994 on that basis. After a while, when Mr Li had not repaid the loan, the Plaintiff started to chasehim. However, Mr Li repaid nothing, making excuses to the effect that his investments were not yielding cash.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The Plaintiff's account in chief of how she came to execute the 1995 Mortgage is in summary as follows. Mr Li told her that the interestrate under the Yu Tai mortgage was too high and he was not on good terms with Yu Tai. He suggested that the mortgage be "changedto" Luk Fai, which would charge less interest. The Plaintiff's reaction was that she wanted to be repaid and to put an end to thematter, but Mr Li maintained that he had no money to repay her.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> As stated above, it was the Plaintiff's evidence that it had been agreed between her and Mr Li that Mr Li would pay the mortgageinstalments (though under the 1994 Mortgages there were no instalments of principal). She maintained that, even though Mr Li hadmade only partial payments to Yu Tai and Sinohill, she was not interested in finding out what the outstanding mortgage debt was becauseshe trusted Mr Li to make payment.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> She claims to have given no thought to whether the fact that both the 1994 and 1995 mortgage loans were $6.5m indicated that Mr Lihad not paid any instalments of principal.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The Plaintiff said the reason she agreed to enter into this mortgage was that she thought there had to be a "transfer" of the 1994Mortgages because Mr Li had been unable to make payment under the 1994 Mortgages and the only way out was to approach someone elsefor a loan. However, she was unable to say when she understood the 1994 Mortgages expired, because she never asked Mr Li. She saysshe trusted him and did not care about it.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The Plaintiff's account of the execution of the mortgage was in summary as follows. Mr Li took her to the offices of the mortgagee'ssolicitors (Amelia Cheung &amp; Co), where she was attended by a solicitor's clerk. She could not recall how many documents therewere, but she read none of them. She claims the clerk's only explanation of the documents that she can recall was that the loan was$6.5m and she would be the borrower, and she thought the clerk also stated the repayment period, but she could not recall what itwas. She says that no one in the firm explained the interest provisions. Evidently she did not enquire about them. She claims shejust signed as requested, trusting Mr Li and the solicitors to draw to her attention whatever needed to be drawn to her attention.The Plaintiff also claims that Mr Li told her she would be the borrower under the mortgage (which on this occasion was true).</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> When asked whether she would have entered into the mortgage if she had known that the interest payments would be $117,000 per month,and the whole loan had to be repaid in six months, she said she would have, because she trusted Mr Li to make arrangements to havethe loan repaid.</p>    <p class="heading">The period between the 1995 and 1996 Mortgages</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Although the Plaintiff and Mr Li had agreed that the loan would be secured by further shares in the Hillwood Road venture, and thishad given her comfort, no such security was ever given. Further, the Plaintiff never pressed for it, she says because she did notwant more shares in that investment.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> The Plaintiff maintains that her view of Mr Li at the time of the 1995 Mortgage was no different from the view she had formed ofhim in 1994. The fact that he had failed to carry out his promise to repay within six months had not changed her impression of himbecause he had explained that he had been unable to get cash from his investments. In any event, she explains, since she was theowner of the property and the borrower under the mortgage, he was not able to "do anything" to the property.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> However, the Plaintiff also says that after the 1995 Mortgage she seldom saw Mr Li, meeting only once every two or three months,it seems when they met by chance at Mr Li's club. She maintained, however, that she was in frequent telephone contact with him, partlysocial and partly to press for repayment of the loan. As before, he maintained he had large investments, and was merely sufferingcashflow problems. A number of faxed chasing messages were produced, the last of which was dated 7th October 1998 and refers to frequentchases in 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The Plaintiff maintains, nevertheless, that she and Mr Li remained on friendly terms and she still trusted him.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1996 Mortgage and the relationship between the Plaintiff and Mr Li when this mortgage was executed</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> It is not in dispute that, although the 1996 Mortgage is dated 4th September 1996, in fact it and the related documents were executedon 29th August 1996. The mortgage secured general banking facilities repayable on demand to Sunny Tech Ltd ("Sunny") without limit,for which the Plaintiff was jointly liable, with interest at the Bank's current rate or such other rate as the Bank in its discretiondecided to charge. The mortgage was executed by Mr Ip on behalf of Sunny.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> It is clear from one of the related documents the Plaintiff signed on 29th August 1996, i.e. the Bank's commitment letter dated 3rdSeptember 1996, that the facility secured by the mortgage was at that time divided into two parts: first, a $4.5m loan repayableon demand but otherwise repayable by instalments over 20 years with interest at 9.5% subject to fluctuation; secondly, general bankingfacilities of $2m. This was superseded by the Bank's letter dated 5th September 1996 the effect of which is not entirely clear, andit is not clear whether this document was among the documents executed on 29th August 1996 or whether it was signed later. Both documentswere signed on behalf of Sunny by Mr Ip.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> The Plaintiff maintains that she still trusted Mr Li at this time. Her account of how she came to execute the 1996 Mortgage is asfollows.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Mr Li told her that the interest rate under the 1995 Mortgage was too high and that he would be able to arrange a mortgage with theBank which would charge a lower rate. Mr Li encouraged her to go to the Bank to take advantage of its much lower interest rate, pointingout that the borrower and the owner would remain the same. She says he asked her to agree to the "transfer" of the 1995 Mortgageto the Bank. Her reaction was to ask Mr Li if he really would be able to repay her, making it clear she did not want the matter todrag on any longer. Mr Li told her he would be getting some money from his investments in six months, or a year at most, and therewas no need to worry, since the Property was still in her name and he would soon repay her. She said she needed to think it overand this time he would have to promise in writing when the Property would be released to her.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> The Plaintiff says Mr Li explained that the arrangement he had made with the Bank was for a $4.5m instalment loan and a $2m overdraftfacility. This would pay off the 1995 Mortgage. The Plaintiff says Mr Li said nothing to indicate that the arrangement would be anydifferent from the terms which had been agreed for the original loan in 1994.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> On 29th August 1996, when the mortgage documents were executed, the Plaintiff met up with Mr Li and together they went to the officesof the Bank's solicitors (Tsang, Chau &amp; Wong). She reckons they were there for about 30 minutes.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The Plaintiff says that a few days previously Mr Li had acceded to the Plaintiff's demand for a written promise to repay, and hehad promised to pay off the $2m overdraft within six months. The first thing that was done at the solicitors' offices was that MrLi wrote, signed and gave the Plaintiff a note dated 29th August 1996 recording this promise. The note was produced. The Plaintiffgave a number of reasons why she did not ask for a similar promise for the $4.5m instalment loan. She thought Mr Li was paying theinstalments and thereby reducing the outstanding principal. She pointed out that $3.2m of the outstanding principal of $4.5m wasattributable to the NCB mortgage. She said she would chase Mr Li for the balance once the $2m overdraft had been repaid, and shedid not go further at that stage because Mr Li had made lots of excuses for not paying and she and Mr Li were still on friendly terms.She says she still trusted Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The Plaintiff said it took Mr Li about 10 minutes to prepare the note, after which the two of them were taken to a conference room,where, in addition to the mortgage itself, there were other related documents for execution. The Plaintiff's account in chief ofthe execution of the mortgage and these four other documents was in summary as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) In her witness statement the Plaintiff said that the attending staff of the firm (in fact a conveyancing clerk named Winnie ChanYuk Chau) gave no explanation of any of the documents.</p>        <p>(2) In oral evidence she said</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) the only explanation given was to indicate references (it seems in the commitment letter dated 3rd September) to an instalmentloan of $4.5m and an overdraft of $2m;</p>            <p>(b) her attention was not drawn to any other documents, nor was their nature explained to her;</p>            <p>(c) she was not given any opportunity to read the documents;</p>            <p>(d) she just signed in the places the attending clerk pointed to;</p>            <p>(e) when she signed the documents, there was no seal or signature of Sunny (which must have been added later);</p>            <p>(f) she was given no opportunity to speak with a solicitor in the firm.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(2) She also said in oral evidence that she was not advised she could consult her own lawyer, and there is no evidence that she was.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> The Plaintiff maintains she was unaware that Sunny was the borrower under the mortgage and was under the impression that she wasthe borrower. She gave a number of reasons. She was the owner. Mr Li had told her she would be the borrower. The solicitor's clerkattending the execution did not tell her she was not the borrower. She says that, had she known that Sunny was the borrower, shewould have refused to sign the mortgage documents, since she knew nothing of Sunny.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> The Plaintiff also maintains that she was under the impression that the amount secured by the mortgage was limited to $6.5m, and,had she known it was not, she would not have executed the mortgage. There was a limit, she said, to her trust in Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> In cross-examination as to the Bank's commitment letter dated 3rd September 1996 (in English) she said that if she read it she wouldhave understood it but nevertheless she did not read it. She claims that all she took in was the address of the property and theamount $6.5m. The other documents (which are clearly more complex documents) she could not read.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> In cross-examination as to the execution of the documents:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) As to the commitment letter dated 3rd September 1996, the Plaintiff said variously: it was a document she was able to read; shedid not read it; she thought the words "Sunny Tech Limited" had not yet been inserted in it; she did read it; she only read the addressof the property and the amount.</p>        <p>(2) As to the Bank's facility letter of 5th September 1996, the Plaintiff said she was certain this was one of the documents she executedon 29th August 1996. She says she did not read it (she had said in chief it was not explained to her). She says she did not noticethe guarantee at the end of the letter.</p>        <p>(3) Generally: she read none of the documents executed on 29th August 1996 and she did not ask for any of the documents to be explainedto her.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> In cross-examination on the note which Mr Li gave her, she accepted she specifically asked for it because Mr Li had previously brokenhis oral promises. However, when it was put to her that this showed she no longer trusted his words, she gave a somewhat differentexplanation: it was to remind Mr Li of the length of the agreed period for repayment. In re-examination, she said it was to remindMr Li when the agreed period of six months would start to run.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> In chief the Plaintiff gave evidence that in 1996 she considered whether she should sell the Property, as its value had increased.Further, she said, this would enable her to put an end to her relationship with Mr Li in the matter, and in cross-examination sheadmitted she was anxious to make a clean break from him. However, she denied this indicated she no longer trusted him. In re-examination,she said she wanted a clean break so far as the mortgage was concerned, not at a personal level, as he still respected her and theywere still friendly. In the end she decided against selling the Property because the Bank agreed to give a mortgage loan and shewas relying on Mr Li repaying the $2m facility within six months, as promised.</p>    <p class="heading">The period between the 1996 and 1998 Mortgages</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> After the 1996 Mortgage, the Plaintiff continued to chase Mr Li but to no avail. She produced six faxes she sent Mr Li between December1996 and October 1998 in which she entreats Mr Li to start paying her back and in which she explains her acute financial predicament,including threatened legal proceedings by her bankers. According to the Plaintiff, Mr Li repeatedly told her he did not then havethe money but expected to receive funds, and she believed him, thinking that he was a rich man and had valuable investments in thePRC but had to wait for the profits to come in. She agreed that Mr Li failed to deliver again and again, but maintains she neverdoubted his ability to repay her. She maintains she still trusted Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> The Plaintiff maintains that on a number of occasions Mr Li confirmed he was paying the mortgage instalments, as (she says) he hadagreed to do.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1998 Mortgage</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> As stated above, Leading Counsel for the Plaintiff in closing submissions indicated he would not seek any relief in respect of the1998 Mortgage, since the Plaintiff was no worse off under the 1998 Mortgage than she had been under the 1996 Mortgage. However, thePlaintiff's evidence as to the 1998 Mortgage is potentially relevant in assessing the Plaintiff's credibility as to the 1996 Mortgage.I shall, however, be selective in summarising the evidence as to this mortgage, concentrating on the evidence as to the executionof the mortgage.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> The 1998 Mortgage was executed on 31st December 1998. It was a second mortgage, ranking behind the 1996 Mortgage, and it securedgeneral banking facilities repayable on demand granted by the Bank to Fairwealth under its new name Keeland Ltd ("Keeland"). It appearsto have been accepted that there was a $9.35m limit under this mortgage. The Plaintiff's maximum liability was limited to the amountof the proceeds of sale of the property, provided certain safeguards were met.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> There was a dispute whether, as the Plaintiff alleged, the manager Mr Wong Lau Ping ("Mr Wong") represented to the Plaintiff thatthe new mortgage would "replace" the 1996 Mortgage, so that the 1996 Mortgage would cease to have effect upon execution of the newmortgage. It appears from Mr Wong's evidence that in fact the effect of the proposed restructuring was that the principal debt securedby the 1996 Mortgage would be paid off but the accrued interest of about $1.25m would not be, and to that extent the 1996 Mortgagewould not be "replaced". However, this is now not a live issue in the case and I do not propose to deal with it further.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> The Plaintiff's account of the 1998 Mortgage in her witness statement can be summarised as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> In early December 1998 Mr Li told the Plaintiff that the outstanding amount secured by the 1996 Mortgage was $9.3m and he was seekingto restructure his debts to the Bank. She was shocked at the amount and asked for an explanation. According to her, Mr Li's explanationwas that he had not been paying the monthly instalments under the 1996 Mortgage. The Plaintiff admitted in her oral evidence thatshe found Mr Li's lies about having paid the mortgage instalments unacceptable and she admitted she felt betrayed in the trust shehad reposed in him.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> The Plaintiff's evidence was that, as a result of what Mr Li told her she panicked in agreeing to execute a further mortgage. However,nothing further occurred until 31st December 1998, when Mr Li told the Plaintiff she had to execute the new mortgage that day. Shewent to the offices of the Bank's solicitors (again Tsang, Chau &amp; Wong) with Mr Li and Mr Patrick Chung, arriving very late inthe afternoon. She claims that the attending solicitor's clerk (again Winnie Chan) did not explain any of the documents to her, andtold her that, Mr Li having explained the documents to her, she had better sign to protect her interests.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The Plaintiff claims that, had she known that Keeland was the borrower and that the limit of the facilities secured by the mortgagewould be as much as $9.35m, she would not have signed the documents, since she knew nothing of Keeland. She says she signed the documentsbecause she was "induced and threatened" by the representations of Mr Wong and Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> The Plaintiff's oral evidence as to execution of the 1998 Mortgage, adds the following to her witness statement on that subject:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Mr Lau was present, as well as Mr Li and Mr Patrick Chung.</p>        <p>(2) They were there for about 1 1/2 hours, and half an hour was spent by the Plaintiff, Mr Li, Mr Lau and Mr Patrick Chung alone withthe documents.</p>        <p>(3) Again, Winnie Chan simply pointed to where on each of the documents the Plaintiff was to apply her signature.</p>        <p>(4) While the Plaintiff was signing, Patrick Chung remained in the room, waiting for his turn, some distance away.</p>        <p>(5) Neither the mortgage nor any of the related documents was explained to her on this occasion, nor was she given the opportunityto read them.</p>        <p>(6) A little later she said that Winnie Chan explained the limit of liability.</p>        <p>(7) When she signed the documents, there was no seal or signature of Keeland (which must have been added later).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The Bank's two-page explanatory document was in both an English and a Chinese version and the Plaintiff signed both. This advisesthe would-be parties to seek independent legal advice before entering into the transaction, and sets out an explanation of the transactionin simple terms. Under cross-examination the Plaintiff accepted she had no difficulty understanding the Chinese version, but claimedshe did not read it because she was in a bad mood, she was more interested in the amount, it was late and she had been told to signthe document right away, she had spoken to Mr Wong and anyway it was the responsibility of the solicitors to draw her attention toit. The Plaintiff claims she never asked the solicitors' staff to explain the documents.</p>    <p class="heading">What happened to the "investment"</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> According to the Plaintiff's witness statement and a letter from a firm of solicitors (Kwan &amp; Kwan) retained by the Plaintiffand other "investors", Mr Li took large sums of money for the Hillwood Road "venture" from at least another four "investors" andthat the other investors, like the Plaintiff, signed agreements and transfer documents for shares in Fairsheen and Bright Wick, butno Fairsheen or Bright Wick shares were registered in the name of any "investor". Consequently, the shares in those companies couldbe, and in fact were in 1998, transferred to a third party. At some stage Fairsheen and Bright Wick sold the shops without accountingto the investors for the proceeds of sale. In the result the "investments" were worthless.</p>    <p class="heading">What happened to the Property</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> On 31st May 2000 the Bank, exercising its power of sale in the 1998 Mortgage, sold the Property for HK$7.5m.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings as to the investment</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> The Plaintiff's account of her "investment" in the Hillwood Road venture of $750,000 in 1994 is credible and I see no good reasonto doubt it. I do not regard the rather unusual way her evidence emerged as reflecting on her credibility. Moreover, her accountis corroborated by: the four paid cheques in 1994; the "schedule of investors" in which she appears to be listed as an investor;the documents signed at the solicitors' offices in 1995; and her fax to Mr Li of 7th October 1998 in which she specifically refersto her $1m investment.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings as to the loan</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The Plaintiff's account of advancing a loan of $3,301,960.27 to Mr Li 23rd December 1994 is credible and I see no good reason todoubt it.

The calculation of the amount of the loan is substantially corroboratedby the passbook for the Plaintiff's savings account.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> I find that no part of the loan has been repaid and accordingly Mr Li remains indebted to the Plaintiff for $3,301,960.27.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings on the Plaintiff's claims based on misrepresentation</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> As stated above, the Plaintiff makes claims against Mr Li in deceit and under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a> in respect of alleged misrepresentations he made inducing her to enter into the 1996 Mortgage.

The Plaintiff gave evidence to that effect, which I disbelieved (see paragraph 132 below). Nor is there evidence thatMr Li expressly represented that the total liability was $6.5m.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The gist of the representation, as outlined by the Plaintiff's Leading Counsel in final submissions, was that Mr Li represented thatthe only difference between the existing mortgage and the proposed mortgage to the Bank would be the interest payable, and this wasfalse because, as Mr Li well knew, the borrower would be Sunny instead of the Plaintiff and the secured borrowings would be unlimitedinstead of being limited to $6.5m.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Considerable reliance was placed on Mr Li's alleged reference to the mortgage being "transferred" as implying that, aside from thematters mentioned, the proposed new mortgage would be the same as the existing one.

I find it hard to believe, without corroboration,on a claimed memory of the precise language used by Mr Li on an occasion many years ago. I take into account my adverse findingsbelow as to the Plaintiff's general credibility.</p>        <p>(2) It will be recalled that the Plaintiff's evidence as to why she granted the 1995 mortgage was that she thought the existing one(the 1994 Mortgages) had to be transferred. So clearly on this occasion she herself was referring to a transfer of a mortgage ina much looser way than she attributes to Mr Li in her case of misrepresentation against him.</p>        <p>(3) As a matter of ordinary language I do not think that reference to transfer gives rise to the suggested implication. It could simplymean that there is to be a new mortgage.</p>        <p>(4) In the context of Mr Li saying (if he did) that the Bank would charge less interest, the emphasis is on finding a new mortgagee,not the terms (other than interest) on which a new mortgage could be obtained.</p>        <p>(5) I should bear in mind that since this is an allegation of fraud, there should be compelling evidence that the representation wasmade, and was known to have been made without belief in its truth.

This is whether in fact the 1996 Mortgage was procured by Mr Li's undue influence. The Plaintiff has to establishthat her relationship with Mr Li developed to a point where he acquired a measure of influence over her of which he took unfair advantage,and this was the reason, or the predominant reason or at least a significant reason, why she granted the 1996 Mortgage (see <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%203%20WLR%201021" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 3 WLR 1021</a> per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at 1029 para 8; <strong>Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd v Wong King Sing</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20HKLRD%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 HKLRD 358</a> at 368E per Mr Recorder Ma SC).</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> The Plaintiff says that she reposed trust and confidence in Mr Li and it is submitted on her behalf that the 1996 Mortgage is notreadily explicable by the relationship between them. If on those two sub-issues I were to make findings in the Plaintiff's favour,then a rebuttable evidential presumption would arise that the 1996 Mortgage was procured by undue influence (see <strong>Etridge</strong> at 1030 para 14 and 1032 para 21).</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> The second issue. If I should find that the presumption has not been rebutted, and therefore the 1996 Mortgage was procured by undueinfluence, the next issue would be whether the Bank was put on enquiry (see <strong>Etridge</strong> at 1036 para 40, 1037 para 44 to 1039 para 49).</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> The third issue. If I find the Bank was put on enquiry, the next issue would be whether the Bank did all that it should have doneto reduce the risk of the proposed transaction being entered into under undue influence (<strong>Etridge</strong> at 1037 para 41 and 1038 para 50 to 1040 para 57).</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> The fourth issue. If I were to find against the Bank on the third issue, the next issue would be whether in principle the Plaintiffcan claim compensation having regard to the sale of the Property to an innocent purchaser.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> The fifth issue. If in principle a claim for compensation can be made, the fifth issue is the amount of compensation.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings on the first issue</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> The Plaintiff and Mr Li were friends, and no other form of relationship has been suggested.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> Whether 1996 Mortgage is readily explicable by relationship. In my judgment the 1996 Mortgage is not a transaction readily explicableby a relationship of friendship. It was entered into at the instigation of Mr Li and is manifestly disadvantageous to the Plaintiff.Under the 1995 Mortgage the Plaintiff was the borrower, having therefore control over the maximum amount secured by the mortgage.Under the 1996 Mortgage, which replaced the 1995 Mortgage, the borrower was a company over which the Plaintiff had no control andin which she had no interest or even knowledge, and there was no limit to the amount secured by the mortgage. Consequently, whereasunder the 1995 Mortgage the Plaintiff could be certain that no further advances would be secured by the mortgage without her knowledgeand consent, under the 1996 Mortgage secured advances could be made without her consent even to the point of extinguishing the valueof her equity of redemption. That is in fact what eventually happened. The 1996 Mortgage was a transaction which was far from beingreadily explicable by friendship alone.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Factual background to 1996 Mortgage. The Plaintiff says she reposed trust and confidence in Mr Li right up to the time she grantedthe 1996 Mortgage. I accept the Plaintiff's evidence as to the background to the 1996 Mortgage which is highly relevant and whichI propose to deal with chronologically.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> When the Plaintiff met Mr Li in 1992 he must have been a person of some social accomplishment, running a no doubt successful socialclub. The Plaintiff obviously liked him and enjoyed his company. Though their relationship was that of friends, their calling eachother brother and sister indicates a special friendship. It is clear that the Plaintiff was very considerably impressed by what shebelieved to be Mr Li's great wealth. She evidently believed him when he claimed to have turned down an offer of $200m for his Zhuhaiinvestments. She was also considerably impressed by what she believed to be his fine qualities. He was a very rich friend whom shecould trust implicitly. This set the stage for what was to follow.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> I have already accepted the Plaintiff's account of her "investment" in the Hillwood Road project, which was done at the instigationof Mr Li. There are several features of her "investment" which indicate that she reposed trust and confidence in him. She decidedto invest on the basis of his no doubt impressive presentation. She does not appear to have sought any advice. There was never anyproper documentation. She paid for the investment by one blank cheque (or two if one counts Mr Lau's) and two cheques in favour ofa company linked with Mr Li, and there is no evidence she got anything in return. She left it to Mr Li to appropriately apply hermoney to her "investment". As to the "schedule of investors" she was given in late 1994 (some months after she had given Mr Li thelast of the three cheques), the Plaintiff came across this document by chance. She does not appear to have called on Mr Li for anexplanation of the document, for she was unable to explain the first two columns except on the basis of inference or guess work.(There is no explanation of the remaining columns.) The Plaintiff was unable to explain the documentation signed in April/May 1995,the terms of which did not reflect what had taken place between her and Mr Li. Yet the Plaintiff was content to sign it. It seemsto me quite plausible that, as she says, she signed the documentation without reading it or having had it explained to her. Thatwould explain why she called for no explanation of the strangeness of the documentation. She made no real effort to ascertain thebasic details of the investment, still less to have it committed to writing. In my judgment, the objectively most plausible explanationfor her acting as she did in relation to the "investment" was that she reposed trust and confidence in Mr Li, specifically to seeto it that her interests in relation to the investment were looked after.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> During the second half of 1994 the Plaintiff allowed Mr Li's credit for building materials with her company to mount, reaching about$1m by the end of the year. The Plaintiff evidently believed Mr Li when he told her, in effect, he was still very rich but had encounteredshort-term cash problems.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> The mortgage loan advanced in late 1994 was done at the instigation of Mr Li. It had three major features. The first is that thePlaintiff agreed to lend Mr Li over $3m unsecured. It is true that her company would get payment of the outstanding credit for buildingmaterials, but still in cash terms the Plaintiff was putting about $2m of her money at risk. It is also true that the Plaintiff hadthe benefit of Mr Li's promise to repay in six months, his vague promise to provide an unspecified number of extra shares in theHillwood Road project as security and his promise to pay the mortgage instalments. No doubt each of these promises played its partin inducing the Plaintiff to make this loan to Mr Li, but they were each worthless unless underpinned by the Plaintiff's trust andconfidence in Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> The second major feature of the mortgage loan is that although the purpose of the refinancing of the Property was just to providefunds to lend to Mr Li, under each of the 1994 Mortgages Fairwealth was the borrower and in the case of the Sinohill mortgage therewas no limit to the amount secured by the mortgage. Consequently, as in the case of the 1996 Mortgage, the Plaintiff was potentiallyat the mercy of the borrower. The Plaintiff therefore did not just put her cash of about $2m at risk in the loan transaction. Shealso risked reducing or even losing the value of her equity of redemption. In so far as she understood that this was the effect ofthe 1994 Mortgages, the most plausible explanation of her entering into the transaction with such knowledge is that she reposed trustand confidence in Mr Li. Equally, if she did not understand that this was the effect of the mortgages - either because no-one explainedthat to her or, if they did, she did not follow the explanation - again the most plausible explanation of her executing the documentsin ignorance of their terms is that she reposed trust and confidence in Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> The third major feature of this mortgage loan is that the Plaintiff did not benefit from it at all, except to the very limited extentthat she (through her company) got a purely cash benefit in the form of settlement of the outstanding debt for building materials.Otherwise all the benefit (in the shape of the loan and the ability to raise further funds on the security of the Sinohill mortgage)went to Fairwealth, with which the Plaintiff had no connexion but Mr Li did. The absence of any real quid pro quo for the loan is,in my judgment indicative of a desire on the Plaintiff's part to accommodate and please Mr Li, which went hand in hand with her trustand confidence in him.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> The 1995 Mortgage was entered into at the instigation of Mr Li. Under this mortgage Fairwealth dropped out of the picture and thePlaintiff was the named borrower. The outstanding principal debt remained $6.5m. The Plaintiff was therefore in a much safer positionthan she had been under the 1994 Mortgages. However, there appears to be no explanation of how this came about, not even whetherthis form of the mortgage was adopted at the initiative of the lender, the Plaintiff or Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> By this time Mr Li had completely failed to honour his promise to repay the loan within six months. He had completely failed to implementhis promise to provide security for the loan. It is clear from the Plaintiff's evidence on the matter, which I accept, that she concludedthat Mr Li had given her untruthful reasons for looking for a new lender (falling out with the 1994 lenders and the interest wastoo high). Indeed, if (contrary to her evidence) she was aware of the interest provisions of the mortgage as compared with the 1994Mortgages she would have realised that the interest under this mortgage was higher than under the 1994 Mortgages.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> These were all sound reasons why the Plaintiff if acting sensibly might have broken off with Mr Li entirely and sought to recoverwhat she could from him, no doubt with the advice and assistance of solicitors. Instead, she carried on her friendship with Mr Li,and at his instigation she granted the 1995 Mortgage despite the fact that Mr Li had by then failed to comply with any of his promises.Her attitude towards Mr Li is shown by her chasing faxes to Mr Li which, while written in a later period (16th December 1996 - 7thOctober 1998) cast light on her attitude when she granted the 1995 Mortgage. Despite the dire straits she was in and despite Mr Li'sreneging on his promises, she remains, throughout, friendly, even apologetic, and understanding of his financial problems. She writesalmost as if she is asking him for a favour.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> I do not think it would be realistic to treat the continuance of the special friendship as being separate and distinct from the Plaintiff'strust and confidence in Mr Li. They went hand-in-hand as two, related, aspects of the Plaintiff's side of the relationship.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> I have already found that the Plaintiff reposed trust and confidence in Mr Li from the time of the investment up to the 1994 Mortgagesand in my judgment that trust and confidence did not cease by the time of the 1995 Mortgage, but continued.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> I accept the Plaintiff's evidence that after the 1995 Mortgage Mr Li continued to represent himself as asset-rich but short of cash,and she believed him.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> The 1996 Mortgage. I have already referred to the salient features of the 1996 Mortgage and the seriously disadvantageous terms ofthe mortgage so far as the Plaintiff was concerned. Insofar as the Plaintiff understood these reasons, the most plausible explanationfor her granting the mortgage is that she continued to repose trust and confidence in Mr Li. Equally if she did not understand thiswas the effect of the mortgage, again, the most plausible explanation of her granting the mortgage in ignorance of its terms is thatshe continued to repose trust and confidence in Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> I find that when the 1996 Mortgage was executed, the Plaintiff reposed trust and confidence in Mr Li. Having already found that themortgage is not readily explicable by the relationship between them, I ask myself whether the presumption of undue influence is rebutted.Before answering that question I deal with further salient aspects of the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> The note. As to the Plaintiff's insistence on Mr Li giving the Plaintiff a written promise to repay the $2m overdraft within sixmonths, no doubt she asked for the document because Mr Li had broken his oral promises. I reject her other explanations for requiringit. However, I do not see it as necessarily precluding trust and confidence in Mr Li or undue influence, though it is a factor tobe taken into account. It seems to me that the most likely explanation is that the Plaintiff wanted to impress on Mr Li the greatimportance to her of being substantially repaid at an early date. This is consistent with the chasing letters starting 16th December1996 which refer to the pressing demands made of the Plaintiff by her own bankers. If the document had been intended as one to facilitateenforcement of Mr Li's promise (being made necessary by a lack of trust) one would have expected to find the Plaintiff relying onthe document after the six months period had expired, yet there is no evidence of that.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> Whether the Plaintiff understood the mortgages. Considerable time was spent during the trial on the question whether the Plaintiffunderstood the terms of the mortgages she granted, and in particular what if any explanation she was given of the documents by thesolicitors for the mortgagee banks.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> Each of the mortgages contained an interpretation clause stating that the mortgage had been interpreted to the Plaintiff in Cantonese.This reflects a standard practice in Hong Kong where solicitors for a mortgagee know that the mortgagor does not have a thoroughcommand of the English language. However, the quality of the explanation given does of course depend on the specific circumstancesand the reliability and expertise of the interpreter.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> As to the 1994 Mortgages, I am unable to accept the Plaintiff's evidence. It is inherently unlikely that the solicitor's clerk wouldhave "explained" the instalment provisions of the mortgages when in fact there were none, and inherently unlikely that he would havemisnamed the borrower. I find it hard to believe that the Plaintiff would have been able to recall the gist of what the clerk saidseven years previously. The complaints she makes are serious ones and it is difficult to see how they could accidentally have beenomitted from the Plaintiff's witness statement. The absence of complaint in the witness statement has not been explained. I did nothave a favourable impression of her evidence on this subject.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> In the absence of any other evidence as to the circumstances of the execution of the 1994 Mortgages, I do not think I can make anypositive findings as to what explanation was given to the Plaintiff, or as to what extent she understood it, beyond finding it morelikely than not that the Plaintiff did not think she was the borrower under the mortgages.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> As for the 1995 Mortgage, the Plaintiff's only real complaint against the solicitors as appears to be that the interest provisionsof the mortgage were not explained to her. For reasons similar to those given in relation to the 1994 Mortgages, I found her evidenceunconvincing. However, apart from affecting her overall credibility, this appears to be unimportant since the Plaintiff acknowledgesthat she did not believe Mr Li's statements about relative interest rates as between the 1994 and 1995 Mortgages.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> As for the 1996 Mortgage, the Bank called Winnie Chan, the conveyancing clerk responsible for the execution of both the 1995 andthe 1998 Mortgages. I will deal with salient feature of the evidence as to both mortgages, since although the 1998 Mortgage is nolonger in issue, Miss Chan's evidence as to that mortgage is relevant to her credibility as to the 1996 Mortgage. In relation tothe 1996 Mortgage she had no independent recollection of the execution and relied on her usual practice. In relation to the 1998Mortgage she said she recalled the execution to some extent, particularly because on this occasion, after Miss Chan had explainedthe documents, the Plaintiff asked for time to consider them, which she did for about half an hour.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> Miss Chan's witness statement sets out the explanations which she says she would have given the Plaintiff in accordance with herusual practice, and without going into details in my judgment, so far as the 1996 Mortgage is concerned, these explanations, if given,would have been sufficient to explain the salient features of the mortgages to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> I also had the benefit of hearing the evidence of Mr Patrick Chung as to the execution of the 1998 Mortgage. Mr Chung's witness statementalleges that Winnie Chan gave no general explanation of the mortgage and only responded to his specific queries. However, accordingto his evidence about the two-page explanatory document which the Plaintiff signed, he said Winnie Chan took him and the Plaintiffthrough the document (thereby contradicting not only his own witness statement but also the Plaintiff's evidence). He later retractedthis evidence, reverting to his first version that he merely "glanced" at the document for the 10-20 minutes he was given to readit himself (as was the Plaintiff). He gave unconvincing evidence as to how it was that the Plaintiff did not hear Mr Li explain whyKeeland was named the borrower. I was unimpressed by his evidence that Winnie Chan misrepresented to him that the 1996 Mortgage wouldbe cancelled and replaced by the 1998 Mortgage. That seems inherently unlikely and believable only if Mr Chung had been unaware thatthis was a second mortgage, which was clearly stated in the explanatory document. Overall, I found Mr Patrick Chung an unreliablewitness.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> I had the benefit of Miss Chan having been taken through her evidence in chief, and having been cross-examined at some length. Iwas favourably impressed by Winnie Chan's evidence, and I prefer it to the evidence on the matter given by the Plaintiff. She gaveher evidence well and straightforwardly. She said, and I have no reason to disbelieve her, that she had worked as a solicitors' clerksince 1980 and she had been specifically trained to explain conveyancing documents. She made the valid point that the purpose wasto prevent those executing the documents from later asserting they did not understand them. She admitted that her witness statementwent too far in positively asserting in relation to the 1996 Mortgage that both Mr Ip and his sister were present when she gave herexplanations. That I regard as a minor matter not adversely affecting her credibility.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> In my judgment the Bank proved that the salient terms of the 1996 Mortgage were explained to the Plaintiff by the Bank's solicitors.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> This conclusion does not mean that the Plaintiff did not repose trust and confidence in Mr Li or that she was not under his undueinfluence. Although the Bank, through its solicitors, adequately explained the mortgage, that does not necessarily mean that thePlaintiff took it all in, still less that she appreciated the implications of the transaction. But even if she understood the transactionand its implications, as Lord Nichols said in <strong>Etridge</strong> at 1032D "a person may understand fully the implications of a proposed transaction, for instance a substantial gift, and yet stillbe acting under the influence of another". As I have already found above, in my judgment the Plaintiff reposed trust and confidencein Mr Li, whether or not she fully understood the transactions.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> The borrower. I was unimpressed by the Plaintiff's evidence that she thought she was the borrower under the 1996 Mortgage. I rejecther explanations. I think it likely that she realised that the borrower under a mortgage might not be the owner. As I have found,Winnie Chan did inform her that Sunny was the borrower. As to Mr Li's alleged representation that the Plaintiff was the borrower,I find this unlikely. There appears to have been no particular reason why Mr Li should have stuck his neck out on such an obviousuntruth, and if such a misrepresentation been made, and relied on as the Plaintiff asserts, one would have expected it to have beenpleaded as part of the Plaintiff's case in misrepresentation. The Plaintiff was cross-examined to show that if she had been the borrowershe would have received the statements of account which her witness statement complains she never received. She claims she thoughtthat the banks would not send statements, provided there was no default. However, she admitted that she had had previous experienceof mortgage loans and had always received bank statements. I found her evidence unconvincing.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> Credibility. There are also a number of other instances where the Plaintiff's credibility was adversely affected by shifts of positionand significant differences between her witness statement and her oral evidence. However, I do not regard the Plaintiff's generallack of credibility as being fatal to her case as to reposing trust and confidence in Mr Li. Her evidence that she did repose suchtrust and confidence in him is underpinned by the nature of the transactions as I have explained above. On all the evidence, themost plausible reason for the Plaintiff granting the 1996 Mortgage was that she continued to repose trust and confidence in Mr Li.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> Conclusion. For the reasons I have given, in my judgment the prerequisites for the presumption are met and the presumption has notbeen rebutted. I find that when the Plaintiff granted the 1996 Mortgage she was under the undue influence of Mr Li and this was thereason or the predominant reason why she granted the mortgage.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings as to the second issue</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> The Bank was of course aware of the disadvantageous terms of the proposed mortgage. It was also aware (from a letter from the existingmortgagee's solicitors) that under the existing mortgage the borrower was the Plaintiff and that there was a $6.5m limit, so it knewof the greatly increased risk the Plaintiff would be running from replacing the existing mortgage by the proposed mortgage. It wasWinnie Chan's evidence that, before taking the mortgage, the Bank had conducted a search of Sunny which had shown that the Plaintiffwas neither a shareholder nor a director of Sunny. The Bank had no reason to think that there had been commercial dealings betweenthe Plaintiff and Sunny. In the course of the trial the Bank never suggested that it was under the impression that the Plaintiffhad a commercial relationship with Sunny.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> In these circumstances the Bank must have realised that there was no commercial relationship between the Plaintiff and Sunny, orat least had no good reason to think there was such a relationship. It was therefore put on enquiry. See <strong>Etridge</strong> at 1048 para 87.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings as to the third issue</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> The burden is on the Bank to establish that it brought home to the Plaintiff the risks she would be running if she granted the proposedmortgage. See <strong>Etridge</strong> at 1039 para 50, 1042 para 64, 1047 para 84 and 1048 para 87 (I do not read 1040 para 54 or 1048 para 85 as saying anything different).As to the kind of steps which should be taken, I follow <strong>Bank of China v Wong King Sing</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20HKLRD%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 HKLRD 358 (Mr</a> Recorder Ma SC, as he then was) at 377 para 69.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> The only steps taken by the Bank to bring home to the Plaintiff the risks she was running were to have the salient terms of the mortgageexplained to the Plaintiff. I have already found that the salient terms were explained by Winnie Chan. But in my judgment, that wasnot enough to bring home to the Plaintiff the risks she was running.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> First, the explanation was given in the presence of Mr Li. As Mr Recorder Ma explained in the <strong>Wong King Sing</strong> case at 381 para 89</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The need for a private meeting is, in my view, obvious. If the suspicion is that an influencer has or may have exerted undue influenceon the complainant, any advice or warnings given to the complainant, at a meeting at which the influencer is present, simply failsto achieve its purpose."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> Secondly, the explanation was not given until very shortly before the mortgage was executed. A similar thing happened in the <strong>Wong King Sing</strong> case where Mr Recorder Ma said at 381 para 91</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In these circumstances, I am of the view that the value of any explanation or advice provided to the complainant surety, loses muchof its effect when he is subjected to additional pressure in terms of time. How realistic, one might ask, is the prospect of thesurety seeking independent legal advice when he is faced with the pressure of having to sign documents within a tight time schedule?In the present case, this prospect would have been unrealistic."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and at para 92</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is important for banks or other third parties to ensure that a surety's agreement has been properly obtained. Adequate time must,therefore, in my view, be allowed for the requisite explanation and advice to be given. In the majority of cases, this should notbe done on the very day when the relevant documents must be signed or the relevant transaction carried out."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I agree.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> Thirdly, in the present case I do not think that merely explaining the salient terms of the mortgage was enough to bring home tothe Plaintiff the risks she was running. The risk was that the people behind Sunny would make additional borrowings behind her backfor which she would be liable and for which her property would be charged. A mere explanation of the terms does not necessarily bringhome the risks which flow from those terms. The Plaintiff was not advised to obtain independent legal advice. By the time of the1998 Mortgage, the Bank had adopted a policy of advising prospective mortgagors to obtain independent legal advice. The new policypresupposes that a mere explanation of the terms is not enough, as an explanation of terms does not require independent legal advice.As in this case, an explanation can be given by a conveyancing clerk.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> In these circumstances the Bank is deemed to have had notice of the Plaintiff's claim that the 1996 Mortgage was procured by undueinfluence, a claim I have found proved. See <strong>Etridge</strong> at 1048 para 87. In case it may be necessary, I find that, had the Bank or its solicitors brought home to the Plaintiff the risksshe was running, it is quite likely that she would not have granted the mortgage.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings on the fourth issue</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> The mere fact that the parties cannot be restored precisely to their original positions does not prevent the Court from giving appropriaterelief. In undue influence cases the court has the power to achieve practical justice between the parties by obliging the defendantto give up profits and compensate for losses.

In view of the evidence of the Plaintiff's poor financial position in 1996 (in the shape of her faxesto Mr Li) and Mr Li's inability or unwillingness to repay the Plaintiff, a sale seems likely.</p>        <p>(3) As to the value of the Property at these times, the Plaintiff relies on the Bank's own internal valuation of $10m as at June 1996.In the absence of any other evidence of value, I should accept this valuation. There is no evidence of any diminution in value inthe months following June 1996.</p>        <p>(4) What therefore the Plaintiff has lost is the $10m value of the Property less the costs of redeeming the 1995 Mortgage.</p>        <p>(5) It is common ground that the cost of redeeming the 1995 Mortgage was $6.5m.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Pleaded claim against the 2nd Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> The Plaintiff's pleading advances against the 2nd Defendant for damages for undue influence.
