The 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant are co-hosts of a liveradio talk show. The 2nd Defendant is a radio station. The Plaintiff accepts that there is no evidence of an employer-employee relationshipor a principal and agent relationship between the station of the one part and the co-hosts of the other part.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> All Defendants have pleaded fair comment as a defence. The Plaintiff has pleaded in his Reply against all three Defendants that theywere actuated by malice. No evidence has been adduced by the Plaintiff of actual malice on the part of the radio station. In relationto some particulars of malice pleaded by the Plaintiff against the 1st and 3rd Defendants, it is accepted by the Plaintiff that noevidence has been adduced against the 3rd Defendant personally.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The question of law for my decision now before I direct the jury is whether it is necessary for the Plaintiff to adduce evidenceof malice against all three Defendants individually, or put in other words, can the station, as a publisher of the allegedly defamatorywords and the 3rd Defendant as a joint publisher of all the allegedly defamatory passages, say that there is no evidence of maliceto go to the jury (in the case of the 3rd Defendant, on some of the pleaded particulars) even though there may have been malice bythe 1st Defendant?</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> This is a very interesting issue of law and a number of authorities had been drawn to my attention by counsel. The law in respectof qualified privilege is clear, at least since the decision of <strong>Egger v. Viscount Chelmsford</strong> [1965] 1QB 248. That was a case of qualified privilege where there were ten defendants participating in a committee and a defamatoryletter was written by the secretary on the instructions of the committee. The Plaintiff proved malice by two members of the committeebut failed to prove it as against the secretary and the other eight members.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The trial judge, following the first instance decision of Bankes, J. in <strong>Smith v. Streatfeild</strong> [1913] 3KB 764, entered judgment against all members. The Court of Appeal in <strong>Egger</strong> allowed the appeal and overruled the first instance decision in <strong>Smith</strong>. The Court of Appeal held that each member of the committee had an independent and individual privilege which could not be defeatedby the malice of others taking part in the joint publication. Qualified privilege attaches to the individual publisher not to thepublication. Therefore, the secretary and the eight non-malicious members were held not liable even though the Plaintiff had successfullyproved that the other joint publishers were acting maliciously.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Now that was a case where the defence was one of qualified privilege. What is the position in respect of the defence of fair comment,which is another defence which can be rebutted by malice? Surprisingly, there are no English authorities directly on the point ina fair comment case. There is one New Zealand case which I shall deal with later. In <strong>Egger</strong>, Lord Justice Denning said at p.265C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"If the plaintiff seeks to rely on malice to aggravate damages, or to rebut a defence of qualified privilege, or to cause a comment,otherwise fair, to become unfair, then he must prove malice against each person whom he charges with it. A defendant is only affectedby express malice if he himself was actuated by it; or if his servant or agent concerned in a publication was actuated by malicein the course of his employment. We have come after several years to find that the law is as Lord Porter's Committee recommendedit should be."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Although it is clear from that passage what Lord Denning's view was, it must be obiter because that was a case of qualified privilegeand not fair comment. I note also that in the same case, Lord Justice Davies said at p.269:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Mr. Colin Duncan, for the Plaintiff, when in the course of the argument general considerations of this kind were put to him, pointedout that it would be a surprising thing if, in a given case, a defence of fair comment could be open to the printers and publishersdespite the fact that the comment had been held to be unfair by reason of the malice of the author. But that is no true analogy.If a publication had been held not to be a fair comment, then all concerned in publishing it have published an unfair comment andno question of individual malice or bona fides can arise."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> So that view was opposite to that of Lord Denning's. The third member of the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Harman expressed no viewon what the position would be in a fair comment case when malice is proved against one of several defendants.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The Court of Appeal in England had an earlier opportunity to decide that point in a fair comment case in <strong>Crozier v. Wishart Books Ltd.</strong> [1936] 1KB 471. But although the Court of Appeal recognised that that was a matter of great importance to printers and publishers,they preferred to decide that matter in an interlocutory proceeding for narrower reasons.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In the case of <strong>Lyon v. The Daily Telegraph</strong> [1943] 1KB 746, however, Lord Justice Scott was less reticent. In that case, the Defendant was a newspaper publisher which had publisheda letter written by a person who had given a fictitious name and address. The Plaintiff, therefore, could only sue the newspaper.At first instance, Hilbery J. held that the newspaper could not prove that the unknown writer was acting honestly, and the fact thathe used a false name was some evidence that the writer was not acting wholly conscionably. He held that the newspaper's defence offair comment failed. The newspaper appealed. The Respondent's (i.e. the newspaper's) counsel Mr. Slade Q.C., argued inter alia atp.749:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Two parties defamed the Plaintiffs - the newspaper and the writer of the letter. They are co-tortfeasors and if the writer is actuatedby malice, the plea of fair comment is lost to the newspaper, whether or not he [the writer] is joined as a co-defendant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary for the Defendant newspaper in its defence of fair comment to prove that the unknownwriter had honestly held that opinion. Lord Justice Scott in his decision at p.752 answering Mr. Slade Q.C.'s argument said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"There is no decided case which covers the precise point. It is unnecessary to consider how far the rule that the fairness of commentmay be destroyed by any oblique motive extends where it is the Defendant's own motives which are concerned, but, assuming that commentinspired by indirect, improper or private motives ipso facto ceases to be fair and that the writer of such a letter to a newspaperwill when sued for libel, have put himself outside the pale of the defence of fair comment, it does not necessarily follow, as contendedby Mr. Slade, that if he is made co-defendant with the newspaper, the newspaper also will lose its defence of fair comment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> And there apparently, the line of English cases on this aspect of the defence of fair comment ends, apart of course from Lord Denning'sand Lord Davies' respective views, both obiter in <strong>Egger</strong>.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I should add that although mention has been made by counsel to Lord Porter's Committee on Defamation, I have not actually been referredto the command paper and I am therefore unable to consider the English position on potential legislation as compared to the legislationin Canada. There is then the case of <strong>McLeod v. Jones</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20NZLR%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 NZLR 441</a>, where the facts bear a similarity to the present case. I read the headnote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The 2nd Defendant which operated a radio talk-back session had been sued for libel by the Plaintiff. The alleged libel arose outof statements made by the 1st Defendant an independent contractor and not an employee or agent of the 2nd Defendant during a talk-backsession. The Statement of Claim alleged that the 1st Defendant had been actuated by malice, and imputed malice to the 2nd Defendantper medium of the 1st Defendant's statement. There were no specific allegations of malice on the part of the 2nd Defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">     The 2nd Defendant had raised the defence that the words were true in substance and in fact and the defence of fair comment ona matter of public interest."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It was held ordering that the paragraphs imputing malice to the 2nd Defendant be struck out, that a Plaintiff seeking to rely onmalice to rebut a defence of qualified privilege or to convert a fair comment into an unfair comment must prove malice against eachperson whom he charges with it. The judge founded his decision on a preference for the trend of authorities supporting a passagefrom Fleming on Torts which was that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"One person's malice cannot be properly imputed to another so as to defeat his defence of fair comment anymore than in the analogouscase, already considered, of qualified privilege."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> As to trends of thought, there have been a number of different views expressed by different textbook writers. Mr. Pow for the Plaintiffreferred me in particular to the 1981 edition of Gatley on libel and slander where the then editors at para. 730 said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Where the defendant has published, or taken part in publishing, the comment of another, he may rely on the defence of fair commentat least to the same extent as the person whose comment it was. Thus, if that person would have a good defence of fair comment, sowill any other person who has participated in the publication. Where, however, the comment does not express the honest opinion ofthe person who made it, no other person participating in the publication has a defence of fair comment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The present edition of Gatley at para. 16.24, however, reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"It is clearly established that where a comment originated by A is published by B, then the defence of fair comment is available toB even though the comment does not represent B's opinion: it is not malicious in a newspaper editor to publish a comment with whichhe does not agree. However, it has been said that the position is different where it can be shown that A was actuated by malice eventhough B was unaware of that. [Then, there is the quotation of Lord Justice Davies in Egger.] While there are cases which have proceededon this assumption, they were decided at a time when the present principles governing malice in relation to qualified privilege hadnot been established and may, in any case, be explained on the basis that B was responsible for A on the principle of respondeatsuperior.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">In any event, the dictum quoted above is in direct contradiction to another dictum in the same case [that is, Lord Denning's dictum]and with other dicta. It is submitted that the better view is that in such a case B may take advantage of the defence of fair comment(unless he is aware of A's malice or is vicariously liable for A) for two reasons. First, because otherwise the news media wouldbe placed in an intolerable position, in publishing letters and opinions on matters of public concern. Secondly, the contrary viewseems inconsistent with the modern view of fair comment as a "two stage" issue in which the defendant establishes the defence byshowing that the words are capable, considered objectively, of being fair comment and loses its protection only if he is actuatedby malice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I have considered Mr. Pow's argument that the defence of qualified privilege is quite different from the defence of fair comment.I accept that the defence of qualified privilege pertains to the occasion and the defence of fair comment pertains to that type ofcomment that an individual can freely make on matters of public interest. Therefore, one cannot just rely on a qualified privilegecase, such as <strong>Egger</strong>, as a complete analogy to a fair comment case such as the present one.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Therefore, I must go back to first principles and see whether it is consistent with the rationale of the defence of fair commentthat the Plaintiff has to prove malice independently against each Defendant participating in a publication.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> At this juncture, it is important to remember that where several persons are jointly concerned in the publication of an allegedlydefamatory statement, any one of them may be sued separately by the Plaintiff. It is entirely the Plaintiff's election, and it isno defence for a Defendant sued separately to say that others were involved. That is the corollary of the present issue.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Going back to basics, the basis of the defence of fair comment is well established. The defence of fair comment is one of the fundamentalrights of free speech and writing in a society that is free but kept in order by the law. Thus the defence is split into two stages.The first stage is the "objective" stage when a Defendant who has made statements found or admitted to be defamatory has to showa sufficient substratum of fact and only that that statement was of the nature of an opinion on a matter of public interest thata person <em>could</em> hold, not that he honestly <em>did</em> hold that opinion.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> I refer to the House of Lords' decision in <strong>Telnikoff v. Matusevitch</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20AC%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] AC 343</a> where the House of Lords expressly rejected the Canadian case of <strong>Cherneskey v. Armadale Publishers Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%2090%20DLR%20%283d%29%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 90 DLR (3d) 321</a> in the Supreme Court of Canada. The Canadian case of <strong>Cherneskey</strong> established a position of law in Canada which was subsequently changed by legislation there. <strong>Telnikoff</strong> is instructive because it shows that the defence of fair comment is <em>complete in itself:</em> once the Defendant shows that the defamatory statement is of the type of comment that can be freely made on a matter of public interest.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> A person who is aggrieved by a defamatory statement might think it unfair that another person could say hurtful things about himand hide behind the "cloak" of fair comment once the Defendant shows that the statement is of the <em>type</em> that <em>can</em> freely be made on a matter of public interest, when the Defendant has not even shown that that was <em>really</em> what he meant and where it might be that in his heart of hearts, he had always had the most evil intentions against the Plaintiff.But that was exactly what the House of Lords held in <strong>Telnikoff</strong>. The Defendant needed only to pass the objective test of whether that statement was of the type or nature of comment on a matterof public interest that the person could hold the opinion stated. That was regarded as the safety level, and that is not surprising,because the defence of fair comment was to enable free speech on matters of public interest.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> If the Plaintiff wishes to rebut a defence of fair comment, it is the Plaintiff who has to show that the comment was, as it were,just a "guise" and that there was some dominant and improper motive behind it other than comment on matter of public interest. Thisis the second stage, sometimes called the "subjective" stage where the court has to probe into the individual state of mind of theDefendant. But this has to be done at the instigation of the Plaintiff and it is the Plaintiff who has to prove someone else's intent.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Once it is borne in mind that each several defendant in the publication of a fair comment criticism has <em>a complete defence in itself,</em> once that defendant shows that the defamatory statement is of the <em>type</em> of comment that can be freely made on a matter of public interest and it is the <em>plaintiff</em> who has to seek to break down a defence of fair comment by a subjective probe into a person's mind, then in my judgment it must followthat an independent defence of fair comment complete in itself would not be "infected" by the breakdown of another defendant's defenceif the plaintiff could prove malice against that other defendant only.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Pow has referred me to a sentence in <strong>Dawson v. Dover Chronicle</strong> [1913] 108 L.T. at p.485 which reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The plea of fair comment is not the newspaper's plea. It is the adoption by the newspaper of the speaker's protection of fair comment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> I fail to see with respect why the plea of fair comment is not the newspaper's plea but only the adoption of the speaker's protectionof fair comment. The newspaper can judge for itself whether the criticism is of the type of comment that can be freely made on amatter of public interest because that is an objective standard. If it fails the objective standard, then it is libel, no matterhow pure the speaker's motives. If it passes that standard, the newspaper has a complete defence in itself. Beyond that a newspapercan hardly be expected to go. If on the face of it, the criticism is fair comment, the newspaper has no way of probing into the mindof the speaker in the way that a court of law can (albeit with difficulty sometimes) when assessing whether the speaker has beenactuated by malice.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I am comforted in my view of the law on the defence of fair comment by the position on the ground. If the position were otherwise,that would mean that all newspapers would find it safer to publish anonymous letters, since then, the plaintiff would have no wayof proving that the anonymous writer was actuated by malice. If, however, the newspaper published attributed letters, then the newspaperlays itself open to a rebuttal of its own fair comment defence, even though it had no knowledge of any hidden motives of the writer.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Such a position can hardly be desirable and it would indeed be strange if the law would force newspapers to prefer anonymous lettersto properly attributed letters whose writers had the courage of their honest convictions to identify themselves.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I hold, therefore, that it is necessary for the Plaintiff to adduce evidence of malice against all three Defendants individually,and in so far as the Plaintiff has not adduced such evidence against one or more of the Defendants or in one or more of the particularsof malice, I will not leave those parts of the case to the jury.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Maria Yuen)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">Jason Pow (instructed by Messrs.
