They are, he says :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1) there must be a dominant and a servant tenement: (2) an easement must "accommodate" the dominant tenement: (3) dominant and servientowners must be different persons, and (4) a right over land cannot amount to an easement, unless it is capable of forming the subject-matterof a grant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> He was content to accept what was contained in a lending text of the day, as am I.

In the words of Lord Brougham in <u>Keppell v. Bailey</u> (1834)2 My and K 517 at p.535, 536 :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There are certain known incidents to property and its enjoyment; among others, certain burthens wherewith it may be affected, orrights which may be created and enjoyed over it by parties other than the owner; all which incidents are recognised by the law. Inrespect of possession, the property may be in one, while the reversion is in another; in respect of interest, the life estate inone, the remainder in tail in a second, and the fee in reversion in a third. So in respect of enjoyment; one may have the possessionand the fee-simple, and another may have a rent issuing out of it, or the tithes of its produce, or an easement, as a right of wayupon it, or of common over it. And such last incorporeal heraditament may be annexed to an estate which is wholly unconnected withthe estate affected by the easement, although both estates were originally united in the same owner, and one of them was afterwardsgranted by him with the benefit, while the other was left subject to the burthen. All these kinds of property, however, all theseholdings, are well known to the law and familiarly dealt with by its principles. But it must not therefore be supposed that incidentsof a novel kind can be devised and attached to property at the fancy or caprice of any owner. It is clearly inconvenient both tothe science of the law and to the public weal that such a latitude should be given. There can be no harm in allowing the fullestlatitude to men in [536) binding themselves and for breach of their representatives, that is, their assets real and personal, toanswer in damages for breach of their obligations. This tends to no mischief, and is a reasonable liberty to bestow; but great detrimentwould arise and much confusion of rights if parties were allowed to invent new modes of holding and enjoying real property, and toimpress upon their lands and tenements a peculiar character, which should follow them into all hands, however remote. Every close,every message, might thus be held in a several fashion; and it would hardly be possible to know what rights the acquisition of anyparcel conferred, or what obligations it imposed. The right of way or of common is of a a public as well as of a simple nature, andno one who sees the premises can be ignorant of what all the vicinage knows. But if one man may bind his messuage and land to takelime from a particular kiln, another may bind his to take coals from a certain pit, while a third may load his property with furtherobligations to employ one blacksmith's forge, or the members of one corporate body, in various operations upon the premises, besidesmany other restraints as infinite in variety as the imagination can conceive, ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> I have quoted Lord Brougham in extenso because he sets out in the clearest terms the reasoning behind the imposition of the limitson the creation of such rights as we are here considering.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> He was speaking in 1834 in England but in my view his dictum is equally applicable to Hong Kong in the present day.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> It is clear that the undoubted right that a person has to give a name to his property is not a right in rem that operates againstall the world.

Brownrigg</u> (1878)10 Ch.D. 294 at p.301:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This is an appeal from the Vice-Chancellor Malins, who has held for the first time, as far as I am aware, and as far as the learnedcounsel in the case on both sides are aware, that a man has a legal right to the exclusive use of any name he chooses to affix toany part of his landed property, whether consisting of a house or land; for there is no distinction, as far as I can find.

That in my view is the language of covenant. According to Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, Vol I atp.582, 583 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A covenant is an agreement by deed between two or more persons to do one of more thing or things, or to do, or give, or to prevent,or refrain from somewhat; and it is either (1) a covenant in law implied from the terms employed, or (2) a covenant in fact, i.e.that which is expressly agreed between the parties."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p94" class="pseudopara" id="p94">94.</a> By acknowledging that Farouche had the right to name, the parties to the DMC must have been undertaking that they would not behavein a manner inconsistent with that right.

It was Ordinance 62 of 1984. It repealed, and in part replaced, the Law of Property(Enforcement of Covenants) Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/297">Cap.297</a>. It also, in part, codified the law of real property in Hong Kong.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> The approach I am asked to take with the CPO is that suggested by Lord Wilberforce in <u>Farwell v.

In recenttimes, because modern statutes have become so complicated, the courts myself included, (cf. Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Joiner[1975]1 W.L.R. 1701) rather too easily accept this process, whether under persuasion of counsel or from their own scholarly inclinations.But unless the process of consolidation, which invovles much labour and careful work, is to become nothing but a work of mechanicalconvenience, I think that this tendency should be firmly resisted; that self-contained statutes, whether consolidating previous law,or so doing with amendments, should be interpreted, if reasonably possible, without recourse to antecedents, and that the recourseshould only be had when there is a real and substantial difficulty or ambiguity which classical methods of construction cannot resolve.This is particularly true of Acts such as the Rent Act 1968 which have to be applied by county courts, and which have to be understoodor at least explained to great numbers of citizens."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> With that approach, it is submitted, I can give the words in the C.P.O. their plain meaning without being fettered by any interpretationthat has been placed upon these words by cases or commentaries arising before the enactment of the C.P.O.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> Clearly the words of Lord Wilberforce cannot be faulted in relation to a consolidating statute.

As far as she is concerned if you wish to ascertainthe requirements for a covenant to relate to land reference is needed, inter alia, to <u>Rogers v. Hosegoood</u> [1900]2 Ch.388.

(2) they must concern or touch the land. It is not contended that the covenants in question in thiscase have not the first characteristic, but it is said that they fail in the second. I am of opinion that they possess both. Adoptingthe definition of Bayley J. in Congleton Corporation v. Pattison (2), the covenant must either affect the land as regards mode ofoccupation, or it must be such as per se, and not merely from collateral circumstances, affects the value of the land."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> Pausing here, in my view, what the Defendant is saying is that by virtue of the covenant he is able to exercise a right which affectsthe whole building, not just the parts to which his undivided shares attach or the parts to which he has exclusive occupation, andthe ability to exercise that right enhances the value of those shares and that occupation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> With that in mind I turn to a recent case in which <u>Rogers v.

Lord Oliver formulated his own test at p.642E where he said :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Formulations of definitive tests are always dangerous, but it seems to me that, without claiming to expound an exhaustive guide,the following provides a satisfactory working test for whether, in any given case, a covenant touches and concerns the land: (1)the covenant benefits only the reversioner for time being, and if separated from the reversion ceases to be of benefit to the covenantee;(2) the covenant affects the nature, quality, mode of user or value of the land of the reversioner; (3) the covenant is not expressedto be personal (that is to say neither being given only to a specific reversioner nor in respect to the obligations only of a specifictenant); (4) the fact that a covenant is to pay a sum of money will not prevent it from touching and concerning the land so longas the three foregoing conditions are satisfied and the covenant is connected with something to be done on, to or in relation tothe land."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a> Only (1), (2) and (3) are relevant here. In the present case, if the right to name were severed from the ownership of the sharesor from the right to exclusive occupation of a part of the building, that right would clearly be of no benefit to the covenanteei.e. the Defendant.

The plea, after stating the conveyanceto A., of 'a certain close, and certain plots, pieces, or parcels of land, &amp; c., together with all ways, &amp; c., particularlythe right and privilege to and for the owners and occupiers of the premises conveyed, and all persons having occasion to resort thereto,of passing and repassing, for all purposes, in, over, along, and through a certain road, &amp; c.' alleged an assignment by A. tothe defendants of 'the said lands, tenements, hereditaments, premises, and appurtenances,' granted by the former deed; and then averredthat the trespasses complained of were committed by the defendants, being owners of the said lands, &amp; c., and in the possessionand occupation thereof, in using the right of way for their own purposes. The plaintiffs, after setting out the deed upon oyer, demurredspecially to the plea, on the grounds that the defendants claimed a more extensive right than that granted by the deed, and that,if the right as claimed was granted by the deed, it was not assignable and it was held, that the grant to A. was not restricted tothe use of the way for purposes connected with the occupation of the land conveyed : but that the right in question was not one whichinhered in the land, or which concerned the premises conveyed, or the mode of occupying and enjoying them, and therefore did notpass to the defendants by the assignment."'</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a> I have set out the headnote more fully than perhaps is at first sight necessary. However it has been emphasised before me that thescene is so different in modern Hong Kong that there is little guidance to be had from the old cases.

The Showmen's Guild</u>, to the owners of shares in a multi-storey building. He is not cited as any authority but, as I understand it, the Defendant adoptshis arguments.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p137" class="pseudopara" id="p137">137.</a> Harvey Bramwell in Conveyancing in Hong Kong, Butterworths, 1981 states, at p.275,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If you apply this reasoning to the owners of shares in a multi-storey building it can be argued that there is privity of contractbetween individual owners and that the terms of that contract can be inferred from the deed of mutual covenant subject to which eachowner purchases his shares. The deed of mutual covenant is not, of course, signed by all the owners but there can still be impliedcontract between later owners who accept the terms set out in the deed. In fact the undivided shares are assigned expressly subjectto the terms of the deed of mutual covenant. If, therefore, there is a contractual relationship between the flat owners, a managementcompany can act as the agent for the owners for the time being in order to enforce the contract between them all. This approach hasnot been tested in the courts of Hong Kong but if it is correct it may of course bypass the need to apply the law relating to thebenefit and burden of covenants attaching to land and in fact would render the Law of Property (Enforcement of Covenants) Ordinanceredundant!"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I do not accept that this approach is correct. At p.270/271 Bramwell sets out the purpose, as he sees it, of the DMC. He says,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The object of the deed of mutual covenant is to provide for the maintenance and management of the common parts of the multi-storeybuilding and to ensure that the benefit and burdens of the rights and obligations created by the deed are annexed to all parts ofthe land and buildings and run with the ownership of the various shares so that subsequent owners will be equally bound."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p138" class="pseudopara" id="p138">138.</a> That is quite correct. That is the object of the DMC but that object will only be achieved in respect of the second leg thereof ofthe rights and obligations created are recognised by law. If they are not recognised by law they will bind only the original partiesto the DMC.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p139" class="pseudopara" id="p139">139.</a> Otherwise there would be no common law and equity rules about the running of the benefit and burden of covenants with land in HongKong and the CPO would be otiose.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p140" class="pseudopara" id="p140">140.</a> Of course statute may modify the common law and the CPO has done so in significant areas where it enforces positive covenants andcovenants between owners of the same land.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p141" class="pseudopara" id="p141">141.</a> However if there is a purported grant of a right that cannot exist on law or there is a covenant that is not enforceable by S.41of the CPO it matters not if that purported right or covenant is in the DMC, it will not run with the ownership of the various sharesand subsequent owners thereof will not be bound.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p142" class="pseudopara" id="p142">142.</a> In my view no exception to the DMC can be taken save for Clause 1(b) the substance of which is not referred to at all thereafter.The Defendants rights under 1(a) are emphasised at 16(i), 17(a)(ii) and 18(a) and qualified at 17 (a) (iii) and 17 (c) .</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p143" class="pseudopara" id="p143">143.</a> The decision making process as between co-owners for matters not covered by the DMC (and presumably for invoking the right claimedat paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim) is set out in detail at paragraph 14 of the DMC.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p144" class="pseudopara" id="p144">144.</a> Nothing further, in my view, is required.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p145" class="pseudopara" id="p145">145.</a> It follows from what I have said that, being unable to justify the actions complained of the Defendant is liable to the Plaintiffin trespass and ouster and there will be judgment for the Plaintiff accordingly in the form of a declaration in terms of the firstdeclaration sought in the prayer of the Statement of Claim, namely, a declaration that the Defendant is not entitled to change thename of the Building known as "Fung House", Nos.19-20, Cannaught Road Central, Hong Kong, and situate at The Remaining Portion ofSection A of Marine Lot No.368, or otherwise to give any name which the Defendant shall think fit for the Building.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p146" class="pseudopara" id="p146">146.</a> In the light of that declaration I do not consider it necessary to issue the injunction sought or continue the one issued by MayoJ, as described earlier.

"Land" in Part IIof the First Schedule, it was submitted, was wider than the definition contained in section 2.

Thus in my view the Third Party was correct in paragraph 9 of his Defence (although this has now been abandoned)where it is said the right to name did not form part of the subject matter of any covenant implied by Part II.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p163" class="pseudopara" id="p163">163.</a> We are then left with the implied warranty claimed by the Defendant in paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim against the Third Party.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p164" class="pseudopara" id="p164">164.</a> There would be no scope for an implied warranty for title if the right to name were a right or interest in land - and easements,appurtenant rights and covenants enforceable under the CPO are all interests in land.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p165" class="pseudopara" id="p165">165.</a> It is submitted by the Defendant that if the court does not regard the right to name as an interest in land then it is a chose inaction in respect of the purchase of which, there has been a total failure of consideration. I regret that, beyond boldly statingthe proposition, I have not had the benefit of argument on that premise in so far as it relates to paragraph 11 of the Defendant'sStatement of Claim. It is certainly not expanded upon further in that pleading.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p166" class="pseudopara" id="p166">166.</a> However, says the Third Party, examine the nature of the warranty pleaded in paragraph 11. Whether the Third Party had the rightto name and whether the right pertained to the 30 equal and undivided shares, are matters of law. Whether that right is valuableis a matter that the Defendant can decide for itself as a matter of fact.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p167" class="pseudopara" id="p167">167.</a> In contrast to that continues the Third Party compare the manner in which the assignment to the Defendant came about.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p168" class="pseudopara" id="p168">168.</a> There was, as always, a period of time for investigation of and requisitions on title, the contents of the assignment are the subjectof agreement between the parties and furthermore in the absence of any express provision it is for the purchaser to prepare and tenderthe assignment for the vendor's execution. Thus it is for the purchaser to put in whatever protection he requires from the vendornot only as regards title but in respect of any matter that is the subject of the assignment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p169" class="pseudopara" id="p169">169.</a> It is certainly the case, in my view, that whether the Third Party had the right to name and whether that right was assignable tothe Defendant for the Defendant to exercise against all the other cc-owners is matter of law. It is not the subject of an impliedwarranty but is a matter the Defendant could have ascertained for itself.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p170" class="pseudopara" id="p170">170.</a> In the absence of argument I do not propose to deal with the transaction as a transfer of personal property or a chose in action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p171" class="pseudopara" id="p171">171.</a> However the warranty for title has not been established and on the pleadings as between the Defendant and the Third Party the Defendantfails to establish that there is any entitlement to any relief against the Third Party and the claim against the Third Party is dismissedaccordingly, with an order nisi for costs against the Defendant.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(B.
