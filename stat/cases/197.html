By his order the judge awarded the appellants damages in thesum of $321,270.13. The appellants appeal, because the judge refused to award them also exemplary damages, as they had asked himto do; and they now ask this court to award them such damages on top of the $321,270.13 they were awarded by the judge. The appealcame before this court (differently constituted) on 19 September 1995; the respondent did not appear, and was not represented, butthe court indicated that, before it embarked on the hearing of the appeal itself, it would require to be satisfied that, having regardto the nature of the case (the alleged misuse by the respondent of confidential information) the remedy of damages was availableat all. The appellants asked for and were granted an adjournment, to a date to be fixed, to enable them to prepare themselves tomeet the concern of the court on this point. The hearing of the appeal was subsequently fixed for 30 January 1996, when this courtreceived the appellants' argument both on this fundamental point, and on the exemplary damages point. Again, the respondent did notappear and was not represented. The respondent had transmitted a voluminous amount of paper to this court, intended to be used bothin opposition to the appellants' appeal and in support of a notice of cross-appeal, dated 11 September 1995, of his own. But, sinceit is not possible in this court for parties to advance their cases otherwise than by oral argument, and since the respondent hadnot appeared before us, in person or by counsel, for the purpose, we were of the opinion that we ought not to consider the papershe had transmitted to this court; and, since he did not appear either in person or by counsel to support it, we dismissed his cross-appeal.We then proceeded to hear the argument in support of the appeal, presented to us by Mr. John Griffiths, Q.C. At the conclusion ofthe argument, we indicated that we would take time to consider our judgments.</p>    <p class="heading">The facts</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The facts found by the judge at the trial of the action (at which, again, the respondent did not appear and was not represented),so far as material for present purposes, may be summarised as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The respondent was a barrister. He was instructed by solicitors, on behalf of the appellants, to represent the appellants at an inquest,due to be opened on 19 April 1993, into the deaths of two employees of the appellants in an explosion at the Castle Peak B powerstation. During the course of the inquest, the appellants' solicitors withdrew the respondent's instructions, as their clients hadasked them to do, and asked him for the return of the papers which they had supplied to him. The respondent instructed solicitorsin New York, U.S.A., to institute proceedings against the Exxon Corporation (which held a stake in the appellants) for compensationfor the damage to his practice, and to his professional reputation, which (he alleged) had been caused by the appellants' actionsin connection with the withdrawal of his instructions. The respondent failed to return to the appellants' solicitors all the paperswhich he had been asked to return, and indeed made use of them, or some of them, in commencing the threatened U.S.A. proceedings,which in fact he instituted, initially, in Texas on 19 July 1995 (claiming, as is the American practice, absurdly large damages),despite an injunction granted by the judge here on 16 July 1995 framed so as to prevent him from making use of such documents. Therespondent justified, or attempted to justify, his conduct on the ground that the appellants had sought to destroy him professionally,by accusing him of professional misconduct, and that in those circumstances he was entitled to make use of the papers in questionin order to rebut that charge and protect his professional reputation.</p>    <p class="heading">The trial</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The trial was held on 7, 8 and 9 March 1994. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge, rejecting the respondent's attempted justification,in absentia, of his conduct, held that conduct to have been "disgraceful". He found that the respondent had "quite deliberately utilisedinformation entrusted to him in confidence for his own advantage, and to his clients' detriment". He held that the respondent hadmisused the appellants' confidential information. He gave judgment for the appellants for damages to be assessed. (He also, in myview wrongly, ordered an account of profits to be taken as well; the remedies of damages, and an account of profits, are alternativeremedies, and a plaintiff has to elect at the trial the remedy he chooses to take. But for present purposes we should, I think, treatthe appellants as having elected for the remedy of damages.)</p>    <p class="heading">The assessment of damages</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The judge heard further argument from the appellants (once again, the respondent did not appear and was not represented) on 8 February1995. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge assessed the appellants' damages in the sum of HK$321,270.13. This was the sumfor which the appellants had asked, apparently in respect of money they had spent on a public relations exercise designed to limitthe damage which, they said, the respondent's actions had caused them. As to the appellants' additional request for an award of exemplarydamages, the judge held that although in principle he was satisfied that the case was a proper one for an award of exemplary damages,the financial position of the respondent (which was parlous) was a matter which he was entitled to take into account in decidingwhether or not to make such an award. Taking that matter into account accordingly, he decided that it would be "inappropriate" forhim to make such an award. He therefore declined to do so.</p>    <p class="heading">The right to damages for misuse of confidential information</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> As a matter of history, the common law provided no protection against the misuse of confidential information. No action for damages(the only remedy available for any wrongful act at common law) would lie. Eventually, equity, true to form, stepped in to supplementthis deficiency of the common law; it made available the equitable remedy of an injunction to restrain such misuse. Now, however,under the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 (Lord Cairns' Act), damages may be granted in certain cases in lieu of an injunction, and thishas caused some confusion.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In <strong>Seager v. Copydex Ltd</strong>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20WLR%20923" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1 WLR 923</a>, the defendant company had made use of information which had been received in confidence; but the remedy ultimately granted by theCourt of Appeal was not an injunction, nor an account of profits, but damages to be assessed. In <strong>English v. Dedham Vale Properties Ltd</strong>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20WLR%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 WLR 93</a>, Slade, J. treated the case last cited as being an application of Lord Cairns' Act, with the court granting damages in lieu of aninjunction. He added:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I am not convinced that it illustrates or establishes any general principle that the court has power to grant damages in lieu ofan account of profits; and no other case has been cited to me which suggests that the court has any such jurisdiction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(see at p.111 H). Yet there seems to be no good reason in principle why equity should not allow a remedy, the award of compensationin money for the infringement of an equitable right, without reference to Lord Cairns' Act.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In <strong>Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers (No. 2)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20AC%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 AC 109</a>, Lord Goff of Chievely, referring to the remedy of an account of profits in relation to claims for restitution in breach of confidencecases, stated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"This remedy of account is alternative to <em>the remedy of damages, which in cases of breach of confidence is now available</em>, despite the equitable nature of the wrong, through a beneficent interpretation of the Chancery Amendment Act ..... (emphasis added)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It does fly in the face of the equitable origin of the remedies for breach of confidence, and it does require a "beneficent" interpretationof Lord Cairns' Act, to hold that the remedy of damages (if by that is meant common law damages) is "now available" in breach ofconfidence cases. And it causes all sorts of difficulties. By what principles are these damages to be assessed? It will be appreciatedthat the rules differ in contract and in tort. Which, if either, is to be preferred? There are dangers in muddying the pure watersof equity with alien elements imported from the law of tort : as the Privy Council reminded this court in <strong>China &amp; South Sea Bank v. Tan</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20AC%20536" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 AC 536</a>, the law of tort "does not supplant the principles of equity" (see per Lord Templeman, at p.543 H).</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Nevertheless, Mr. John Griffiths Q.C. was able conclusively to demonstrate that, whatever historical, legal or conceptual difficultiesmay be involved in the view that the (common law) remedy of damages is "now available" in cases of breach of confidence, that viewis supported, not only by the statement of <strong>Lord Goff of Chievely in Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No. 2)</strong> (above) but by a number of New Zealand authorities to the same effect. He referred us, in particular, to <strong>Coleman v. Myers</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%202%20NZLR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 2 NZLR 225</a>; <strong>AB Consolidated Ltd. v.

Despite the misgivingsexpressed in this court when this appeal was originally called on for hearing, I am satisfied that we should accept, for Hong Kong,that the remedy of damages for breach of confidence is indeed "now available" (and do our best sensibly to work out the consequences).To do so is consistent with elementary notions of justice, if with nothing else. Why should a wrongdoer who, by his misuse of theconfidential information of another, has caused the latter damage, not be liable to compensate him for that damage? The questiondoes not admit of any acceptable answer.</p>    <p class="heading">The judge's award of damages</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The judge, on the basis of the money spent by the appellants on their public relations exercise mentioned above, awarded the appellants$321,270.13 damages. This award appears to be in the nature of an award of special damages, the expenses incurred in repairing theinjury done by the respondent to the reputation of the appellants, akin to the expenses incurred in repairing the injury to the bodyin an action for damages for personal injuries. An award of this nature in an action for damages for breach of confidence is novel(so far as I am aware) and I would reserve for consideration on a further occasion whether an award of special damages, rather thanan award of general damages such as would be made in an action for damage to reputation in a defamation action, is appropriate ina case like this. We have not had the benefit of adversary argument on the point. Nor did the judge. And, for the reasons I havealready given, the respondent's cross-appeal (in which the point might have been raised) has been dismissed. In these circumstances,despite my doubts as to its propriety, I do not consider we should interfere with the judge's award of damages in the sum of $321,270.13.I might have thought it necessary to do so if I considered that the award operated to inflict a substantial injustice; but, on thefacts found by the judge, the award cannot in my view be said to have done any such thing.</p>    <p class="heading">The judge's approach in principle to an award of exemplary damages</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In the <strong>Aquaculture</strong> case, cited above, the court said that it saw no reason in principle why exemplary damages should not be awarded in an action forbreach of confidence in a case where a compensatory award would not adequately reflect the gravity of the wrongdoer's conduct. Onceit is accepted that damages is an available remedy in an action based on breach of confidence, it seems to me to follow, from thenature of the subject matter, that exemplary, as distinct from merely compensatory, damages should, in a proper case, be availableas well (although such damages are punitive in nature and alien to equitable principles : as Somers J. pointed out, at p.302, "equityand penalty are strangers"). I would therefore agree with the judge, who held that he could properly make an award of exemplary damagesif he thought it right to do so.</p>    <p class="heading">The judge's refusal to award exemplary damages</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> However, he declined to do so. He expressed himself satisfied that this was one of those cases where the respondent's conduct (inbringing his US proceedings) was calculated to make a profit for himself which might exceed the compensation payable to the appellants.In doing so, the judge did not misdirect himself in law; that is indeed one type of case in which exemplary damages may properlybe awarded. And, so far as the facts are concerned, I am of the opinion that we ought not to disturb his findings, in the absenceof any properly supported cross-appeal, unless his conclusions are so plainly at variance with the primary facts that we must stepin to prevent a substantial injustice being done to the respondent. I would for myself have had some difficulty in coming to thesame conclusion as the judge, that on the facts the respondent's conduct was calculated to make a profit for himself which mightexceed the compensation payable to the appellants. But I do not think that is sufficient to justify us in rejecting the judge's conclusion,and this court should, I think, proceed on the footing that it was correct. Why, then, did the judge decline to make an award ofexemplary damages against the respondent?</p>    <p class="heading">The judge's reason for his decision</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The judge's reason, that it would be "inappropriate" to award exemplary damages because of the current financial position of therespondent, seems to me, with respect, to be no reason at all. The appellants' whole point was that an award of damages in favourof the respondent in his US proceedings, an award which he could not have obtained without misusing the appellants' confidentialinformation, would be a profit (potentially, a huge profit) made by the respondent from that misuse. That point would have been thesame, whether the respondent, before the award was made, was as poor as a churchmouse or as rich as Croesus. I would, therefore,put on one side the judge's reason for refusing to award exemplary damages, and hold that we should consider the matter afresh.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It seems to me, considering the matter afresh, but in the light of the judge's finding (subject to no legitimate challenge in thiscourt) that the respondent's conduct was calculated by him to make a profit for himself which might well exceed the compensationpayable to the appellants, that the appellants are indeed entitled to exemplary damages. I would so hold. But how, and when, arethese to be assessed? The profit which it is said the respondent may make is hypothetical, future and uncertain. For this court toaward these damages now, as the appellants asked us to do, in the (unascertained) sum which (perhaps) the respondent might recoverin his US proceedings would indeed, as it seems to me, be "inappropriate" (to use the judge's word). I consider the right coursefor us to take is to adjudge that the appellants are entitled to exemplary damages against the respondent, the amount of such damagesto be assessed on a date to be fixed, being a date not before the conclusion of the respondent's US proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> If, on the assessment, the appellants are able to show that the respondent has in fact made a profit, perhaps a huge profit, frommisusing the appellants' confidential information, they will recover substantial exemplary damages. If, on the assessment, it appears(as is, I think, probable) that the respondent has profited not at all from his US proceedings, the rationale for an award of exemplarydamages will have disappeared altogether. Certainly, no question can arise of our making any assessment of such exemplary damagesat this stage of these proceedings. On the other hand, there seems no good reason why the appellants should not recover, now (inso far as they are able to do so) the $321,270.13, in the nature, as we think, of special damages, already awarded to them by thejudge. This should be treated as an interim award, enforceable now, and unaffected by this judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> So I would allow the appeal to the extent that I would adjudge the appellants entitled to exemplary damages to be assessed on a dateto be fixed, being a date not before the conclusion of the respondent's US proceedings. But since Bokhary and Liu, JJ.A. are in favourof dismissing the appeal, it will be dismissed, with the consequences to be indicated by Bokhary, J.A. in his judgment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p>Liu, J.A.:</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The defendant was at one time a barrister retained by the plaintiffs. He was dismissed. He kept original and copy documents of theplaintiffs after his dismissal. The defendant has instituted proceedings against Exxon Corporation in America for "damage done tohim and his legal practice by Exxon and its affiliates". He also claimed that his reputation had been tarnished. The defendant allegedthat his claims were supported by the "voluminous documentary evidence ........ in the files of (Exxon's) Hong Kong Lawyers".</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Sears, J was satisfied that the American proceedings "were commenced utilising either original or copy documents obtained from theplaintiffs (by the defendant)". Copies of these documents have even been disseminated to the Hong Kong press. The defendant furtherexplained that criminal investigation implicating him might be initiated and that if he "then parted with the papers, (he) wouldno longer have the very proof (he) required to establish (his) own innocence. (He) had no other means to do so".</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Sears, J concluded that the defendant had used "these documents for really what (had) been described as greed, but at any rate selfinterest, because what he (had) done (was) to launch proceedings claiming the staggering sum of US$125 million". The judge describedsome of the fears of the defendant as paranoia and his actions as "shameful" or "more appropriately disgraceful". The judge gavejudgment to the plaintiffs for "substantial detriment". An account was ordered to be rendered with payment to the plaintiffs of thesums found due in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The defendant do give an account of all profits and monies presently, or potentially to be, made or received by him arising directlyor indirectly from the use of the material ordered to be returned and/or the information contained therein and that there be an orderfor payment of all sums found to be due to the plaintiff in connection therewith."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Damages were thereupon ordered to be assessed, and the judge assigned assessment to himself.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In the proceedings for assessing damages, the judge observed:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As I have said, it is difficult, as he never turned up in court, to know really what his true motive was".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The judge held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I am satisfied that it is one of the cases where exemplary damages <em>can</em> be awarded where the defendant's conduct has been calculated to make a profit for himself which may exceed the compensation payableto the plaintiff. I have no doubt that these actions of Mr Ford were calculated, for some unknown reason, to make a profit for himself.As a matter of principle therefore, in my judgment, the plaintiffs would be entitled to exemplary damages." (Emphasis supplied).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The judge was however of the view that the defendant had sufficiently punished himself by his own deeds. The judge refused to orderexemplary damages and his deliberation was focused on the means of the defendant who was a bankrupt. From such a refusal, the plaintiffsappeal.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The judge failed to appreciate the nature of "the exemplary damages award sought by the plaintiffs, (namely, an indemnity againstany award made to the defendant in the defendant's United States of America proceedings)". Clearly, the financial standing of thedefendant would not be adversely affected by the plaintiffs' prayer. If this court has jurisdiction to entertain an application forexemplary damages and if that jurisdiction can be invoked in this case, for this reason the judge's exercise of his discretion innot awarding exemplary damages could be impugned and consequently discretion would have to be exercised afresh by this court.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Some basic principles need to be addressed. First, a plaintiff cannot be awarded both an accounting of profits and damages againsta confidant for breach of his duty of confidence. These remedies are hardly reconcilable. Counsel should have been put on election.See The Law of Restitution by Lord Goff and Gareth Jones 4th edn. at p. 686; <strong>Neilson v.

See Law of Restitution, supra p. 686 et seq. Exemplary damageshave been awarded in cases of misuse of economic information by the confidant, newspapers libels, high-handed eviction of tenants,deceit and nuisance. See McGregor on Damages 15th edn. pp. 418 - 423. This list is not closed, but a prayer for exemplary damagesin the circumstances of this case is unusual and unprecedented.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Thirdly, as Professor Finn of Australian National University reminds us that "English law (on exemplary damages) is governed by LordDevlin's famous restatement in <strong>Rookes v. Barnard</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a>, according to which exemplary damages are only recoverable in three cases". Essays on Damages, Professor P.D. Finn. The plaintiffsrely on the second category of cases as formulated by Lord Devlin in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Cases in the second category are those in which the defendant's conduct has been calculated by him to make a profit for himself whichmay well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiff. I have quoted the dictum of Erle CJ in <em>Bell v. Midland Railway Co.</em> Maule, J. in <em>Williams v. Currie</em> suggests the same thing; and so does Martin B. in an orbiter dictum in <em>Crouch v. Great Northern Railway Co.</em> It is a factor also that is taken into account in damages for libel; one man should not be allowed to sell another man's reputationfor profit. Where a defendant with a cynical disregard for a plaintiff's right has calculated that the money to be made out of hiswrongdoing will probably exceed the damages at risk, it is necessary for the law to show that it cannot be broken with impunity.This category is not confined to moneymaking in the strict sense. It extends to cases in which the defendant is seeking to gain atthe expense of the plaintiff some object - perhaps some property which he covets - which either he could not obtain at all or notobtain except at a price greater than he wants to put down. Exemplary damages can properly be awarded whenever it is necessary toteach a wrongdoer that tort does not pay." <em>Rookes v. Barnard &amp; Others,</em> <em>supra</em> pp. 1226-7.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> In <strong>Cassell &amp; Co. v. Broome &amp; Another</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 1027</a> at p. 1078 H, Lord Hailsham regarded Lord Devlin's second categorisation as being "not intended to be exhaustive but illustrative".At p. 1088 D/E, Lord Reid was critical of Lord Devlin's formulation of his Lordship's second category, but he accepted that "themeaning (was) clear enough". At p. 1088 E/F, Lord Reid was prepared to exclude a malicious tortfeasor from its operation for admittedlyno logical reason other than the fact that the second category had been "firmly established" by authorities which "did not requireus to go farther". It would seem that the narrow ambit of Lord Devlin's second category is tolerably well-defined and that no extensionof the category should be encouraged.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I turn then to the issues before us: Does this court have jurisdiction to order exemplary damages? If so, may that jurisdiction beinvoked against the defendant? If not, is this court bound by what would appear to be a holding of Sears, J on whether the courtcan make an award against the defendant? If so, how is its discretion to be exercised?</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It is clear that our courts have jurisdiction to award damages including exemplary damages in equity. After all, we have fusion ofcommon law and equity in Hong Kong. Suffice it to refer to <strong>AG v. Guardian Newspapers (No. 2)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20AC%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 AC 109</a>, where at p. 286 D/E Lord Goff gave us a positive reassurance: "The remedy of an account is alternative to the remedy of damages,which in cases of breach of confidence is <em>now</em> available." (Emphasis mine).</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> What has the defendant done? He is suing Exxon for damage done to him, his reputation and his law practice. It is not suggested thatthe defendant must necessarily fail in his claims without the documentary evidence. That the defendant may conceivably prove hiscase by viva voce evidence was not examined, though it was alleged that the original and copy confidential documents would "supporthis claim". It is conceded that no damages had been sustained by the plaintiffs to found any claim. The order for account shouldhave been refused or abandoned. These original and copy documents have in themselves no economic value. All the defendant claimsagainst Exxon is for damages caused by the alleged wrongs done to him. In the defendant's American proceedings, there will be noprofit made in breach of confidence, nor benefit acquired or advantage obtained by the use of confidential information. The damagesclaimed allegedly arose from his dismissal and the following measures taken, which were said to have been improperly motivated. Thebreach of confidence or the unauthorised use of confidential material will not bring the defendant any profit, benefit or advantage.And supporting a cause of action by documentary evidence cannot be said to have given rise to any advantage in the true sense ofthat word. The defendant's gain, if any, derives from alleged loss brought about by his dismissal and the follow-up actions, impropermotivation and/or unfounded implication in a criminal conspiracy. The original and copy documents in the possession of the defendantmerely serve to support his claims founded on assertions which arose independently of these papers. None of the damages sought inthe American action is a benefit or advantage attributable to misuse of the confidential information. Profit is clearly out of thequestion. The original and copy documents in question are not of a profit-earning nature. No pecuniary value can be placed on them.It would be inapt to speak of a calculated value of these original and copy documents. No reasonable sum can be assigned to the unauthoriseduse of these documents and copies. The motive of the defendant in pursuing his America litigation is, so the judge said, obscure.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> How is it then possible to say that the defendant's activities in America are caught or clearly caught by the second category ofLord Devlin in <strong>Rookes v. Barnard</strong>, <em>supra</em>. It is true that Lord Devlin did not confine the second category to "moneymaking in the strict sense". He extended it to cases inwhich a defendant was seeking "a gain at the expense of the plaintiff" in respect to some object or property. In <strong>Broome v. Cassell</strong>, <em>supra</em> at p. 1088 D/E, similarly Lord Reid spoke in terms of "an advantage which would outweigh any compensatory damages likely to be obtainedby his victim". However, in <strong>Drane v. Evangelou</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20WLR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 WLR 455</a> at 462B (C.A.), Goff, LJ, as he then was, was of the view that "calculation by the defendant of actual money which he hoped to makeout of the conduct was not necessary". Further, in <strong>Archer v. Brown</strong> [1985] QB401 at p. 423F, Peter Pain, J was even prepared to make an award of exemplary damages in an action for deceit, where thedefendant had not made any profit at all, but no award was ordered in that case because the defendant had been duly prosecuted forfraud, convicted and imprisoned and thus actively punished. But a confidant's deeds must be judged in the context of a gain suchas profit, benefit or advantage within the contemplation of Lord Devlin in his second category. That is not the nature of the defendant'sclaimed damages in his American suit. The plaintiffs have themselves sustained no loss. Try as I may, I find it quite impossibleto put the defendant's American proceedings neatly into Lord Devlin's second category.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> An application of this kind is not known to have been previously attempted. It cannot be said that the defendants' conduct "has beencalculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiffs" (<strong>Rookes v. Barnard</strong>, <em>supra</em> p. 1226) or that the defendant "faces up to the possibility of having to pay damages for doing something which may be held to havebeen wrong but where nevertheless he deliberately carries out his plan because he thinks that it will work out satisfactorily forhim" (<strong>Broome v. Cassell</strong> <em>supra</em> p. 1094 C/D - D, per Lord Morris). In <strong>Broome v. Cassell</strong> <em>supra</em> at p. 1131 A/B, Lord Diplock assigned "the express purpose" of Lord Devlin's second category in <strong>Rookes v. Barnard</strong> to restricting, not expanding, "the anomaly of exemplary damages". In my view, it has not been demonstrated that the jurisdictionof this court to grant exemplary damages may be invoked against the defendant in this unusual case. At least, it must be very doubtfulwhether the defendant's conduct satisfies the requirements of Lord Devlin's second category.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> That this court may or may not invoke its jurisdiction to order exemplary damages against the defendant is a question of law or mixedlaw and fact, in which this court cannot be fettered by the decision of Sears, J. Even if this court were deemed, by issue estoppelbetween the parties to this appeal or otherwise, capable of granting exemplary damages against this defendant and even if exemplarydamages could be awarded in conjunction with an order for accounting profits without an election, discretion would have to be re-exercised.Matters would then have to be examined realistically to see if it would be unjust, in the exercise of our equitable jurisdiction,to order exemplary damages when in truth the defendant's case does not fall squarely within Lord Devlin's second category despitewhat Sears, J held or seemed to have held. The granting of damages in equity is always discretionary. See <strong>Day v. Mead</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%202%20NSLR%20443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 2 NSLR 443</a> at p. 451, line 25 per Cooke, P. I refer to the observation of Cook, P merely for convenience. The New Zealand and Australian decisionswhich extend the restitutional principle are not binding authorities for Hong Kong. New Zealand, Australia and Canada share a historyof restitutional remedy. See p. 104 Essays on Damages, Professor P.D. Finn. Indeed, on the grounds of indigenous exemplary principleand separate judicial policy, their Lordships in the Judicial Committee upheld a decision given in Australia, where the AustralianHigh Court refused to adopt the English approach. See <strong>Australian Consolidate Press v. Uren</strong> [1969]1 AC 590 (P.C). For exemplary damages, we should regard ourselves better guided by Lord Devlin's second category in<strong>Rookes v. Barnard</strong>, <em>supra</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Turning to discretion, "the legitimate interests of the plaintiffs in seeking to keep the confidential information suppressed andthe legitimate interests of the defendant in seeking to make use of" it in the peculiar circumstances of this case would have tobe finely balanced. "There is never any question of an absolute right to have confidential information protected." <strong>Webster v. James Chapman &amp; Co (a firm) and others</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%203%20All%20ER%20939" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 3 AER 939</a> at p. 945a, per Scott, J. In the spycatcher case, Lord Goff took into consideration "all the circumstances" for deciding if "it wouldbe just ...... that (a defendant) should be precluded from disclosing the informations to others". See <strong>AG v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd. (No. 2)</strong> <em>supra</em>. p. 281B. As to the circumstances in which the information obtaining came into the hands of the defendant, the issues were joinedin the action against the defendant and in the American action, the defendant sought to rely on the relevance of the documents anddisclosure of these documents was needed, the American proceedings aside, little could be said for the defendant. But the exemplarydamages sought in the manner and to the extent as prayed for in this case are novel. There is no known case for exemplary damagesakin to the claim against the defendant here. In <strong>Broome v. Cassell</strong> <em>supra</em> at p. 1088 F Lord Reid refused "to extend the right to inflict exemplary damages to any class of case which (was) not already clearlycovered by authority". (Emphasis added). Lord Devlin's second category was designed to restrict the anomaly of exemplary damages.See <strong>Cassell v. Broome</strong> <em>supra</em>. P. 1076 B/C, per Lord Diplock. "The firmly established authority (binds us) to accept this category however little we might likeit, but (would) not require us to go farther". P. 1088 E/F, per Lord Reid. Further, the defendant is not making any profit, acquiringany benefit or obtaining any advantage out of the use of the documents in question. In real terms, damages award in the Americanaction is not attributable to the unauthorised use of these documents and copies. These documents and copies may or tend to supportthe defendant's claims founded on independent causes of action. In conclusion, I cannot find any justification for extending theapplication of Lord Devlin's second category to the case of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Whether exemplary damages sought against the defendant may be ordered is, at least, unclear. No satisfactory explanation is givenas to why the plaintiffs should not be left to intervene in the American proceedings. After all, the plaintiffs have obtained injunctionsrestraining the defendant from using or disseminating these papers. The plaintiffs have not elected to relinquish the order for accounting,and with no loss to themselves from the unauthorised use of confidential information they have throughout been well placed to makean election. Compensation or damages in equity has traditionally been said to aim at restoration or restitution. Insofar as LordDevlin's second category may be said to be based on a waiver of tort for suing in restitution, namely, to recover the benefit whichthe tortfeasor has derived from the commission of his tort, the English Court of Appeal refused to apply "restitution" where thegain to the defendant was not matched by an equivalent loss to the plaintiff. See <strong>Phillips v. Homfray</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2024%20Ch%20D%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 24 Ch. D. 439 (C.A.).</a> The plaintiffs have admittedly sustained no loss by the unauthorised use of the said original and copy documents. Moreover, the secondcategory revolves significantly about the motive or intention behind the defendant's conduct (McGregor on Damages 15th edn. para.419 at pp. 262-3), and the motive of the defendant is obscure. It has also been said that malice by itself should not be visitedby exemplary damages. See <strong>Broome v. Cassell</strong> supra p. 1088 E, per Lord Reid. Indeed, we must not loose sight of observation of Lord Reid: "Objections to allowing juries to gobeyond compensatory damages are overwhelming. To allow pure punishment in this way contravenes almost every principle which has beenevolved for the protection of offenders". p. 1087 C. His Lordship went as far as describing the second category as providing "a formof palm tree justice". p. 1087 F/G. The anomalous and draconian nature of the remedy calls for greater caution. In all the circumstances,judicial discretion, if it need be considered, should not be exercised in favour of granting exemplary damages.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> In Mcgregor on Damages 15th Edn. para. 422 at pp. 266 and 267, it is suggested that full recognition should be accorded to the realpurpose behind the second category of Lord Devlin, which is not for "the punishment of the defendant but the prevention of his unjustenrichment". In the Law of Restitution by Lord Goff and Gareth Jones, 4th edn. reference is made at p. 690 to the observation ofSlade, J in <strong>My Kinda Town Ltd. v. Soll</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20FSR%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] FSR 147</a> at p. 156: "the purpose of ordering an account ... is to prevent an unjust enrichment". It is quite unnecessary for me to dwell onthe conceptual basis for the second category of Lord Devlin. During the hearing, I bravely resisted the temptation of seeking aidfrom counsel as amicus curiae. But for the firm views I have expressed, further submissions would be justified. For all these reasons,I would not order exemplary damages and would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Bokhary, J.A.:</b></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I have no doubt that damages are recoverable for misuse of confidential information. And I take the view that such damages can inan appropriate case include exemplary damages. But is the present case such a case?</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> What the appellants seek is a Hong Kong award of exemplary damages which, in the event of the respondent obtaining damages in theproceedings which he has commenced in the United States, would equal such United States award.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> So the appellants do not seek an award defined by a figure. Rather, they seek an award governed by an elastic formula into whichis built a contingency. I am not persuaded that such an award is ever legitimate.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> That difficulty apart, there is also this difficulty. The appellants seek such a Hong Kong award on the assumption that any awardwhich the respondent may obtain in the United States proceedings would necessarily be the result of misuse by him of their confidentialinformation.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> I do not see how we can proceed on that assumption. The appellants deny the "cover-up" alleged by the respondent. That being so,it can hardly be their case that any confidential information of theirs points to the existence of a cover-up. Accordingly, how anyuse or misuse of their confidential information could help the respondent to establish a cover-up is by no means apparent.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> On any view, there can be no basis for an award of exemplary damages against the respondent unless and until he recovers damagesand does so by misusing the appellants' confidential information.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> There is such a thing as a <em>quia timet</em> injunction; but there is no such thing as a <em>quia timet</em> award of unquantified and unaccrued damages. The present case is wholly different from, for example, the case of someone who misusedconfidential information to write a "tell all" book. There an award of exemplary damages could be made in a specific sum based ona reasonable estimate of the royalties which the book is likely to earn for the author.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> I too would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> There is one thing which I would add. If the respondent were to recover damages one day and if there then appeared to be a viablebasis for saying that he had succeeded in doing so by misusing the appellants' confidential information, it may well be that theycould then bring a fresh action seeking exemplary damages (doing so on the basis that until then they had no cause of action to pursueor to lose). I would leave that open.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The result is as follows. By a majority, the appeal is dismissed. As to costs, we are unanimously of the view that there should beno order as to costs since the respondent is not represented and has not appeared. There will be an order nisi as to costs to thateffect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(K.
