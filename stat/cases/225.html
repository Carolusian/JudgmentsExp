This common law duty retains itsimportance despite the existence today of a large body of work safety legislation.  Being a duty of <i>care</i>, it is not absolute.  But the standard of care demanded is naturally a high one since personal safety is at stake.  Breach of thisduty resulting in injury to or the death of an employee affords a cause of action against the employer in the tort of negligence. If there is one question of law lying at the heart of the present appeal, it is this.  What does it take to prove a breach of thisduty?  Such a question is necessarily a broad one since the detailed answer in each case must depend on its facts.  So neither MrNeville Sarony SC for the appellant employer nor Ms Audrey Eu SC for the respondent employee was entirely right or entirely wrongwhen he said that this appeal turns on law while she said that it turns on facts.  Shortly stated the circumstances of the presentcase are as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The appellant employer Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd operates an airline.  On 17 November 2000 the respondent employee Ms Wong SauLai was injured in an accident while working for Cathay as a cabin attendant.  The accident took place on board a passenger aircraftduring a flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Three cabin crew members were on duty in the aft business class cabin.  In descending order of seniority they were a senior purser,a flight purser and a cabin attendant.  Ms Wong was the cabin attendant and therefore the most junior of the three.  Shortly aftertake-off, drinks were being served to passengers from a trolley by the senior purser and Ms Wong.  The flight purser was seeing tothe meals which would be served later on.  While drinks were being served a passenger requested a drink or another drink.  To complywith this request Ms Wong went to get a bottle from a bar cart in the aft galley of the cabin. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The bar cart consisted of an aluminum frame and several plastic drawers.  There were a number of grey drawers in which bottles layhorizontally and a taller blue drawer in which bottles stood vertically.  The blue drawer was 15 inches long.  It was normally loadedwith 13 bottles, and weighed about 30 lbs so loaded.  Ms Wong was squatting in front of the bar cart.  As she was opening the bluedrawer to get a bottle, this drawer fell out of the bar cart and landed on her right knee.  That is how she was injured.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>In the courts below</b></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Ms Wong sued Cathay in negligence for damages for personal injuries and consequential loss.  The trial judge (Andrew Cheung J) foundCathay negligent and Ms Wong contributorily negligent.  He apportioned responsibility equally between them.  So he halved the damageswhich he assessed, then deducted what Ms Wong had already received by way of employeesâ compensation and awarded her the net sumtogether with interest and costs. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Cathay appealed to the Court of Appeal on liability and quantum.  The Court of Appeal were unanimous in declining to interfere onquantum.  But it was by a majority (Le Pichon and Yuen JJA, Rogers VP dissenting) that they dismissed Cathayâs appeal on liability. In the result Cathayâs appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed with costs.  Cathay then sought the Court of Appealâs leaveto appeal to us on liability.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In granting Cathay such leave, the Court of Appeal imposed conditions under which Cathay has to pay Ms Wongâs costs here and belowwhatever the result here.  Cathay could have treated the grant of leave subject to those conditions as a refusal of leave and chancedits arms by applying afresh to the Appeal Committee of this Court for leave.  But Cathay eventually chose instead to accept thoseconditions.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Cathayâs principal contentions</b></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  It was for Ms Wong to prove her case.  Cathay now seeks to overturn the success which she enjoyed in doing so at trial and on intermediateappeal.  Its principal contentions on final appeal are as follows: </p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) The only way in which the blue drawer could pose a potential hazard was if it was deliberately misused, in other words, if itwas handled in a way that no one, let alone an experienced and well-trained and supervised cabin attendant, would conceive of handlingit. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) And the claim was distorted so that it became a question of to what lengths an employer must go in order to guard against thedeliberate folly of its employees who themselves create the very danger from which they sustain injury. </p>    </blockquote>    <p>Let us examine those contentions.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Particulars of negligence pleaded</b></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The particulars of negligence pleaded on Ms Wongâs behalf against Cathay were of</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">"(A) Failing to install sliding tracks or rails to fit in with the said drawer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(B) Failing to install safety device or to provide safety mechanism to prevent the said drawer to fall from the said flat partition.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(C) Placing the said drawer on the said flat partition of the said bar cart.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(D) Overloading the said drawer with bottles of alcoholic drinks.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(E) Placing or piling bottles of alcoholic drinks in the said drawer in an unsafe way.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(F) Failing to give the Plaintiff any or any adequate instruction or training upon the safe use of the said bar cart.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(G) Instructing causing or permitting the Plaintiff to pick out a bottle of alcoholic drink from the said drawer.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(H) Failing to take any adequate precaution for the safety of the Plaintiff whilst she was engaged upon her work.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(I) Exposing the Plaintiff to a risk of injury which they knew or ought to have known.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(J) Failing to provide the Plaintiff with safe plant or equipment, or safe place or system of work.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(K) Failing to instruct or supervise in the work that Plaintiff was performing and/or exposing her to an unnecessary risk of injury."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b>How did the accident happen?</b></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Ms Wongâs evidence as to how the accident happened may be summarised as follows.  Squatting in front of the bar cart, she locatedthe bottle containing the requested drink.  The bottle was at the far end of the blue drawer.  She noticed that the blue drawer wasoverloaded, additional bottles having been stacked between the usual thirteen.  Supporting the bottom of the blue drawer with herleft hand, she began to pull it out with her right hand.  When she had pulled it out by less than a third of its full length, sheheard the âclinkingâ sound of bottles tilting.  And before she realised what was happening, the blue drawer fell out of the barcart and landed on her right knee.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The trial judge did not accept Ms Wongâs account of how the accident happened.  In particular he did not accept her evidence thatthe blue drawer had contained more than 13 bottles or that it had not been pulled out by more than a third of its full length.  Henoted that, according to the cabin safety report prepared by the In-flight Services Manager Ms Karen Young, the aircraft was in itsâclimbâ phase at the time of the accident.  But it has not been pleaded or said in evidence that the climb had anything to dowith the blue drawer falling out of the bar cart.  So the trial judge rightly treated the climb as irrelevant to what he had to decide.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Circumstances taken into account by the trial judge</b></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In arriving at his finding that Cathay had been negligent and apportioning 50% of the responsibility to it, the trial judge tookinto account all the circumstances as he saw them.  These included, he indicated, the heaviness of the blue drawer when loaded with13 bottles, the fact that it could fall out of the bar cart if pulled out too far and the reasonable foreseeability of momentaryfailures to follow standard procedure that pressure of work can bring about.  He observed that âprimarily it is the employerâsduty to provide a safe place of work, as well as safe plant and equipment [and] to give warnings and supervisionâ.  And he discussedthe evidence which had been given as to possible modifications to the blue drawer that would, in his view, have greatly reduced therisk of it falling out of the bar cart. </p>    <p class="heading"><b>System of work</b></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Employerâs liability is said in <i>Street on Torts</i>, 11<sup>th</sup> ed. (2003) at p.266 to be âone of the most highly developed areas of the law of negligenceâ.  And a safe system of work - itis observed in <i>Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort</i>, 16<sup>th</sup> ed. (2002) at p.298, para. 8.13 - is âthe most frequently invoked branch of the employerâs duty [and] also the most difficultto defineâ.  In a similar vein, a proper system is said in <i>Markesinis and Deakinâs Tort Law</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> ed. (2003) at p.569 to be âprobably the most important, but ill-defined, aspect of the employerâs dutyâ.  These statementsare of course made in regard to the position in Britain.  But similar statements can justifiably be made in regard to the positionin Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The practice of judges and academics alike is to speak in open-ended terms of the matters that system <i>includes</i>.  I know of no attempt to provide anything like an exhaustive list, and doubt that any such attempt would prove successful.  In <i>Speed v. Thomas Swift &amp; Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1943%5d%20KB%20557" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1943] KB 557</a> at pp 563-564 Lord Greene MR said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI do not venture to suggest a definition of what is meant by system, but it includes, in my opinion, or may include according tocircumstances, such matters as the physical lay-out of the job - the setting of the stage, so to speak - the sequence in which thework is to be carried out, the provision in proper cases of warnings and notices, and the issue of special instructions.  A systemmay be adequate for the whole course of the job or it may have to be modified or improved to meet circumstances which arise.  Suchmodifications or improvements appear to me equally to fall under the head of system.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It is of course generally far easier to say whether something comes within a concept than to define the concept all the way outto the extreme limits of its meaning.  This is certainly true of the concept of system.  Whatever system may or may not encompass,there can be no doubt that the way in which Cathayâs cabin crews obtained drinks for passengers comes within its compass.  Gettinga bottle out of the drawer may sound like a relatively simple exercise.  But the point is neatly put in <i>Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence</i>, 10<sup>th</sup> ed. (2001) at p.713, para. 10-64 where it is said that âa system of work must be instituted when it is necessary in the interestof safety, even where the work consists of a regular and uniform kindâ.  A safe system of work was plainly necessary in the presentcase.  This is because the drawer in question could fall out while being opened and was a heavy one liable to cause injury if itfell onto the person opening it or somebody else. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  When the present case reached the Court of Appeal, Rogers VP (who was in the minority) took the view that âif [Cathay] had beenguilty of negligence it had to be in relation to the system of work and not in the nature of the equipment as suchâ.  As for theprocedure which Cathay had devised for getting bottles from the blue drawer, Rogers VP, quoting from the witness statement of a CathayIn-flight Services Trainer Ms Carmelina Heredia, set it out as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(a) bend one's knees (never squat or kneel down) when lifting or pulling out the drawer from the bar cart;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(b) use the whole of the forearm for support and place the same under the drawer when lifting or pulling out the drawer from the barcart;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(c) when removing the bottle of drinks from the far end of the drawer, use one hand to pull one-third of the drawer out gently byholding the handhold on the drawer and then place the forearm of the other arm underneath the drawer for support while pulling itout;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(d) only one-third or less of the drawer needs to be pulled out when removing a drink from the far end of the bar cart;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">(e) when the drawer has been pulled out, keep the forearm in place under the drawer until the drawer is stabilised and then use theother hand to remove the drink from the far end of the draw;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(f) push the drawer back lightly into the bar cart after removing the drink from the drawer."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The training provided by Cathay to Ms Wong and other trainees in the operation of that procedure had been, in Rogers VPâs view,âcareful and extensiveâ.  And he found no negligence proved against Cathay.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Giving the first of the two majority judgments in the Court of Appeal, Le Pichon JA noted that â[t]he system of work devised by[Cathay] entailed the pulling out of the blue drawer, albeit by no more than one-third of its length,â and continued by sayingthis:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âWas it reasonably foreseeable that if that happened, the blue drawer would fall off the cart causing injury? In my view, the judgewas right and the answer to both questions must be in the affirmative. The pulling out of the drawer would normally be accomplishedby a single motion and the extent the drawer is pulled out would depend on the strength applied. It is a question of judgment howhard the drawer had to be pulled in order to achieve the desired result. The fact that [Ms Wong] had had 5 years' experience as acabin attendant at the time of the accident would suggest that she should have been familiar with the manoeuvre.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Then Le Pichon JA cited Lord Oakseyâs observation in <i>General Cleaning Contractors Ltd</i> <i>v. Christmas</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1953%5d%20AC%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1953] AC 180</a> at p.190 that employees have to function âin circumstances in which the dangers are obscured by repetitionâ.  Having done so,Le Pichon JA appropriately noted the evidence from which it appeared that cabin attendants âworked under considerable pressureâwhen drinks or meals were being served.  There can be liability where the injured employee had to do things in a hurry even thoughthere would have been none otherwise.  The situation of the tea lady who was on a tight schedule and won her case (<i>Osarak v. Hawker Siddeley Water Engineering Ltd</i>, âThe Timesâ, 29 October 1982) may be contrasted with that of the cleaning lady who was not on a tight schedule and lost hercase (<i>Cheung v. Attorney General</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%204%20HKC%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 4 HKC 288).</a>  As for Ms Wongâs situation, her job as a cabin attendant was obviously one of considerable pressure not only as to time but alsoas to weight of responsibility for passenger safety and comfort. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Next Le Pichon JA turned to Lord Tuckerâs statement in <i>Christmasâs</i> case at p.195 as to an employerâs obligation.  This, Lord Tucker there said, is âto take reasonable steps to provide a systemwhich will be reasonably safe, having regard to the dangers necessarily inherent in the operationâ.  In this connection Le PichonJA cited Lord Reidâs statement in <i>Smith v. National Coal Board</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20WLR%20871" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1 WLR 871</a> at p.873 H that an employer must always have in mind ânot only the careful man, but also the man who is inattentive to such a degreeas can normally be expectedâ.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The system for getting bottles from the blue drawer was seen by Le Pichon JA as less than reasonably safe for reasons which shestated in this way:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIn the cart in question, it would appear that the grey drawer situated above the blue drawer obstructed the retrieval of bottlesfrom the far end of the blue drawer. But unobstructed access to those bottles without necessitating any pulling out of the blue drawer(thus eliminating or at any rate minimizing any risk of injury) would appear to be possible in at least two ways: either by ensuringthat the upper compartment housing the blue drawer does not also house a grey drawer or by first removing the grey drawer (containingonly 3 plastic bottles of mineral water of 1.5L each) and placing it in the space on top of the bar cart before accessing the bottlesplaced at the far end of the blue drawer. If, as would appear to be the case, the task in question could be performed in circumstancesthat would involve no or virtually no risk injury, it could hardly be said that all reasonable steps had been taken or that the systemdevised was reasonably safe. If so, it would follow [Cathay] was itself negligent.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In the opening paragraph of her judgment Yuen JA said that she agreed with Le Pichon JAâs conclusion that Cathay âwas liablein negligence for having failed to provide a safe system of workâ.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Equipment</b></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Having said that, Yuen JA added that she was of the view that Cathay was âalso liable in negligence for having failed to providesuitable equipmentâ.  She explained this view by saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe blue drawer freestanding inside the bar cart was unsuitable for the purpose for which it was used, in that it was reasonablyforeseeable that it would be unbalanced if slid out beyond the point of stability, and that it was reasonably foreseeable that anemployee would be injured by the toppling drawer with its heavy contents.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Suitable equipment is simply another term, of which there are many, for what Lord Wright famously called âadequate materialâ in<i>Wilsons &amp; Clyde Coal Co. Ltd v. English</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1938%5d%20AC%2057" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1938] AC 57</a> at p.78.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Single duty</b></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Of course the duty of care owed by employers to employees at common law is a single duty to take reasonable care for his employeesâsafety.  This is so even though it is convenient to think of the duty as involving the provision of safe co-workers, a safe placeof work, safe equipment, a safe system of work, proper instructions and supervision and (where called for) adequate training.  AsLord Keith put it in <i>Cavanagh v. Ulster Weaving Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] AC 145</a> at p.165, â[t]he ruling principle is that an employer is bound to take reasonable care for the safety of his [employees], and allother rules or formulas must be taken subject to this principleâ. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  While the duty is a single one, the aspect of the duty most engaged in the present case is, in my view, system.  So it is rightto bear in mind everything which Lord Reid said in <i>Christmasâs</i> case at p.192 about the heavy onus which lay upon a plaintiff who seeks to have condemned as unsafe a system which has been usedfor a long time in an important trade.  As to this, there was evidence that carts like the one in the present case were standardequipment in the airline industry.  But it is unknown whether the systems operated by other airlines for getting drinks from theircarts were the same as Cathayâs.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Acceptable alternative system proposed?

The passage in Rogers VPâs judgmentwhich I have in mind is this one:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âI would mention that in actions involving intellectual property rights, where the feasibility of a design of equipment and questionsof whether a particular construction is operable (which arise where there are issues of ânoveltyâ, âlack of inventive stepâ(previously referred to as âobviousnessâ) and âsusceptibility to industrial applicationâ (previously covered by âutilityâ)are matters which are commonly raised, proper particulars of a proposed design or construction are required and not only is expertevidence prepared but experiments are commonly carried out with models. Design changes for mechanical equipment cannot be properlyconsidered with a couple of imprecise suggestions or questions thrown out at the end of a witness's evidence. This became even moreclear to me after the argument. During the course of the appeal I had made some suggestions only to find out later, on further consideration,that what I had been thinking of would not provide any acceptable solution.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>That approach is to be contrasted with the approach articulated by Le Pichon JA when she said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âWhat system should be adopted is ultimately a matter for [Cathay] rather than the court for it is [Cathay] who has the obligationto take all reasonable steps to ensure that a safe system of work is in place for its employees.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  A defendant must of course know the case which he has to meet, and the issues to be decided must of course be made clear to thecourt.  This is well illustrated by the case of <i>Colfar v. Coggins &amp; Griffith</i> <i>(Liverpool) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1945%5d%20AC%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1945] AC 197.</a>  The facts of, and the decision in, that case may be taken from the headnote at pp 197-198 where this appears:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âA dock labourer working in the hold of a ship stowing bags of salt, which were being lifted from a barge alongside by two derricksworking in âmarried gear,â a system involving the fixing of one derrick arm in an outward position by means of a guy-rope, wasinjured when several bags of salt fell from a sling into the hold in consequence of the derrick arm, which was not properly secured,having swung inboard, failure to secure it properly being attributable to a fellow-servant :-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>Held,</i> that the accident was due to the isolated act of the fellow-servant and not to any failure of the employers to maintain a propersystem of working and that accordingly the doctrine of common employment applied.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I turn now to Viscount Simon LCâs dictum at p.203.  Referring to the issue of whether the accident was due to the defendantâsfailure to provide and maintain a proper system of work, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTo raise this issue, the statement of claim ought to set out, so far as relevant, what the proper system of work was, and in whatrelevant respects it is alleged that it was not observed. Instead of this, there is merely an allegation that the bag of salt âfellout of the sling on the plaintiff owing to the negligence of the defendantsâ, followed by particulars many of which cannot be regardedas alleging defects of âsystemâ at all.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Although the statement of claim omitted to do that, the omission was catered for easily enough.  That was done when (as Viscount SimonLC noted on the same page) counsel for the plaintiff made it plain to their Lordships that what he relied on was the alleged overloadingof the last few slings by picking up too many bags at the same time.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Viscount Simon LCâs dictum was considered in <i>Dixon v. Cementation Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%201%20WLR%20746" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] 1 WLR 746.</a>  At p.748 Devlin LJ (as Lord Devlin then was) referred to that dictum, and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âI do not think it means that, in every case where an unsafe system of working is alleged, it is necessary for the plaintiff toundertake the burden of pleading, and proving, an alternative system of work which could have been adopted and which would have beensafe. That is for the employer to provide. There may be cases in which the plaintiff will not get very far with an allegation ofunsafe system of work unless he can show some practicable alternative, but there are also cases â and I think this is one of themâ in which a plaintiff can fairly say: âIf this is dangerous, then there must be some other way of doing it that can be foundby a prudent employer and it is not for me to devise that way or to say what it is.â â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>That was cited with approval in the High Court of Australia by Taylor and Owen JJ in their joint judgment in <i>Neill v. Fresh Food and Ice Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20108%20CLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 108 CLR 362</a> at p.369.  And it was applied by Walters J in <i>McInerny v. Schultz</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2027%20SASR%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 27 SASR 215</a> at p.222, a decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia in its original jurisdiction. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  As much as any other claim for negligence, a claim based on an alleged breach of an employerâs common law duty of care has tobe proved by the plaintiff.  But I see no warrant for insisting that a complaint against the employerâs system can never be establishedunless the plaintiff manages to propose an acceptable alternative system.  That would involve imposing a special rule for which Isee no warrant.  As Lord Hoffmann said in <i>White v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20AC%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 2 AC 455</a> at p.505 FâG, an employerâs liability to his employees for negligence âis not a separate tort with its own rules.  It is anaspect of the general law of negligenceâ.  </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The position, as I see it, is as follows.  When considering whether an employer was in breach of his obligation to provide a safesystem, it is relevant to see if the plaintiff manages to propose an acceptable alternative system.  But even if the plaintiff doesnot manage to do so, the court is by no means precluded from nevertheless finding the employer in breach of that obligation.  Anythingless flexible would be an unwarranted fetter on proper judicial decision-making in an inherently fact-sensitive area.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  For those reasons, I hold that identifying an acceptable alternative system was not a pre-condition to finding that Cathay had failedto provide a safe system. </p>    <p class="heading">Changes since the accident?</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Lest it be misunderstood, a word ought to be said on the absence of evidence as to whether any (and if so what) changes have beenmade by Cathay to its system in question since this accident.  That absence is neither surprising nor a matter for criticism of eitherside.  In <i>Hart v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281869%29%2021%20LT%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1869) 21 LT 261</a> at p.263 Bramwell B (as Lord Bramwell then was) said that âpeople do not furnish evidence against themselves simply by adoptinga new plan in order to prevent the recurrence of an accidentâ.  At least in general that must, I think, be right.  Bramwell B said(<i>ibid</i>.) that âa proposition to the contrary would be â¦ to hold that, because the world gets wiser as it gets older, therefore it wasfoolish beforeâ.  And to that may be added a policy consideration.  People should not be discouraged from introducing enhancedsafety measures for fear that doing so would be seen as an admission that the previous measures were inadequate.</p>    <p class="heading">No previous similar accident</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Cathay places reliance on the fact that the system in question had been in operation for a considerable time without any previousaccident similar to Ms Wongâs accident.  In this connection Cathay cites <i>Michaels v. Browne &amp; Eagle Ltd</i> [1955] 2 Lloydâs Rep. 433.  In that case McNair J said this at p.437:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">âIn each case it is a question of fact which has to be decided in a practical manner, whether the employer has exercised reasonablecare and skill in the provision of the system of work in fact provided, and in deciding this issue the absence of accidents overa course of years, the absence of any complaint by Trade Union officials or by factory inspectors, are very relevant evidence although,of course, by no means conclusive.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><span style="font-style:normal">The absence of any previous similar accident is properly to be taken into account in Cathayâs favour.  But, at the same time, MsWong is entitled to have it borne in mind that such absence is by no means conclusive.</span></p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I accept that the absence of any previous similar accident is a factor, but consider it a rather limited one.  In <i>Crafter v. Metropolitan Railway Co</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281865%2d66%29%20LR%201%20CP%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1865-66) LR 1 CP 300</a> a passenger fell while ascending the stairs at a railway station.  There were no hand-rails along the walls of the staircase.  Oneof the questions was whether the defendantâs failure to provide hand-rails constituted negligence.  As one sees at p.303, it wasonly after giving more cogent reasons why not that Erle CJ added at the end that âmany thousand persons have used [the stairs]without any accident having happenedâ.  And in <i>Thomas v.

Whatthat decision did was to recognise and give effect to the qualification that it is justifiable not to take steps to eliminate a realrisk if it is small and if the circumstances are such that a reasonable man, careful of the safety of his neighbour, would thinkit right to neglect it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Here was a cabin attendant serving drinks to passengers under considerable pressure as to time.  She was getting a bottle from adrawer which, being fully laden, weighed about 30 lbs.  This involved her using one hand to support it and prevent it from fallingout of the cart and onto her.  The danger involved in that exercise was apt to be obscured by its repetitive nature.  And being onlyhuman, she would not be immune from momentary lapses of attention.  Did Cathay fail to take reasonable care for Ms Wongâs safety? This was the crucial issue of fact at the trial. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  If the blue drawer was pulled out too far while being opened, it was liable to fall onto and injure the person opening it.  Cathaycontends that it had sufficiently catered for that danger by training cabin crew members (i) to support the drawer with one forearmwhile pulling the drawer with the opposite hand and (ii) not to pull the drawer out for more than one-third i.e. 5 inches of itsfull length of 15 inches.  Rogers VP said that âin so far as [Ms Wong] was holding the drawer in the left hand rather than supportingit on her left forearm and using her right hand to pull the drawer forward, she was acting contrary to the manner in which she hadbeen instructedâ.  Le Pichon JA wondered about that.  If the drawer was to be pulled out for no more than 5 inches, would it notbe only the hand rather than any part of the forearm that would be used to support the drawer?  The instructions to cabin crew memberswould seem less than clear.  And even if they were clear, would they be adequate?  As Yuen JA pointed out, they involved the cabincrew member concerned having to estimate when one-third of the drawer had been pulled out.  She regarded the making of an inaccurateestimate through time pressure or momentary inattentiveness as reasonably foreseeable.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As can be seen from <i>Sky Heart Ltd v.
