The Defendant counterclaimed for a declaration that the Plaintiff held his share ofthe interest in the Property as trustee for the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Chan Shee Yuen died shortly before the trial commenced.  The action was ordered to continue with his son, Chan Sek Lam, as the executorof the estate against the Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Chan Shee Yuen and the Defendant were brothers.  Their father, Mr Chan Choy, (the âFatherâ) was a native of Toishan in Chinawho left for the United States in 1920s to work as a carpenter on board ocean- going vessels.  The Father had a kit-fat wife; ChuShi who died leaving two issues; Chan Shu Wing and Chan Shu Tak who migrated to the United States in 1948.  The Father married MadamTang Ngan Fung (the âMotherâ). Out of that wedlock, were born Chan Shee Yuen, the Defendant, Chan Shu Chun, Chan Shu Nam andChan Shu Yuk who predeceased the Father at the age of nineteen leaving no issues.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In the 1940s, the Father bought some properties in Toishan, including two houses in the countryside and several dozen acres of farmland. In about 1950, the Father retired to live in Toishan.  He bought a house in town for HK$40,000.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In 1954, the Father fled from Toishan alone via Guanzhou.  Presumably, as a result of the land reform and class struggle under thethen Communist rule, the Fatherâs farmland and the countryside houses were confiscated and the Mother was put in prison for beinga landlord.  Under that setting, the Defendant came to Hong Kong in late 1954, followed by Chan Shee Yuen in 1955.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Upon arrival in Hong Kong, the Father lived with his clansmen in Sham Shui Po.  Shortly after the Defendantâs arrival, they movedto 1Tuen Mun.  Two years later, on 11 September 1956, the Father entered into a deed of agreement to purchase the Property.  Theconveyance on sale was completed with the Property registered in the Fatherâs name in the District Office.  The purchase pricefor the Property was $3,000.  In the following year, the Father built a stone house in the Property.  Chan Shu Chun came to HongKong in 1957 and was followed by Chan Shu Nam and the Mother in 1958.  Upon their arrival, they all lived in the Property until theyhad other arrangements later.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 6 February 1960, the Father died intestate.  The Defendant filed an application with the District Office for succession to theProperty.  On 8 December 1960, the application was approved by the District Officer (the â1960 Successionâ) and the Defendantbecame the registered owner of the Property.  By a deed of gift dated 13 October 1981 (the â1981 Deed of Giftâ), the Defendantassigned three-fifths of the interest in the Property to each of his siblings, retaining two-fifths of the interest to himself.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam had moved out of the Property in 1980 and later migrated overseas.  Chan Shee Yuen lived in the stonehouse in the Property until 1991 when he returned to China.  Upon his return several months later, he was excluded from the Propertyby the Defendant.  The Property was since solely occupied by the Defendant and his family.    Since July 1998, part of the Propertyhad been rented by the Defendant to a coach operator, Yeung Ming Hin, as a car park for about HK$7,000 a month.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Chan Shee Yuen commenced action in the Small Claims Tribunal under Claim No SCTC39787 of 2000 against the Defendant for a sharein the rental income from the Property in 2000.  Then he commenced the present action on 9 January 2002.</p>    <p class="heading">Preliminary issue: the issue of joinder</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  When the trial commenced, Mr Siu, counsel for the Defendant, made an application to determine as a preliminary issue whether theother siblings should be joined as parties to the action.  He submitted that if my answer to that question be in the affirmative,the Plaintiffâs action must be dismissed or adjourned for direction as to the further conduct of the proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Siuâs argument was as follows.  The Father died intestate leaving altogether six children, two by the former marriage to ChuShi and four by the marriage to the Mother.  Hence, he argued that all the surviving siblings, half-siblings and the issues of thosedeceased siblings and deceased half-siblings had an interest in the Property and should be joined as parties to these proceedings. He further argued that it was unjust and inequitable to dispose of the interest of the other siblings and half siblings who arenot parties to this action and for the Court to make any orders which are binding on them.  He relied on Order 15 rule 6(2)(b)(i)and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352">Cap 352</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In my view, Mr Siuâs argument was founded on false premises.  This is not an action in respect of the estate of the Father.  ThePlaintiffâs action is not founded on his right under the intestacy of the Father, but on the 1981 Deed of Gift signed by the Defendant. The question of the siblingsâ and half-siblingsâ right under the intestacy of the Father is irrelevant.  The Plaintiff is notdisputing the legality of the Defendantâs 1960 Succession to the Property nor is the Defendant.  The Plaintiff is not seeking toset aside or to challenge the validity of the 1981 Deed of Gift.  Nor is the Defendant.  It is indeed common ground that the 1960Succession and the 1981 Deed of Gift are all valid.  Thus, the legality of the Succession and the validity of the 1981 Deed of Giftare non-issues in these proceedings.  None other than those who were parties to the 1981 Deed of Gift need be made a party to theseproceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In the light of the partiesâ pleadings Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6(1)</a> does not avail him.  That rule provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)   No cause or matter shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or nonjoinder of any party; and the Court may in any caseor matter determine the issue or questions in dispute so far as they affect the rights and interests of the persons who are partiesto the cause or matter.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">  (2)   Subject to the provision of this rule, at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter the Court may on such termsas it thinks just and either of its own motion or application-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)   â¦</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(b)   order any of the following persons to be added as a party, namely â</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(i)    any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence  before the Court is necessary to ensure that all mattersin dispute in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon, or</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(ii)   any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relatingto or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenientto determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.â</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  This is a litigation between the Plaintiff and the Defendant founded on the 1981 Deed of Gift and on the basis that the 1960 Successionand the 1981 Deed of Gift were valid.  The half-siblings are not parties to the 1981 Deed of Gift.  There is no issue or matter indispute between the half-siblings and the parties in respect of the 1981 Deed of Gift which requires a determination or adjudicationas to justify them to be joined as parties to this litigation under Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6(2)(b)(i).</a>  Even if the half-siblings might have an interest in the Property by reason of the intestacy so that as between them and the Plaintiffor the Defendant there might exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimedin this action, in the light of the pleadings, it would not in my opinion be just and convenient to have the issues determined asbetween any of the half-siblings and either of the parties to the cause or matter.  There is no need to join the two half-siblingsor their issues in this action. The outcome of this litigation has no bearing on the half-siblings and their issues and will notbind them.  If indeed they have an interest in the Property under the Fatherâs intestacy, they can bring an action against theDefendant in respect of the 1960 Succession or against the Defendant, the Plaintiff and their two siblings as co-owners of the Propertyunder the 1981 Deed of Gift.  They are not necessary parties to these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  As for the other two siblings, they gave evidence before me.  Both of them clearly indicated their unwillingness to join as a partyand had no objection that the Property be partitioned or be sold or if no order was made.  They understood clearly that not beinga party to the proceedings, they had no claim to any share in the rent or other profits arising out of the Property since July 1998. They have been explained and were fully appreciative of the principle of issue estoppel that if the Defendant should succeed, theymight be estopped from disputing that they hold their one-fifth share of the Property on trust for the Defendant for remaining silentwhile knowingly watch the Defendant asserting a right over their share of the interest in the Property.  Chan Shu Chun said he wouldwish to have a share in the proceeds of sale of the Property if an order for sale was made.  Chan Shu Nam indicated that he wouldnot care whether he received any share in the proceeds of sale.  They are persons within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6(2)(b)(ii)</a> who may be joined as parties.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  However, the Courtâs power to join any person either upon application by that person or by the parties to the proceedings or atthe Courtâs initiative, is a discretionary one.  In exercising its power, the Court must bear in mind the wishes of those personsto be joined and more importantly whether it is necessary, just and convenient to have him joined.  In view of the wishes and attitudeof both Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam, I think it is not necessary to have them joined as parties.  They had no objection to anorder for partition or sale, save that in relation to Chan Shu Chun he expressed that if an order of sale was made he would wishto be given his due share of the proceeds of sale, an order which I would be duty bound to make if I were to make an order for sale. They indicated in unequivocal terms that they did not wish to be made parties to the proceedings.  There is no need for them tobe joined as parties to these proceedings and there is nothing to be gained by doing so.  It would not be just and convenient toorder a joinder as that would only result in delay and in unnecessary costs to the Plaintiff, the Defendant as well as the unwillingsiblings themselves, which would achieve nothing.  Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6(1)</a> expressly preserves an action from being defeated by the misjoinder or non joinder of parties.  In the circumstances, I do not thinkit is necessary, just and equitable that the siblings should be joined as parties to the proceedings under Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6.</a></p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Lastly, Mr Siu submitted that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(3)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(4)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352">Cap 352</a>) must be read together with the result that the existence of other interested party is not a matter which the Court shouldnot be concerned.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3(1)</a> to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">3</a>(4) provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) Where any property in land is held in the manner referred to in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a>, any person interested in such property may institute proceedings in the Court under this Ordinance by way of an action for partitionor sale.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) In any proceedings under this Ordinance the Director shall be served â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) Subject to subsection (2), proceedings under this Ordinance may be instituted against one or more of the persons interested withoutserving the other or others, and no defendant may object for want of parties.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4) At the hearing of the proceedings the Court may direct such inquiries as to the nature of the property, the persons interestedtherein and such other matters as it thinks necessary or proper, and it may add any person as a party whose presence before the Courtis considered desirable; â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Of course, in construing an Ordinance, the Ordinance must be read as a whole.  However, by no reading of the section and the Ordinanceas a whole can it give rise to the suggestion that anyone interested in a property subject to an application for partition must bejoined.  Quite on the contrary, on a true construction, subsection (1) permits any person interested in the property to instituteproceedings and subsection (3) expressly permits proceedings under the Ordinance to be instituted against one or more of the personsinterested in the property without serving the other interested persons and that no defendant may object for want of parties.  Thepower of the Court under subsection (4) to direct inquiries as to the nature of the property, the persons interested therein andother matters and to add any person as a party is phrased in discretionary and not mandatory term.  Furthermore, this power is onlyexercisable subject to necessity.  From these provisions, it is amply clear that the intent of the legislature is that any co-ownerof a property, whether as a joint tenant or tenant in common may institute proceedings against another co-owner without joining anyor all of the other co-owners.  The Courtâs discretion to join other co-owners as parties may only be exercised if it is necessary,proper or desirable.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In considering whether it is necessary, proper or desirable to join in any other co-owner, the Court must have regard to all thelikely consequences of the trial.  In an action under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a>, the Court may order partition under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> or sale under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> or may make no order.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(1)</a>, the Court may make an order for the partition of property in land.  The section does not prohibit the Court from making an orderfor partition if any person interested has not been made a party.  The only prohibition is to be found in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(3)</a>, which provides that no order for partition shall prejudice any person other than a party to the proceedings.  Thus if a co-ownerhas no objection or agrees to partition, an order for partition is not prejudicial, especially if the Court has taken into considerationhis interest when giving necessary or proper consequential directions in giving effect to the order.  Chan Shu Chun and Chan ShuNam have no objection to an order for partition.  So long as their interests are taken care of when giving consequential directions,an order for partition may nevertheless be made without making them parties to these proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> gives the Court very wide discretion in making an order for sale.  If it appears to the Court that a partition of the property wouldnot be beneficial to all the persons interested by reason of the nature of the property, the number of persons interested or presumptivelyinterested, the absence or disability of some of the persons interested or any other circumstances, the Court may make an order forsale notwithstanding the dissent or disability of any person interested.  The Property is a lot of about 13,200 square feet accordingto the Defendant. It would have to be partitioned into four parcels. Except for the parcel to be allocated to the Defendant, thesize of the remaining three parcels would be approximately 2,640 square feet each.  Even without the benefit of expert opinion, itis apparent that small plots of farmland of this size would practically be of little use or value.  Besides, there will be problemsin providing individual or common access to all the parcels.  Partition is unlikely to be beneficial to all the persons interested. An order for sale is in all probability the likely order to be made, if at all.  As an order for sale may be made notwithstandingthe dissent of any person interested, it is not necessary for Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam to be made a party to these proceedings,especially as they have no objection to an order for sale.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In the circumstances, in view of the stance and attitude of Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam, whatever the outcome of this trial,it is not necessary, proper or desirable to have them joined as parties to this action.  Joining them as parties would only occasionunnecessary delay for the parties and unnecessary costs for everyone.  Accordingly, I make the preliminary ruling that the actionmay proceed without joining Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam as parties.  I expressly refrain at this stage from making any findingwhether it is just and equitable to dispose of their interest in the Property without making them a party to the proceedings.  Ireserved costs.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Following my ruling Mr Siu sought an adjournment to enable the Defendant to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the above ruling. Both the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal have confirmed that interlocutory appeals are to be strongly discouragedas such appeals are undesirable and disruptive.  Mr Siu advanced no grounds to justify why these proceedings should be disruptedby an interlocutory appeal except that he disagreed with me as to the law.  He could cite no authority showing that I have erredin principle such that it is appropriate for the Court of Appeal to intervene.  In my opinion, this trial should be allowed to runits course.  Should there be an appeal, the Court of Appeal should have the benefit of a proper finding of fact from the court below. I therefore dismissed the application with costs.</p>    <p class="heading">The parties' case, burden of proof and the issues</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The Plaintiff's pleaded case is that he received one-fifth share in the Property based on the 1981 Deed of Gift.  His burden thereforeis to prove the Deed, its due execution and its validity.  On the pleadings, these matters are not in dispute.  Hence, the Plaintiffhas no burden to discharge.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The defence is that the Property was purchased by the Defendant with his own money, but as he was then not of full age and capacitythe Father purchased and held the Property under a resulting trust for the Defendant.  Thus, the Defendant acquired title to theProperty by the 1960 Succession in his own right as the beneficial owner of the Property for having provided the funds for its purchase. He then assigned one fifth interest in the Property to each of his siblings under the 1981 Deed of Gift at their request for thepurpose of enabling them to obtain resettlement or compensation in the event of a possible resumption of the Property by the Governmentand on their representation that they would not claim any legal interest to the Property.  Hence, the Defendantâs case is thatChan Shee Yuen as well as the other siblings each held one-fifth of the interest in the Property on trust for him.  He counterclaimedagainst the Plaintiff for a declaration to that effect.  Thus the Defendant bore the burden of proving the two trusts, i.e. provingthat he provided the purchase money for the Property in 1956 and the Plaintiffâs representation which resulted in his executingthe 1981 Deed of Gift.  In my view, these are the issues in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  However, Mr Siu took a different view.   He vehemently repeated his views made in the preliminary issue.  He argued that the Plaintiffâsclaim is ill-founded.  He reiterated that the Plaintiff relied on the 1981 Deed of Gift which in turn depended on the legality ofthe chain of title, including the 1960 Succession.  Hence, he submitted that it was open to him to challenge the chain of title relyingon the rule in nemo dat and that upon such a challenge it was incumbent upon the Plaintiff to prove that the assignment was goodand the 1981 Deed of Gift was valid otherwise the Plaintiff could not derive any interest or title from it.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In setting out the Plaintiffâs pleaded case and the Defendantâs pleaded defence above, it is clear that the validity of the1960 Succession and the 1981 Deed of Gift is common ground and not in dispute.  In answer specifically to my question, Mr Siu unequivocallyconfirmed that the Defendantâs stance was that the 1960 Succession was lawful.  That is understandable because the Defendant derivedtitle to the Property by reason of the 1960 Succession.  Mr Siu also had no dispute that the 1981 Deed of Gift was valid.  The Defendantdid not deny the authenticity of the deed or that he signed the deed.  He did not plead non est factum, mistake, fraud, duress orany other vitiating factors.  Thus, the validity of the 1960 Succession and the 1981 Deed of Gift is not in dispute and is not inissue.  Mr Siu argued that he was nevertheless entitled to challenge the weakness of the Plaintiffâs case on the chain of titleto the Property.  I do not agree.  Mr Siu had confirmed that these matters were neither pleaded nor disputed by the Defendant.  Ifthese matters are not pleaded, they are not in issue, let alone they are not disputed.  It is not open to Mr Siu to challenge anythingthat is neither pleaded nor in issue.  With respect to Mr Siu, his argument demonstrated a blatant confusion of thought and a wantondisregard to the pleadings and their purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Next, Mr Siu submitted that the Plaintiffâs case is contrary to his pleading.  His argued that in answer to the Defendantâsrequest for further and better particulars of the Plaintiffâs interest in the Property prior to and as at the date of the 1981Deed of Gift, the Plaintiff answered that prior to that date, the Plaintiff was entitled to one quarter share in the beneficial interestin the Property when administration of the Fatherâs estate was or was deemed to have been completed and that as at the date ofthe 1981 Deed of Gift, he was entitled to one-fifth share as the registered owner of the Property.  Hence Mr Siu argued that thisanswer formed part of the Plaintiffâs pleading and part of the Plaintiffâs case.  He submitted that if the Plaintiff had derivedinterest in the Property in 1960 as a result of the Fatherâs intestacy, he was only entitled to one-sixth share in the Propertyand could not re-derive any interest in the Property at a different proportion by the 1981 Deed of Gift.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  While I have no doubt that the above answer formed part of the Plaintiffâs pleading, it does not necessarily follow that by extractingthat answer from the Plaintiff, the answer became part of the Plaintiffâs case.  The Plaintiffâs case is that he was given one-fifthshare in the interest in the Property under the 1981 Deed of Gift, the validity of which is not in dispute.  The Plaintiffâs answeras to the interest he had prior to the date of the 1981 Deed of Gift is irrelevant.  That answer never formed part of the Plaintiffâscase.  It was ordered to be given by a master upon an application made by the Defendant which was contested by the Plaintiff.  Apleading of an irrelevant fact extracted by the Defendant cannot form part of the Plaintiffâs case.  On the pleading, it neverwas the Plaintiffâs case that he derived interest in the Property as a result of the Fatherâs intestacy.  The Plaintiffâs claimis based on the 1981 Deed of Gift.  Mr Siu fully appreciated that.  It is impossible to understand why he should pursue that lineof argument.  It is for the Plaintiff to plead his case and to present his case as pleaded.  It is not for the Defendant to hijackthe Plaintiffâs conduct of the litigation and to run it the way the Defendant wanted it to be run and to lose it.  Again with everyrespect to Mr Siu, it is impossible to launch that sort of argument.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In my view, the issues raised in this action are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)   whether the Defendant provided the money for  the purchase of the Property;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)   if the Defendant did, whether the Plaintiff held his one-fifth interest in the Property as trustee for the Defendant;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)   if the Plaintiff did not, whether there should be (a)   an order for partition or sale of the Property;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)   an order for an account of the rents, profits or other income arising or derived from the Property; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)   an award of damages suffered by the   Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  If the first and second issues are resolved against the Defendant, the Plaintiff bears the burden of proving that an order for partitionor order for sale is appropriate and the measure of damages.</p>    <p class="heading">The evidence of the parties</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Chan Shee Yuen passed away before this trial commenced.  He had prepared a witness statement for the purpose of this litigationin the solicitorâs office in the presence of his son, Chan Sek Lam.  Chan Sek Lam tendered that statement as evidence and gaveevidence that the statement had been explained and interpreted to Chan Shee Yuen who confirmed it was true and correct.  Chan SekLam did not have first hand information about the matters averred to in Chan Shee Yuenâs witness statement, much of its contentswas hearsay.  The Plaintiff also called one of his siblings, Chan Shu Chun to give evidence.   Part of his evidence is also hearsay.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  According to Chan Shee Yuenâs witness statement, the Father moved to Tuen Mun and rented a piece of land to farm with.  Aftertwo years, the Father bought the Property for HK$3,000 and then built a house on it with his own money.  That was hearsay upon hearsay. That evidence was, however, supported by Chan Shu Chun who gave evidence in these proceedings.  According to Chan Shu Chun, hisFather told the family that he had deposited about US$16,000 in a safe deposit box with Hong Kong And Shanghai Bank when he passedby Hong Kong on his way from the United States to Toishan.  Chan Shu Chun was then 15 to 16 years of age.  Then to his knowledge,the Father took US$10,000 from the safe deposit box to buy a house in Toishan city for $40,000.  At the time the rate of exchangewas about one US Dollar to four Hong Kong Dollars.  Both his Father and his mother told him that the Father had bought the Propertyfor $3,000 and some shares in Luk Hoi Tung Company Limited with his own money he had in the safe deposit box.  Again, that evidencewas hearsay as Chan Shu Chun only came to Hong Kong in about 1957 and had no personal knowledge of those matters.  But there wasno dispute that the Father had bought the house in Toishan city for $40,000 and had bought some shares in Luk Hoi Tung Company Limited. That is the state of the Plaintiffâs evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The Defendant was the sole witness in the defence case.  His case is that the Father fled to Hong Kong and lived in Sham Shui Powith some friends.  Then he joined the Father in 1954.  He lived there for 20 days and came to know a clansman by the name of LeeFoon.  Then Lee Foon suggested him to move to San Hing Tsuen in Tuen Mun and introduced him to a villager called Yeung Shing.  YeungShing had a lot of farmland and let him have the use of a plot of about 8,000 square feet free of rent for growing vegetables andraising pigs and chickens.  After about three months, he came to know the village representative Siu To Wing, who also let him usetwo other plots of land rent free for farming.  He had his harvest of vegetables after 30 days.  He made good profits from the harvestsince there was no vegetable supply from China and the New Territories was then only source of vegetables for Hong Kong,  In August1954, he started raising chicken and pigs.  He raised a hundred chickens which he sold after six months in February 1955 for $16to $17 each.  At the same time, he bought a pig for $300 from a villager who was migrating.  The pig gave birth to 14 piglets whichhe raised and sold for $200 each after eight months.  His neighbours gave him seeds to grow while suppliers sold him animal feedon credit which he repaid after selling his produce.  Then a year later, he purchased the Property from To Yu Tin through the introductionof Fung Yuen.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  According to the Defendant, on 11 September 1956, To Yu Tin signed an agreement for sale of the Property to the Father and receiveda deposit of $1,000 from the Defendant.  The Father refused to sign that agreement because it was the Defendant who bought and providedthe purchase money.  The Father signed the conveyance on sale and completed the purchase on 29 September 1956 at the District Office. In 1957, the Defendant built the house with his own money.  Then his other brothers, Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam and Mother camefrom China to join the family and lived in his house.  Neither he nor the Father had told the siblings that he was the purchaserof the Property, but his Mother had told them that he was the real owner.  In February 1960, the Father died.  The Defendant appliedto the District Lands Officer for succession to the Property on 21 October 1960.  His application was approved on 8 December 1960.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  There is no dispute that the Defendant moved out of the Property in 1962 to a flat which he bought in To Kwa Wan and that Chan ShuChun and Chan Shu Nam also moved out of the Property to live in their own accommodation in 1980, leaving the Mother and the Plaintiffliving in the Property for most of the time during the next thirty years..</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  As for the circumstances leading to the execution of the 1981 Deed of Gift, the Plaintiffâs case according to Chan Shee Yuen isthat the other siblings did not know that the Defendant had succeeded to the Fatherâs interest in the Property.  They thought theDefendant had only succeeded to the Fatherâs licence in the house.  Then in 1980, the Mother and the other three siblings requestedthe Defendant to transfer part of the interest of the Property to the other siblings.  Eventually, the Defendant agreed to dividethe Property into five shares, one for each of the four siblings and the Mother and to allocate one share to each of his siblingswhile he retained two shares.  The 1981 Deed of Gift was to give effect to that agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  But, according to the Defendant, the Plaintiff told the Defendant that his family was poor and their living condition was not good. The Plaintiff told him that if the Property was resumed by the Government, the registered owners of the Property would be givengovernment re-settlement or compensation.  On behalf of himself and the other two siblings, the Plaintiff repeatedly urged and persuadedthe Defendant to add his and Chan Shu Chunâs and Chan Shu Namâs names as registered owners of the Property and expressly representedthat they did not want to obtain any title in the Property and that they only wanted to be qualified for compensation or resettlementby the Government in case of resumption.  The Defendant agreed.  At the advice of the District Office, the Defendant executed the1981 Deed of Gift in favour of the Plaintiff and the two siblings to give effect to that agreement.  However, no resumption tookplace after several years.  In 1991, the Plaintiff left for China.  When the Plaintiff sought to return to the Property in 1992,the Defendant refused to allow the Plaintiff access to the Property as it was his own property, it was occupied by the Defendantand his family and there was no room for the Plaintiff.  </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  According to the Defendant, Chan Shee Yuen and his son Chan Sek Lam asked for a loan from the Defendant and to provide accommodationfor them.  The Defendant refused and Chan Shee Yuen repeatedly disturbed the Defendant and his family.  In his witness statementwhich formed his evidence in chief, the Defendant alleged that Chan Shee Yuen disturbed and threatened the Defendant again in January2000 and the matter was reported to the police.  However, he withdrew that allegation under cross-examination.  Then through themediation of Yeung Shingâs son, Yeung Ming Hin, the dispute was settled by the Defendant lending $3,000 and then $8,000 to ChanShee Yuen.  In February 2002, Chan Shee Yuen demanded money from him again.  The Defendant refused.  Chan Shee Yuen then institutedaction in the Small Claims Tribunal and later took out the present action.  Chan Sek Lam did not dispute the receipt of the two sumsof $3,000 and $8,000 but denied to have any knowledge of the purpose for the payments.  As Yeung Ming Hin was the person who mediatedthe dispute between Chan Shee Yuen and the Defendant, the payments might be related to Yeung Ming Hinâs lease of part of the Propertyfor parking his coaches.  But there is no need for me to speculate the reason for the payments.  It is not relevant to the centralissue in dispute. </p>    <p class="heading">Credibility</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The Plaintiff called two witnesses: Chan Sek Lam and Chan Shu Chun.  Chan Sek Lamâs evidence was only of marginal importance. I find Chan Sek Lam evasive when he denied knowledge about the reason for the two payments of $3,000 and $8,000 received by ChanShee Yuen.  That reflected adversely on his credibility.  However, in the light of the totality of the evidence, this has littleimpact on his credibility.  I consider Chan Shu Chun an honest and credible witness.  His evidence was inherently credible and hisanswers in cross-examination were spontaneous.  I accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The Defendant gave evidence.   But he did not impress me as an honest and credible witness.  He was evasive when giving evidenceabout the 1960 Succession.  He departed from his witness statement in respect of the representation made by his siblings that theyhad no wish to claim legal title in respect of the Property.  He was confused in his evidence when he accounted for the purchasemoney for the Property.  He was also changing his evidence about the shares in Luk Hoi Tung Company Limited.  He impressed me asan unreliable and exaggerating witness.  It appeared to me that he was making up his evidence while he was in the witness box.  Theseapart, his evidence is inherently incredible.  I do not accept his evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Who provided the purchase money for the Property</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I now turn to the crucial issue of whether the Defendant provided the purchase money for the Property.  The Defendant had the burdenof proof.  Before analysing the Defendantâs evidence, it should be recalled that the setting was that the Father was a retireefrom the United States having worked to the end of his carrier as a carpenter.  He had saved some money which bought him some propertiesand farmland in Toishan and some shares in Luk Hoi Tung Company Limited.  He fled to Hong Kong from Communist rule in 1954 when hewas 73 years old.  The Defendant arrived Hong Kong to join the Father later that year.  He was then seventeen years old.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In a nutshell, the Defendantâs case is that after he moved to Tuen Mun with his Father, he came to know Yeung Shing and Siu ToWing who gave him, a total stranger of seventeen, land to farm with.  He was given seeds to grow vegetables by his neighbours andcredit by suppliers to buy animal feed for his poultry and pigs.  He was able to start a very profitable farming business with absolutelyno capital and which earned him $3,000 to pay for the Property.  He gave no credit to his Father, saying that the Father had no money,was suffering from rheumatism and was too old and feeble even to assist him in his farming.  He said that not only he supported hisaged parents, he provided food and shelter for the entire family, including the education of his two younger siblings.  But whenthe Defendantâs evidence is analysed against the background at the material time, it is plainly incredible.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In contrast, the Father had undoubtedly been a rich retiree with substantial saving, at least at some stage.  There was no evidencehow much, if any, the Father had brought with him when he fled from Toishan.  However, there was no dispute that the Father laterbought some shares in Luk Hoi Tung Company Limited.  The Defendant tried to play down the significance of those shares by sayingthat the shares had been given to him by his Father and that there were only a few shares.  He said his Father gave him the sharesbecause of his contribution to the family.  The Father took him to the company office and transferred the shares to him.  However,when asked about the dividend he last received, he said the company refused to pay him dividend because he could not produce thenecessary probate documents.  This is utterly inconsistent with his earlier evidence which show that he had something to hide andwas making up his evidence as he went along.  He then explained that when the Father took him to the company to transfer the sharesto him, the staff of the company advised that there was no need transfer the shares and he could collect the dividend by showingthe passbook to the company.  Again, this is incredible.  On the other hand, Chan Shu Chunâs evidence is that the Father wrotefrom Hong Kong back home and informed the family that he had bought shares in Luk Hoi Tung Company Limited and received dividends. Chan Shu Chun said that the Defendant gave him dividends in sums of $2,000 to $4,000 two or three times in about 1987 and 1988. The Defendant denied and said he only gave some petty cash of a hundred dollars or so to his brothers for the new year and did notgive them dividends from the shares as the shares were his.  I find the Defendant was not telling the truth about the shares.  Iaccept Chan Shu Chunâs evidence about the dividends and about what the Father had told the family in his letter from Hong Kong. Though there is no evidence about the number of shares the Father bought, the quantity of shares was not insubstantial in view ofthe dividend in 1987 and 1988.  The irresistible inference must be that the Father had either brought some money with him when hefled Toishan or he had left some US Dollars in his safe deposit box in Hong Kong And Shanghai Bank when he returned to Toishan enroute Hong Kong as he had told his children.  Whatever was the truth, the Father was not as unresourceful as the Defendant wouldhave me to believe.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The Defendantâs story about his profit from farming is too good to be true.  He said he made $3,000 in two years to buy the Property. That was a huge sum of money in 1957.  According to the unchallenged evidence of Chan Shee Yuen, he earned $15 per month as a farmerin 1957 and $20 to $40 per month as a factory worker in 1960s.  Thus the $3,000 which the Defendant allegedly made in two years wasas much as 200 monthâs wages for a farm worker.  While luck and entrepreneurial success may go hand in hand, it is just too incrediblethat two strangers, Fung Yuen and Siu To Wing who only came to know the Defendant shortly would have given this young stranger ofseventeen years of age three plots of land to farm with free of rent, instead of employing him to farm the land just like the Plaintiffwas being employed to farm and raise pigs for another villager.  It is also incredible that three suppliers could have supplied thePlaintiff, again a total stranger, animal feed on credit without any security to the extent of $2,000 to $3,000 in those days, whichwas enough to buy the Property or enough to pay 200 workers for one month.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The Defendant was confused in his evidence when accounting how he paid the purchase price for the Property.  Initially, his evidencewas that he borrowed $3,000 to purchase the Property from a Mr Tang and two other suppliers who sold him animal feed.  Then he changedhis evidence and said he meant that he purchased animal feed on credit.  He was asked questions in Punti dialect which he was veryfluent with.  The questions asked were straightforward and clear.  The two matters were unrelated and he could not have mixed themup.  I think the confusion was not due to his inability to understand the questions asked of him or to his difficulties in expressinghimself but because he was making up his evidence. </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  If the Property was purchased by the Defendant in the Fatherâs name because the Defendant was underage, it is surprising thatthe Defendant did not request the Father to transfer the Property back to him soon after he came of age two years later.    Therewas no reason why the Father would have refused as he must realize he was approaching the last of his days then.  It is also incrediblethat neither the Father nor the Defendant had prepared a memorandum or note of some sort as evidence of this fact in view of theold age of the Father.  It is also surprising that the Father would not have informed the other siblings that it was the Defendantâshouse that they were living.  There was no reason for the Father or the Defendant to be secretive about the Defendant having paidthe purchase price for the Property if that was the truth.  The Defendant said his Mother had always told the siblings that he wasthe true owner.  But this evidence was contradicted by Chan Shu Chun whose evidence was that it was through the Motherâs interventionthat the Defendant agreed to assign one-fifth share of the Property to each of the siblings.  I consider Chan Shu Chunâs evidencecloser to the truth than the Defendantâs.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Furthermore, according to the unchallenged evidence of Chan Shee Yuen, the Defendant and his family moved out of the Property in1962 after having bought a flat in To Kwa Wan.  For the thirty years between then and 1992, the Property was occupied by the Motherand other siblings who moved in and out of the Property at will as if it were their parentsâ home.  If indeed the Defendant wasthe true owner of the Property, it is inconceivable that he would have left, if not abandoned, the Property for thirty years withoutfirst asserting his ownership.  There was no dispute that he never claimed to his siblings that he was the owner of the Propertybecause he had provided the purchase money for the Property.  According to Chan Shu Chun, whose evidence I have no reason to doubt,the Defendant only claimed to the siblings that he succeeded to the licence of the Property, which the siblings understood to referto the licence in respect of the house on the Property.  The Defendantâs conduct was inconsistent with his being the owner of theProperty.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The Defendant was evasive when cross-examined about his application for succession in 1960.  In the application, it was representedthat the Defendant was the only son of the Father and that the Property was not subject to any trust or other third party interest. The application was signed by the Defendant.  Yet, he denied having supplied the information which was filled in the applicationform but was unable to explain how it was those information came to be filled in the form.  The information could not have been suppliedby the staff of the District Office.  The irresistible inference must be that the Defendant misrepresented to the District Officerthat he was the only son of the Father when he applied for succession to the Fatherâs Property.  The Defendant might have liedin order to simplify his application to reclaim legal title to his Property.  However, if as what he said his Mother had always toldhis siblings that he had provided the purchase money for the Property, there was no reason to be secretive about it.  He could haveformally applied for succession on the ground that the Property was held by the Father on trust for him and quoting support fromthe Mother and the siblings who at that stage could not have denied his title if what he said was true.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Having considered the totality of the evidence, I do not consider the Defendant credible.  I reject his evidence.  He has failedto discharge the burden of proving that he provided the funds for the purchase of the Property.  That would be sufficient for meto find for the Plaintiff.  But on the evidence, I am quite prepared to go further to find that it was more likely than not thatthe Property was purchased by the Father with his own money.  There was no dispute that the Father was a retiree who had some saving. Accepting Chan Shu Chunâs evidence, it was common knowledge in the family that the Father had kept some money in a safe depositbox with Hong Kong And Shanghai Bank and had bought some shares in Luk Hoi Tung Company Limited after he fled to Hong Kong from Toishan,the Father must have either taken with him some money when he fled from Toishan or had kept some money in his safe deposit box withHong Kong And Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong.  Having rejected the Defendantâs evidence, I find it was more likely than not that theFather moved to Tuen Mun and rented a piece of land to farm with.  It was more likely than not that having acquainted with the indigenousvillagers, the Father purchased the Property with the money he had either brought with him from Toishan or kept in the safe depositbox in Hong Kong And Shanghai Bank. The Defendant took advantage of the opportunity while Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam had migratedand the Mother had been moved to an old age home to exclude the Plaintiff from the Property when he returned to China.  The Defendantâsaccount was fabricated and wholly unrealistic. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Whether the Plaintiff held the interest in the Property as trustee for the Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I have outlined this part of the partiesâ case in paragraphs 36 and 37 above.  According to his witness statement which the Defendantadopted as his evidence in chief, the Defendant said that the Plaintiff, Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam repeatedly requested himto add their names as registered owners of the Property in order to enable them to obtain compensation or resettlement from the Governmentin the event of resumption of the Property by the Government and represented to him that they did not wish to acquire any beneficialinterest in the Property.  The Defendantâs case is contrary to incontrovertible evidence that at the material time, Chan Shu Chunand Chan Shu Nam were already in receipt of Government housing and were not entitled to any compensation or resettlement in the eventof a resumption.  Chan Shu Chun had bought a unit in Lady Grantham Estate in Tai Kok Tsui in early 1980 while Chan Shu Nam was accommodatedin public housing in February 1980.  The Defendant tried to salvage his case by departing from his witness statement while undercross-examination and said that the request and representation were made by the Plaintiff on behalf of himself and the other twosiblings and that Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam had not made the request or representation.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I think the damage to the Defendantâs credibility caused by the allegation in his witness statement is beyond repair.  His witnessstatement was prepared by his solicitor, who presumably must have taken clear and detailed instruction from the Defendant beforereducing his allegation in writing.  The witness statement was written in clear and unequivocal language.  It had been interpretedto the Defendant before he signed his name.  His allegations about his other siblings making the requests and representation wererepeated allegations.  His solicitor could not have mistaken his instruction.  His departure from his witness statement could nothave been due to failure in memory while in the witness box or while giving his statement to his solicitor, but was due to deliberateexaggeration on his part.  It is plainly obvious that when he came to realise that there was incontrovertible evidence that ChanShu Chun and Chan Shu Nam could not have made the representation he alleged, he changed his evidence under cross-examination in orderto salvage his accusation against the Plaintiff.  I think the Defendant was exaggerating.  I do not find him credible and rejecthis evidence.  The Defendant was unable to discharge his burden of proving the representation and the trust.  I am left with whatis on the face a validly executed deed of gift by which one-fifth share of the interest of the Property was assigned to the Plaintiff,Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam.  My finding in respect of this issue also supports my finding in respect of the first issue.</p>    <p class="heading">The remedies</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The Defendant has failed to prove that he provided the purchase money for the Property and indeed I am satisfied that it was morelikely than not that the Property was purchased by the Father with his own money.  The Defendantâs second defence that the Plaintiffheld bare title in the Property in trust for the Defendant also failed.  In the circumstances, the Plaintiff is entitled to remedy. The Plaintiff seeks an order for sale, an order for an account and damages.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  At the hearing, Mr Wong, counsel for the Plaintiff, abandoned the claim for partition and elected to seek an order for sale.  Herelied on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a>(1) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352">Cap 352</a>).  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)   In any proceedings instituted under this Ordinance the Court may, subject to subsection (2), make an order for the partitionof property in land in any of the following ways -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)   into parcels held by single owners in severalty;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(b)   into parcels held by 2 or more owners as joint tenants;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(c)   into parcels held by 2 or more owners as tenants in common,</p>            <p class="quote">â¦</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2) Where there is a building on any land, the Court shall not partition the property in that land so that part only of a buildingstands on any parcel into which the property in the land is partitioned unless that part of the building is self-contained and isnot connected to the remainder of the building otherwise than by a party-wall or a mutual staircase, or both.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mr Wong submitted that by reason of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(2)</a>, the Court shall not order partition because there was a building on the Property which by reason of its size could not be partitionedinto self contained units.  I think that is a misinterpretation of the section.  I think that section only prohibits a Court frompartitioning a property which has the effect of dividing a building on the property so that parts of the building stand on differentparcels so partitioned, unless the parts are self contained and is not connected to the remainder of the building otherwise thanby a party-wall or mutual staircase or both.  The section does not prevent a Court from dividing the property into parcels if itcould be done without dividing the building on the property into parts.  The size of the parcels may have to be adjusted to compensatefor the loss of the value of the building to the parcels without the building.  Such partitioning may be difficult in view of thesize and shape of the property and the need to provide separate or common access.  These are matters which expert opinion may berequired.  But the presence of a building alone does not prevent a Court from ordering partition, if it could be done consistentlywith <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(2).</a></p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  No expert evidence has been adduced to show how the partitioning could be effected if the Court is to make an order for partition. Mr Siu submitted that in the absence of expert opinion it was not open to the Court to consider partition.  He also submitted thatit was not open to the Court to adjourn the hearing for expert opinion on the partitioning as the Plaintiffâs application for separatetrial on liability and damages had been refused by a master.  I think the masterâs refusal does not prevent the Court from adjourningthe case for expert opinion on how the partition could be carried out, if an order for partition is appropriate.  The question forthe Court at this stage of the proceedings is whether such an order should be made.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a> provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1)    In any proceedings under this Ordinance, where it appears to the Court that a partition of the property would not be beneficialto all the persons interested by reason of â</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)   the nature of the land to which the proceedings relate;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(b)   the number of the persons interested or   presumptively interested;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(c)   the absence or disability of some of the persons interested; or</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(d)   any other circumstances,</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">the Court may make an order for the sale of the property.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Where a remedy should be ordered, the Court should first consider partition unless it would not be beneficial to all the persons interestedby reason of one or more of the circumstances stated in sub-section (1).  The Court has to take into account the four circumstancesand strike a balance which is beneficial to all the persons interested in the Property as a whole.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The Property is a plot of agricultural land in the shape of a letter âLâ of a total area of 13,200 square feet.  There is ahouse of 400 square feet with an adjoining kitchen build on one arm of the letter âLâ.  If a partition has to be made, the Propertyhas to be divided into four parcels with three parcels representing one-fifth share in the interest of the Property and one parcelrepresenting two-fifth shares.  The presence of the house, the number of the parcels which the Property has to be divided, the needto provide separate or common access create problems in partitioning. These factors obviously may affect the usefulness and valueof the parcels as partitioned.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  There are four persons interested.  The Plaintiff is desirous of an order for sale.  He has been excluded from the Property whichis now being used exclusively by the Defendant as residence for his family.  The house is only about 400 square feet.  It would beunrealistic to make an injunction order restraining the Defendant from refusing the Plaintiff access and use of the Property so thatboth parties may use the Property without having it partitioned.  Such an order would be impossible of enforcement.  For the Plaintiff,the only remedy other than partition is an order for sale.  An order for sale is obviously beneficial to him.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The Defendant has expressed no view save that the Property is his absolutely.  He could have considered the possible options ifhe was unsuccessful in his defence, but he did not.  He could, for example, have considered a partition into two parcels, one forhimself and one for the other three siblings, or one parcel for the Plaintiff and one parcel for himself and the other two siblings. These options are not beneficial to the other two siblings.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The other two siblings have no objection whether the Property was to be partitioned or sold.  They have migrated out of Hong Kongand have no use of the Property.  If partitioned, the parcel they would be entitled to would be a small plot of farmland, which couldbe of little use for whatever purpose or as rental property in the present circumstances.  To have the Property partitioned intofour parcels would in all probability only result in their parcels lying vacant and unattended and eventually adversely possessedby a squatter.  To them, an order for sale so that they may pocket the proceeds of sale for their own use is obviously to their benefit.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In view of the nature of the Property, its shape, its size and its limited use as farmland, I think even without the assistanceof expert opinion I can come to the conclusion that a partition would not be beneficial to all the persons interested as a whole. In the event, having regard to all the circumstances, I consider an order for sale of the Property appropriate.  Mr Wong has proposedsome directions.  But I consider them inadequate to protect the interest of the Defendant and the other two interested siblings. Accordingly, I shall make an order for sale of the Property and shall adjourn to a date to be fixed for consequential directionswith notice of the hearing to be served on Chan Shu Chun and Chan Shu Nam.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed for an order for an account of and enquiries into the Plaintiffâs share in the rents, profits or other incomearising or derived from the Property since July 1998.  However, it appears that this remedy was not pursued further by Mr Wong inhis closing submission.  The evidence is confusing.  The Defendant admitted that he had rented part of the Property to Yeung MingHin as a parking ground for his coaches and received $7,000 per month between July 1998 and October 2000 but thereafter the tenancyceased upon cessation of the business of Yeung Ming Hin.  The Defendant also claimed that the monthly payment of $7,000 includedhis services as a watchman and cleaner for the coaches. I have doubts in the truthfulness of the Defendantâs assertion as he hasbeen shown to be an exaggerating witness.    On the other hand, the Plaintiff had instituted action in the Small Claims Tribunalunder Claim No SCTC 39787 of 2000.  An adjudicator gave directions on 12 January 2001 for the parties to produce documents within21 days.  However, the action went dormant for unknown reasons.  As the Small Claims Tribunal had been seized of the matter, I declineto make an order for an account and enquiry.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I now turn to the Plaintiffâs claim for damages.  In paragraph 12A of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendant deniedever evicting the Plaintiff from the Property and denied that the Plaintiff suffered loss and damage.  According to Chan Shee Yuenâswitness statement, he left the Property when he returned to China in 1991, but upon his return several months later he was excludedfrom the Property.  Chan Sek Nam said that he found the locks had been changed and that he and his father were denied access to thehouse.  Even in his own evidence, the Defendant admitted that he denied the Plaintiff entry to the house as he considered the househis own property and that it was occupied by his family.  I am satisfied that the Plaintiff had been excluded from the Property since1991.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed for loss and damage suffered since 31 December 1999 when he returned from China and was denied the use ofthe Property.  He had to reside in hotels or in the home of Chan Shu Chun until he eventually rented a room in Sham Shui Po at themonthly rent of $1,000.  The Defendant pleaded that the Plaintiffâs loss and damage were time-barred by virtue of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.  Mr Siu argued that as the Plaintiffâs cause of action accrued in 1991 the Plaintiffâs claim was time-barred in 1998.  He submittedthat the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> did not work on the date on which the writ is issued and did not allow any relief within six years preceding the issue of the writ. With respect, that is manifestly wrong.  It is trite law that where a continuing tort has been committed against a person, a freshcause of action accrues on each renewed tortious act. If a continuing tort has been committed against a person for over six years,that person has lost his right of action for loss and damage which were suffered more than six years prior to the issue of the writ,but he can still recover those loss and damage which he suffered within six years of the issue of the writ.  In the case of land,trespass is a continuing tort and a fresh cause of action accrues on each renewed act of trespass.  Thus, an owner of land who hasbeen dispossessed by a squatter or a tenant in adverse possession for more than twelve years may not bring an action to recover hisland.  However, until his title is so extinguished, not only that he can bring an action to recover his land, he can also sue forloss and damage suffered at any time within six years of the date of issue of the writ.  The Plaintiffâs claim is for loss anddamage suffered since 1 January 2000.   His writ was issued on 9 January 2002.  His claim is well within six years of the date ofissue of the writ and is not time barred by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Chan Sek Lamâs evidence was that since 2001 he lived with Chan Shee Yuen in a room in Sham Shui Po at the monthly rent of $1,000. Chan Shee Yuen paid rent to the landlady until he died in April 2005 and hence he could not produce those rent receipts.  He saidthat since the SARS epidemic in 2003, the rent was reduced by $300 to compensate for Chan Sek Lam performing cleaning duties forthe flat.  Mr Siu criticised the Plaintiffâs failure to produce documentary evidence in support of the rent paid despite requestmade as early as 2003.  I do not think it can be doubted that the Plaintiff had incurred expenses for accommodation since 31 December1999 when Chan Sek Lam came to Hong Kong for permanent residence.  Mr Siu also criticised the amount claimed excessive as what thePlaintiff lost was the use of a room in a village in Tuen Mun and not a room in the urban area in Shum Shui Po where the rent, understandably,is higher.  The Plaintiff has a duty to mitigate his loss.  I would assess his loss at a flat rate of $500 per month since 1 January2000.  Accordingly, I assess the Plaintiffâs damages from 1 January 2000 to 30 April 2005 to be $32,000 (i.e. $500 per month x64 months).</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  I have reserved the costs of the hearing of the preliminary issue.  When the preliminary issue was raised, Mr Wong rightly raisedno objection.  Shortly after Mr Siu began his submission on the preliminary issue, it was immediately apparent that the argumentwas novel and difficult to follow.  Mr Wong asked for an adjournment for parties to exchange skeleton argument and authorities. Mr Siu asked for costs of the adjournment. I reserved those costs.  After determination of the preliminary issue, Mr Siu repeatedhis application for costs of the adjournment and despite the Defendant was unsuccessful he argued that there should be no order asto costs of the hearing of the preliminary issue against the Defendant.  </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The Defendantâs solicitor had never indicated to the Plaintiff that the Defendant would seek determination of a preliminary issueon the first day of trial and the nature of that issue.  Mr Siuâs argument was so novel which I do not think would have been takenby any reasonable counsel nor could have been anticipated by his opponent.  As Mr Siu suggested that my ruling on the preliminaryissue might result in dismissal of the Plaintiffâs action, there was all the more reason for the Defendant to be cautious.  Inthe circumstances, it was reasonable for Mr Wong to request that he be supplied with skeleton argument and list of authority. Hadthe matter proceeded straight to trial instead, Mr Wong could have had some clue of the issue and the nature of Defendantâs argumentby the close of the defence case and could promptly respond in his final submission.  The adjournment would not have been unnecessary. The Plaintiffâs position was different when the preliminary issue was argued at the beginning and in the way Mr Siu argued it. I therefore think the costs of the adjournment should also follow the event.  Having considered all the arguments raised at thepreliminary issue and having heard all the evidence at the conclusion of this trial, I consider there was no reason to depart fromthe usual rule that costs should follow the event.  Accordingly, I make an order that the Plaintiff shall have the costs of the hearingof the preliminary issue, including the cost of the adjournment when the issue was first raised.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The Defendant applied for an adjournment pending appeal to the Court of Appeal.  I have dismissed that application with costs tothe Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In an uncontested action for partition or sale of property under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a>, it is usual to make no order as to costs or for costs to be paid out of the proceeds of sales.   In the present case, the Defendantcontested the action.  He raised no reasonable defence. In the circumstances, the Plaintiff is entitled to have his costs againstthe Defendant.  I therefore make an order that the Plaintiff shall have all costs of the action which have not been otherwise providedfor.  All costs are to be taxed, if not agreed.  As the Plaintiff is legally aided, the Plaintiffâs costs shall be taxed in accordancewith the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Accordingly, I grant an order for sale of the Property and award the Plaintiff damages in the sum of $32,000.  I shall invite theparties to seek directions in connection with the sale of the Property.  Having granted the order for sale, it is unnecessary andinappropriate to grant the declaration and injunction sought by the Plaintiff.  The Defendantâs counterclaim is dismissed.   TheDefendant shall pay the Plaintiffâs costs of this action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="12">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="12">(Anthony To)<br />            Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Kenneth Y.
