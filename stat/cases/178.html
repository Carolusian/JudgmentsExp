At the moment of impactthe plaintiff, Mr. Wong, was underneath or near the tailgate arranging the goods in the van. He heard a loud bang; jumped back andwas then covered with small pieces of glass which, I find, must have come from the shattered pane of glass in the window frame and/orthe fragments of the shattered window of the tailgate of the van.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> Fortunately, Mr. Wong suffered very slight physical injuries as a result of the impact and its immediate consequences or aftermath.He was found to have multiple abrasion wounds over his right index finger, third right toe, and anterior chest wall. But these injuriesdid not prevent him from taking immediate steps, with help from others, to locate the person supposedly responsible for the fallof the window frame, and having done so, to negotiate for compensation for the damage caused to the van, which belonged to his employer.It is not disputed that the window frame fell from flat B ("the flat") on the 33rd floor of Richland Gardens. These premises areowned and occupied by the defendants Mr. To Chark Wah and Madam Sin Kam Ling, who are husband and wife. Madam Sin refused Mr. Wong'srequest for $2,500 compensation to cover the cost of repair to the van. If she had agreed to meet that request it is very probablethat the present action would never have been commenced or resulted in a trial. However, because of subsequent developments the defendantsnow face a claim by Mr. Wong for damages for negligence and breach of statutory duty arising out of this incident.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> These proceedings were commenced by a writ issued on the 25th July 1991. Nine months previously, Mr. Wong had filed a claim in theSmall Claims Tribunal seeking to recover $9,100 from Madam Sin for medical expenses and loss of earnings resulting from the incident.Although there is very little evidence before the court, it seems to be common ground that the claim before the Small Claims Tribunalwas not pursued. The defendants have not sought to have the present proceedings stayed. Nor do they rely on any form of estoppelor similar defence. On their behalf, Mr. Sham has merely sought to make use of this conduct of Mr. Wong in order to support his submissionsthat Mr. Wong's present application is not made in good faith. At best, it is suggested that Mr. Wong's claim is inflated or exaggerated;at worst it is fraudulent because Mr. Wong's later complaint of a psychiatric illness lasting until September 1991 is not genuine,or is not attributable to the incident.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> I recognise that there is some merit in Mr. Sham's submissions on the quality of the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff.There are apparent inconsistencies in his evidence and previous conduct. There are gaps in the evidence, which would normally befilled without much difficulty. For example, Mr. Wong's employer has not given evidence, in court or by other means, of Mr. Wong'sactual earnings during the material period or periods. Sick leave certificates have not been produced. Receipts for medical expenseshave not been produced. These features are clearly relevant to the question whether the alleged loss has been satisfactorily proved.They are also relevant matters to be taken into consideration on the issue of liability. I have considered all these apparent weaknessesof the case. But, I have also reminded myself that my decision must be based on the totality of the evidence placed before me. Imust and do exclude speculation on matters or questions which the admissible evidence might excite but cannot lead to findings offact based on reasonable inferences from proved facts. At the same time, unlike Mr. Wong, neither of the defendants has given evidencebefore me. Apart from the evidence of two psychiatrists (Drs Lo and Lau), I have a bundle of documents consisting of 43 pages. (Byagreement, two pages (42-43) were added to the two bundles prepared by the parties before the trial to form one agreed bundle.)</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> I have not overlooked the apparent discrepancies between the actual evidence of the plaintiff and the pleadings filed on his behalf.The latter had to be amended to correct mistakes which were, in my view, clearly due to oversight or carelessness on the part ofhis lawyers. In this respect, the defendants' lawyers cannot avoid some degree of criticism for the manner in which the defence hasbeen pleaded or argued. On several occasions Mr. Sham had to be checked in the course of his final submissions against attemptingto make points which departed from the defendant's pleaded case, or the actual evidence. At times I gained the impression that hefelt extremely embarrassed by the pleaded case. He tried to avoid the clear implications of the admission that Madam Sin's convictionfor an offence against <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228" class="autolink_findacts">Summary Offences Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228">Cap.228</a>) was relevant to the alleged negligence and/or breach of statutory duty, by seeking to argue that the conviction was irrelevantor erroneous. He persisted in that submission by seeking to rely on the case of <u>Hollington v. Hewthorn &amp; Co. Ltd</u> [1943] KB587, although its authority had clearly been removed by subsequent legislation; and despite the fact that the defendantshad not complied with the requirements of Order 18 rule 7A of the Rules of the Supreme Court.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I have considered all these and other aspects of these proceedings, which have caused some degree of disquiet on my part. But, atthe end of the day, my unease rests solely upon the assessment of the quantum of Mr. Wong's alleged loss. I am satisfied on the balanceof probabilities that he did suffer a genuine psychiatric illness which lasted until the end of September 1991. I am also satisfiedthat he has rebutted the suggestion of malingering. On the contrary, I find that throughout this illness he was very motivated toget well. So far as the medical evidence goes there is very little disagreement between the two doctors, i.e. Dr. Lo and Dr. Lau.But, in general, I prefer the evidence of Dr. Lo because he saw the plaintiff approximately every week over a 10 months' period;whereas Dr. Lau only saw him twice in May 1993, some 18 months after he had been cured of that illness.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Before I turn to the question of liability it is necessary to indicate some further findings of fact. The defendants bought the flatin June 1985 and have lived there since that time. The incident occurred at or about 1.30 p.m. Later that afternoon, after an investigationby police, Madam Sin was arrested and taken to the police station. She was later charged with the offence of allowing the windowframe to fall from her flat, contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228" class="autolink_findacts">Summary Offences Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228">Cap.228</a>). On the 24th August 1990 she was convicted of that offence, after admitting the same; and fined $500.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Although the particulars of breach of statutory duty do not specify the relevant statutory provision, it is tolerably clear, fromthe pleading of Madam Sin's conviction, that the plaintiff relies on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228" class="autolink_findacts">Summary Offences Ordinance</a>. Mr. Sham's arguments on this statutory provision and the conviction were really aimed at persuading the court to dismiss the convictionas evidence of little or no weight as proof of the alleged negligence of the defendants. He did not really address any argument tothe question whether <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228">Cap.228</a> gives rise to a civil cause of action in favour of persons injured by objects dropped from buildings. Nevertheless, Iconceive that I must be satisfied that it does give rise to a civil remedy, because I do not think that the failure to argue thepoint can be treated as a concession on the part of the defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> I have not been referred to any of the more recent authorities on breach of statutory duty as a separate cause of action. Mr. Toreminded me of some of the general principles and contended that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228">Cap.228</a> was intended to afford protection for a special or particular class of individuals, to which the plaintiff belonged; andwas not imposed to benefit the public at large. But he did not cite any authorities to support or illustrate his submissions. The<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228" class="autolink_findacts">Summary Offences Ordinance</a> consists of several provisions dealing with disparate activities which can be loosely regarded as public nuisances. They are notreally designed to protect or give redress to victims of private nuisances, although the fact that the express sanctions enable suchvictims to invoke police action means that they can achieve in practice an abatement of the nuisance without resort to civil proceedings.In my view, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B(1)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228">Cap.228</a> does not give rise to a civil cause of action against any person offending against its provisions. The section does notimpose any duty on the owner or occupier of a building. It imposes a <u>criminal</u> liability on <u>any person</u> who <u>drops</u> or <u>allows</u> <u>something</u> to fall from a building. The culpable person could be the owner or occupier; an independent contractor employed by the owner or themanager of the building; a guest of the occupier of part of the building; or even a burglar who drops his jemmy. If the culprit canbe identified the victim has ample and adequate civil remedies without resort to breach of statutory duty. If the culprit cannotbe identified, the statute does not impose any duty on any other person, unless the building is under construction, repair or decoration.In the present case, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants were negligent if he is to succeed.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Originally, the only particulars of negligence alleged in the statement of claim were :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"failing to check and/or otherwise to maintain the said window frame to prevent its falling;"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At the trial, I allowed the plaintiff to amend his pleadings to rely on the doctrine of <u>res ipsa loquitur.</u> It is strictly not necessary to specifically plead the doctrine, but it is usual and, in my view, good practice to do so. Contraryto Mr. Sham's submission, the doctrine does not shift the burden of proof to the defendant. Cf. <u>Ng Chun Pui v. Lee Chuen Tat</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 425.</a> But, in my view, it should be pleaded so that the defendant is put on notice that the court may expect some explanation from thedefendant or other evidence explaining the cause of the occurrence.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> On this aspect of the case, Mr. Sham relied heavily on a passage in <u>Goldman v. Hargrave</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20AC%20645" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] AC 645</a> at 663. In addition, he sought to impugn Madam Sin's conviction by contending that it should be given no weight because of the circumstancesin which it was reached; and, further contended that it was not even proof of negligence because the offence was one of strict liability.With respect to counsel, I do not think that the cited authority is apposite to the circumstances of the case before me. It was concernedwith the hazard of fire thrust upon the occupier of land through no seeking or fault of his own, and whether he had adopted reasonablemeasures to deal with the hazard. In the present case, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the window frame was dislodgedby some freak occurrence. Although it happened in August, there is no evidence that it might have been due to typhoon conditions.Mr. Sham sought to suggest that it may have been due to faulty workmanship by those employed by the developer, which the defendantscould not reasonably expect or foresee. I reject that explanation as being highly improbable. If it was badly fitted, it is moreprobable that it would have become dislodged at some earlier time, instead of 5 years after the defendants took possession of theflat.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> As Madam Sin's conviction and its relevance to the alleged negligence was expressly admitted in paragraph 4 of the Defence, I donot think that I can accede to Mr. Sham's contentions that no weight should be given thereto because Madam Sin was not legally representedand the facts were not fully investigated. She has not given evidence. From the notes of the hearing of her case (p.18AB) I do notthink that there was sufficient ambiguity in her answers to the charge to justify a finding that her guilty plea should not havebeen accepted. No steps have been taken to appeal against the conviction. Accordingly, I consider that I must regard the convictionas imposing on Madam Sin a burden of rebutting what is presumed against her by the conviction. Cf. <u>Wauchope v Mordecai</u> [1970] 1WLR 317; <u>Stupple v Royal Insurance Co. Ltd</u> [1971] 1QB50. Furthermore, I consider that the 'presumption' or inference to be derived from the conviction is that Madam Sin <u>allowed</u> the window frame to fall from the building. Mr. Sham argued that the conviction was not evidence of negligence because the offencecreated by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B(1)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228">Cap.228</a> is one of strict liability. In my view, allowing something to fall from a building necessarily implies some element ofknowledge of, or advertence to, the probability of that event happening. I do not think that the offence created by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B(1)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228">Cap.228</a> is one of strict liability. It implies knowledge of the hazard, i.e. the risk of something falling, and some deliberateact which causes that occurrence or some conscious failure to prevent the occurrence. In my view, the offence cannot be committedwithout proof of some degree of negligence. It does not follow that subsection (1) implies strict liability because it is not subjectto the "due diligence" defence contained in subsection (3). The latter was no doubt enacted to alleviate any harshness in the effectof subsection (2), which makes contractors constructing, repairing or decorating a building <u>vicariously</u> liable for any offence against <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s4b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4B(1)</a>, committed by another person who may not be an employee.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Although neither defendant gave evidence, Mr. Sham submitted that there was sufficient explanation or other evidence in the agreedbundle to prevent the operation of the doctrine of <u>res ipsa loquitur</u> or a finding of negligence against them. According to Mak Wun Man, a police constable called to the scene after the incident, MadamSin heard a bang and discovered that one of the aluminium windows in a room of her flat was missing. After being cautioned she toldthe police constable :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have lived at the Richland Gardens for 5 years, I often check the door and windows to see if they are all right. As to the fallingdown of the window to the street, I do not know such accident would happen." (See pp 9-10 AB).</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This statement is inconsistent with her admission to the learned magistrate a few days later that she did "neglect matters in thiscase" (p.15 AB) but, perhaps, consistent with her denials of actual knowledge of unspecified facts or matters. These vague and slenderindications, gleaned from the agreed bundle of documents, are not, in my view, sufficient to rebut the presumption or inference whicharises from the conviction. In the absence of any oral testimony by Madam Sin, it is not possible to reconcile her various claimsor statements in a way which would exonerate her from negligence. In all the circumstances, I consider that the plaintiff has dischargedthe burden or proving negligence by the combined effect of the conviction and the application of the doctrine of <u>res ipsa loquitur.</u> I appreciate that the evidence before me does not directly implicate Mr. To. But, as the co-owner of the flat, the husband of MadamSin, and a decoration worker by occupation, I think that I am entitled to infer (as I do) that he shared his wife's apparent knowledgeof the state or condition of the window frame at the material time. On the totality of the evidence I find that the defendants werenegligent. They failed to take any or any reasonable steps to maintain the window frame, which they knew or ought to have known wasliable to fall from their flat.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I now turn to the more complicated issue of whether the plaintiff can recover damages for what I have found to be a genuine psychiatricillness. Mr. Sham contended that such illness was not compensatible because it fell outside the scope of the defendants' duty ofcare. It was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of their negligent act or omission. Furthermore, the type of illness was notthe kind of loss which could be brought within the "nervous shock" cases. Mr. Sham relied almost exclusively on a dictum of NolanLJ which appears at the end of his judgment in <u>Jones v Wright</u> [1991] 3 All ER88 at 123, to the effect that the law does not recognise psychiatric illness "brought about by an accumulation ofmore gradual assaults upon the nervous system." Quite apart from the fact that the present case is far removed from the authoritycited on the facts, I respectfully suggest that the dictum has been overworked or misunderstood by Mr. Sham in his final submission.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> In the present case, I am satisfied that the plaintiff suffered from anxiety disorder in which phobia symptoms were prominent; andthis was caused by what Dr Lo described as the "frightening experience" of the incident. The illness and the symptoms did not develop<u>gradually</u>, as Mr. Sham suggested in his first question in cross-examination of Dr. Lo. They manifested themselves within 2 or 3 days of theincident and were very acute. It must also be remembered that the plaintiff suffered some physical injuries as an immediate consequenceof the incident. He suffered multiple abrasions from the shards of glass. Fortunately, he was saved from more serious injuries bythe roof or tailgate of the van. But, his proximity to potentially fatal or serious injury from this terrifying incident would beclearly foreseeable as "a reaction to an immediate and horrifying impact." That form of "nervous shock" is, in my view, recognisedby the law as compensatible, provided the other conditions for liability are satisfied. In my respectful view, this was recognisedby Nolan LJ in the first sentence of the last paragraph of his judgment in <u>Jones v Wright,</u> supra. He was not endeavouring to limit the categories of nervous shock or psychiatric illnesses for which compensation could neverbe awarded. He was merely explaining why one particular plaintiff (Mr. Capoc), in his judgment, fell "beyond the margin of what,as a matter of law, was reasonably foreseeable." In my view, the learned Lord Justice was not saying that persons suffering from"anxiety disorder" could <u>never</u> recover damages if that condition was caused by a clear breach of a duty of care. The fact that he recited passages from the expertevidence (at 117-118) is some indication that he recognised that anxiety disorder could be made the basis of a valid claim.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The case of <u>Jones v Wright</u> concerned plaintiffs who had suffered psychiatric illness from nervous shock as a result of seeing or hearing news of the disasterat Hillsborough football stadium in 1989, in which their relatives or friends were killed or injured as a result of police negligencein controlling crowds at the match. They were not directly injured by the negligence of the police, because most of them witnessedthe disaster through the medium of live television transmission and subsequent news reports. The four who attended the match didnot suffer nervous shock through any fear for their own safety. In my view, the case has no bearing on the present case, where theplaintiff suffered immediate physical injury, albeit of a trivial nature, and shock which manifested itself a few days later in theform of phobic symptoms of acute anxiety disorder. In <u>Jones v Wright</u> the essential and principal question was whether any of the <u>witnesses</u> of the disaster or its aftermath could bring themselves within the range of foreseeability apparently set by the House of Lords in<u>McLoughlin v O'Brian</u> [1983] 1AC 410.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In the present case, I consider that the defendants must have foreseen that someone might be injured by the fall of the window framefrom their flat on the 33rd floor. They must be taken to have foreseen that their negligence in allowing it to fall from that heightmight result in the infliction of serious or fatal injuries to persons such as the plaintiff. Even though the fall of the window-framecaused no direct or serious injury to any person they must, in my view, be regarded as foreseeing that it would at least frightenor cause shock to persons in the vicinity, even if they were not hit or injured by the falling object. In all the circumstances,I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established a claim to be compensated for the psychiatric illness he suffered as a direct resultof this incident.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> As indicated earlier, quantification of Mr. Wong's actual pecuniary loss is not easy because of the paucity of evidence of the usualkind. It is not even easy to determine his medical expenses. Although the doctor who treated him for some 9 or 10 months in 1991was called, he was unable to testify as to the amount Mr. Wong had paid for his treatment. He hazarded a guess that there were 25consultations at $300, and a final consultation for which he charged $1,600; and the total amount was in the region of $9,000 to$10,000. In general, Dr. Lo testified that Mr. Wong was in his care for about nine months; and consultations took place approximatelyevery week. Mr. Wong testified that his medical expenses amounted to about $12,000. He consulted Dr. Wong Ling Ling on 2 or 3 occasionsbetween October and December 1990 at $100 per session; and saw Dr Lo between 30 and 40 times at $300 per session. Regarding the numberof consultations, I think that Mr. Wong's evidence is the more realistic. Weekly consultations over some 9 months would give a figureslightly in excess of $10,000. Dr Lo's final consultation cost $1,600 and the earlier consultations with Dr. Wong would have cost$200 to $300. In all the circumstances, I assess Mr. Wong's loss in the form of medical expenses at $12,000.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> On behalf of the plaintiff, Mr. To invited me to award a sum of approximately $35,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities.This amount was arrived at by adopting the $20,000 awarded in <u>Kung Kit Shing v. Star Synthetic Flower Factory</u> (HCA No.8967 of 1981; 24 March 1987)(1987) HKCL 57 and adjusting it to reflect the impact of inflation since 1987. Apart from thefact that Mr. To merely cited a digest of that judgment, there is before me very little evidence to justify an award under this headof damage. Nothing is expressly pleaded; it is left to be inferred from the pleading and evidence as a whole. Mr. Wong's injuriesfrom broken glass were fortunately not serious. Indeed, he was initially prepared to waive compensation for them if Madam Sin hadagreed to pay compensation for the damage to his employer's van. Nevertheless, I think that he is entitled to an award to compensatehim for the suffering which began shortly after the accident and must have continued for the next year, albeit to a diminishing extentas his treatment gradually restored him to his pre-accident condition. He suffered from loss of sleep and violent dreams three orfour times a week until he sought medical treatment. He was obliged to give up driving until his disorder was brought under control.But this deprivation can only be measured by reference to his loss of earnings, as there is really no evidence to show that he normallyderived some pleasure or recreation from driving. For the 3 or 4 months before he was referred to Dr Lo I would award $10,000 forpain and suffering and loss of amenities.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Damages for actual loss of earnings are also difficult to quantify for reasons already given. Mr. Wong's evidence was rather vagueand difficult to understand. I find that his average monthly earnings at the time of the incident were $8,500. They included overtimepay on top of a basic wage of $6,000. Immediately after the accident he was given sick leave, although its duration is not clear.According to Mr. Wong he received no wages or periodical payments of employee's compensation until his employer later agreed to payhim his normal wages. It is not clear whether he received his usual wages (including overtime) or his basic wages. But, on the evidencebefore me I do not think that Mr. Wong has proved a real loss until he was advised by Dr. Lo to cease driving motor vehicles, ator about the end of 1990, because his acute anxiety disorder was causing him to lose concentration and was aggravated by his phobiasymptoms. I find that this began in January 1991, when he was given light work as a messenger for which he was paid $1,500 per month.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Mr. Sham suggested that the plaintiff could have found more remunerative employment during the ensuing 9 months when he was undergoingtreatment from Dr. Lo. That may be the case; although the evidence does not stretch to suggesting the nature or expected rewardsfrom any alternative employment. But, in the present case, I do not consider that Mr. Wong's acceptance of reduced wages for differentemployment by his employer was a failure to mitigate his loss. It would seem that his employer had adopted a very sympathetic andgenerous attitude at all times. Mr. Wong was keen to get cured of his disorder; and believed that it would take less time than itdid. He did not wish to take on commitments to other employers in case they prevented him from returning to his job as a driver foran employer, who had shown him understanding and some generosity in allowing him to work flexible hours. It may be the case thathis employer's sympathetic attitude contributed to Mr. Wong's eventual recovery. Dr. Lau considered that "the symptomatology wasunusually protracted in duration", whereas Dr. Lo considered that it was not uncommon. I have already indicated that I am satisfiedthat Mr. Wong has rebutted any suspicion of malingering. On the duration of his illness I have no hesitation in accepting Dr Lo'sopinion. He described Mr. Wong's disorder as very acute. He saw him weekly for the next 9 months. Dr. Lau only saw Mr. Wong 18 monthsafter his recovery.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I do not know when Mr. Wong resumed work as a driver. I do not even know whether he was paid more than the $8,500 he had receivedat the time of the accident, some 12 or 13 months earlier. I must assume that there was no change in his average earnings. I findthat his illness prevented him earning $8,500 per month as a driver for the 9 months from the beginning of January to the end ofSeptember 1991. During that period he received a substitute wage of $1,500 per month. Accordingly, I assess his loss under this headingat $63,000. For these reasons, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the sum of $85,000 against both defendants. I will hear furthersubmissions on the rate and duration of interest prior to judgment.</p>    <p> </p>    <div style="text-align:center">        <center>            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="50%"></td>                    <td style="text-align:center" width="50%">(B.W.M.
