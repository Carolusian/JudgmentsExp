I accepted the evidence given by Miss Wong that what the defendant saidwas that there should be no problem with the sale of 30,000 movements a month.  It is quite true that when pressed in cross-examination,she went further than that and said the defendant guaranteed sale of that number. I do not accept it was a guarantee and am satisfiedthat it was an estimate and no more. It was not intended to form any part of the contract and this is confirmed by the fact thatthere is no mention whatever in it in the subsequent written contract of employment which I find was prepared by the plaintiff. Iam satisfied that the defendant was asked about potential sales and gave his opinion that the plaintiff would be able to sell 30,000movements a month. I am also satisfied that he showed the plaintiff lists of potential customers. I am, however, also satisfied thatwhile his opinion on that aspect was important he was being employed because of his knowledge of production and the statement oflikely sales was not intended to be a warranty made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to employ him.</p>                <p align="left" class="quote"> </p>                <p align="left" class="quote">            I am satisfied that there is no representation made by the defendant upon which the plaintiff can rely as a collateralwarranty and the claim is dismissed."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> With the utmost respect to the learned judge in my judgment, after making this finding he should have gone on to consider whetherMr. Kwan had been guilty of any misrepresentations that were actionable despite his decision that what Mr. Kwan said was not intendedto be a contractual term. The distinction between a warranty and a misrepresentation, stressed in the older cases, and the legalconsequences that flow from that distinction, have diminished since the enactment of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/284" class="autolink_findacts">Misrepresentation Ordinance</a>, but the difference has still some relevance.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The point I venture to make is illustrated by <u>Esso Petroleum Co.</u> v. <u>Mardon</u><sup>(1)</sup>. There the trial judge had rejected Mr. Mardon's primary submission that he was entitle to damages for breach of warranty but hadheld that Esso were liable for damages in tort for negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge's decision was upheld by the Courtof Appeal, but both Ormrod L.J. and Shaw L. J. were inclined to the view that Mr. Mardon had also established breach of warranty.I will quote brief passages from their judgments which are, to my mind, relevant to the present case.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="16%"></td>            <td width="84%">                <p align="left">Ormrod L.

That representation - to the effect that there would be no problem with the sale of 30,000 movementsa month - was, in the opinion of the judge, clearly not intended to be a warranty, so that, even on Lord Denning's approach, theinference of a warranty was found to have been rebutted. I am disposed to agree with the submission of Mr. Chong that the representationmust have been intended to induce the contract and I think it is apparent that the judge so believed, for he said:</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="14%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>            </td>            <td width="86%" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">I am, however, also satisfied that while his opinion on that aspect was important he was being employed because of his knowledge ofproduction and the statement of likely sales was not intended to be a warranty made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff toemploy him."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left">The second sentence appears to confuse two separate issues, but the passage as a whole suggests that the representation was one ofthe factors inducing the contract, although not the only factor or even the major factor. Nevertheless the judge had clearly foundthat the representation was not intended to be a warranty, and that in my view was a conclusion he was entitled to reach and onewhich was fatal to the Appellant's claim in contract. The representation was as to the Defendant's opinion on the likelihood of futuresales and it is almost inconceivable that the Defendant would have been willing to guarantee a business result which was inevitablydependent upon future trading conditions unforeseeable by either party.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> My only anxiety is whether Penlington, J. 's failure expressly to deal with the claim in tort is necessarily fatal to his decision.When he said that he "accepted the evidence given by Miss Wong that <u>what</u> the Defendant said was that there should be no problem with the sale of 30,000 movements a month" (emphasis supplied), it seemedto me to be implicit that he was satisfied that that was all the Defendant had said and that the judge therefore rejected anythingalleged by the Plaintiff to the contrary. In particular he appeared to have found that the Defendant had not represented that "hehad business connections to secure the sale by the Plaintiff of not less than 30,000 analog watches per month should the Plaintiffemploy the Defendant as its manager in charge of the Plaintiff's quartz watch department", as alleged in para. 2 of the Statementof Claim, or that he would "bring whole business", as the Plaintiff is recorded as saying in his evidence. If the judge had foundthat the latter representation had been made, it is inconceivable that he would not have said so.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Even if one were to treat the representation found to have been made as equivalent to the representation pleaded, the position wouldthen be that the Defendant, having been disbelieved when he denied showing the Plaintiff lists of suppliers and other documents,might well have been disbelieved if he had said that he honestly and reasonably held the opinion he was found to have expressed.However, the disbelief of that evidence could not have amounted to proof to the contrary. In an action in tort for misrepresentationthe burden is on the plaintiff to establish not only the representation of a past or present fact but also the untruth of that representation.Where the representation is as to an opinion held by the defendant, it seems to me that the plaintiff must prove either that thedefendant did not hold that opinion or that he was negligent in expressing it, i.e. that he failed to use reasonable care to seethat it was reliable. All that has been shown here is that the opinion proved to be wrong. It does not necessarily follow that theDefendant had been fraudulent or negligent: there could have been many causes of the Plaintiff's poor sales. In the circumstancesI think it would not have been open to the judge on the evidence before him to conclude that a false representation had been made,and the claim in tort inevitably failed. It seems to me that to order a retrial would give the Plaintiff an opportunity to call evidencewhich (if it be available) ought to have been called at the trial, and I do not think that should be allowed.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I would dismiss the appeal.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><strong>Macdougall, J.:</strong></p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I find myself unsure as to the precise extent of the learned trial judge's findings.

I am also satisfied that he showed the plaintiff lists of potential customers. I am, however, also satisfiedthat while his opinion on that aspect was important he was being employed because of his knowledge of production and the statementof likely sales was not intended to be a warranty made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to employ him."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The judge was there plainly considering whether the defendant had warranted that the plaintiff would sell 30,000 movements a month.He was not considering, nor did he specifically consider elsewhere in his judgment, whether the defendant had, as pleaded, representedto the plaintiff that "he had business connections to secure the sale by the plaintiff of not less than 30,000 analog watches permonth should the plaintiff employ the defendant as its manager in charge of the plaintiff's quartz watch department" and, if so,whether it was an actionable misrepresentation founded in tort.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Although it is true that the judge accepted Miss Wong's testimony ''that <u>what</u> the defendant said was that there should be no problem with the sale of 30,000 movements month" (emphasis supplied) and found thatthis was an estimate and no more", I am unable to bring myself to assume that the judge was there doing any more than merely focuson whether what the defendant had said in this connexion amounted to a guarantee or was no more than an estimate. In the contextin which this passage appears in the judgment I do not think that it would be legitimate to read anything further into the word "<u>what</u>".</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> Moreover, apart from failing to consider what the defendant had said in anything other than the context of a contractual claim, thejudge gave no specific indication as to what part, if any, of the plaintiff's evidence he did not accept. It is clear, however, thathe must have accepted at least part of it, particularly since he rejected the defendant's testimony that he had not shown the plaintifflists of customers kept by his previous firm.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> In my view it is not safe to conclude with any degree of confidence what the judge would have found had he directed his mind to theclaim founded in tort and had made clear and positive findings on all material parts of the plaintiff's evidence. Indeed, the plaintiff'stestimony that he had been shown lists of customers by the defendant is particularly germane to the issue of whether the defendanthad made a deliberate or negligent misrepresentation that he had business connections to secure the sale by the plaintiff of notless than 30,000 analog whatches a month.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Since the defendant's denial that he had shown these lists to the plaintiff was not accepted by the judge. It is possible that, hadhe considered the matter, he might have found that the defendant had made such a misrepresentation and that the plaintiff shouldsucceed in tort. I, therefore, agree with Fuad J. A. that the appeal must succeed and that there should be a re-trial of the wholeaction including the counterclaim.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Mr. K.M.
