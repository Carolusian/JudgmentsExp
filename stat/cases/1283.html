The 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs are the Deceasedâs sons and respectively 30, 19 and 18 years old at the time of his death. The 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff is the Deceasedâs daughter and 14 years old at the time of his death. In a few monthsâ time, the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff will attain the age of majority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Madam CCKW is the widow of the Deceased and stepmother to the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs (â<u>Stepmother</u>â). The natural mother of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs, Madam WMY (â<u>M</u><u>other</u>â), passed away in April 2003. The Mother and Stepmother have 9 and 3 children respectively out of union with the Deceased.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff, who is presently still a minor, acts by her sister and next friend Madam CMS (â<u>Sister</u>â). The Sister claims she was appointed by the Court of First Instance in guardianship proceedings (â<u>Guardianship Action</u>â) as the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffâs guardian under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/13/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/13" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Minors Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/13">Cap.13</a> pending a substantive hearing. The Stepmother claims the Sister was only appointed as guardian <i>pro tempore</i>. The distinction, if any, has no bearing on the issues before me. In any event, I am informed by Mr Cheung and Mr Li, counsel forthe 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs and for the Defendant respectively, the Guardianship Action has been essentially resolved save for the question of costsin view of the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffâs imminent majority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>II. Legal proceedings</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Under the Deceasedâs alleged last will said to have been made in 2003, the Stepmother was appointed as sole executrix and beneficiaryof the Deceasedâs estate.

In June2006, the Stepmother was appointed administrator pending suit pending determination of the Probate Action. According to the Stepmotherâsaffirmation in the present proceedings, the Probate Action is ready to be set down for trial. Mr Li submits she is anxious to proceed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs commenced the present proceedings in January 2007 under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/481" class="autolink_findacts">Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/481">Cap.481</a> (â<u>IO</u>â).

After all, it is not their case that there is no reasonable financial provisionfor them in the last will of the Deceased, but rather they are entitled to shares in the Deceasedâs estate either pursuant to thetrue last will of the Deceased made in 1997 or alternatively under his intestacy.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant argues that the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs have failed to show an immediate need for interim financial provision under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/481/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of IO.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The Defendant questions whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff has the requisite mental capacity to maintain his claim herein, and therefore doubts the authority of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs solicitors to act for him.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 31<sup>st</sup> July 2007, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appointment to Hear Originating Summons returnable on 21<sup>st</sup> August 2007 seeking <i>inter alia</i> the following reliefs :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the Defendant do pay each of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs interim maintenance out of the Deceasedâs net estate at the rate of HK$14,2000.00 <i>per</i> month until further order of the court;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the Defendant do pay the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff interim maintenance out of the Deceasedâs net estate at the rate of HK$8,000.00 <i>per</i> month until further order of the court.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  According to the supporting affirmations filed by the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs and by the Sister on behalf of the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs are prepared to accept on a further or alternative basis free occupation of any landed property of the Deceasedâs estatein lieu of financial provision for their accommodation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>III. The issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  At the hearing on 21<sup>st</sup> August 2007, I raised with the parties the question whether this court has jurisdiction to deal with reliefs sought by the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs in the present proceedings, so I adjourned the hearing <i>inter alia</i> for argument on such issue and on whether the present proceedings should be transferred to the Court of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr Cheung argues that the present proceedings should be transferred to the Court of First Instance under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/481/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25(2)</a> of IO and/or section 41(1) of the District Court Ordinance (â<u>DCO</u>â) because the value of the Deceasedâs estate is greater than the applicable jurisdictional limits. Further, the court shouldalso exercise its discretion under section 25(2) of IO and/or section 42 of DCO to transfer the present proceedings to the Courtof First Instance because the claims herein may involve probate matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In the Stepmotherâs affirmation in opposition, it is said that the right venue to hear and adjudicate the claim for financialprovision is the District Court and there is no sound reason to transfer the present proceedings to the Court of First Instance.Mr Li submits that the Defendant adopted such stance at that time because the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffsâ claim for maintenance in the Probate Action was still extant and the proposal by 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs to transfer the present proceedings to the Court of First Instance was perceived as a patent attempt to cover up the mistakeof commencing the claim for financial provision under IO in the Court of First Instance. But this has been resolved when the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs dropped their claim for maintenance in the Probate Action. Mr Li further submits that the Defendant adopted the aforesaidstance also on the assumption that the claim for financial provision herein will not exceed HK$1 million.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  But having re-considered the position, Mr Li submits that because there is no relevant jurisdiction-conferring provision in eitherIO or DCO, he is driven to the conclusion that the District Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with applications under IO (includingthe present claims by the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs under section 4 and/or section 7 of IO) irrespective whether the claims exceed HK$1 million or not. In the circumstances,the present proceedings are outside the jurisdiction of the District Court and should be transferred to the Court of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The effect of Mr Liâs submissions is that whilst all proceedings under IO must be commenced in the District Court as requiredby section 25(1) of IO, the District Court will have no jurisdiction to deal with any further steps in the proceedings and must transfer<i>all</i> IO cases to the Court of First Instance even if the value of the estate and/or the amount of the claim is small. One is thereforeleft to wonder why the draftsman or legislature would countenance the absurd and unnecessary requirement of having all IO claimsissued out of the District Court when all other steps are to be dealt with by the Court of First Instance. But it is Mr Liâs contentionthat I am bound to give effect to the legislative language even if the consequences are such that they would not have been contemplated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It appears therefore that both counsel are of the view that the District Court has no jurisdiction in the present proceedings althoughthey rely on different grounds. In light of the wider impact of their contentions on the jurisdiction of the District Court in relationto claims under IO, I heard submissions on the subject. Further, given the significance it may have in relation to claims pursuantto IO generally, both counsel consent to the publication of these Reasons for Decision subject to an anonymity order so that thenames of the parties and/or other indicia that may identify the minor 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff will not be published. To give effect to such order, I now also direct that the Originating Summons in the court file shallnot be open for search by strangers to the present proceedings without leave of the court. I am satisfied that in the context ofthe present proceedings administration of justice is best served by exercising my discretion to make such orders.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>IV. Value of the Deceasedâs estate</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  There is no dispute the value of the Deceasedâs estate is substantially in excess of HK$3 million. The Provisional Certificateof Receipt of Estate Duty issued on 26<sup>th</sup> October 2005 lists 33 high-valued landed properties in Hong Kong and gives a provisional value of the estate of HK$295 million.

Under section 2 of IO, âcourtâ is defined as âunless the context otherwise requires, means the Court of First Instanceor the District Courtâ. Sections 4 and 7 as well as other sections of IO all refer to powers of âthe courtâ to make orderswithout restricting the relevant tribunal to the Court of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Sections 8 and 9 of IO are illuminating. Section 8 refers to the powers of âthe courtâ to vary, discharge, suspend and/or revivethe original order made by âthe courtâ under section 4(1)(a) of IO. Section 9 refers to the powers of âthe courtâ to orderpayment of lump sums under section 4(1)(b) or 8(2)(b) by instalments. These provisions again do not restrict the relevant tribunalto the Court of First Instance. Section 25(3) of IO goes further to provide as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">Applications under sections 8 and 9(2) shall be made to the court that made the order to which the application relates; but rulesof court may make provision for the transfer of applications from one court to another.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Mr Cheung suggests that this provision plainly shows that both the District Court and Court of First Instance must have jurisdictionto deal with applications under IO otherwise the reference to âtransfer of applications from one court to anotherâ will be meaningless.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Both counsel have referred to the case of <i>Leung Kam Yin Joyce v Li Oi Lun</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%204%20HKC%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 4 HKC 559</a>, where the value of the deceasedâs estate amounted to about HK$5.5 million and the plaintiff claimed for a maintenance sum of HK$1.5million under IO. Yam J transferred the case to the District Court since it was wrongly commenced in the Court of First Instance.H H Judge Lok held that section 25(1) of IO did not make provision for the District Court to have exclusive and unlimited jurisdictionin terms of monetary claims exceeding those limits set out in sections 32 to 37 of DCO, so there was no restriction preventing himfrom transferring the case back to the Court of First Instance on the grounds that the District Court did not have jurisdiction todeal with the same and/or the Court of First Instance would be the more appropriate forum.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In my view, it is implicit in the judgment of H H Judge Lok that the District Court does have proper jurisdiction to deal with claimsunder IO, but such jurisdiction is subject to the jurisdictional limits set forth in sections 32 to 37 of DCO. This is recognisedby Yam J in <i>Leung Kam Yin Joyce v</i> <i>The Personal Representative of the Estate of</i> <i>Lee Sai Wai, deceased (for the time being</i> <i>Li Oi Lun)</i> HCMP48598/201 (unreported, 25<sup>th</sup> September 2001) in his reading of H H Judge Lokâs judgment. In that case, the defendant applied before Yam J to strike out theplaintiff's case or to stay the same on the ground that the application by the plaintiff before H H Judge Lok in the District Courtfor the case to be transferred to the Court of First Instance was wrong since it would operate as an appeal against Yam Jâs earlierorder for transfer of the case to the District Court. Yam J disagreed and dismissed the defendantâs application.

Butthat is what the Act does not do.

Section 37(1) of DCO provides <i>inter alia</i> that :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">Subject to the maximum limits in amount or value set out in subsection (2), the Court has the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instanceto hear and determine the following proceedings-</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="80%" valign="top" class="quote">proceedings <i>relating to or for the administration of the estate of a deceased person</i>;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="80%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">(e)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="80%" valign="top" class="quote">proceedings for the maintenance or advancement of an infant; â¦â¦â (my emphasis)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr Cheung and Mr Li read the provision in section 37(1)(a) of DCO differently. Mr Cheung submits that its proper interpretationcovers proceedings ârelating to the estate of a deceased personâ or proceedings âfor the administration of the estate of adeceased personâ, so the District Court has power in the former case to make orders of various kinds relating to the net estateof the deceased under sections 4 and 7 and/or other provisions of IO. On the other hand, Mr Li submits that section 37(1)(a) of IOcovers proceedings ârelating to the administration of the estate of a deceased personâ or proceedings âfor the administrationof the estate of a deceased personâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Mr Cheung and Mr Li have not cited any authority or other aids to statutory interpretation to support their respective contentions.Nevertheless, I prefer Mr Liâs interpretation. If the provision is, as suggested by Mr Cheung, intended to cover proceedings ârelatingto the estate of a deceased personâ which have nothing to do with âthe administration of the estateâ, the draftsman of thestatute could easily have madeit abundantly clear, say, by adopting the form of wording in section 37(1)(b) of IO (eg â<i>proceedings</i> relating to the estate of a deceased person <i>or proceedings</i> for the administration of the estate of a deceased personâ) or by simply rearranging the expression(eg âproceedings for the administrationof or relating to the estate of a deceased personâ). Yet such forms of drafting have not been adopted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Further, the Rules of the District Court (â<u>RDC</u>â) contains procedural rules for administration actions (see Order 85) without any corresponding equivalent of Order 76 of the Rulesof the High Court (â<u>RHC</u>â) for contentious probate proceedings. Under the wide ambit of Mr Cheungâs interpretation of section 37(1)(a) of DCO that coversproceedings ârelating to the estate of a deceased personâ, such expression includes even probate actions, but this does not sitwell with the omission of Order 76 in RDC. In my view, the expressions ârelating toâ and âforâ in section 37(1)(a) of DCOrefer to âthe administration of the estate of a deceased personâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  On such basis, Mr Li argues that applications under IO for financial provision are not proceedings ârelating to or forâ theadministration of the estate of a deceased person since they are claimsagainst the estate and do not concern administration of theestate as such. He relies on <i>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate</i> (18<sup>th</sup> ed, 2000), para.31-10 at p.396 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦ Where a person who enters an appearance is interested under a will or codicil he must give the date thereof and show his interest,<i>e.g.</i> as residuary legatee. Where he claims to be interested under an intestacy, he must show how his interest arises. A claim to provisionunder the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 is claim against the estate and not an âinterestâ for thispurpose, although a successful claimant will of course have the status of a beneficiary under the trusts of the will or intestacyâ¦â¦â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr Li further submits that <i>Leung Kam Yin Joyce</i> does not assiston this question because H H Judge Lok concluded the case ought to be transferred to the Court of First Instance primarilybecause the amount involved, ie the claim of HK$1.5 million, exceeded what was set forth in sections 32 to 37 of DCO. Mr Li saysthe additional reason for transfer given by the learned judge, ie the application might involve probate matters, is not a matterof jurisdiction, but a factor that affects the discretion to transfer the case to the Court of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Even though H H Judge Lok did not precisely identify which provision of sections 32 to 37 of DCO was applicable to claims pursuantto IO, it is quite clear that by affirming the applicability of such sections to claims under IO (ie setting forth the maximum limitof the amount involved in such claims), he did not question the more fundamental premise that claims under IO fall within the prescribedproceedings in which the District Court has jurisdiction (see paragraph 24 above). Had it been otherwise, there would have been noneed to consider whether they are within the maximum jurisdictional limits or not. I do not believe <i>Leung Kam Yin Joyce</i> is helpful to Mr Liâs contention.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The relevant principles of statutory construction are summarised in <i>Craies on Legislation</i> para.18.1.14 at p.566 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Legislation is always to be understood first in accordance with its plain meaning.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Where the plain meaning is in doubt, the courts will start the process of construction by attempting to discover, from the provisionsenacted, the broad purpose of the legislation.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Where a particular reading would advance the purpose identified, and would do no violence to the plain meaning of the provisions enacted,the courts will be prepared to adopt that reading.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Where a particular reading would advance the purpose identified but would strain the plain meaning of the provisions enacted, theresult will depend on the context and, in particular, on a balance of the clarity of purpose identified and the degree of strainon the language.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="82%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Where the courts conclude that the underlying purpose of the legislation is insufficiently plain, or cannot be advanced without anunacceptable degree of violence to the language used, they will be obliged, however regretfully in the circumstances of a particularcase, to leave to the legislature the task of extending or modifying the legislation.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The expression ârelating toâ is capable of bearing broader or narrower meaning as the context requires. Section 37 of DCO ispart of a group of sections, ie sections 32 to 37 of DCO, that deal with the adjudicative jurisdiction of the District Court, andhence section 37(1)(a) must be interpreted in such context according to the intention expressed in the language used.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In my view, for proceedings to be caught within the jurisdiction-conferring provision in section 37(1)(a) of DCO, they do not haveto be administration actions as defined in Order 85 of RDC or be directly concerned with the administration of the estate of a deceasedperson. The use of the disjunctive word âorâ in section 37(1)(a) of DCO suggests that proceedings ârelating toâ the administrationto the estate of a deceased person are sufficient without having to be âforâ the same. The natural and/or purposive meaning ofthe expression ârelating toâ is to bring a wider dimension to the scope of section 37(1)(a) of DCO in the context of the DistrictCourtâs adjudicative jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Again, neither Mr Cheung nor Mr Li has referred me to any authority or other aids to interpretation on the meaning of the expressionârelating toâ in a statutory context. Notwithstanding Mr Liâs submissions in paragraph 38 above, an application under IO isnot a probate action as contemplated in Order 76 of RHC. In my view, it is a statutory claim against the estate of a deceased personthat necessarily ârelates toâ the administration thereof because the effect of any claim or order for financial provision isto bring about a redistribution of the deceasedâs estate between the beneficiaries and the applicant by upsetting the existingadministration of such estate pursuant to a requirement to pay monies or transfer/settle/acquire property(ies) out of the net estateof the deceased to the applicant. Such construction of the expression in section 37(1)(a) of DCO does not do violence to its naturalmeaning. In coming to such view, I bear in mind <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap.1</a> as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">An ordinance shall be deemed to be remedial and shall receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as willbest ensure the attainment of the object of the ordinance according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Mr Cheung reminds that IO was enacted in 1995 (with amendments that are insignificant for present purposes in 1998) whilst the legislativeamendments enlarging the District Courtâs jurisdictional limits (eg the introduction of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 37</a> of DCO) were passed in 2000. He argues that had there been any legislative intention to abrogate the jurisdiction of the DistrictCourt in handling proceedings under IO, it would have been set out expressly and unambiguously in the District Court (Amendment)Ordinance 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Mr Li next submits that it is evident from the section heading of âEquity jurisdictionâ for section 37 of DCO that such sectiondeals with the equity jurisdiction of the District Court. Since proceedings under IO are not claims in equity, section 37(1) of DCOdoes not confer jurisdiction on the District Court to handle such proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In making such submission, Mr Li has very fairly drawn my attention to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap.1</a> which suggests that a section heading is not decisive of the meaning of the section :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">A marginal note or section heading to any provision of any Ordinance shall not have any legislative effect and shall not in any wayvary, limit or extend the interpretation of any Ordinance.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Nevertheless, Mr Li argues that a section heading still provides guidance on the reading of the section.

The learned Acting Registrar took the view that whenthe mortgagee sued for monies under a mortgage, he was in fact enforcing the personal contract for payment of a debt. In the circumstances,section 32 of DCO, which set forth the jurisdiction of the District Court for contractual claims, was applicable, and section 37of DCO was not because the claim was not for âforeclosure or redemption of a mortgageâ or for enforcing equitable rights undera charge. The claims in these two cases were therefore outside the jurisdiction of the District Court, and the learned Acting Registrargranted orders for transfer to the Court of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Li seizes on the learned Registrarâs comment in her judgments that section 37 of DCO âonly deals with the equity jurisdictionof the District Courtâ. In my view, such comment must be read in the context of the discussion in two cases, which is focused onthe applicability of section 37(1)(c) of DCO (ie âproceedings for the foreclosure or redemption of a mortgage or for enforcinga charge or lienâ) to the subject claims.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  If one casts an eye through the various provisions of section 37 of DCO, it is not hard to find that it is not strictly limitedto âequity jurisdictionâ. For example, whilst proceedings for the execution of a trust or for declaration that a trust subsistsseek equitable relief, the reference to âproceedings under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/253/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/253" class="autolink_findacts">Variation of Trusts Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/253">Cap.253</a>)â in section 37(1)(b) plainly seeks a statutory remedy. Further, Mr Li accepts that âproceedings for foreclosure â¦â¦of a mortgageâ in section 37(1)(c) do not necessarily refer to a claim in equity. Still further, âproceedings for the dissolutionor winding up of a partnershipâ in section 37(1)(f) may well be a claim for statutory relief under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/38/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 37</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/38" class="autolink_findacts">Partnership Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/38">Cap.38</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr Cheung submits that the section heading for <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/38/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 37</a> of DCO is misleading and can be disregarded. It is not lost on this court that H H Judge Lok had at p.423 of his judgment in <i>Wong Kum Chi</i> also regarded the section heading of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/38/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 36</a> of DCO misleading, ie whilst it is not a jurisdiction-conferring provision, its section heading is entitled âJurisdiction wheretitle in questionâ. In my view, the section heading of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/38/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 37</a> of DCO is merely a brief approximation that does not cover all the detailed matters falling within the provision.

Mr Li submits that is not how <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/38/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 37</a> of DCO should be read. He relies on the English position stated in <i>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate</i> para.59-11 at pp.833-834, ie the guidelines for allocating proceedings to the English High Court and County Court under the Inheritance(Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 turn on the âamount of money which the plaintiff or applicant could reasonably stateto be the financial worth of the claim to himâ under paragraphs 7 and 9 of the High Court and County Court Jurisdiction Order 1991and not on the size of the estate. Mr Li has not referred me to the High Court and County Court Jurisdiction Order 1991. But I amnot persuaded the English position is of assistance because according to the learned text the High Court and County Court JurisdictionOrder 1991 gives the County Court unlimited jurisdiction under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 whichis in contra-distinction to the limited jurisdiction of the local District Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  I prefer Mr Cheungâs submission that the maximum limits in amount or value referred to in section 37(1)(a) is referable to thevalue of the estate of a deceased person. This is the only natural reading of section 37(1)(a) in conjunction with 37(2)(a) of DCO.Mr Liâs interpretation renders the expression âan estate of a deceased personâ redundant. That cannot be right.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In addition to a claim for final and/or interim maintenance, the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs further or alternatively seek rent-free occupation of a landed property owned by the Deceased. I am not sure whether suchrelief is sought under section 4(1)(d) of IO which refers to settlement rather than occupation of property, but I need not form anydefinitive view on this issue. There is no dispute that the amount or value of the Deceasedâs estate or indeed (as Mr Li concedes)the value of any single landed property of the Deceasedâs estate exceeds HK$3 million. Clearly, such claim is outside the jurisdictionallimits of the District Court. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  As regards the monetary claims of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs, I agree they should be considered together for the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs seek financial provision out of the same estate of the Deceased. As discussed above, each of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs applies for financial provision of HK$14,200.00 a month and the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff applies for financial provision of HK$9,800.00 a month for their accommodation, living, education and/or medical expensesunder section 4 of IO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Mr Cheung submits that the monetary claims easily exceed HK$1 million. He refers to section 21 of IO which provides <i>inter alia</i> that â[where] an order is made under section 4 then for all purposes, â¦â¦ the will or the law relating to intestacy, or boththe will and the law relating to intestacy, as the case may be, shall have effect and be deemed to have had effect <i>as from the deceased's death</i> subject to the provisions of the orderâ (my emphasis). Given the young age of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs, the indefinite term of their claim for financial provision under section 4 of IO (ie âas the court thinks fitâ asprayed for in the Originating Summons), and almost 3 years have elapsed since the Deceasedâs death in December 2004, Mr Cheungsays that the claims of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs easily exceed the monetary limit of HK$1 million. Mr Cheung argues that the term of the periodical payments is left tobe fixed by the court at the time of making the order after having considered the matters set out in section 5 of IO and/or uponvariation of the order pursuant to sections 8 and 25(3) of IO, and there is no requirement in IO for spelling out the same in theapplication.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Mr Li complains that the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs have not clarified the precise total amount of final and interim maintenance since they have failed to specify the termfor the periodical payments, so there is doubt as to whether the claim for maintenance exceeds HK$1 million. Further, the deemingprovision in section 21 of IO is not mandatory or automatic but subject to the provision of the order for maintenance. Mr Li arguesthat the factual bases put forward by the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs in the present proceedings for seeking financial provision for future (and not past) studiesby the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs as well as for future tertiary education for the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff (when she was previously only a secondary school student) make it inappropriate for the eventual order for periodical payments(if any) to be made retrospectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  At this stage when the court is considering the matter of jurisdiction, it is unnecessary and indeed inappropriate to form any definitiveview as to the final merits of the claims of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs. Jurisdiction is not determined by the ultimate merits but rather on the nature and/or value of the claim unless it iswholly unarguable. Approaching the matter on such basis, I cannot say that Mr Cheungâs submissions on the value of the monetaryclaim are unarguably bad. Indeed, there is an arguable case that the monetary claims of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs exceed HK$1 million and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In the case of section 37(1)(e) of DCO, the corresponding maximum limit in amount or value relates to the property of the infant.However, there is no property of the infant (ie the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff) to speak of in the present proceedings because financial provision is not sought against her property but against theDeceasedâs estate. That itself is enough to take the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffâs claim outside the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In the circumstances, I conclude that the District Court does not have any jurisdiction to deal with the present claims of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs under IO, which must be transferred to the Court of First instance pursuant to section 41 of DCO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>VI. Discretion to transfer</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  But if I am wrong and the District Court does have jurisdiction to deal with the present proceedings, I proceed to consider whetherI should exercise my discretion to transfer the present proceedings to the Court of First Instance pursuant to section 42 of DCO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Mr Cheung refers to <i>Leung Kam Yin Joyce</i> where H H Judge Lok transferred the application under IO before him to the Court of First Instance partly because the claim mightinvolve probate and matrimonial matters and so the Court of First Instance would be the more appropriate forum to determine the application.Mr Cheung submits that the present proceedings likewise involve probate matters and should be transferred to the Court of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mr Li adopts a neutral stance on the question of whether the present proceedings should be transferred to the Court of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In my view, this is an appropriate case for transfer to the Court of First Instance. Although the Guardianship Action is now almostat an end, the Probate Action is still ongoing. It is unnecessary to set out in detail the factual matters canvassed in the affirmationsfiled by the parties in the present proceedings.

factual matters are hotly disputed. Although Mr Li submits that the Defendant reserves the right to dispute the relevancyof the historical matters for the purpose of the present proceedings, the reality is that the affirmation evidence (including thosefiled on behalf of the Defendant) has put these matters in issue. In the ongoing Probate Action, the plaintiffs therein challengethe validity of the will of the Deceased made in 2003 whilst the Stepmother maintains it is the Deceasedâs true and last will.One of the issues is the testamentary wishes of the Deceased, ie whether the Deceased intended to disinherit <i>inter alia</i> the Motherâs children. In such circumstances, the Deceasedâs relationship with the Stepmother, Mother and their children areprobably matters that will be canvassed in the Probate Action. As seen from above, similar matters have been raised in the affirmationevidence in the present proceedings. Bearing in mind the factors the court has to consider under section 5(1) and (4) and section7(3) of IO and looking at the matter in the round, I am persuaded that the Court of First Instance is the more appropriate forumto determine the present application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>VI.</u> <i><u>Conclusion</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In the circumstances, I have at the hearing made an order directing the whole of the present proceedings to be transferred to theCourt of First Instance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Mr Cheung and Mr Li are in agreement on the issue of costs.
