Chu, the Defendant, was the solicitor acting for her in the deal.  For alleged failure to complete by the contractual deadline onthe part of Chu on behalf of Wu, the vendor forfeited Wuâs deposit.  The vendor and Wu eventually settled their dispute and thedeal managed to proceed to completion at a later date.  Wu commenced this action against Chu for breach of contract and negligencein causing her pecuniary loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Background</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The sale and purchase agreement between the vendor and Wu dated 11 March 2008 provided that completion should take place on or beforethe date and time as set out in the 6<sup>th</sup> Schedule.  There the completion date and business hours were defined as âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> day of June 2008 within the Business Hours between 9:30 am and 5:00 pmâ.  Time was of the essence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  By subsequent agreement evidenced by letters between the solicitors dated 13 and 14 May 2008, completion was advanced to 21 May2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 21 May 2008, Chuâs representative delivered the completion docket enclosing Wuâs payment for the balance of the purchaseprice to the office of the vendorâs solicitors.  On the basis that the completion docket arrived at 5:06 pm, the vendor treatedWu as being in breach of the sale and purchase agreement.  The vendor sought to forfeit the deposit that Wu had previously paid inthe total sum of HK$988,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  After negotiation and by a written settlement agreement dated 28 May 2008, the vendor and Wu agreed to proceed to complete the saleand purchase, this time on 4 June 2008.  For that, Wu also agreed to pay the vendor a sum of HK$180,000 on top of the balance ofpurchase price payable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Wu now claims against Chu for damages in the sum of HK$180,000 together with the additional legal costs in the sum of HK$1,500 andadditional interest payment for mortgage arrangement in the sum of HK$683.15.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>The application</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Pleadings were closed and Wu applied for summary determination of this case. Pursuant to O.14A of the Rules of the District Court,Wu formulated the following question of law for determination:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âwhether upon the true construction of the following documents, namely (i) the Agreement dated 11<sup>th</sup> March 2008 between the Plaintiff and Golden Rich Realty Limited (âthe Vendorâ) and (ii) the letters dated 13<sup>th</sup> May 2008 and 14<sup>th</sup> May 2008 between the Defendant and Messrs. Katherine Y. W. Or &amp; Co. (solicitors for the Vendor), the proper time for completionof the sale and purchase of the property known as Flat C, 6/F, Block 2, Kingâs Park Villa, No.1 Kingâs Park Rise, Homantin, Kowloontogether with car parking space C55 at level 3 (âthe Propertyâ) was to be within the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (definedas âBusiness Hoursâ therein) on 21 May 2008; and therefore, by reason of the Defendantâs (and/or his agentâs) failure toarrive at the Vendorâs solicitorâs office on or before the time for completion of the transaction and his failure to duly completethe said transaction for and on behalf of the Plaintiff, for final Judgment against the Defendant in this action for the amount claimedin the Amended Statement of Claim with interest thereon, and costs of this action to be taxed and paid by the Defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Alternatively, Wu asked for judgment under O.14 on the basis that Chu has no defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In her submissions, Miss Lam made clear that Wuâs primary position was to seek summary judgment under O.14.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Insofar as O.14 is concerned, the court will consider whether the Defence raises any arguable issues that should be tried or thatthe case ought to proceed to trial for any other reason.  However the court is not supposed to embark on a mini trial on affidavits. See <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2009</i>, Vol.1 at 14/4/2 â 14/4/10.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=11%20For%20O14A" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">11.</a>  For O.14A</a> to be applicable, the question of law or construction should be one that is suitable for determination summarily; and that it wouldfinally determine the entire cause or matter or any issue or claim therein: see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2009</i>, Vol.1 at 14A/2/2 â 14A/2/4.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Discussion</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Agreed time for completion is meant to be and must be strictly adhered to: see <i>Union Eagle Ltd v Golden Achievement Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20HKC%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 HKC 173</a>; <i>Ocean Force Enterprises Limited &amp; Anor v Grand Fully Holdings Limited &amp; Anor</i>, HCA 3571/1997 (14 April 1999); <i>Leung Ching Fai Jacky v Tang Ka Fai</i>, HCA 2313/2004 (1 February 2006).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  There should be no real dispute as to the duty of Chu as the conveyancing solicitor.  Chu owed Wu the duty to exercise due careand skill to be expected of a reasonably competent conveyancing solicitor: see <i>Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett Stubbs and Kemp</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20Ch%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] Ch 384</a> at 402.  This included the duty not to miss a conveyancing deadline: see <i>Leung Ching Fai Jacky</i> (above) at para.7.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The major dispute is whether Chu was in breach of such duty.  Central to the question of whether Chu was in breach of such dutyare the following issues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  whether completion on 21 May 2008 should take place between 9:30 am and 5:00 pm; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)  if yes, whether Chuâs representative failed to deliver the completion docket by 5:00 pm on that day.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Issue (1)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Issue (1) above was argued as questions of construction of contractual documents and law.  Miss Lam submitted that any reasonableparty looking at the terms of the sale and purchase agreement and the subsequent correspondence evidencing the partiesâ agreementto advance the completion date would consider that all the terms of the agreement unchanged would remain in force including the definitionof âthe business hoursâ in the 6<sup>th</sup> Schedule.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr Li for Chu submitted that the âmidnight ruleâ applied in the present case.  He argued that the time for completion was partand parcel of the complete date.  Once the date was varied, so would the time.  In the absence of specific reference to the timefor completion in the agreement on the new completion date, Wu should have had up to the midnight of the new completion date to complete. He relied on <i>Camberra Investment Ltd v Chan Wai Tak</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20HKLR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 HKLR 568.</a>  He submitted that this is at least arguable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I can understand that in a case where there was no expressly agreed time for completion on the completion date, there may be basisfor applying the âmidnight ruleâ by way of implication.  This was also the scenario in <i>Camberra</i>.  There the court remarked that the contracting parties always had the liberty to make such express provision so as to remove anyperceived absurdity arising out of the application of the âmidnight ruleâ: see 573C-H.  There was in fact express provision asto the time of day for completion in the sale and purchase agreement in the present case.  I am not convinced that by agreeing toadvance the completion date, the time for completion was also varied for any intent and purpose.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Miss Lam submitted that Chu in fact recognised the time for completion on the new completion date to be within the business hoursas defined in the sale and purchase agreement.  She referred to two other letters from Chu on the day before completion.  By oneof these letters, Chu informed the mortgagee bank of the time for completion being at or before 5:00 pm on 21 May 2008.  By the otherletter, Chu confirmed that the completion was scheduled to take place at or before 4:00 pm and requested for funds no later than3:00 pm on that day.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Li for Chu submitted that these letters came into existence after the sale and purchase agreement and the solicitorsâ correspondenceevidencing the partiesâ agreement to vary the completion date.  Therefore they are inadmissible as aid to construing the contractualterms.  I do not agree.  In my view, these letters reflect Chuâs knowledge or understanding of the time for completion on the completionday and are admissible as evidence of that.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  As a matter of construction of the relevant documents and that of law, I am not convinced by the argument on behalf of Chu thatthe time for completion on 21 May 2008 could be any time of the day other than the business hours as originally agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Issue (2)</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Issue (2) is really a question of fact.  In his first letter of reply to the vendorâs solicitors after the latter communicatedtheir position in respect of the alleged failure to complete on time on the part of Wu, Chu put on record, among other things, thathis representative insisted that he arrived at the office of the vendorâs solicitors before 5:00 pm and that his arrival was delayedby the incorrect description of the address of the vendorâs solicitors which was not the room number as per the firmâs letterhead.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In the settlement agreement subsequently reached between Wu and the vendor, the parties recited that there was a dispute about thetime for completion between the parties.  They also recited the vendorâs allegation that Wu had been in breach by failing to completethe purchase on or before 5:00 pm on the completion date and that the vendor purported to exercise the right to rescind the agreementand to forfeit the deposit.  The parties were said to have reached the settlement agreement to settle such disputes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  It was expressly provided in the settlement agreement (para.1 of the substantive terms) that Wuâs agreement to pay the extra sumof HK$180,000 to the vendor did not constitute any admission of obligations or liabilities on her part in respect of their disputes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Upon the close of pleadings in the present action, Wuâs solicitors filed the following list of issues in dispute between the partiespursuant to the courtâs direction:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â1.  Whether the Defendant was in breach of contract and/or was negligent in carrying out his duties as a solicitor when actingfor the Plaintiff in a sale and purchase transaction of a property known as â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">2.  <b>In particular, whether the Defendant and/or employees of his firm were late in tendering the balance of purchase price for the Propertyat the offices of the Vendorâs solicitors on 21 May 2008 (after the agreed deadline for completion of the sale and purchase ofthe Property, i.e., on or before 5 p.m., 21<sup>st</sup> May 2008), thereby rendering it impossible for completion to proceed; and consequently, whether the Defendant had negligently carriedout his duties as a solicitor, and should therefore be liable to the Plaintiff (in contract and/or in tort) for any loss and damagesuffered by the Plaintiff</b>.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">3.  Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to claim relief from the Defendant for compensation in the sum of HK$180,000.00 being the amountagreed to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Vendor to their subsequent dealings together with other expenses incidental thereto.â(<i>emphasis added</i>)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In other words, it was acknowledged on behalf of Wu that whether the representative of Chu was late in tendering the completiondocket including the payment of the balance of purchase price at the office of the vendorâs solicitors is a live issue.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Unlike the case where the claim for professional negligence is filed where how the conveyancing transaction failed and whose responsibilityit was for the failure is either indisputable or adjudicated upon by the court, the dispute between Wu and the vendor was settledwithout prejudice to Wuâs position, as expressly provided in the settlement agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Faced with the dispute with the vendor, Wu might stand to lose the deposit.  Between them, Wu might not be expected to take therisk of litigation and therefore it might be reasonable for her to come to terms with the vendor.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  However, between Wu and Chu, it is her burden to establish breach of duty on the part of Chu.  She still has to prove the primaryfact that Chuâs representative was late on the completion day.  It was only that which caused her to lose the deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Of course, Wu could show for the purpose of this application that Chuâs case is incredible.  This was indeed Miss Lamâs contention. Miss Lam, understandably, relied on the time chop placed by the vendorâs solicitors on the completion docket received from Chuâsrepresentative on the completion day which recorded the time of 5:06 pm.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  But Mr Li referred to <i>Ocean Force Enterprises Limited v Chuan Sau Wan</i>, HCA 3571/1997 where the solicitor was said to be 3 minutes later than the completion deadline.  The learned Deputy Judge accepted(at pp.10-11) that notwithstanding the apparent record of 5:03 pm by reference to the time chop on the completion docket, he couldbe no more precise than finding that completion was tendered around 5:00 pm.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In my view, the alleged 6-minute difference was a sufficiently narrow margin for the partiesâ respective timing and allegationsto be fully investigated.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In this respect, Miss Lam categorised Chuâs allegation as bare assertion, in the absence of evidence from the representative whodelivered the completion docket.  I notice from the court file that the parties have filed their witness statements for trial priorto the present application.  There is yet to be a statement from this representative of Chu who delivered the completion docket tothe office of the vendorâs solicitors at the time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Nevertheless, as this is an O.14 application, Chu is entitled to rely on hearsay evidence where the source of such information wasidentified.  The point is that in view of the materials before this court, Chuâs allegation about the arrival time of his representativeat the office of the vendorâs solicitors cannot be ruled out as a recent fabrication.  I am not prepared to rule out the defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The point of law formulated for the purpose of the O.14A application was premised on the fact that Chuâs representative was latefor completion on the completion day.  The dispute in this very respect upsets that premise.  Further, the court retains a residualdiscretion whether or not to embark on a determination of a question under O.14A.  See <i>Rockwin Enterprises Ltd v Shui Yee Ltd &amp;Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKC%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 HKC 174.</a>  I come to the conclusion that I should not do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Order</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  My view as to the contractual deadline for completion on the completion date is against Chu.  As to whether Chu has failed to meetthat deadline, his evidence remains as at today a matter of hearsay against what the time chop on the completion docket primarilysuggests.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Chu also raised various other issues.  I agree with Miss Lam that they are nothing but red herring.  For the purpose of the O.14application, I consider these other issues to be relatively insignificant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Considering all the circumstances, I am not minded to dismiss the summons with costs to Chu as Mr Li suggested.  Nor am I mindedto impose condition for leave to defend as Miss Lam suggested. There will effectively be unconditional leave to defend.
