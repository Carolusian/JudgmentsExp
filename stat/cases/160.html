They have been taken together because theyraise identical issues. To illustrate this I need refer only to the first action which is the hotel action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The plaintiffs in both cases were main contractors on two different building sites. The defendants, a firm of architects, were ineach case the architects named in the relevant building contract. The hotel claim relates to a hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> After pleading by way of recital certain matters one finds this in paragraph 5: -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The defendants owed the plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in the performance of their functions pursuant tothe contract, and a duty to act fairly and impartially in the performance of those functions."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>That is the first crucial paragraph of the Statement of Claim because it is said that neither of these duties exists in 1aw.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The second crucial paragraph is the first allegation of breach, it is paragraph 29. It says this: -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The Defendants wrongfully and in breach of duty disregarded the above facts and matters and acting partially and solely in the interestof the owners purported ....."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The last material paragraph is 35 which alleges further breaches. It is in these terms: -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"The Defendants were further negligent and/or in breach of their duty to act fairly and impartially in the performance of their functionspursuant to the contract, as particu1arised hereunder."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>The comp1aints particu1arised thereunder relate largely to the administration of the contract.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The allegations of duty and breach in the factory action follow a similar form. The only difference there is that because there wasno arbitration clause in that contract, the building owners are the 1st defendants in that action and the architects are the 2nddefendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Now there is no dispute as to the appropriate principles to be applied by the court on an app1ications of this nature. They are tobe found in <u>Drummond Jackson</u> v. <u>British Medical</u> <u>Assocation</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%201%20WLR%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 1 W.L.R. 688</a> and in <u>McKay</u> v. <u>Essex Area Health Authority</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20QB%201166" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 Q.B. 1166.</a> Very conveniently at page 1176 in his judgment in <u>McKay</u> Stevenson L.J. collects together the various adjectives and epithets that had been used in the earlier cases. For my part I am contentto adopt what Lord Pearson said in <u>Drummond Jackson</u> which is that an order for striking out should only be made if it becomes plain and obvious that the claim cannot succeed". I notethe fact that it need not become plain and obvious at first sight. The question is what is the state of mind of the court at theend of the argument however long that argument has happened to be. This provoked Griffiths L.J. in that case to suggest that whenthe court is faced with some prolonged argument, it should not embark upon the inquiry.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> That is an attractive suggestion but it seems to me easier to say it than to apply it. I have had four days of argument in this case.I may add four days of exceedingly skillful and stimulating argument, and I am most grateful to the counsel on both sides. I do notregret a moment on it. It does mean that at the end of four days I am in this rather perverse position. I have to decide not whetherthe duty a11eged in the pleading exists, but whether it can plainly be said not to exist. The court is really now under this procedurein a worse state than it was under the old demurrer procedure, if I have correctly understood it. My decision, if I strike out, bindsthe party; if I do not it becomes purely advisory. It becomes something like a thing "writ in water". This is a somewhat bizarreposition after four days of careful legal argument. There is the problem. The solution has eluded me. The only "solution" in thiscase would have been to have said "your four days estimate is too long; you have too many authorities; I shall not embark upon thisat all." I do not see how that is possible without obvious injustice. So the approach that I adopt is - is it plain and obvious thatthis claim must fail?</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The claim is framed in negligence. Therefore it seems to me that I have to start, in the same way as every court has started, tomy knowledge, since 1978, with the two questions posed by Lord Wi1berforce in <u>Anns</u> v. <u>Merton London Borough Council</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20A%20C%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) A. C. 728</a> at 751. He says this: -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"First one has to ask whether as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suffered damage, there is a sufficient relationshipof proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former carelessness on his part may be likely tocause damage to the latter in which case a prima facie duty of care arises."</p>            <p> </p>            <p class="quote">"Secondly, if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there are any considerations whichought to negative or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Oliver L.J. in a recent decision <u>Leigh and Si11ivan Limited</u> v. <u>A1iakmon Shipping</u> <u>Limited</u> in the Court of Appeal in England  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20WLR%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 W.L.R. 287</a>, pointed out that the guidance given by these two questions is somewhat inadequate. I am constrained to agree, but it is the bestthat we have, and perhaps as far as the law has yet gone.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> So I consider first question one. The proximity said to arise in this case is purely the creation of contract. It arose between thetwo parties when the contractor elected to enter into the contracts; and the architect elected to accept appointment as architectin the hotel case, and as architect and quantity surveyor in the factory case, under those respective contracts. That is what broughtthe parties together in the context of the construction of these buildings. One of the matters complained of in this case is faultycertifying. It is, I think, self evident that if by a mistake in the architect's office a certificate is issued for $X when in factit should have been issued for $2X, that that is likely to cause damage to the contractor. The building owner can be expected topay on that certificate $X, and not (on my assumed facts) the true figure of S2X. Furthermore the damage which is likely to be occasionedto the contractor in such circumstances is financial damage.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Now there have been a number of cases where the courts have held that legal proximity arises out of a relationship which is basicallycontractual or pre-contractual. In the immediate wake of the decision in <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u> v. <u>He11er</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20A%20C%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) A. C. 464</a> I think the courts were reluctant to allow the tortious principles of that case to intrude into the contractual scene. That reluctancewas dissipated. Substantia11y by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <u>Esso Petroleum Limited</u> v. <u>Mardon</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20QB%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) Q.B. 801.</a> There are a number of other examples of legal proximity arising out of contract. We considered a lot of them in a fairly recent bankingdecision in Hong Kong <u>Tai Hing Cotton Mill</u> v. <u>Liu Chong Hing Bank</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20HKLR%2095" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) H.K.L.R. 95.</a> The banking contract may create by that contract alone a proximate relationship and a duty on the Bank. This is also in line withthe decided cases conveniently collected in volume 4 of the Building Law reports. I have in mind <u>Clay</u> v. <u>Cramp</u> and <u>O1dschool</u> v. <u>G1eason</u> where the relationship between architect and contractor in relation to obviously defective plans, and the relationship between architect,contractors and third parties in relation to defective workmanship, have been said to give rise to duties of care. It therefore seemsto me that there is a strong probability of this question being answered in the affirmative.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I therefore turn to the second question. It is usually here that the problems arise and I think that it is in relation to this questionthat most of Mr. Lloyd's submissions can properly be dealt with. I accept that there is a semantic argument as to whether policyarises on question one or question two; but I follow Lord Wi1berforce's lead and deal with it entirely at question two.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Now the first problem here which the defendants face is the decision in <u>Arenson</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20A%20C%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) A. C. 405.</a> This case reached the House of Lords in the wake of <u>sutcliffe</u> v. <u>Thackrah</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20A%20C%20727" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) A. C. 727.</a> <u>sutcliffe</u> v. <u>Thackrah</u> had decided that an architect owed a duty of care to his employing owner and was not immune from suit by reason of being a quasi-arbitrator.In reaching that decision their Lordships were severely critical of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <u>Arenson</u>. As a result of this leave to appeal was given well out of time in the <u>Arenson</u> decision, and it thus reached the House of Lords. It concerned a dispute about the valuation of shares in a private company. It isinstructive to note that Lord Salmon opened his speech by pointing out that there was considerable doubt as to who had in fact retainedthe va1uers, whether was one or other of the Arensons or the company itself. But he said: "I do not think that this matters becausesince the decision of this House in <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u> it is quite clear that apart from any contractual obligations the respondents must have owed the duty both to Mr. Archy Arenson andto the appellant to use reasonable care and skill in making their valuation."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Later in his speech he turns to deal with the argument of the accountants that they should not be put in a duty situation which wouldleave them open to be "shot at" from both sides. Lord Salmon goes on to say that he cannot accept this argument. "Were it sound itwould be just as relevant in <u>Sutcliffe</u> v. <u>Thackrah</u> as in the present case. The architect owed a duty to his client, the building owner, arising out of the contract between them touse reasonable care in issuing his certificate. He also, however, owed a similar duty of care to the contractor arising out of theirproximity, see <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u>. In <u>Sutcliffe</u> v. <u>Thackrah</u> the architect negligently certified that more money was due than was in fact due. And he was successfully sued for the damage whichthis had caused his client. He might, however, have negligently certified that less money was payable than was in fact due, and therebystarved the contractor of money. In a trade in which cash flow is especially important, this might have caused the contractor seriousdamage for which the architect could have been successfully sued."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> It is apparent, I think, from those remarks that Lord Salmon took the situation of the architect as an obvious example of a professionalwho was liable to be shot at from both sides from his appointment under a typical common-form building contract. He goes on in factto distinguish the earlier decision of <u>Stevenson</u> v. <u>Watson</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20CPD%20148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 CPD 148</a> not upon the basis that there was no duty, but because the architect there was truly discharging a judicial function. So that Mr.Wa11er for the plaintiffs is able to point to what is admittedly an obiter but in my judgment a plainly considered view of a verydistinguished judge in this field. He is also able to point to the views of Lord Denning in <u>Arenson</u> in the Court of Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20Ch%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) Ch. 346</a>, where at pages 365 and 366 Lord Denning expresses views which would point to the same conclusion.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> My first question really is whether I can treat observations from that source not simply as being wrong but as being plainly wrong.I confess I have the greatest difficulty in so concluding. The part that both Lord Denning and Lord Salmon played in the developmentof this branch of the law, is very well known and very distinguished. Both on more than one occasion expressed views in advance oftheir contemporaries, if I can imitate Winston Churchill, up with which their contemporaries finally caught. Lord Denning can pointto <u>Cand1er</u> v. <u>Crane Christmas</u> and its approval in <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u>; he can point to <u>Arenson,</u> and he can probably point to <u>Esso</u> v. <u>Mardon</u>. Lord Salmon could point to <u>Woods</u> v. <u>Martins Bank</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%201%20QB%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 1 Q.B. 55</a>, which as long ago as 1959 made new advances in this field; another decision which was approved in <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u>. Another distinguished contribution of his was <u>Cuckmere Brick</u> v. <u>Mutual Finance</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20Ch%20949" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) Ch. 949.</a></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Therefore my starting point is that I think it is uncommonly difficult to say that anything is p1ainly wrong which has the supportof two such distinguished jurists. Nor in fact are they alone in this as I see it. If one looks at the speeches in <u>Arenson</u> of the other Lords of Appeal I strongly suspect that Lord Simon would have come to the same conclusion having regard to what he saysat pages 417 and 422. The same might be said about Lord Wheat1ey. It also seems to me that support is to be derived from the earlierdecision of the House of Lords in <u>Sutcliffe</u> v. <u>Thackrah</u>. That case concerned the architect and the employer. Lord Reid said in terms that they did not have occasion to consider whetherthe architect owed any duty to a contractor. But when he came to formulate the duty owed by the architect to the employer Lord Reidsaid this: "The building owner and the contractor made their contract on the understanding that in all such matters (and he is referringto certifying) the architect would act in a fair and unbiased manner. It must therefore be implicit in the owners contract with`the architect, but he shall not only exercise due care and skill but also reach such decisions fairly holding the balance betweenhis client and the contractor."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Those comments of Lord Reid's seem to me to suggest this. First these are two distinct duties albeit closely connected. Secondlythere is an obligation to act fairly which can scarcely be expressed unilaterally. It must in almost all cases be mutual. Thirdlyin a professional context fairness seems to me to postulate at least a degree of professional care. Those observations suggest tomy mind that Lord Reid would have answered the question: Does he also owe a duty to the contractor to act fairly, very firmly andpositively "Yes". He might well have gone on to say, "Yes, and that necessarily involves using professional care."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The last two observations upon this case are these. First, if as Mr. Wa11er contends a duty in identical terms is owed to the contractorby the architect, there is no possibility of conflict. The second is that Lord Reid made those observations in the context of certifying;Lord Morris put the matter somewhat more widely at pages 740 and 741.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Then it seems to me that there is considerable support in principle to be found in other authority. The first I pick out is the speechof Lord Pearce in <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20A%20C%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) A. C. 465</a> at 538 where he put the matter very generally in a way which has been cited repeatedly since. The second general observations whichpoint to that conclusion, I think are in <u>Ministry of Housing</u> v. <u>Sharp</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%202%20QB%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 2 Q.B. 223</a>, by Lord Denning again at page 268, and by Salmon L.J. at page 278. Then there is Megarry V. C. âs decision in <u>Ross</u> v. <u>Caunters</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20Ch%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) Ch. 297</a> and Junior <u>Books</u> v. <u>Veitchi</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20A%20C%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) A. C. 520</a> in the speeches of Lord Fraser and Lord Roski11. The way in which the duty and the law is put in each of those cases seems to meto suggest the existence of a duty in circumstances such as these.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The text book writers all faithfully repeat Lord Salmon. Perhaps they could do nothing else. What is more significant is that hisobservations are referred to without any criticism. The same might be said of the very distinguished editor of the building law reportswho, for this purpose will remain anonymous, who in a note at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20BLR%2018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 B.L.R. 18</a> not simply agreed with Lord Salmon but in fact anticipated his views.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> One is minded to suspect that the architects will prove to be unable to resist the tide which in the last twenty or thirty yearshas successively submerged accountants, solicitors, barristers, surveyors and va1uers in the sense that they have all been held toowe duties of care to persons other than their own clients. When one adds that support to the stature of Lord Salmon and Lord Denning,it does seem to me impossible for me to conclude that this case advanced on the pleading is unarguable.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I am going to go on, nevertheless, to consider the various points which have been most skillfully put before me by Mr. Lloyd in supportof the application, to see if there is anything which seems so decisive as to get him home.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The first point that he made was that it is essential here, having regard to the many different functions of the architect underthis contract, to draw a distinction between the architect as agent and the architect as certifier. As agent, he suggested that thearchitect was simply the legal extension of the owner. He was acting on the owner's instruction. He owed a duty only to the ownerand a conflicting duty could not be imposed upon him. The owner for his part owed no duty of care at all to the contractor. Therefore,he said, in the non-certifying characteristics and particularly in the case of administering the contract, no sort of duty of carecan possibly be owed and paragraph 34 of the hotel action must go.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> I am not convinced that this argument is well founded. First, I very much doubt whether this distinction is relevant to the existenceof a duty, although it would be very relevant to the content of the duty and to its performance. What the architect accepted underthese contracts was appointment in one case as architect, in the other case as architect and quantity surveyor. If he is under aduty of care by reason of that situation, I think that his duty arises qua architect, not qua agent, not qua independent contractor,not qua certifier. I think one has got to start with the premise that the duty arises from his professional position and no other.Now it may well be that when you consider the content and effect of that duty, there will be a number of contractual situations whereit is scarcely exists at all, because they do not give rise to any opportunity for the exercise of professional judgment and aresimply matters of performance under the contract. In other cases the position may be totally different. I do not think it is rightto start by splitting up somewhat artificially the manâs function in that way, among other things because he was not appointedin that form and because the dividing line is so difficult to draw.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> It follows from that first point that the express instructions which he may receive from the employer may well be relevant to theperformance of duty. I am far from sure they would necessarily constitute a defence. If he in fact acts in a way which the courtfinally concludes is negligent, and he does so on the instructions of the employer, I cannot see that that is going to constituteany defence to the architect. Nor can I see any basis for assuming that all the conduct complained of in paragraph 34 was in factperformed at the express instruction of the employer. Finally in this context, it seems to me that Mr. Wa11er is right when he submitsthat if the duty owed is the same to both parties, and follows the language of Lord Reid in <u>Sutcliffe</u> (which is also the language of the pleading), there is no room for conflict at all. So I am far from sure that that point will succeedat the hearing.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The next major premise advanced by Mr. Lloyd took two forms which I think I can take together. First he says that there is no generalduty owed by the professional man in these circumstances. In every case any duty which arises can properly be called "particularor special" and it only arises where two situations exist: first where the speaker or giver has information or knowledge unknownto the were the recipient, and secondly where the recipient relies on such knowledge. That is advanced as a general proposition,in support of the view that in absence of those elements no duty to be careful in respect of words arises.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Secondly, it is particularly advanced in the context of purely financial loss, where it is said that no duty of care can arise toguard against that sort of loss, in the absence of any damage to person or property. He seeks to put the damages in this case incategory 4 of the categories identified by Oliver L.J. in his judgment in <u>Leigh and Si11ivan</u> at page 310.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Those two propositions I am minded to think are not well founded. The first seems to me to constitute a misreading of <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u>, and the second to constitute a misreading of the ambit of <u>Leigh and Sil11ivan</u>. The <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u> principle is not so limited in the light of more recent authorities. The <u>Leigh</u> case seems to me very special and quite different to that potentially before this court, because it involved financial loss consequenton physical damage, claimed by a person who held the risk but no property in the goods. What answer to that conundrum is given tous by the house of Lords in the future, we shall have to wait and see.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I am bound to say I sympathized with the views being advanced upon <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u> v. <u>He11er</u> because they were very familiar to and once advanced by me. But likewise they were rejected by that court in <u>Ministry of Housing</u> v. <u>Sharp</u>. Cross L.J. in particular said in terms that <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u> did not lay down "the metes and boundes of the law" in this context. Indeed the submission cannot survive <u>Sharp</u> because there was no reliance there at all. Likewise the submission is inconsistent, it seems to me, with <u>Ross</u> v. <u>Caunters</u> unless one adopts the stance which Mr. Lloyd was advancing which you could have reliance at one stage removed. But if you can havereliance at one stage removed, then you can bring the contractor in at first remove.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The more I listened to this argument the more convinced I personally became, that "reliance" as used in the authorities is simplya factor which can lead to proximity and create the duty. If you have got facts which give rise to a proximate relationship you donot need reliance. That is true, as it seems to me, of a large number of the contract cases, where the contractual relationship orthe pre-contractual relationship is said to be sufficiently proximate to create the duty. Likewise it seems to be contrary to a numberof the general statements in the authorities to which I have already referred.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> Secondly the submission on financial loss fails again for the same reason as it failed in <u>Sharp</u>. If you answer question 1 by saying that carelessness may be likely to cause damage, and then you further ask what damage. The answeris financial loss. The duty then simply arises to take care that someone else does not suffer financial loss. The risk of damagegiving rise to a duty in the case of a professional man will in almost every case be of economic loss. So that that point, if correct,simply denies the duty at all. On authority it is not correct.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Next Mr. Lloyd advanced various propositions in relation to damage, and the foreseeabi1ity of damage, arising first out of the remedyin contract which the contractor has against the building owner; and secondly out of the arbitration clause in the hotel contract,and clause 30(8) in both contracts. These were various ways, I think, of expressing the same thought. First, there being an availableremedy against the building owner, there was no need for any other duty, and this was a policy consideration against its existence.Secondly the available remedy meant that the duty-ower would not foresee any loss because the loss would be met by another. Thirdlythe arbitration clause enabled any error to be put right, and therefore that excluded the prospect of foreseeable loss, unless itwas self-induced by non-operation of the arbitration clause.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Again I cannot agree with this. First of all there is, in fact, no true overlap between the causes of action in any event. Theremay be different defences e.g. under the contract, arising between the two claims. You can certainly have different measures of damages.This was made crystal clear in <u>Esso</u> v. <u>Mardon</u>. Likewise you have got different limitation periods. It could be that if you have different tribuna1s dealing with the differentcases, you wi11 have different results because one tribunal may not agree with the other. But the fatal objection here seems to meto be that if this point was right it would have prevented the development of parallel remedies in tort and contract at all. Butit never succeeded. The remedy in contract was available in <u>Esso</u> v. <u>Mardon</u> but that did not prevent the court saying that there was a parallel remedy in tort. The remedy in contract was available againstsolicitors and that survived <u>Hed1ey-Bryne</u> for some years. But it was put aside in <u>Midland Bank</u> v. <u>Hett</u>. The same could be said of Lord Salmon's view in <u>Arenson</u> and of the views of the House of Lords in <u>Junior Books</u>. If this was a valid policy objection it must have succeeded in those cases and it did not.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The granting of concurrent remedies in this situation does not give rise to double recovery because there are well known principleswhich ensure, or are intended to ensure, that although judgment may be obtained for the full amount against two different people,execution can only be obtained against one or other for the total limited sum.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Next there was what has been called the Crouch point which is based upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in <u>Northern Regional Health Authority</u> v. <u>Derek Crouch</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20QB%20644" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1 Q.B. 644.</a> In that case the Court of Appeal held that the court had no jurisdiction to interfere with certificates under clauses 22 and 23 ofthat contract, (and indeed of the contract before me) which are the clauses which enable the architect to extend the contractualtime for completion. They are the clauses which provide machinery for the variation of the contract rights. The Court of Appeal heldthat they were operative only by the arbitrator and not by the court. If that is the limit of the decision, as I had previously thought,it may well be that that is a decision which will be followed in Hong Kong. If on the other hand the decision goes a great deal furtherthan that, as has been brought home to me in the course of this course of this hearing by the judgment of H.H. Judge Smout Q.C. in<u>Oram Builders</u> v. <u>Pemberton</u> delivered on 1st February 1985 i.e. that the court has no jurisdiction to reconsider payment certificates, then it seems to me thatwe in Hong Kong will have to look at the position again with some considerable care.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> What at the moment, I entirely fail to see is how that can effect the position before me. I do not see why the fact that two parties,the contractor and the building owner have entered into a private arrangement which may curb the powers of the court in certain respect,can operate as a policy defence to an architect. It seems to me, with respect to Mr. Lloyd, a non sequitur. First of all it cannotapply to the factory contract at all because there is no arbitration clause. The same court has both parties before it and will haveto deal with the situation. We cannot surely have reached the situation where a duty arises if an arbitration clause exists, butdoes not if it does not.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Secondly in an action against an architect damage is a question of fact. The fact that the building owner and the contractor havechosen some private method of settlement of their own disputes cannot prevent the court from considering the measure of damage. Itdoes not present any sort of impediment or obstacle to the court that I can see. If the dispute between builder and contractor hasgone to arbitration, then obviously the court will have to have regard to the result, and to the arbitrator's reasons if it can discoverthem. That may give rise to problems, I accept, of proof. But if it has not gone to arbitration, and there may be good reason whyit has not, the court will have to act upon its own view of the actual damage suffered. I am frankly quite unable to see how thiscan constitute some policy objection to the existence of a duty in the architect.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> A very similar point is taken on interest. This is founded on the decision of the House of Lords in <u>La Pintarda</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20A%20C%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) A. C. 104.</a> Paragraph 2 of the head-note says this:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"But since Parliament had chosen to remedy some of the injustices caused by the Common Law Rule as laid down in a previous decisionof the House that a Court had no power to award interest by way of damages for detention of <u>debt</u>. (my emphasis) The house was unable to interfere."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>At the moment I do not see how this particular rule affects this case. It seems to me that Lord Salmon was totally right in his formulationof the potential damage which a contractor could suffer in these circumstances.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> First it seems to me that the old Common Law Rule will not even apply between contractor and owner. In the hypothetical situationI have already put of the certificate for $X which should have been $2X, the owner will pay $X, and properly pay $X on the certificate.He will only be liable to pay $2X when an arbitrator says $X is wrong. There will be no question then of detention of a debt. Thedebt will only be owed after the arbitrator's finding. Whether the arbitrator then awards interest to the contractor will be a matterof his discretion. One reason why the arbitrator may be loath to exercise his discretion against the owner could be, if he felt thearchitect was the person who was totally to blame for the delay.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> This simply does not arise as I see it in a claim by contractor against the architect. The law does not apply to anything other thanthe detention of debt in contract. It does not apply to damages in tort. Again it is a pure question of fact. I cannot see any legalimpediment to the recovery of damages against the architect, measured by the amount of interest which the contractor has lost bybeing kept out of his money.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Finally there is the fact that the Statements of Claim plead two duties: The duty of care and the duty of fairness. Lord Reid inthe passage I have referred to from <u>Sutcliffe</u> likewise separates the two duties. That second plea of a duty of fairness is supported by a plea of facts, which I must assume tobe true, which are claimed to give rise to as inference of partiality, which again I must assume to be true. The only possible wayin which that particular part of the Statement of Claim could be struck out is by saying that there are not two duties here but one.Frankly, I do not see how I can reach that conclusion in the face of what Lord Reid said.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> So for those reasons, which I recognise will have no effect upon the determination of this action at all, I am constrained to theconclusion, without any real difficulty or doubt, that these applications must be dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(D.S.
