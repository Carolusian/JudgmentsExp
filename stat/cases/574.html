At the time a person named KWAN SHING YIP was a passenger on the motorcycle. As a result of the collision bothLIU CHUN WAH and KWAN SHING YIP lost their lives.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The administrator of the estate of LIU CHUN WAH bought an action suing the driver of the bus and its owner, namely the 1st and 2ndDefendants in this action, for damages under High Court Action No. 9046 of 1981. Settlement was eventually reached and judgment wasaccordingly given on 1st February 1983 on the basis of the agreement that the deceased, the rider of the motorcycle was 45% to blamefor the accident.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> On the 25th May 1983 the administratrix of the estate of the pillion rider, KWAN SHING YIP commenced this present action suing thethree named defendants. The 3rd Defendant applied to have the Plaintiff's action against him dismissed on the grounds that the proceedingswere not commenced within 6 months of the date Letters of Administration were granted to him, namely on 17th November 1981. He relied,of course, on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sec 20(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap. 23</a> which provides.</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"No proceedings shall be maintainable in respect of a cause of action in tort which by virture of this section has survived againstthe estate of a deceased person unless .......</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>    </blockquote>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="10%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>            <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">(b)</p>            </td>            <td width="90%" valign="middle" class="quote">                proceedings are taken in respect thereof not later than 6 months after his personal representative took out representation."                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The action against the 3rd Defendant was accordingly dismissed. The 1st and 2nd Defendants had served on the 3rd Defendant a noticeunder Order 16 Rule 8 of the Rules of the Supreme Court claiming an indemnity or contribution in respect of the Plaintiff's claimand as a result of further directions they also served a statement of claim on the 3rd Defendant alleging that the said collisionwas caused or contributed to by the negligence of the said LIU CHUN WAH.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The 3rd Defendant now seeks a ruling that as the 1st and 2nd Defendants' right to claim an indemnity or contribution is a statutoryright provided by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19(1)(c)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap. 23</a> and as that provision does not include tortfeasors who have already been sued and found not liable in respect of the samedamage then the 1st and 2nd Defendants claim should be dismissed because, it is argued, the 3rd Defendant was sued and was not foundliable.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The relevant parts of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19</a> are as follows :-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"19(1)where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort .............</p>        <p class="quote"> </p>    </blockquote>    <table cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="8%" valign="top" class="quote">                <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">(c)</p>            </td>            <td width="92%" valign="middle" class="quote">any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable inrespect of the same damage whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise ....."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The 3rd Defendant's argument that he is excluded from the classes of persons contemplated as potential contributory tortfeasors becausehe was originally sued in this action and it was later dismissed against him depends on whether or not the wording of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sec. 19(1)(c)</a> extends to those persons who were sued and found not liable, not on the merits of the case, but because of a time limitation provision.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Mr. Sakhrari Q.C., who appeared in this preliminary issue on behalf of the 3rd Defendant, has cited an authority which he contendsis on all fours with the facts of this case and that is the House of Lords decision in: <u>George Wimpey &amp; Co. Ltd v B.O.A.C.</u><sup>(1)</sup></p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> In that case an employee of B.O.A.C. was injured when a vehicle owned by his employer collided with another owned by George Wimpey&amp; Co. Ltd. He bought an action against both the Company and B.O.A.C. and the former served a third-party notice on B.O.A.C. claiminga contribution. Because B.O.A.C. was a public authority it had special protection under the Limitation Act and the employee's actionagainst it was dismissed as being statute barred.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Wimpey's claim for contribution from B.O.A.C. was refused by the trial judge and they appealed. The Court of Appeal (Denning L.J.dissenting) dismissed the appeal and the matter was taken to the House of Lords where a majority held that the appeal must fail.The English courts were concerned with the identical provision as our Sec. 19(1)(c) but then known in England as Sec. 6(1)(c) ofthe Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935.</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>            <p>In his judgment Viscount Simonds said p.178:-</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The question of construction, as I see it, is whether section 6(1)(c) can, according to its natural meaning, be so interpreted asto admit a claim for contribution by one tortfeasor against another when that other has been sued by the injured person and heldnot liable. I agree with Parker J and Singlehon and Morris L.JJ in thinking that it cannot."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>and further down that page:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It happens in the case under appeal that the reason why the party from whom contribution was claimed was held not liable was becausethe Limitation Act was successfully pleaded. But this is irrelevant to the issue ..... the subsection plainly contemplates two classesonly of persons from whom contribution can be claimed VIZ: those who have been sued and those who have not been sued but would, ifsued, be held liable. If the intention had been to include a third class of persons who having been sued and found not liable, mightyet in hypothetical proceedings be sued a second time and then found liable. I should have expected to find it expressed in clearand appropriate language. Not only is it not so expressed, but on the contrary I find in the words actually used the clear indicationthat the class of persons who 'if sued would have been liable' does not include persons who having been sued have been held not liable."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Lord Tucker joining the majority said this at p.192</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It would, in my view, require very clear language to lead to the conclusion that in addition to the categories consisting of (1)those sued and held liable and (2) those not sued but who, if sued, would have been held liable, there is to be added a third classconsisting of those who have been sued and held not liable but who may now be proved liable in further proceedings. "</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The House of Lords by reason of their majority decision have quite clearly ruled that their intrepretation of Sec. 19(1)(c) is suchthat it excludes from those who can be considered as contributory tortfeasors persons who have been sued but found not liable becausethey successfully invoked a time limitation provision. In the absence of any distinguishing features I would feel bound to rule infavour of the 3rd Defendant on the basis of this authority.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Mumford for the 1st and 2nd Defendants sought to persuade me that it is still open to consider the question as to the time atwhich a hypothetical action must be assumed to have been brought. In other words the expression "who is, or would if sued have beenliable" does not refer to any particular period of time and he went on to urge me to adopt a literal construction and read the expressionto mean "who would, if sued at any time, have been liable" This logically would overcome the limitation restrictions placed on suingthe estate of a deceased person and bring the 3rd Defendant within the provisions of Sec. 19(1)(c).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> With respect, the flaw in this argument is that we are not dealing here with a hypothetical action and we are not dealing with atortfeasor who is in the category of one who if sued would have been liable. The 3rd Defendant in this case was sued and found notliable. The situation has been best summed up by Lord Tucker in the <u>Wimpey</u>  case where at p.191 he said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There are two separate and exclusive categories. If an alleged tortfeasor comes into the first category his liability to make contributionwill be conclusively determined by the result of the suit. If he is in the first category it is immaterial to speculate what hisfate would or might have been if he had fallen into the second category".</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p> </p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The 3rd Defendant falls into that first category and it is outside my province to wonder at what time he should be considered tohave been liable in a hypothetical suit.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. Mumford also sought to distinguish the facts of this case with those before the House of Lords in "Wimpey v B.O.A.C.".<sup>(1)</sup> In that case, he contended, it was the actual tortfeasor who had been sued and found not liable, namely B.O.A.C. In the present caseit was not the tortfeasor who had been sued and found not liable but the administrator of his estate. Mr. Mumford argued that Section19(1)(c) may well be construed so as to provide a tortfeasor who has been unsuccessfully sued with a defence to a claim for contributionbut such a defence is not available to the tortfeasor's administrator. It is an unusual and imaginitive submission but in my opinionit must fail. What the 1st and 2nd Defendants have been seeking in this action is contribution from the 3rd Defendant in respectof the Plaintiff's claim. They rely for this on Section 19(1)(c). But this provision does not speak of administrators it refers onlyto tortfeasors, yet, the 1st and 2nd Defendants claim contribution from the administrator of a tortfeasor. Logically, if the administratorof a tortfeasor's estate is liable under Sec. 19 (1)(c) to be subjected to a claim for contribution he is entitled to the same defencesthat the tortfeasor has been geven. In addition I do not consider it is correct to submit that tho tortfeasor has not been sued andfound not liable. After his death he was sued in the only way known to the law namely against the administrator of his estate andI find that this argument also fails.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The final point made by Mr. Mumford is that the 3rd Defendant has been sued and found liable and refers me to the other High Courtaction in which the 3rd Defendant commenced proceedings against the 1st and 2nd Defendants which action was settled on the basisthat the 3rd Defendant accepted 45%o contributory negligence.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I cannot agree that that action can constitute the 3rd Defendant as having been sued. He was the Plaintiff at the outset and wasnever the subject of any counterclaim or set-off. Even if I am wrong on this point I do not consider that the other proceedings were"in respect of the same damage". The damage in that action concerned the death of LIU CHUN WAH. The damage in the present actionis the death of his pillion passenger, KWAN SHING YIP. It is a clear and unambiguous condition in Sec. 19(1)(c) that the tortfeasorto be liable for contribution must have been sued in respect of the same damage and this third contention must join the fate of it'spredecessors.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> I accordingly rule that the 1st and 2nd Defendants are not entitled to any indemnity or contribution from the 3rd Defendant in respectof the Plaintiff's claim and he will be entitled to judgment with costs to be taxed if not agreed. I consider this matter was fitfor additional Counsel and I so certify.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(P.
