Theaction started life as two sets of proceedings in the Labour Tribunal.  They were consolidated and altogether 165 claims were transferredto the High Court.  By a consent order, directions were given for the trial involving three âleadâ plaintiffs namely, Dr LeungKa Lau, Dr Choi Chi Yee and Dr So Yung Pak.  The remaining plaintiffs and the Hospital Authority expressly agreed to be bound byâany determinations of law or principle in the lead casesâ.  It is to be noted that the plaintiffs form but a small percentageof the total number of doctors actually employed by the Hospital Authority which numbered some 4600 at the date of the hearing.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In broad terms, the plaintiffsâ claims comprise (1) a claim under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57">Cap. 57</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ) in respect of rest days and holidays in respect of which they had been deprived since 15 March 1996,this date being six years before the commencement of the proceedings; and (2) a contractual claim for overtime worked for the sameperiod.  The lead plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and, further or alternatively, compensation consequent upon the declaratoryrelief sought or damages to be assessed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  By a judgment dated 1 March 2006, Stone J ordered the Hospital Authority to pay the lead plaintiffs damages to be assessed for theclaims for lost rest days and statutory and public holidays for the full six-year period preceding the commencement of the actionbut dismissed their overtime claim.  The judge also dismissed the lead plaintiffsâ claim for declaratory judgment and their claimfor time-off in lieu.  He further directed that the assessment of quantum should proceed on the basis of a reasonable evidentialassessment of the hours actually worked by the lead plaintiffs on their past rest days and statutory and public holidays at the thenprevailing monthly salary, credit to be given for any half day off or other administrative relief already given to the particularplaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  As at the date of the appeal hearing, this court was informed that the Hospital Authority had reached a settlement with 65 of the165 plaintiffs in respect of past claims and, further, that agreement had also been reached with approximately 90% of the doctorsemployed by the Hospital Authority not involved in these proceedings.  At the conclusion of the appeal hearing judgment was reservedwhich we now give.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Background</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Prior to 1 December 1991, doctors employed in the public sector in Hong Kong were civil servants whose employment was governed bythe Civil Service Regulations (âCSRsâ) and to which employment the Ordinance had no application, the Government not being subjectto the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Subsequent to the Report on the Delivery of Medical Services in Hospitals commissioned by the Government in 1985 to review the managementof the public hospital system and the public consultation which followed, a new statutory body namely, the Hospital Authority, wasestablished on 1 December 1990 pursuant to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113" class="autolink_findacts">Hospital Authority Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113">Cap. 113</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ) for the purpose of managing and controlling public hospitals and for the provision therein of hospitalservices.  The Hospital Authority is almost entirely funded by the Government with funds appropriated for that purpose by the LegislativeCouncil.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Doctors serving in the public sector at the time of the establishment of the Hospital Authority could elect to transfer to the HospitalAuthority if they so wished on new terms of service.  The evidence before the judge was that previous non-salary benefits were translatedinto a cash amount which, thereafter, became part of the monthly remuneration.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Hospital Authority employs, very roughly, half of the doctors in active practice in Hong Kong.  The judge observed (at Â§ 26of the judgment) that since its establishment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">26.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦the demand for public health services in Hong Kong has grown at a very considerable rate, and â¦public hospitals have faced anextremely heavy workload â¦ as seen from the fact that the overwhelming majority (93%) of patients were being handled by the publichealth sector â¦ public hospital doctors were facing escalating health demands also due to other factors : an ageing population,enhanced public expectation on service quality and medical advancement.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Dr Leung began his medical career as a Government doctor serving on civil service terms.  Upon his election for transfer to theHospital Authority after its establishment, he was offered new contractual terms effective 1 September 1992.  Dr Choi and Dr So becameinterns on 1 July 1997 and 1 July 1999 respectively and after completion of their respective internship were offered employment asdoctors by the Hospital Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Dr Leung and Dr Choi are still employed by the Hospital Authority but Dr So resigned on 18 May 2004 and is now in private practice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Broadly speaking, the plaintiffsâ claims can be categorised as (1) the rest day claim, (2) the holiday claim, and (3) the overtimeclaim.  But as the judge explained in his judgment, there is a degree of overlap within these categories.  As appreciation of theâon callâ system is required for a proper understanding this overlap, it would be convenient to digress at this point with abrief description of that system.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The âon callâ system</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  As Dr Ko, Director (Professional Services and Human Resources) of the Hospital Authority observed, the on call system âis foundall over the world for the purpose of facilitating 24-hour patient careâ.  It was devised to ensure that there are doctors availableafter normal working hours to meet patientsâ needs: thus public hospitals are manned 24 hours a day and seven days a week but asa result, exceptional demands are put on doctors who face an extremely heavy workload and who have to work unsociable hours.  Nevertheless,as the judge remarked, it is an inherent part of the practice of medicine in a public hospital environment worldwide.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In Hong Kong the system operates by way of monthly rosters, known as âcall listsâ.  Being on call is generally in addition tonormal hours of work.  The judge found that on any given day, there is more than one doctor in a department, usually of differingseniority, who would be âon callâ.  The most junior doctor in the unit usually is the âfirst tierâ of call (âfirst callâ),whilst more senior doctors are put on higher tiers of call (âsecond callâ, âthird callâ etc).  A doctor rostered on âfirstcallâ is expected to stay within the hospital compound.  That is sometimes referred to as âresident callâ.  A doctor rosteredon âsecond callâ may or may not be expected to stay within the hospital compound, depending on the hospital department, whilsta doctor rostered on âthird callâ must remain contactable via pager or mobile phone and be available at the hospital within 30minutes of being called.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  There is clearly a distinction between being on âresident callâ and being on ânon-resident callâ: in this judgment the descriptionon âresident callâ is used exclusively to refer to a doctor who is expected to stay within the hospital compound whether on âfirstcallâ or âsecond callâ.  And, like the judge, the description âon callâ is used to refer to the period after normal workinghours until the beginning of work the next day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Several scenarios could arise when a doctor is on non-resident call: he may not be contacted at all or he may have to give adviceover the telephone without actually having to return to the hospital or he may have to return to the hospital.  It can readily beappreciated that the meaning of âworkâ in the overall context of the âon callâ system became a central issue in the proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In the context of the claims relating to rest days and holidays there is the further related issue of how âworkâ performed onthose days should be quantified for the purpose of reckoning compensation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  This would be a convenient point at which to outline the Honorarium Scheme, the principal administrative measure adopted to addressthe special demands put on public doctors having to work consistently unusually long hours to ensure adequate patient care.  Anotheradministrative measure was what was known as âthe compensatory leave schemeâ which will also be referred to below.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Honorarium Scheme</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  A comprehensive account of the origin and development of the Honorarium Scheme is to be found in Â§Â§ 76-101 of the judgment towhich reference should be made.  For present purposes, it is sufficient to highlight the following matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The genesis of the honorarium can be seen from an exchange of letters in 1988 between the chairman of the Government DoctorsâAssociation and the Chief Secretary.  In September 1988, with the reorganisation of the Medical &amp; Health Department, the impendingestablishment of the future Hospital Authority, the escalating problem of staff shortages and loss of experienced staff, Dr DicksonChang, the then chairman of the Government Doctorsâ Association made a submission to the then Chief Secretary for better workingconditions.  In stating the Associationâs case for, <i>inter alia</i>, an independent pay scale in the Civil Service for Government doctors, Dr Chang made the following points:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">The medical and dental officer grade is distinct from the other professional grades in many aspects:</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦3)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="86%" valign="top" class="quote">Long working hours averaging 80 per week and these overtime work are not compensated in any way </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦5)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="86%" valign="top" class="quote">Working on all days of the year irrespective of whether, holidays, festivals and weekends thus sacrificing a lot [of] social lifeand causes tremendous disruption on family life.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Under the heading âOvertime pay/Professional allowanceâ, it was stated that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">Government doctors in the hospital units work on average over 80 Hours per week i.e. nearly double that of the other civil servicecolleagues who were 44 Hours weekly, not to mention the differences in enjoying public holidays and weekends.

As for the holiday claim, it was said that if required to âworkâ on a holiday, the employerhad a statutory obligation to provide an alternative holiday within the time prescribed by the Ordinance and failure to do so shouldalso result in time-off in lieu.  In either case, if it were to prove impracticable for the Hospital Authority to grant time-offin lieu because of unacceptable disruption to the health care system, the plaintiffs seek cash compensation.  The âRest Day BasicClaimâ and the âHoliday Basic Claimâ in the table set out above reflect, in monetary terms, what each of the lead plaintiffsclaim they have lost by having had to work on rest days and holidays.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The overtime claim is more involved.  The plaintiffsâ case has been formulated on the basis that their normal working week consistsof 44 hours only, those being their âconditioned hoursâ and hours âworkedâ beyond those hours qualify as overtime which shouldbe recompensed by time-off in lieu.  As is apparent from the table, there are three separate claims for overtime.  The âGeneralOvertime Claimâ is in respect of overtime worked beyond normal hours on a regular working day that is neither a rest day nor aholiday.  The âRest Day Overtime Claimâ and the âHoliday Overtime Claimâ are best illustrated by an example.  If rosteredto be âon callâ for more than 8 hours on a rest day or holiday, the excess hours would fall under the overtime claim for therest day or holiday as the case may be.  So if a plaintiff had been rostered to be on 24-hour call on a rest day, in addition tothe claim in respect of the lost day, there would also be a claim for 16 hours of overtime for that rest day.  The plaintiffsâcase throughout is that simply being rostered to be âon callâ is equivalent to being âat workâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The judge disagreed: he held that a doctor who was not actually required to return to the hospital even if he was required to giveadvice over the telephone without returning to the hospital was not âat workâ or âworkingâ, whether for the purposes of calculatingâovertimeâ or for determining whether there had been any deprivation of rest days or holidays.  Again, the primary relief soughtis time-off in lieu with cash compensation as a last resort.  For employees who have left the Hospital Authority, cash compensationwas said to be the only practicable remedy.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I propose to deal first with the overtime claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The overtime claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The issue that arises is whether the judge was correct in holding that the plaintiffs have no contractual entitlement to be recompensedfor overtime worked, whether the compensation takes the form of time-off in lieu or overtime allowance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The various letters of appointment of the lead plaintiffs uniformly refer to the appointment being upon the terms and conditionsof the relevant appointment letter, the Hospital Authorityâs Human Resources Policies Manual (âHRPMâ) and the Hospital Authorityâsrules and regulations, subject nevertheless to the relevant appointment letter being the prevailing document and the Hospital Authorityâsright to revise the HRPM and the rules and regulations from time to time.  Thus, in determining the plaintiffsâ contractual entitlement(if any) for overtime work, it will be necessary to consider not only the letters of appointment but also the relevant provisionsof the HRPM and the rules and regulations.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The letters of appointment</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  There are a number of letters of appointment so far as the lead plaintiffs are concerned in relation to their respective appointmentsas senior medical officers and medical officers.

For Dr Choi and Dr So, there are a number of appointment letters as each contract wasfor a term of three years only.

Although Mr Chang SC who appeared for the plaintiffs criticised the judge for considering those lettersin isolation, I do not consider the criticism justified.  As is clear from Â§ 110, the judge plainly appreciated that the employmentoffered was subject to the HRPM and the rules and regulations which he went on to consider.  The judge was stating no more than thaton the face of the letters, there was nothing to suggest that overtime would be compensated for and remarked that the reference inthe second and third formulations to âa fixed rate honorarium â¦in recognition of the additional work doneâ pointed to the contrary.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  As to the judgeâs finding that the conditioned hours of the plaintiffs are 44 hours per week, there can be doubt as to its correctnessfor contracts containing the first or second formulations set out in Â§ 33 above.  For contracts containing the third formulationset out in Â§ 33 which made no mention of the number of working hours per week, the finding is nonetheless sustainable given thereference to overtime which necessarily has to be premised on the existence of conditioned hours.  The internsâ contracts whichreflect the fourth formulation set out in Â§ 34 for my part, are significantly different: no hours are mentioned nor is there anyreference to overtime.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">HRPM</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  As Chapter E4 is of central importance, it would be convenient to set out the relevant provisions using the version that was inplace for the period from November 1994 to 21 November 2002:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="10%" valign="top" class="quote"><b>E4.1</b></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote"><b><u>Definition of Overtime</u></b></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="10%" valign="top" class="quote">E4.1.1</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">Overtime is defined as work undertaken over and above an employeeâs conditioned hours of work (as defined in Chapter B2) regardlessof the time of day at which it is undertaken.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="10%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="10%" valign="top" class="quote"><b>E4.2</b></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote"><b><u>General Principles</u></b></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="10%" valign="top" class="quote">E4.2.1</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="83%" valign="top" class="quote">Overtime may be undertaken only when it is unavoidable.

Theplaintiffs acknowledge (and this is not controversial) that they do not qualify for overtime allowance provided for in that chapterbecause eligibility is restricted to employees in ranks whose scale maximum is on or below Point 25 of HGPS.  The scale minimum forthe most junior doctor is above that.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In summary, the plaintiffsâ submissions are as follows.  Since, as the judge found, their âconditioned hoursâ are 44 hoursper week, work undertaken over and above conditioned hours of work must rank as âovertimeâ.  Applying the general principlesstated in section E4.2, specifically section E4.2.3, the plaintiffs should be recompensed by time-off in lieu.  Therefore, the plaintiffsargue that they are <i>entitled</i> to time-off in lieu for overtime worked and if it does not suit the Hospital Authority to grant them time-off because of operationaldifficulties, then the plaintiffs must be compensated in some other way for having been deprived of what they say is their contractualentitlement.  I pause here to observe that section E4.2.2 would appear to preclude any person in the position of Head of Departmentto âovertime claimâ.  Whether any of the plaintiffs held that position at any time is not known but their submissions took noaccount of this provision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As to the form of compensation, it was said that it could take the form of damages i.e. cash compensation or, alternatively, byanalogy with the provisions in the HRPM, it should be treated in the same way as accruement of any untaken annual leave due to operationalneeds by allowing the employee to put it in a sinking fund or alternatively allowing it to be encashed based on the wages prevailingat the time of encashment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Digressing for the moment, I should deal briefly with the suggested alternative by analogy with accruement of annual leave which,despite its superficial appeal, is not a real alternative.  The accruement and encashment of annual leave provisions in the HRPMoperate within fairly stringent parameters.  Suffice it to say that the maximum leave accumulation is capped at 32 days for an employeewith less than 10 yearsâ service or 46 days for those with more, not to mention that âexceptional approvalâ by the HCE or CEis required for carrying over unused annual leave beyond one year even if due to operational needs.  Looking simply at the generalovertime claim of the lead plaintiffs, what is involved in Dr Leungâs case, for example, is 22,200 hours.  That translates into2775 days or roughly 7Â½ years.  In my view, the proposed alternative remedy is self-evidently impracticable, leaving no real alternativeto what, fundamentally, is a claim for monetary compensation.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Rules and regulations</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The judge found (and it is not challenged) that what is known as the Honorarium Scheme (considered in Â§Â§ 18 - 23 above) formedpart of the rules and regulations to which the plaintiffsâ employment was subject.  Mr Chang SC sought to challenge the judgeâsfinding (at Â§ 137) that the lead plaintiffs were entitled to payment of the honorarium on the basis that the second and third formulationsset out in Â§ 33 above referred to the payment being discretionary.  While those formulations may have been infelicitously worded,I agree with the judge that it is abundantly clear from the Circulars issued by the Hospital Authority that a doctor working in aneligible unit (and the judge found the lead plaintiffs to have been such which finding has not been challenged) is <i>entitled</i> to be paid the honorarium at the applicable scale.  The Hospital Authority has no discretion in that regard.  See, for example, Circular40/96 at Â§ 7 (set out in Â§ 23 above).  That provision is repeated in the Hospital Authorityâs Human Resources AdministrationManual (âHRAMâ) compiled to be read in conjunction with the HRPM and designed to implement the HRPM.  See HRAM, Chapter E2 Â§Â§48, 49 and 52.  In so far as it is suggested that regard should not be had to the HRAM, not having been specifically mentioned bythe judge as part of the relevant contractual materials, I disagree.  The HRAM clearly forms part of the Hospital Authorityâs rulesand regulations.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Construction of the contractual materials</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  As the judge observed, the correct approach is that set out by Lord Hoffmann NPJ in <i>Jumbo King Ltd v Faithful Properties Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%204%20HKC%20707" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 4 HKC 707</a> at 726D which I gratefully adopt.  Looking at the broader canvas of all the relevant contractual materials, the salient parts ofwhich have been set out and considered at some length above together with the relevant legal and factual background, I have no difficultyin coming to the conclusion that the judge was correct in dismissing the overtime claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The judge had rejected the plaintiffsâ construction of the HRPM on the basis that the final sentence in section E4.4.3 means thatdoctors who do not qualify for overtime allowance also do not qualify for time-off in lieu.  In my view, what needs to be consideredfirst is the effect of section E4.2.3.  Although Chapter E4 of the HRPM is headed âOvertime Allowanceâ and, <i>prima facie</i>, would not appear to apply to an employee who is not eligible to overtime allowance, there is nothing in the first sentence of sectionE4.2.3 to restrict its application to a specific category of employees.  Rather, it is written in such a way as to be of generalapplication regardless of rank.  I am inclined to the view that it must be so read.  I propose, first of all, to consider how sectionE4.2.3 operates as regards an eligible employee i.e. an employee who qualifies for overtime allowance which, by definition, cannotinclude the plaintiffs before considering how it operates <i>vis-a vis</i> the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Section E4.2.3 is not free-standing in the sense that it has to be read in conjunction with, <i>inter alia</i>, the express provisions for time-off in lieu contained in Chapter E4 of the HRAM:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><b><i><u>Time Off in Lieu</u></i></b></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">3.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">Time off in lieu should be granted as compensation for approved overtime work, based on actual duty hours that have been worked whichshould exclude meal breaks, travelling time to and from employeeâs home to working places.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">4.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">Residual hours not eligible for overtime allowance should not be eligible for time off in lieu.

However, Â§ 5 of Chapter E4 of the HRAM prescribes a timeframe forthe taking of time-off in lieu, namely, within six months of the date of the overtime worked.  The question which arises is whether,as a matter of construction, that timeframe is meant to apply to the second time reference to be found in section E4.2.3 of the HRPM(i.e. the âlater dateâ) or whether that date is at large and not constrained by the prescribed timeframe of six months.  I wouldobserve, at this stage, that the drafting of some of the provisions of the HRPM and the HRAM could be said to be less than satisfactory. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the imperfections, one has to endeavour to discern a construction that would give best effect to everypart of the provisions and consistent with common sense.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  <i>Prima facie</i>, it strikes one as highly unlikely that the âlater dateâ was intended to be at large.  For one thing, for a statutory body likethe Hospital Authority with so many employees, it would result in administrative chaos, particularly as overtime work for some ofits employees is almost bound to be a daily occurrence.  It is also relevant to note the administrative provisions for the keepingof overtime records in Chapter E4.5 of the HRAM, including the requirement that overtime be reflected in the employeeâs timesheetwhich has to be initialled by the Department Head on a fortnightly basis before routing to the Finance Department for payroll processing. It is reasonable to assume and, it would appear to be logical, that the âoptionâ conferred on the eligible employee by sectionE4.2.3 must be exercised before the overtime allowance would, in the normal course, be paid to him.  Once payment has been effected,the option would lapse.  Therefore it stands to reason that what would be âmutually convenientâ (if at all) must be ascertainedat the time the âoptionâ is exercised.  Further, it is also pertinent to have in mind the purpose of time-off in lieu consideredin Â§ 56 below.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Having regard to all these matters, I am of the view that any time-off in lieu for an eligible employee must be taken (if at all)within the six-month timeframe.  In other words, the âlater dateâ is not large but is to fall within the six-month period.  Onthat analysis, it would follow that the first time reference (i.e. the âreasonable periodâ) mentioned in section E4.2.3 mustbe shorter than the six-month period and before the overtime allowance would normally be paid.  So, if notwithstanding good faithon the part of the Hospital Authority, there were not to be a mutually convenient date within the timeframe of six months, therewould not appear to be any alternative but for the eligible employee to settle for the overtime allowance.  Whilst it might be saidthat to some extent that would impinge on the seemingly unrestricted scope of the option conferred on the eligible employee, it isa result that would avoid administrative chaos and, at the same time, give meaning and effect to every part of the provisions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Insofar as an eligible employee is to be given compensation in the form of cash (i.e. overtime allowance), there are elaborate provisionsregulating the bases on which and the rates at which overtime is recompensed.  For example, section E4.4.4 provides for payment ata reduced rate for standing by at the eligible employeeâs place of work and expressly excludes compensation for standing by athome.  As illustrated by the examples in Appendix 1E4(1) to Chapter E4 of the HRAM, the effect of the first two sentences of sectionE4.4.3 Chapter E4 of the HRAM is that number of hours that qualify for overtime allowance would invariably be fewer than the numberof hours that qualify for time-off in lieu.  The upshot of all this is that not all the hours that qualify for time-off in lieu wouldqualify for cash compensation.  In other words, if time-off in lieu could not be granted for operational reasons, the so-called ârightâdoes not mature into a right to be paid for the total number of hours that qualify for time-off in lieu, not to mention that overtimerates are not necessarily greater than the equivalent hourly rate calculated by reference to conditioned hours and basic monthlysalary.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The significance of the foregoing analysis is that in the case of an eligible employee, the so-called ârightâ to time-off inlieu flowing from the first sentence of section E4.2.3 is not open-ended but would, after the reasonable period, mature into an entitlementor ârightâ to be paid an overtime allowance.  Insofar as an eligible employee may opt to take time-off in lieu after the reasonableperiod, he may do so before the overtime allowance is paid if there is a mutually convenient date within the time frame of six months. I can conceive of no cause of action arising from his so-called ârightâ to time-off in lieu if there is no mutually convenientdate during that period absent bad faith on the part of the Hospital Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The difficulty with section E4.2.3 as regards non-eligible employees is that it is wholly silent as what is to happen if it wereoperationally impracticable to grant such employees time-off in lieu within a reasonable period.  Mr Chang SCâs position is thatif it were to be impracticable for the employee to be granted time-off within the âreasonable periodâ, it remains a right totime-off at any time in the future period until time-off is actually granted or compensated for in cash.  But such a constructionwould have the effect of conferring on such an employee rights that are greater or more extensive than those accorded to an eligibleemployee.  As explained below, that appears to be diametrically opposed to the position under the CSRs on which Mr Chang SC reliesand the underlying rationale of overtime allowances under the CSRs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In support of his contention that doctors have always had that right even under the CSRs, Mr Chang referred to CSR 664 on whichsection E4.2.3 was modelled.  That provision reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="6%" valign="top" class="quote">664.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">Overtime should normally be compensated by time off in lieu.  Where this is, or is likely to be, impracticable within one month ofthe date on which the overtime is worked, an Overtime Allowance â¦may be paid â¦â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">(The version of CSR 664 that is to be found in the hearing bundles set out above comes from the 2001 edition.  For present purposes,it will be assumed that the version in place at the time of the establishment of the Hospital Authority was substantially the same.) I do not consider that the CSRs can assist the plaintiffs.  In my view, they have the opposite effect.  In their 1971 Report, theHong Kong Salaries Commission considered that the principle that overtime worked should be offset by time-off, when possible, tobe âa basic principle to regulate overtime arrangementsâ.  See Â§ 319 of the 1971 Report.  The Commission saw nothing wrong withthe principle but noted that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ in practice, there are only rare occasions, when the grant of overtime offset is âpracticableâ.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Nothing in CSR 664 suggests that if time-off in lieu cannot be given within the stipulated period, the overtime worked would continueto remain a right to time-off even after the expiration of the stipulated period.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In this connection, the rationale for overtime allowances is also relevant.  Historically, under the CSRs, the principle on whicheligibility for overtime allowance was regulated was either related to the character of the appointment, mainly affecting apprentices,trainees and the like, or limited by a particular salary level.  It was considered that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">there is some salary point above which there is a fundamental incongruity with the receipt of cash allowances for overtime.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">See the Hong Kong Salaries Commission Report 1971, Â§Â§ 321 and 325.  Some 10 years later, Â§ 3.6 of the 1982 Standing CommissionâsReport on Civil Service Salaries recorded that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Having regard to private sector evidence, we consider that generally it is not appropriate for ranks performing middle or higher managementfunctions to be eligible for overtime allowance.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a>That accords with the position at the time the Honorarium Scheme was introduced.  The account given in Â§Â§</a> 19 - 20 above underscores the fact the public doctors (being of the middle and higher ranks) were not entitled to any cash compensationfor overtime under the CSRs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The conundrum of what is to happen when time-off cannot be granted to an employee who does not qualify for overtime allowance isresolved when section E4.2.3 is read together with the Honorarium Scheme which was already in place.  The Honorarium Scheme as wellas the HRPM formed part of the plaintiffsâ contractual entitlement.  As noted above, whilst under CSR 664 a Government doctor wasin theory entitled to time-off in lieu for overtime, in practice, it was recognized as long ago as 1971 that happened rarely becauseof operational difficulties.  It would be idle to suggest that the overtime burden on public doctors had eased by the time the doctorsmade their case for the payment of honoraria in 1988/1989 referred to in Â§ 19 above.  Dr Changâs letter shows the contrary.  Itis clear that the Honorarium Scheme came into being in recognition of the long hours required of public doctors and âto recompensethe officers involved who are <i>not</i> entitled to earn overtime allowances under the normal rulesâ. (<i>emphasis added</i>)  It differed from the regimen of the overtime allowance inasmuch as the honoraria were fixed rates for various categories of medicalofficers.  At the time the Scheme was introduced, it represented a meaningful percentage of the basic salary of a doctor entitledto such payment.  See Â§ 20 above.  The fact is that the amounts have not kept pace with inflation and salary adjustments over theyears and have since become âderisoryâ.  But that is another issue and cannot alter the fundamentals upon which the HonorariumScheme was introduced and implemented and which Scheme forms an integral part of the plaintiffsâ contracts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In my view, the fixed rate honoraria did not have the effect of removing or replacing the basic principle regulating overtime workencapsulated in the first sentence of CSR 664, now section E4.2.3.  However, the two are neither incompatible nor mutually exclusive:they operate in tandem.  The Honorarium Scheme effectively altered the normal rules relating to overtime allowance and introducedan entirely different regime applicable to staff entitled to be paid a fixed rate honoraria, separate from that for staff who qualifyfor overtime allowance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  It is also important not to lose sight of the purpose time-off in lieu is meant to serve: to provide respite for an employee whohad lost his break and an opportunity to recuperate from the stress and strain that work normally entails.  Where time-off cannotbe offered within a reasonable time of the overtime worked, the point of granting time-off in lieu would be lost.  This explainsthe âreasonable periodâ requirement.  So, if in any particular case time-off in lieu within a reasonable period could not begranted, that would be the end of the matter.  In my view, it is not, and does not ripen into, a right as would âentitleâ theemployee to insist on time-off in lieu in the future without time constraints or to compensation in lieu because the element of compensationhad already been taken care of by the fixed rate honoraria payment.  The fact that a parallel provision is missing from the 1991version of the HRMP does not detract from the analysis given the rationale for the Honorarium Scheme and the wording of the firstsentence in E4.2.3 which effectively replicates the first sentence of CSR 664.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  I now turn to consider section E4.4.3 of the HRPM.  For ease of reference, I set it out again:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="8%" valign="top" class="quote">E4.4.3</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="85%" valign="top" class="quote">Overtime work is payable after one hourâs work either at the start or at the finish of a shift.  Thereafter, overtime is payablefor the actual time worked rounded off to the nearest half-hour.  No time-off in lieu will be recompensed if the overtime does notqualify for Overtime Allowance.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  A great deal of time was spent on the meaning of the final sentence of that section.  As the judge explained, that sentence firstappeared in the November 1991 version of the HRPM under the heading âEligibilityâ as a freestanding section<i>.</i> In the 1994 amendments to the HRPM, this section was moved and added to what had been E4.4.2.  The amalgamated section was redesignatedE4.4.3.  In the court below, leading counsel then appearing for the plaintiffs contended that the change constituted a âfundamentalchangeâ in approach.  As I understand it, the contention then was that the amendments effectively removed any obstacle to the doctorsclaiming a right to time-off in lieu.  In that connection, the judge found that no one regarded the 1994 amendments as effectingany change in the regime as it was applicable to doctors.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  In this court, Mr Chang SC (who did not appear below) adopted a different approach from his predecessor.  As noted above, his positionwas that the doctors have always had a right to time-off in lieu even under the CSRs and it remains the position today, the natureof that right being that set out in Â§ 51 above.  But as explained above, CSR 664 had no such effect.  In short, the last sentenceof section E4.4.3 is of little assistance to the plaintiffs if (as is my view) they fail to get home on section E4.2.3.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In conclusion I would dismiss the plaintiffsâ overtime claim but I would reiterate that, in my view, the first sentence of sectionE4.2.3 does impose a positive obligation on the Hospital Authority to grant time-off in lieu within a âreasonable periodâ ifâoperationally practicableâ in respect of overtime performed by those who do not qualify for overtime allowance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The rest day claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  As employer, the Hospital Authority is required by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17(1)</a> of the Ordinance to grant every employee not less than 1 rest day in every period of 7 days.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19(1)</a> prohibits him from requiring an employee to work on any of his rest days but, under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19(2)</a>, he may require the employee to work if it is necessary to do so because of a breakdown of machinery or plant or other unforeseenemergency.  In that event, the employee has to be given a rest day in substitution within 30 days thereafter.  âRest dayâ isdefined in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">a continuous period of not less than 24 hours during which an employee is entitled â¦to abstain from working for his employer.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">It was common ground that every Sunday was to be the relevant rest day for the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  By mutual agreement, an employee may work on his rest day.  See <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20.</a>  In such a case, unlike statutory holidays provided for under section 39, there is no prohibition of payment in lieu of the grantof a rest day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The judge held that the Hospital Authority was in breach of its statutory obligations as regards such of the plaintiffs who hadto be on resident call on a rest day or, if on non-resident call, had to return to work.  The appeal under this head relates to thejudgeâs ruling (1) that doctors on non-resident call on rest days were not âat workâ and had not been deprived of their restday unless they had to return to the hospital to work, and (2) that a doctor who was required to attend the hospital to perform hisduties during a rest day should only be compensated by reference to the number of hours spent in the hospital.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  As the judge explained, doctors who were rostered on non-resident call would be subject to the following constraints: (a) he mustremain within a distance of 30 minutes from the hospital; (b) he must not drink alcohol; and (c) he must remain mentally ready. Apart from those constraints, he was essentially free to carry on with his social and family life.  Doctors on non-resident calltherefore fall into the following categories: (1) those rostered to be on call but is not actually called or contacted at all; (2)those contacted by telephone to render advice who may then have to decide whether or not to return to the hospital; (3) those whoreturn to the hospital to attend to duties after being contacted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Mr Chang SC argued that underlying the definition of ârest dayâ is the concept of a continuous period of 24 hours where theemployee has a choice to refuse to work for his employer.  It was submitted that the simple fact of being rostered on non-residentcall, thereby becoming subject to the constraints mentioned above, constitutes sufficient disturbance of the rest day particularlyas the doctor so rostered has no choice in the matter.  It was said that in those circumstances he could not be said to have beenâentitledâ to abstain from working on his rest day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The judge considered the concept of âworkâ and concluded that simply by being contactable, a person could not be said to beâat workâ or âworkingâ for the purposes of the Ordinance.  Support for this approach can be found in the decision of theEuropean Court of Justice in <i>Sindicato de Medicos de Assistencia Publica (SIMAP) v Conselleria de Sanidad y Consumo de la Generalidad Valenciana</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20ICR%201116" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] ICR 1116</a> where that court had to consider the concept of âworking timeâ for the purposes of Article 2(I) of Directive 93/104/EC.  It washeld at Â§ 52 of that judgment that time spent on call by doctors in primary health care teams must be regarded in its entirety asworking time if they are required to be present at the health centre but if they must merely be contactable at all times when oncall, only time linked to the actual provision of primary care services must be regarded as working time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In my view, on the question as to what constitutes âworkâ, subject to the qualification below, I agree with the general approachof the judge and his conclusion at Â§ 172 of the judgment that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ a doctor is not âat workâ or âworkingâ simply by virtue of being on call outside his hospital.  Likewise the giving ofa brief advice by telephone ... is not to be thus characterised.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">However, whether the giving of brief telephonic advice without returning to the hospital constitutes âworkâ is, in my view, afact-sensitive matter.  I would not necessarily preclude it from constituting work.  It would depend on the particular circumstancesof each case.  Borrowing the phraseology of the European Court in <i>SIMAP,</i> if the advice rendered amounts to âactual provision of primary care servicesâ, it would constitute âworkâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The further question that arises is whether in the context of the Ordinance, the concepts of âworkâ and ârest dayâ are mutuallyexclusive as was the case with Directive 93/104/EC considered in the SIMAP case where, <i>rest period</i> was defined to mean âany period which is not working timeâ.  Put differently, had the Hospital Authority discharged its statutoryobligation to provide a ârest dayâ simply because, as matters turned out, the doctor did not have to âworkâ?  To be <i>entitled</i> to abstain from working for a continuous period of 24 hours is undeniably a crucial feature of the concept of a rest day.  In viewof the statutory definition of ârest dayâ, I am driven to the conclusion that an employer would not have discharged his statutoryobligation where the employee did not have a choice in the matter and it is only with hindsight that it could be said that he didnot have to work.  It follows that the statutory obligation under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> of the Ordinance is breached in respect of those rostered on non-resident call on their rest day and not only in respect of thosewho, in the event, had âto workâ on a rest day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In my view, in the case of doctors on non-resident call who were not actually contacted, there would have been a breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> although not of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19.</a>  Subject to the exception contained in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19(2)</a>, there would have been a breach of both sections if the doctor had to work on the rest day whether by rendering telephone advicethat objectively could be said to constitute work or by actually returning to the hospital and where <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/113/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19(2)</a> applied, a substituted rest day had not been given within 30 days thereafter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The statutory/public holiday claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  As appears from the schedule to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/149" class="autolink_findacts">General Holidays Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/149">Cap. 149</a>, in addition to Sundays, there are currently 17 days that are general holidays.  12 of those days correspond to statutoryholidays under section 39(1) of the Ordinance.  There is thus a claim relating to statutory holidays under section 39 of the Ordinanceas well as a claim relating to 5 holidays, being general holidays under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/149" class="autolink_findacts">General Holidays Ordinance</a> that are not statutory holidays or Sundays (hereinafter called âpublic holidaysâ).  The distinction is made to highlight thefact that section 40A of the Ordinance which prohibits payment of holiday pay or other sum in lieu of the grant of a holiday appliesto statutory holidays but not to public holidays.  Nor, as noted above, does it apply to rest days.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  In my view, in determining whether there has been a breach of the plaintiffsâ statutory entitlement to statutory/public holidays,the principles applicable to the ârest dayâ entitlement equally apply.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Appropriate relief</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Declaratory relief</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The judge declined to exercise his discretion and refused declaratory relief because he saw no useful purpose in doing so on thebasis that the plaintiffsâ legal entitlements and the Hospital Authorityâs obligations were clear from his judgment.  See Â§244 of the judgment.  The plaintiffs have failed to show that this approach was unwarranted or wrong as a matter of principle.  Asno basis for interfering with the exercise of the judgeâs discretion has been shown, this part of the appeal must fail.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Time-off in lieu</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The judge rejected time-off in lieu as an appropriate remedy for the reasons set out in Â§Â§ 245 - 250 of his judgment.  He considered,<i>inter alia</i>, that an order granting time-off in lieu would be a form of injunctive relief and it had not been shown that damages would not bean adequate remedy.  In my view, that approach cannot be faulted.  Moreover, the reasons for or purpose of granting an employee time-offin lieu which I have considered in Â§ 56 above in the context of overtime equally applies to the concept of rest days and statutory/publicholidays.  In this connection, it is pertinent to note that time constraints are to be found in the Ordinance for substituted restdays and alternative and substituted statutory holidays.  Having regard to the time that has elapsed, it is evident that time-offin lieu now in respect of breaches from as long ago as 1998 cannot serve its intended function and falls to be rejected as a remedyin respect of rest days and statutory/public holidays.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Damages: assessment methodology</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The judge made the following order:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">1.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="89%" valign="top" class="quote">The assessment of quantum of damages should proceed on the basis of a reasonable evidential assessment of the hours actually workedby the plaintiffs on their past rest days and statutory and public holidays and on the basis of the then prevailing monthly salaryof the particular plaintiff in this action. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">2.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="89%" valign="top" class="quote">Credit should be given for any half-day-off or other administrative relief that the defendant already may have given the particularplaintiff.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Mr Changâs central point was the compensation should be calculated by reference to the lost day (being a whole day) and not simplyby reference to the number of hours worked.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The general object of an award of damages is to compensate the claimant for the losses, pecuniary and non-pecuniary, sustained asa result of the tort, in the present case, a breach of statutory duty.  As stated in Â§ 19-003 of McGregor on Damages, 17<sup>th</sup> edition, the claimant is entitled to be put into the same position, as far as money can do it, as he would have been in had the wrongnot been committed.  In a case such as the present where damages are claimed for breach of statutory duty which is not capable ofreasonably precise calculation in money terms, the concept of restoration would not appear to be particularly helpful or appropriate. Rather, the question of compensation is to be approached on the basis of what would be fair reasonable and just for both partiesand not just the plaintiffs, having regard to the breach involved.  In other words, the compensation awarded should, so far as possible,be commensurate with the nature and degree of breach.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Pausing here, it is to be noted that contravention by an employer of either the rest day or statutory holiday obligation is an offence. The Ordinance does not differentiate between the two categories of offences in terms of penalty notwithstanding the prohibitionof payment in lieu for statutory holidays.  Upon conviction each is punishable by a level 5 fine.  See section 63(2)(5) and (7) ofthe Ordinance.  Currently, a level 5 fine attracts a penalty of $50,000.  See <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/221" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/221">Cap. 221</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/221/s113b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 113B</a>, Sch. 8.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  As regards doctors in category (1) referred to in Â§ 64 above, i.e. those who have been rostered on non-resident call but were notactually contacted, in my view, that breach should attract no more than nominal damages.  For those in categories (2) and (3), asexplained earlier in this judgment, whether or not any work was carried out on the particular rest day or holiday is fact-sensitive. It has to be proved by the claimant concerned, but in so doing any whole day off granted under the compensatory leave scheme mustbe taken into account.  Subject to discharging this burden, damages would be recoverable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The next question which is one of considerable difficult is that of quantum.  The two extremes were summarized by the judge at Â§254-255.  I have been much exercised by the question.  The conclusion the judge reached certainly has its attractions.  Whilst itwould appear to be a fair way of calculating compensation for work done, it would not appear to give sufficient recognition to thenature of the statutory duty imposed on an employer by the Ordinance in relation to rest days which is to provide a continuous periodof 24 hours during which the employee is entitled to abstain from working and the purpose that statutory duty is meant to achieve. So, after considerable hesitation, I have to agree with Mr Chang that damages have to be assessed by reference to the âlostâday.  However, the assessment is to be based on the rates of pay prevailing at the time of each breach and not the rates prevailingat the date of the assessment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  For the reasons stated above, I would allow this appeal in part.

Patients in hospitals require medical care at all timesof the day and night, and providing such care requires that medical professionals be available round the clock.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  On-call duty after usual working hours and during holidays is also common among the medical professions, including interns, in everyhospital all over the world. The need to balance patient service, education and personal life of the medical professions, however,has created significant problem.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Traditionally, the problem was tackled by voluntary arrangements between hospitals and doctors. However, in the era of resourcerestraints, the clinical relationship has become more complex. It now involves many more stakeholders who control funds, make policy,and effectively ration services. Lawyers are also involved in important ways.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The number of working hours for the medical professions has become a controversial issue. More so is the question of whether generalon-call duty should be counted as working hours and therefore should be paid or should attract âtime-off in lieuâ and other formof compensation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The judge concluded that only resident on-call duty should be so counted. The judge also concluded that the contractual arrangementbetween doctors and the Hospital Authority, complicated and perhaps the result of kneeâjerk reaction, nevertheless precluded doctorsfrom claiming âtime-off in lieuâ, payment in lieu or other form of compensation for their general on-call duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  The judge took the view that the plaintiffs, under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>, were entitled to their rest days and statutory holidays and in so far as doctors were required to be on call or to work on theirrests days and statutory holidays, they had been deprived of their statutory entitlement and were entitled to be compensated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  The judge ruled that doctors on resident call, i.e. within the hospital compound, were on call at their place of work, and wereworking, for the entire period when they were on such call.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  However, when doctors were on call outside the hospital (non-resident call), and were only required to be contactable, they werenot at work even though they might be giving brief advice by telephone. In such case, a doctor would only be returning to work ifhe was in fact called back to the hospital.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The judge therefore limited the doctorsâ claim for the interference of their rest days and statutory holidays to damages to beassessed on the basis of the hours they had actually been asked to return to work in hospitals by reference to their prevailing salariesat the time of the breach.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  The plaintiffs argue that the judge was wrong. Putting a different construction to the contractual arrangement, they suggest thatalthough they are not entitled to âovertime payâ, they are entitled to âtime-off in lieuâ as compensation for their generalon-call duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  They also suggest that after being âon callâ, irrespective of where such âon callâ duty was performed (resident call ornon-resident call), they should be regarded as having worked âovertimeâ for the entire period when they were on call even ifthey had not actually been called upon to perform any duty, and should be so compensated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  They further suggest that having been âon callâ during rest days and holidays, they should be compensated as if they had beenworking throughout the entire period of the âon callâ time and therefore damages should be assessed by reference to the âlostâday.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  I find the primary submissions of Mr Chang SC, leading counsel for the plaintiffs, that after being âon callâ for one day, thedoctors should be entitled to âovertimeâ for 16 hours, irrespective of where they were on call and whether they had been calledupon to perform any work, startling.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  If Mr Changâs submission is correct, to adopt the words of Mr Huggins SC, âafter being âon callâ for one day, a doctor wouldbe entitled to 2 daysâ âtime-off in lieuâ and if a doctor had been on call on two days in a week, he would be entitled to takethe rest of the week offâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  âOvertimeâ constitutes an extension of the normal working hours, with the same workloads, whereas âduty on callâ is carriedout under conditions different from those under which work within the normal working hours is performed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  When a doctor is âon non-resident callâ and is only required to be contactable, he may be subject to restrictions such as ânotto consume alcoholâ and âto remain with certain distance of the hospitalâ, he is nevertheless free to rest or to pursue otherleisure activities as he wishes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In <i>Cheng Ho Kee &amp; Others v Secretary for Justice</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282006%29%209%20HKCFAR%20705" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2006) 9 HKCFAR 705</a>, the Court of Final Appeal was only required to construe the meaning of âovernight on callâ under the Civil Service Regulations,nevertheless, its reasoning is applicable to the plaintiffsâ claims.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  I wish just to repeat the following excerpt from the judgment of the Chief Justice at p 718 G-H:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">An officer performing âovernight on callâ would not be working.

The Hospital Authority should of course fulfilits statutory obligation by allowing doctors their rest days.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  What we are concerned with is the assessment of reasonable damages to be awarded to doctors who were required to be on call on restdays and holidays.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  The judge has held that a doctor on resident call on a rest day or a statutory holiday must be considered to be at work for theentire day, regardless of how many times he is called, and of how much he actually spends in the wards.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  In my view, the judge was obviously right in drawing a distinction between resident call and non-resident call in that the formeris âworking timeâ whereas the latter is not.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  As pointed by the judge, the call room is not a dormitory, and its facilities are limited and fairly Spartan. It is just a placewithin the hospital compound for doctors to gather to enable them to respond to duty calls more readily.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  The judgeâs decision certainly accords that of the European Court of Justice in <i>Sindicato de Medicos de Asistencia Publica (SIMAP)</i> (supra).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  However, once it is decided that ânon-resident on-call timeâ is not âworking timeâ, there is no logical basis to award damagefor non-resident on call duty when a doctor does not have to respond to any call. There is no work done to justify any compensationby way of damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  A doctor on non resident call who has been called upon to work in the hospital for eight or more hours on a rest day or a holidayshould be recompensed in the same way as one who does not have to respond to any call and is free to rest or pursue other leisureactivities, as suggested by Mr Chang, simply is illogical and unreasonable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  The judge took the view that a fair assessment of quantum was to proceed on the basis of a reasonable evidential assessment of thehours actually worked by doctors on their rest days and holidays, with reference to their then prevailing monthly salary. The judgedeclined to grant the declaratory relief as it served no useful purpose. It was, in my view, a fair exercise of discretion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  The judgeâs approach, though not particularly generous or favourable to the doctors, is logically sounded. I agree with his viewthat it is difficult, if not impossible, to divine another fairer method of any such quantum assessment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  However, I share the concern expressed by Le Pichon JA with regard to doctors on non-resident call, and contacted by telephone torender advice, before deciding whether or not to return to the hospital.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Whether the plaintiffs consider it worthwhile to pursue damages for the telephone advice is a matter for them to decide. Nevertheless,they should be given the chance to prove their claims for damages under this head.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  I agree with the conclusion that Le Pichon JA has reached that doctors contacted by telephone to render advice should be entitledto claim reasonable damages for their âworksâ. However, I am of the view that damages have to be assessed not by reference tothe âlostâ day, but only by reference to the âlostâ time of the day in connection with the telephone contacts. Although thelegislation allows doctors a continuous period of 24 hours rest on their rest days and holiday, a breach of the duty by the HospitalAuthority only entitled them to reasonable damages. Again, in my view, it is not reasonable to award the same damages to doctorswho only gave brief advise over the telephone for perhaps a few minutes as those who worked eight or more hours in the hospital.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  The assessment should be based on the rates of pay prevailing at the time of the breach.  I would only vary the judgeâs orderto the extent indicated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  I also agree with costs order <i>nisi</i> proposed by Le Pichon JA.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Yuen JA:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  This appeal is concerned with the vexed question of recompense for the inordinately long hours worked by doctors in the public service. The Hospital Authority (âHAâ), the doctorsâ employer, does not  dispute that the public health service in Hong Kong has beenchronically undermanned.  The evidence shows very long hours of work over sustained periods, demanding a high degree of physicalstamina and prolonged mental alertness, which would inevitably cause fatigue and frustration in even the most dedicated professional.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Fundamental premises</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  Mr Adrian Huggins  SC leading counsel for the HA has paid tribute to the doctorsâ dedication and professionalism over this extendedperiod of time.  He has however argued that recompense for overtime is fundamentally inconsistent with the culture, ethos and traditionof the medical profession which puts patient care first, whatever the time of day or night, and before the doctorsâ own well-being.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  With respect, it seems to me that that argument confuses the issue.  The doctors are <i>not</i> refusing to work overtime or to be rostered on call.  They are simply asking for recompense for the additional time worked â primarilyby asking that their employer provide for time-off.  The fact that doctors are prepared by virtue of their culture and ethos to attendto patients whenever required does not justify an employer denying them proper recompense for the work they do.  To suggest otherwise,it seems to me, is to take unfair advantage of that culture and ethos.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  As for tradition, although the âtraditionalâ image of a tired doctor struggling to stay on his feet for hours on end to copewith the relentless demands of patient care is one which naturally arouses feelings of admiration for his dedication and professionalism,in my view it is also an unappealing antiquated image which should have no place in an efficient modern community.  Progressive communitiessuch as the European Union provide doctors with maximum working hours and minimum rest times.  In fact the HAâs own Mission Statementalso asserts that its mission is âto provide rewarding, <i>fair</i> and challenging employment to all its staff, in an environment conducive to attracting, motivating and retaining well qualified staffâ(clause A2.4.1(c), H.R.P.M.). (Emphasis added).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  Accordingly, I reject the premise suggested on behalf of the HA that the doctorsâ culture, ethos and tradition should somehowentitle their employer to treat them differently to - and less fairly than - other sectors of its workforce. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  I would also comment that the fact that the employer is largely publicly funded should <i>not</i> have any bearing on the courtâs consideration of the issues in the litigation or its result.  If that fact is to be of any relevanceat all, then in my view it is that in an employment dispute (which this is), one should assume that a publicly funded employer wouldnot have intended to discriminate against or exploit any sector of its workforce, and indeed this has been specifically articulatedin the Mission Statement which I have mentioned.  It is not within the courtâs province to try to resolve problems such as theHA not having employed enough doctors to cover those who should have been given time-off but who were not.  If the doctors have certainrights, the court cannot trammel its judgment because of financial implications for their employer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">History of pertinent features</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  Before dealing with the issues, it is pertinent to point out the following features which have led and which are relevant to thispiece of litigation.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  First, doctors in the public service were originally employed under the Civil Service Regulations.  The effect of that, and theirranking within the service, meant that they were not entitled to any overtime pay. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Now generally it is not unusual in employment situations for personnel in senior positions not to be given overtime pay.  I supposethat is because in those positions, they are regarded as being able to regulate their own time for the tasks in hand, and if theyhave to stay behind usual office hours or bring work home, then that is because they have failed  more or less in their own time-taskmanagement. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  However those considerations do not apply to public doctors.  To take a simple example, the doctor who is required to be on residentcall at a hospital - however efficient he is - simply cannot leave before the end of his call list day.  And obviously patients cannotbe brought home like papers to work on after some downtime with the family.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  It was therefore not surprising that when public doctors became increasingly overworked at the end of the 1980's, many âvotedwith their feetâ and left the service.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Secondly, it would appear that the Honorarium Scheme was originally intended as a short-term measure.   At the end of 1988 the GovernmentDoctors Association raised calls for a pay scale independent of the Civil Service or the provision of a professional allowance totake into account the difficulties particular to their work.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  It is apparent from the letter dated 5 December 1988 from the Secretary for Health and Welfare to the Chairman of the GovernmentDoctors Association that the government recognized that public doctorsâ terms of service required improvement.  However the administrationâsresponse was that the doctorsâ proposals</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">could not be pursued <i>in the short term</i> because of their far-reaching implications for the civil service as a whole and because their basic concepts will require very detailedexamination and justification which, inevitably, must be time-consumingâ.  (Emphasis added).  </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">The administration considered that proposals that could be âimplemented quicklyâ included the Honorarium Scheme.  The letter endedas follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">In framing the above proposals, the Administration has been conscious of the need to provide improvements for government doctors assoon as possible.  Our first priority, therefore, is to bring in those improvements which can be implemented fairly quickly.  Asregards those of your proposals which have much wider implications, I hope you will understand that, while we very much value theservice of government doctors and wish to do our best to alleviate the problems they face in their work as soon as possible, themore complicated issues cannot be implemented in the short-term and will need to be given further examinationâ. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  Since then, however, the âshort-termâ measure of the Honorarium Scheme - which were at realistic rates at the time of its inception- has continued for nearly 20 years.  This is even though the Administrationâs argument of â far-reaching implications for thecivil service as a wholeâ no longer had any relevance after the public health service was hived off from the Civil Service withthe creation of the HA in 1990-1. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  Thirdly, with transfer to the HA, the doctors became employees rather than civil servants.  At the same time, in 1990, the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> was amended to apply to all employees irrespective of their type of work or level of wages.  This is particularly pertinent to thestatutory requirements of ârest daysâ and âstatutory holidaysâ to which I will refer later in this judgment.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  Fourthly, although the Honorarium Scheme has remained for a long period of time now, and even though the HA has produced variousversions and reviews of the manuals for the central administration of the public health service, there has been some inconsistencyin its application.  Letters of appointment have referred to the honorarium being paid âat the absolute discretion of hospitalmanagementâ, but Mr Huggins says that it is actually an entitlement and not a discretionary payment.  He acknowledges however thatthere is still a discretionary element in that the HA chooses to which units the Honorarium Scheme is to apply, so that when a doctorsigns a contract of employment, he would not know if he would be entitled to receive payment under the Honorarium Scheme for workingmore than his âconditioned hoursâ (a concept which I will discuss later). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  Further, there is some inconsistency in practice as to whether a doctor would be entitled to time-off for working more than hisâconditioned hoursâ.  In a memorandum (ref (23) in HA 1021/1) to âDistributionâ dated 14 May 1992 on the subject of âGuidelineson Handling of Time-Off Periodsâ (âthe Time-Off Guidelines Memorandumâ), the Deputy Director (Administration) âclarifiedthe policies in this respectâ as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>Time-off</i> or compensation-off [compensation time-off] are usually granted to staff who are required for operational reasons to perform round-the-clockshifts, to be on duty on statutory holidays or Sundays, and <i>sometimes to recompense for overtime worked</i>â.

This disavowal was quite surprising, as it was the HAâs own document and as thetitle of the memorandum showed, it was intended to be the statement of guidelines for general application.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  In any event, the Time-Off Guidelines Memorandum was referred to in a reply from the Deputy Director (Human Resources) dated 18June 1996 to a doctor inquiring about compensatory leave for medical officers for attending on-call duties.

There is no Respondentâs Notice.  In any event the doctorsâ contention in this respect is correct,given the language of (at least some of) the letters of appointment.  (As this is a representative action, there is little purposediscussing individual circumstances, save that I would note that interns are not included in my discussions below).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  The fact that the doctors have âconditioned hoursâ is significant as the concept of overtime then kicks in under clause E4.1.1of the HRPM, which states:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Overtime is defined as work undertaken over and above an employeeâs conditioned hours of work ... regardless of the time of dayat which it is undertakenâ. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(A)(2) When additional time is worked, is there contractual recompense?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  Given that work undertaken by doctors over and above 44 hours a week is âovertimeâ, the next issue is the contractual recompensefor the additional time worked.  (As I have said earlier, the doctors are not refusing to work overtime, they are only seeking recompenseunder the terms of their employment).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  That there must be <i>some</i> contractual entitlement to recompense is clear.  Once the concept of âconditioned hoursâ is accepted to apply to doctors, itcannot be said that they can be made to work extra hours without consideration, or that they would only be given recompense in theHAâs absolute discretion, as then the agreement of a 44-hour week would be rendered completely meaningless.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(A)(3) Does clause E4.2.3 (which provides âovertime work should normally be recompensed by time-offâ) apply to doctors?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  In accordance with general contractual principles, one would expect to find the contractual recompense provided in the HRPM theterms of which are incorporated by reference in the letters of appointment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  On the aspect of overtime, the section on âGeneral Principlesâ contains clause E.4.2.3 which provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>Overtime work should normally be recompensed by time-off in lieu</i>.

In an organization where doctorscomprise a very important sector of the workforce (if not the most important sector), one would expect that if the employer did notintend this passage to apply to them, then it would have clearly said so.  This was a document drafted unilaterally by the employerand as such, in construing it, the principle of <i>contra proferentum</i> applies.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Of course as doctors are not eligible for âovertime allowanceâ, the latter part of that passage is not pertinent, but that isnot to say that their ânormal recompenseâ should not be time-off for the overtime worked; or that if they do not get that time-off, they would get nothing. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  Pausing there I note that the words âRevised 21 November 2002" appear on the version of the HRPM with which we were provided (p.1480of the Core Bundle) and these proceedings were first commenced in the Labour Tribunal in May 2002. A comparison with the versionof the HRPM dated 26 November 1991 (p.1687 of the Core Bundle) shows that the above passage did not appear in the 1991 version  butit is not very clear when the passage I have quoted in para. 156 above first appeared.  It appears however to be accepted that itwas in existence by 1994 at the latest.  In any event there must have been some basis for the guidelines in the âTime-Off GuidelinesMemorandumâ issued in 1992 by the Deputy Director (Administration) and referred to in the 1996 reply from the Deputy Director (HumanResources).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(A)(4) If clause E.4.2.3 .applies, how does it work consistently with the Honorarium Scheme?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  There is no reason why that clause cannot be read consistently with the Honorarium Scheme.  In my view, the consistent way of readingthis term of the HRPM and the letters of appointment together, and giving effect to both, is that the primary or normal recompensewould be time-off for overtime worked, and failing that, (since doctors are not eligible for âovertime allowanceâ) overtime paymentin the form of the flat rate Honorarium Scheme for doctors in the eligible units, and payment of other monetary compensation fordoctors not in those units. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  In my view, it is an important element of the doctorsâ claim that the primary recompense is time-off for the overtime worked. The busier a professional person is, the more he needs and prizes time - whether it is to be spent with family, or in the pursuitof non work-related interests, or simply to have a breather in the interests of his own well-being.  The exchange of time-off foradditional time worked is an important contractual entitlement and the HA is in my view contractually bound to honour it.  That itcan be done administratively can be seen from the fact that the evidence shows that some hospitals have applied the compensatoryleave scheme not only for statutory holidays but also for on-call days.  This has also been referred to in the 1992 âTime-Off GuidelinesMemorandumâ.    </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  On this aspect, I would pause to discuss the view that by reason of the final sentence of clause E.4.2.3 when read in conjunctionwith Chapter E4 of HRAM, an eligible employee cannot compel the HA to give him time-off for overtime worked instead of being paidovertime allowance, once he has become <i>entitled</i> to the latter.  I see nothing that leads to that conclusion.  The final sentence says:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">An employee who qualifies for an Overtime Allowance may, instead of being paid the Overtime Allowance, opt to take time-off in lieuat a later date mutually convenient to the employee and the managementâ. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">That sentence refers to the <i>employeeâs</i> <i>option</i>.  It does not require the managementâs <i>agreement</i>.  Of course it provides that the time to be taken off should be convenient to both, but those circumstances can be objectively ascertainedin good faith.  It does not give a contractual right to the management to refuse to give time-off if the employee opts for it andthe objective circumstances so permit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  Of course once payment for overtime worked has been <i>received</i>, the option for time-off would lapse.  Therefore doctors who have received payments under the Honorarium Scheme in my view have noextant claim to be given time-off for overtime worked.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(A)(5) What is the position of those doctors who are not in units covered by the Honorarium Scheme?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  It logically follows that those doctors who were not in units to which the Honorarium Scheme applied and who had worked over andabove 44 hours a week would be entitled to claim recompense for the additional time worked.  The numbers should not be large, andsubject to proof, I see no reason why they should not claim time-off now for the overtime worked.   If time-off can no longer beprovided, e.g. because they have left the HA, I would have thought that subject to the usual limitation periods, compensation shouldbe assessed at the rate when they should have been given time-off for the overtime worked.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(A)(6) Under the âon callâ system, what should be regarded as âworkâ?           </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  Le Pichon JA has set out in her judgment the different ways in which a doctor may be on-call.  In which of those situations hasa doctor done âovertimeâ  (which is defined as â<i>work</i> undertaken over and above an employeeâs conditioned hours of workâ)? </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  I think we can derive the test of what is a doctorâs âworkâ from the basic question: what is a doctor employed to do?  Theanswer it seems to me is that a doctor is employed to treat patients.  Of course, there are other incidental and ancillary activitiesbut essentially he is at the employerâs disposal for providing patient treatment. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  Once that test is applied, I think the problem regarding the different on-call situations resolves itself.  A doctor on residentcall is clearly required to treat such patients at the hospital as need treatment.  At the other end of the scale, a doctor who wascarrying a pager but who had not been paged at all cannot be said to have treated patients during that period.  A doctor who hadbeen paged and who attended hospital as a result would also have provided patient treatment.  A doctor who had been paged and whogave crucial <i>advice</i> on treatment on the telephone would in my view also have done so.  Perhaps that would not be the case for a doctor who is paged justto be kept <i>informed</i> of a patientâs progress, as he would have provided the treatment earlier.    As Le Pichon JA noted, this is a fact-sensitive issue.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  In my view, the test of âhas the doctor provided patient treatmentâ is consistent with the decision of the Court of Final Appealin <i>Cheng Ho Kee</i> as well as the decision of the European Court of Justice in the <i>SIMAP</i> case.  I would only add in respect of the former case that correctional service officers are employed to be physically present toperform their duties at CSD facilities, whereas for doctors, intellectual activity without physical presence can be adequate whenadvising on patient treatment from a distance.  As for the <i>SIMAP</i> case, I would only add that references to âworking timeâ and âovertimeâ should be read with caution as the question of whatwas âworking timeâ was relevant in the context of legislation governing maximum working time, and the question of what was âovertimeâwas relevant in the context of payment. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(B)(1) Has <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> been contravened?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  I shall now deal with rest days.  This is a discrete issue (irrespective of the claim to overtime recompense) as it arises fromthe extension of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a> in 1990 to virtually all employees irrespective of type of work or level of wages. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  The provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17</a> and s.<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">19</a> have already been referred to in Le Pichon JAâs judgment.  For my part, I do not consider that there has been a contravention of<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17.</a>  This section requires an employer in a continuous contract to âgrantâ 1 rest day in every period of 7 days.  Put another way,there must be a term in such a contract that there should be a rest day every 7 days.  The employer here (the HA) <i>has granted</i> rest days as a âstandard working weekâ is a 5Â½ day week (clause B.2.3.2 of the HRPM).  So there is no contravention.  The complaintis that the doctors have nevertheless had to work on the rest days so granted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(B)(2) Has <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19</a> EO been contravened?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  I take the view that when the HA required a doctor to work (in the sense previously discussed) during the rest day, then the continuousperiod of 24 hours which constitutes a ârest dayâ in accordance with the statute is broken,  and a contravention would ariseunless the nature of the work comes within the meaning of âunforseen emergency of any natureâ within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19(2).</a>  That  again has to be fact-sensitive.  If it occurs, then under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19(3)</a>, the employer must substitute for that interrupted rest day another rest day within the period prescribed by the legislature. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  If the HA (or indeed any employer) has been in breach, then in my view given that the purpose of the statute is to ensure that employeesare given rest days, the statute should be enforced by ordering the employer to grant substitute rest days for the employees, inthis case those doctors still remaining within the service.  For those who have left, the only remedy is the award of damages.  Giventhat there is one statutory requirement, which is to provide one <i>continuous</i> period of 24 hours for a rest day, the management who calls a doctor to hospital to work for say 3 hours during that day would neverthelesshave contravened that one statutory requirement â it does not contravene only <i>part</i> of that statutory requirement.  If that contravention had not taken place, the doctor would have had a continuous period of 24 hoursrest.  Therefore, the remedy would have to be assessed on the basis that he has <i>not</i> had a continuous period of 24 hours rest.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(C) Holidays</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  The same analysis would apply to holidays insofar as it is applicable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(D) What is the appropriate relief?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  As far as the overtime claim is concerned, with respect to the judge, I take the view that in light of the representative natureof the proceedings, it would be appropriate to grant declaratory relief so that the parties have a set of parameters within whichto determine their respective rights.  Put briefly, there should be declarations that doctors whose contracts are governed by clauseE.4.2.3 would be entitled to time-off for overtime worked as the primary recompense, but where this is operationally impracticablewithin a reasonable period from the date on which the overtime is worked (which period would have to be determined objectively),then the doctors in units under the Honorarium Scheme should be entitled to the flat rate payment under that Scheme.  If howevera doctor opts not to accept the honorarium, then he may opt to take time-off at a later date mutually convenient to him and the management. For doctors in units not subject to the Honorarium Scheme, they would be entitled to compensation for overtime quantified pro ratato their salaries.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  As far as the 1<sup>st</sup> lead plaintiff is concerned, I would grant a declaration in terms of paragraphs (5) and (6) of his claim insofar as he has not receivedthe honoraria under the Honorarium Scheme.  Of course since payment under the Honorarium Scheme is paid at a flat rate, once thehonorarium has been received for a particular month, the entitlement to time-off for overtime worked for that month would have beenextinguished. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  I do not see the need to deal with the circumstances of each individual lead plaintiff as to do so will only serve to lengthen thisjudgment.  I do not know whether any of the plaintiffs belonged to units outside the Honorarium Scheme.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  As for the rest days claim and the holidays claim, in my view the claims would have to be assessed on the basis discussed in thisjudgment.  I appreciate that this may result in a time-consuming and expensive exercise in quantification but that is the inevitableresult of the magnitude of the breach in terms of the numbers of doctors involved and the length of time during which these breacheshave occurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Le Pichon JA:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  Accordingly, the order below is affirmed save as regards the two paragraphs further ordering and directing the assessment of quantumof damages which are set aside.  An agreed draft order varying the order below should be submitted for approval.
