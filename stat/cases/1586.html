The appellant was found to have conspired with others to defraud theCompany by dishonestly causing and permitting the Company to improperly give financial assistance to Join Park in acquiring the sharesof the Company, in contravention of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a> and concealing this by means of a circular movement of cashier orders and cash cheques.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Following the appellant's conviction, the Company commenced the present action against him for damages for conspiracy, conversionand breach of fiduciary duty, and for an account as a trustee.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Yuen J gave judgment for the Company in the sum of HK$127,617,747.88 ($127 million) with credit for $58,574,315 (which the Companyhad recovered from a third party pursuant to a settlement), together with compound interest from 17 August 1985 calculated at monthlyrests at a standard rate of prime plus 1%.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Having failed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant now appeals to this Court.</p>    <p class="heading">ISSUES IN THIS APPEAL</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> In this appeal, the appellant no longer disputes, as he did in the courts below, the allegation, which the trial judge found as proved,that he was involved in the conspiracy and the defence, which the judge rejected, that the Company's claim was statute-barred. Henow seeks to challenge the judgment only on two main grounds:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) the Company did not suffer any loss as a result of the wrongful conduct on the part of the appellant and others; and</p>        <p>(2) the award of compound interest at monthly rests was erroneous.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On the first ground, the primary issue is whether the implementation of the conspiracy by means of the circular movement of cashierorders and cheques had resulted in any loss to the Company. In support of his contention, the appellant relies on <strong>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v. Cradock and Others (No. 3)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20WLR%201555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 WLR 1555</a>, where it was held that the plaintiff company in that case did not suffer any loss as a result of a similar circulation of cheques.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Related to and in further support of the argument that the Company did not suffer any loss, the appellant raises another issue, thatis, whether title to 3 cashier orders issued by the Ka Wah Bank payable to the Company in the sum of $127 million as part of theconspiracy had passed to the Company. This puts into question the effect of fraud on the passing of title to a bill of exchange and,in the context of the present case, the effect of the conspiracy on the passing of title to the cashier orders.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In relation to the second ground, the issues initially raised in the appellant's case are: (1) what are the circumstances under whichthe court can award compound interest, whether such power is confined to proprietary claims; and (2) whether it was right to calculateinterest at monthly rests. The appellant now concedes that the court does have power to award compound interest in the present case,leaving only the issue of monthly rests to be resolved.</p>    <p class="heading">FACTS AS FOUND BY TRIAL JUDGE</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> In order to deal with these issues, it is necessary to go into the facts in some detail, although not at such length as in the courtsbelow, in view of the limited grounds of appeal now argued before this Court.</p>    <p class="heading">Persons and companies involved</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The appellant was an architect in Malaysia. Since the 1970's, he has also become a businessman. In 1985, he was the majority shareholderof Join Park with Mr Ngai Shiu Kit (Ngai) as the other shareholder.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Mr C H Low (Low) was at the relevant times the Executive Vice President of the Ka Wah Bank. He also owned or controlled a numberof companies through his family. These included Seareef Investments Ltd (Seareef), Wanfong Nominees Ltd (Wanfong), Vestall Ltd (Vestall)and Ariffin &amp; Low.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Mr Quek Teck-huat (Quek) was at the relevant times a director of the Company which was a public listed company. He also owned a privatecompany, Territorial Development Ltd (Territorial). It was said that he was a nominee for or controlled by Low in relation to thesetwo companies.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> In 1985, 87 million shares (equivalent to 68%) in the Company were held by Territorial. Another 38 million shares (equivalent toabout 30%) were held by Wanfong and Vestall. The remaining 2 to 3 million shares (equivalent to about 2%) were held by members ofthe public.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The Company owned a number of subsidiaries including Dixon Ltd (Dixon). Through 2 of its subsidiaries, it owned substantial partsof a commercial and office building called Intercontinental Plaza in Tsimshatsui. The Company also owned 50% of Seareef which shareholdingwas subsequently reduced to 33% which the Company later disposed of for $1.</p>    <p class="heading">Negotiations for acquisition</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In 1985, the appellant negotiated with Low for the acquisition of 77 million of the shares in the Company owned by Territorial. Hewas shown some unaudited accounts of the Company made up to 31 May 1985 which showed that its assets consisted of the IntercontinentalPlaza offices to the value of $388 million and a debt owed by Seareef in the sum of $89 million with an overdraft due to the Ka WahBank in the sum of $91 million, giving the value of its net assets as $387 million. Based on such information, the purchase pricewas to be $232,540,000 ($232 million). After the acquisition of the 77 million shares, the appellant had to make an offer to acquirethe shares of other shareholders of the Company at the consequential price of $3.02 per share.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The appellant did not have sufficient funds to acquire the shares. Initially, Low informed the appellant that the Ka Wah Bank wouldprovide 100% financing for such acquisition. When this became impossible because of the Bank's lending restrictions, it was agreedthat the purchase price was to be financed as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) $109 million was to be provided by loans (to be secured by a pledge on the shares) to be granted by the Ka Wah Bank to two companiescontrolled by the appellant and Ngai respectively; and</p>        <p>(2) $123 million was to be raised by an arrangement which ultimately led to the conspiracy complained of.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The appellant alleged that the arrangement was to consist of: (a) Territorial obtaining $123 million from Quek and paying it to JoinPark to be retained for one year to enable the appellant to satisfy himself with the net asset value of the shares and to sell someof his own assets to the Company; (b) Seareef repaying to the Company the debt of $89 million to enable the Company to buy assetsfrom the appellant; and finally (c) the appellant and Join Park using the proceeds from the sale of assets to the Company to repaythe sum of $123 million to Territorial. The arrangement of payment and retention of the $123 million was found by the trial judgeas not making commercial sense and not credible: the lawyers were not consulted about this; the subsequent agreement did not containany provision to that effect; Quek was in financial difficulty at the time; and it was not a reason given by the appellant in anearlier affirmation.</p>    <p class="heading">The Share Purchase Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The lawyers and auditors who advised the appellant in the acquisition transaction were gravely concerned about the lack of informationon the Company and Seareef. Notwithstanding such concern, a Share Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) was signed on 18 July 1985 wherebythe appellant through Join Park agreed to acquire 77 million shares in the Company from Territorial at the price of $232 million.The Agreement contained, amongst other provisions, the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Clause 3 - the purchase price of $232 million was payable in cash made up of two sums: (a) $123 million as deposit and part paymentwhich was stated as having been paid by Join Park to Territorial, receipt of such payment being acknowledged in the Agreement byTerritorial; and (b) $109 million which was to be paid on completion;</p>        <p>(2) Clauses 4(b) and 6(vi) - Territorial would procure repayment of the debt of $89 million due from Seareef to the Company within30 days of completion and Quek would procure Territorial to deliver to Join Park a banker's draft in that amount to the Company todischarge such debt;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) Clause 5 - the sale was to be completed within 30 days (which was originally fixed for 16 August 1985). On completion, Join Parkwas to pay Territorial the balance of the purchase price, $109 million, subject to any adjustment as provided in Clause 7; and</p>        <p>(4) Clause 7 - Territorial and Quek were to deliver to Join Park the audited accounts of the Company made up to 30 June 1985 within30 days of completion and further warranted that the net assets of the Company would not be less than $374,945,520 and that if thenet assets were to be less than that amount, the price would be reduced by the difference.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Events after the Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> It is not disputed that the sum of $123 million stated in Clause 3 of the Agreement was never paid. It is also to be noted that althoughthe balance of the purchase price in the sum of $109 million was to be payable upon completion, it was in fact paid one week afterthe execution of the Agreement and 3 weeks before the date for completion. This was made possible by loans from the Ka Wah Bank totwo companies controlled by the appellant and Ngai respectively and $109 million was credited to the account of Wanfong. The trialjudge remarked that this payment was made in advance of completion notwithstanding the express provision in the Agreement probablyfor the reason that there was never any payment of the deposit and part payment of $123 million.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> On 9 August 1985, the appellant was appointed the Chief Executive of the Company. This enabled him to participate in the affairsof the Company even before completion. There was a dispute at the trial as to when this happened, but on the evidence before thecourt, the judge came to the conclusion that the appellant's appointment was effective from that date. He was subsequently made adirector on 28 August 1985 and remained thereafter until some time in 1993 when he was facing trial for criminal charges.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Shortly before the date scheduled for completion (which was postponed by agreement for one day to 17 August 1985), there was an disclosureby Low to the appellant to the effect that in addition to the debt due from Seareef to the Company in the sum of $89 million, theCompany also had other assets which consisted of overseas stock in the sum of $26 million and a deposit with Ariffin &amp; Low inthe sum of $10 million. It was also said that Seareef was prepared to pay $2 million interest in respect of the debt. The total amountwhich was to be repayable to the Company on completion was thus $127 million instead of $89 million as provided in Clause 4 of theAgreement.</p>    <p class="heading">Circular movement of cashier orders and cheques</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The repayment of this $127 million was effected, as the trial judge found and it is no longer in dispute, by the circular movementof cashier orders and cheques which started as a payment by Wanfong on behalf of Territorial to the Company in the form of 3 cashierorders issued by the Ka Wah Bank in the total sum of $127 million, which was followed by payment to Dixon of the same amount by meansof 8 cash cheques issued by the Company in favour of Dixon, which was followed by payment to Wanfong in the same amount by another8 cash cheques issued by Dixon in favour of Wanfong.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is necessary to describe the various steps taken by those involved in this circular movement of cashier orders and cheques.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) On 16 August 1985, Quek instructed Miss Chiu Chik Shang (Chiu), the manager of Wanfong to go to the Ka Wah Bank at 9 a.m. on thefollowing day, 17 August, to apply for 3 cashier orders in favour of the Company for $127 million and to bring them back to the office.</p>        <p>(2) Quek also gave her 8 cash cheques drawn by Dixon all dated 17 August 1985 and payable to Wanfong. They were to be put into itsaccount with the Ka Wah Bank only after 11 a.m. on 17 August 1985.</p>        <p>(3) On 17 August 1985, Chiu duly applied to the Ka Wah Bank for 3 cashier orders all payable to the Company in the total sum of $127million.</p>        <p>(4) Since the account of Wanfong with the Ka Wah Bank did not at that stage have sufficient funds for these cashier orders, a Mr VictorTan, a senior officer of the Ka Wah Bank and one of the conspirators, approved the issue of the cashier orders ahead of debitingthe account of Wanfong.</p>        <p>(5) Three cashier orders were issued by the Ka Wah Bank drawn on the Bank's Cashier Order Account before the Wanfong account was debited.This was contrary to the established practice of the Bank for the issue of cashier orders.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6) The cashier orders were taken to Wanfong's office and subsequently delivered by Ms Doreen Yong (Yong), who was the administratorof the Company, to the meeting place for completion at about 12 noon.</p>        <p>(7) At the meeting, Quek gave these cashier orders to the appellant in purported performance of Clause 4 of the Agreement. They werethen taken by Yong to the Ka Wah Bank and credited to the Company's account with the Bank at 12:31 p.m.</p>        <p>(8) Meanwhile, Quek and Mr Chew Kam Meng (Chew), another director of the Company, purportedly on behalf of the Company drew 8 cashcheques in favour of Dixon in the same amount and had them paid into Dixon's account with the Ka Wah Bank. These were used to supportthe 8 cash cheques which were issued the day before by Dixon in favour of Wanfong.</p>        <p>(9) By 12:48 p.m., Wanfong had paid the 8 cash cheques issued by Dixon into its own account with the Ka Wah Bank. This put Wanfongin funds to cover the cashier orders which were issued earlier that day.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Completion of the sale and purchase of the shares took place and in due course, the shares were transferred. As the trial judge found,the scheme in effect amounted to this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Join Park had not paid but was treated as having paid $123 million as deposit and part payment to Territorial in respect of theAgreement, in consideration for</p>        <p>(2) the appellant and others involved in the conspiracy arranging for the discharge of the indebtedness and liability to the Companyfrom Seareef and Ariffin &amp; Low by the repayment of $127 million through the circular movement of cashier orders and cheques.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Appellant as officer of the Company</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> It will be recalled that by then the appellant was already the Chief Executive of the Company. On 28 August 1985, he was appointeddirector. On 19 September 1985, Ngai was appointed the Chairman and the appellant the Deputy Chairman of the Company. On 27 August1985, a general offer to minority shareholders to purchase their shares at $3.02 per share was made.</p>    <p class="heading">Investment by the Company in Dixon</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In the ledgers of the Company, it was shown that the 8 cash cheques issued in favour of Dixon on 17 August 1985 totalling $127 millionwere entered as investment by the Company in Dixon.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> How Dixon made use of the sum and what happened to it remains a mystery. This is because in September 1985, the appellant purportedlywrote to Quek making enquiry about it. The trial judge considered this enquiry as only a gesture since it was not really followedup. The appellant alleged that he had made a visit to Singapore and was assured by Low and Quek that $127 million were in fact investedin properties in Singapore. However, there were no supporting documents for such investment. Nor were there any other contemporaneousentries to that effect in any of the books of the Company or Dixon or any other company. The trial judge rejected this allegation.</p>    <p class="heading">ANY LOSS TO THE COMPANY</p>    <p class="heading">Indebtedness to the Company</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Mr Daniel Fung, SC, for the appellant argues that the Company suffered no loss because the indebtedness from Seareef and Ariffin&amp; Low was not genuine and was not worth anything. The loans to Seareef, the overseas stock and the deposit with Ariffin &amp;Low were all for Low's own benefit. The money paid by the Company went straight to Low through companies controlled by him. The entriesin the books were only meant for the accountants. The money had already been siphoned off by Low long before the appellant came intothe picture.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The trial judge took the view that there were probably no genuine commercial transactions represented by the payment from the Companyto Seareef or the overseas stock or the deposit with Ariffin &amp; Low. However, she found that the evidence of the experts and thedocuments clearly showed that there were genuine payments from the Company to Seareef and Ariffin &amp; Low. They resulted in genuinedebts owed to the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> In our view, this must be right. How Seareef and Ariffin &amp; Low made use of the money they received from the Company was an entirelyseparate matter. Since these were genuine debts owed to the Company, they formed part of its assets.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> It is not correct to say that the indebtedness was not worth anything to the Company. Although the money paid by the Company to Seareefwas immediately transferred to Low or his companies and Seareef might well have been a company of a dubious nature, there might stillhave been something one could assess or value in respect of such indebtedness, either against Seareef or against Low and his companies.Moreover, at the time, Low would have been most unlikely to have endangered the support with which the Ka Wah Bank was being providedby the HSBC and the Bank of China, by allowing his companies to default.</p>    <p class="heading">Repayment of the indebtedness</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Under Clause 4(b) of the Agreement, Seareef's debt was to be repaid to the Company. As a result of the late disclosure by Low, theoverseas stock and the deposit with Ariffin &amp; Low were also included. Any person, including the professionals, looking at theAgreement in the light of the late disclosure, would expect that the Company would be paid back by Seareef and Ariffin &amp; Lowa total sum of $127 million. It was intended that the Company was to recover such sum upon completion. The repayment of such sumwas not only a term of the Agreement but might also have had an effect on other shareholders of the Company when they had to decideat a later stage whether to accept the offer from the appellant to purchase their shares.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss to the Company</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> It is clear that there was no real investment by the Company in its subsidiary Dixon, represented by the 8 cash cheques paid by theCompany to Dixon. Nor was there any investment by Dixon of such funds. It is now known that the 8 cash cheques issued by the Companyin favour of Dixon were put into Dixon's bank account in order to enable Dixon to draw the cash cheques payable to Wanfong whichWanfong used to finance the issue of the 3 cashier orders. The explanation that the funds paid to Dixon were used to invest in propertiesin Singapore was dubious in the extreme and was rightly rejected by the trial judge.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> As a result of the circular movement of cashier orders and cheques pursuant to the conspiracy, the indebtedness from Seareef wastreated as written off and discharged. The same can be said of the overseas stock and the deposit with Ariffin &amp; Low. If therehad been a genuine repayment, the Company would have been repaid its debts, realized its overseas stock and recovered its deposit.It would now have $127 million to its own use.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The net result of what happened was that (a) Join Park as purchaser paid $123 million less for the 77 million shares; (b) Territorialas vendor obtained $123 million less for the sale of those shares; (c) the indebtedness in the sum of $127 million owed by Low'scompanies to the Company was written off and discharged; but (d) the Company did not have the benefit of the repayment of this $127million. Its assets represented by such repayment were used indirectly to finance the purchase of its own shares. To this extent,the Company was defrauded and had suffered a loss. The conspiracy scheme enabled Join Park to comply, on the face of it, with Clause3 of the Agreement without actually paying $123 million. It also enabled the appellant, through Join Park, to acquire the 77 millionshares at less than 50% of the purchase price and that was made possible at the expense of the Company.</p>    <p class="heading">Analogy with Selangor</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Counsel also submits that the circular movement of cashier orders and cheques was not intended to benefit the Company; was nevermeant to put the Company in funds; was purely a series of paper transactions; there was no money or fund for the appellant and othersto misapply and the Company was no better off or worse off before or after the implementation of the scheme. The facts, it is submitted,were on all fours with those in <strong>Selangor</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The trial judge sought to distinguish <strong>Selangor</strong> on the basis that there was real money in form of the cashier orders issued by the Ka Wah Bank which were in fact put into the Company'sbank account. The Court of Appeal took the same view.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In <strong>Selangor</strong>, by means of certain transactions, the plaintiff company's funds were used to finance the purchase of its own shares by Cradock.As a result of this, a Woodstock Trust Ltd became indebted to the plaintiff company. By a subsequent agreement, this debt was takenover by Cradock. In purported repayment of this debt, Cradock drew a cheque in favour of the plaintiff company. This was followedby another cheque in the same amount drawn by the plaintiff company in favour of Burden who was one of its officers and a signatoryof that cheque. This was then followed by a third cheque drawn by Burden in favour of Cradock as payment for the purchase by Burdenfrom Cradock of the shares in the plaintiff company. This circulation of cheques enabled Burden to purchase the shares from Cradockand resulted in replacing Cradock's debt owed to the plaintiff company by a debt from Burden. Ungoed-Thomas J held that the plaintiffcompany did not suffer any loss.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> On paper, the circulation of cheques in <strong>Selangor</strong> merely consisted of a credit entry followed by a corresponding debit entry in the books of the plaintiff company, a credit entryfollowed by a corresponding debit entry in the bank account of Cradock and similar entries in Burden's bank account. In the presentcase, again on paper, the same happened as a result of the circular movement of cashier orders and cheques: there was a credit entryfollowed by a corresponding debit entry in each of the bank accounts of the Company, Dixon and Wanfong. But is the situation herethe same as in <strong>Selangor</strong>? More importantly, is the result the same?</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> In our view, whether or not the facts in <strong>Selangor</strong> were distinguishable from those in the present case is, in the result, immaterial. The question is whether as a result of what happened,the Company had suffered any loss.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Looking at the situation in the present case objectively, the fact that the cashier orders were issued by the Ka Wah Bank contraryto established practice simply means that, in effect, Wanfong was given credit by the Bank for the issue of the cashier orders fora couple of hours. The 3 cashier orders were issued and paid into the Company's account with the Ka Wah Bank in compliance with theAgreement, representing the repayment of the Seareef debt, the realization of the overseas stock and the recovery of its depositwith Ariffin &amp; Low. It was money which was contemplated under the Agreement (though not intended under the conspiracy) for theCompany to have and which it would have had but for the conspiracy. It was the arrangement pursuant to the conspiracy which causedthe drawing out from the Company's bank account of the same amount of money in the form of 8 cash cheques payable to Dixon.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> In <strong>Selangor</strong>, the parties involved were receiving one cheque with one hand and giving out another cheque in the same amount with the other. Noneof the cheques involved in the circular movement could be honoured without the other cheques. Each of the cheques was dependent onthe others. In the present case, while Wanfong did not have sufficient money in its bank account to fund the 3 cashier orders withoutthe Dixon cheques and the Dixon cheques could not be honoured without the Company's cheques, the 3 cashier orders could be honouredeven if Wanfong had no sufficient funds in its bank account. This is because the Ka Wah Bank had to honour the cashier orders andit was up to the Bank to go after Wanfong. But the money received by the Company, had there been no conspiracy, could have been keptin its bank account and could have been used for its own benefit. It was the drawing out of the same amount of money to Dixon infraud of the Company which prevented the Company from keeping and using it. By immediately withdrawing the money from the Company,the appellant and the others made sure that the Company was not able to keep and use the money.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> In <strong>Selangor</strong>, the court held that at the end of the day, there was no satisfaction of the plaintiff company's liability and no money was therecapable of being misapplied. This is because the circular cheques had the effect of substituting Cradock's liability to the plaintiffcompany by the liability of Burden. It was accepted in that case that neither Cradock nor Burden was good for the money. It was notintended by those involved that the plaintiff company would receive satisfaction, that is, would be repaid its debt, after the circulationof cheques. The plaintiff company suffered no loss as a result of this substitution of debtors. In the present case, the Agreementcontemplated that the Company was to receive satisfaction by way of repayment of the debts from Seareef and Ariffin &amp; Low. Accordingto the Company's books, it did receive repayment in the form of the proceeds of the cashier orders. It was the withdrawal of thesame amount from the Company's bank account payable to Dixon pursuant to the conspiracy that had deprived the Company of the benefitof such proceeds.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> If one whistled at half time when the money was in the Company's hands, it was inescapably and immediately to be diverted out ofthe Company which diversion was covered up by the circulation of cashier orders and cheques. When the whistle was blown at full time,the Company which was treated as having received satisfaction of its debts did not have the benefit of the repayment. This is becauseas far as the Company was concerned, the indebtedness due from Seareef and Ariffin &amp; Low was treated as discharged but at thesame time, money was withdrawn from the Company to finance the purchase of its own shares and to enable the appellant to pay lessfor the shares. Hence, whether the whistle was blown at half time or full time, it is evident that the Company had lost the moneyrepresenting the repayment of the debts. The money was misapplied by the appellant and his fellow conspirators.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> In <strong>Selangor</strong>, the result was a substitution of debtors. Here, one of the intentions of the conspirators was to misapply the proceeds, while alsoto have the Company's debts written off. They succeeded to the detriment of the Company. As we have said, whether or not these factualdifferences are material does not have to be decided in this case, it being quite clear that the Company did suffer a loss as a resultof the conspiracy of the appellant and the others.</p>    <p class="heading">THE CASHIER ORDERS : WHETHER GOOD TITLE OBTAINED</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Yuen J held that the cashier orders were delivered with the authority of the Bank. Although that authority was induced by fraud,it was voidable, not void; it remained actual authority until it was avoided: <strong>Citibank NA v. Brown Shipley &amp; Co. Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%202%20All%20ER%20690" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 2 All ER 690.</a> The handing over to Wanfong of the cashier orders made out to the Company was sufficient to authorise Wanfong to deliver the cashierorders to the Company : <strong>Yan v. Post Office Bank Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20NZLR%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 NZLR 154</a>, 160.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The appellant does not question the validity of the <strong>Citibank</strong> case; but he submits that it is inapplicable to the present case. There was fraud on the part of the payee of the cashier ordersi.e. the Company. This was, the submission continues, the fraud of Quek and Chew (directors of the Company) and Yong (the administratorof the Company). While there is no actual issue between the Ka Wah Bank and the Company, in any notional issue between them as towhether the Company obtained title to the cashier orders, the Company's claim would be defeated by its own fraud : <em>Chalmers &amp; Guest on Bills of Exchange</em>, 15 ed, para. 1042.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> However Yuen J held that the fraud of the Company's directors would not be imputed to the Company because the Company was itselfthe victim of the conspiracy, <strong>Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v. Williams Furniture Ltd &amp; Others</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20Ch%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 Ch 250.</a> The appellant does not challenge the validity of <strong>Belmont</strong> and acknowledges that it is that authority that makes it impossible for him to contend in the present case that the fraud of thedirectors upon the Company is to be imputed to the Company so as to defeat the Company's claim founded on conspiracy.</p>    <p class="heading">The notional issue</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> To overcome that hurdle the appellant seeks to have the question whether the Company obtained a good title to the cashier ordersdetermined upon the basis of a similar though notional issue between the Ka Wah Bank and the Company, arising out of a fraud uponthe Ka Wah Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> There is no such issue. In fact the cashier orders were honoured. The proceeds were paid into the Company's account. Moreover wedo not think there was a fraud upon the Ka Wah Bank. In fact the Bank was used to further the fraud upon the Company, and was notitself defrauded. Upon completion of the cashier orders and cheques circle the Bank's funds remained the same as before.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> In any case the appellant's submissions upon the notional issue, seeking to impute the directors' fraud to the Company, would nothave succeeded. True there is a rule that the knowledge of a director may be imputed to the company on whose behalf he is actingin the transaction concerned. But there is also the well established exception to the rule relied upon by Yuen J, i.e. where thedirector is acting in fraud of the company, see <strong>In re Hampshire Land Co.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%202%20Ch%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 2 Ch 743</a> at 749; <strong>J C Houghton &amp; Co. v.

The exception would preclude the imputation to the Company of knowledge of and therefore participation in the conspiracyof its directors.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The appellant's submissions on title therefore fail.</p>    <p class="heading">CONVERSION</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The appellant takes only one point before this Court upon this cause of action which is that his no loss submission applies equallyto conversion which could only succeed if loss was established. In the light of our conclusion that the Company did suffer loss,the point taken fails.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> We would add that the $127 million in the form of the 3 cashier orders was to be a repayment of the debts owed to the Company. Thismoney should, under the Agreement, and could, had it not been for the conspiracy, have been kept by the Company for its own use.The withdrawal of this money from the Company's bank account by means of the 8 cash cheques payable to Dixon for the purpose of financingthe cashier orders instead of being a genuine investment amounted to divesting the Company of its assets. This constituted a wrongfuldeprivation and thus a conversion of the Company's property to the benefit of the appellant. This was effected by the appellant whowas its Chief Executive, Quek and Chew who were its directors and signatories and Yong who was its administrator at the relevanttime. They are all liable to the Company for conversion.</p>    <p class="heading">BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Yuen J held that as Chief Executive, the appellant had a fiduciary duty to the Company and that he breached that duty in passingon the cashier orders knowing that the Company was to be deprived of these proceeds. Counsel does not challenge those findings. Herelies only upon the general submission which we have already rejected, that there had been no loss to the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> It may be added that the appellant himself instructed Yong to take the cashier orders to the Bank knowing that they would be usednot for the benefit of the Company but to fund the cheques issued to Dixon. At the same time, he knowingly assisted his fellow conspirators,Quek and Chew, who were directors of the Company, in misappropriating the proceeds of the cashier orders in breach of their statutoryduties. It follows that the appellant's appeal in respect of breach of fiduciary duty must also fail.</p>    <p class="heading">COMPOUND INTEREST</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Adopting the standard rate of prime +1% laid down in <strong>Komala Deccof &amp; Co.

The Court of Appeal upheld the award.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The appellant rightly does not question the order for compound interest and accepts that the court had jurisdiction to make it. Theclaim was in equity and the money was obtained and retained by fraud, upon which basis, the court clearly had jurisdiction to awardcompound interest. As Lord Brandon said in <strong>President of India v. La Pintada Compania Navigacion S.A.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20AC%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] AC 104</a> at 116:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Chancery courts, again differing from the common law courts, had regularly awarded simple interest as ancillary relief in respectof equitable remedies, such as specific performance, rescission and the taking of an account. Chancery courts had further regularlyawarded interest, including not only simple interest but also compound interest, when they thought that justice so demanded, thatis to say in cases where money had been obtained and retained by fraud, or where it had been withheld or misapplied by a trusteeor anyone else in a fiduciary position."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">MONTHLY RESTS</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> In challenging the order for monthly rests, counsel contends that the judge erred in not ordering yearly rests as it is conventionalto do so. Plainly yearly rests are the more usually encountered in the mainly English authorities relied upon, but we are not persuadedthat that is the conventional interest rest, at any rate in Hong Kong. Nor are we persuaded that if conventional, it would leaveno room for more frequent rests where justice in particular circumstances required, given that the unquestioned discretionary natureof the court's power plainly permits monthly rests. No authority to that restrictive effect contended for has been cited, and merelyindividual instances of the adoption of yearly rests are relied on.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Counsel also submits that the experts were referring to the way banks in Hong Kong levy interest on borrowings, whereas compoundinterest is awarded in order to deprive the fiduciary of the gain he has made from the use, or presumed use of the money : <strong>Wallersteiner</strong> at 388, 398 and 406; <strong>Kleinwort Benson</strong> at 990-5. Thus it is argued that what should have been addressed was the profit the appellant had made from the use or presumed useof the money, and not what he would have paid by way of interest on the loan he would otherwise have to raise.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> In any award of compound interest, the power to fix the rests is simply part of the power to make such an award, and is equally discretionary.In this case, the purpose to which the money was put is far from clear. To the extent that it went to the purchase of the Company'sshares, there is no evidence of what profits, if any, were made. If the appellant was not able to make use of the diverted moneyto purchase the shares, he would have had to borrow a similar amount. That would have involved interest charges and rests of thevery nature deposed to by the experts, which upon that basis the appellant "may be fairly presumed to have made": see <strong>Burdick v.

It has to that extent profited from the use of the bank's money. Moreover, if the bank had not advancedthe money to the council, it would itself have employed the money on similar terms in its business.

The second transaction in <strong>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v. Cradock (No. 3</strong>)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20WLR%201555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 WLR 1555</a>, which Ungoed-Thomas J held caused no loss to the plaintiff, is startlingly similar to the particular transactions here. As LordMillett says of that second transaction in <strong>Selangor</strong> : "It was not the absence of underlying funds which made the payments mutually interdependent, but their pre-arranged and circularcharacter which deprived the plaintiff of the opportunity of applying the payment for any legitimate purpose of its own."</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> So too here. The Company, whether or not there was the appearance of real money in the circular transaction, was rendered unableto make use of the proceeds except for their misapplication. The Company was denied the opportunity - by the fraudulent scheme inwhich the appellant in his capacity as its Chief Executive - a little later as its Director - was, on the evidence, a full participant- of using the proceeds for legitimate company business.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The Company was the victim of the fraud. As such the Company has, as Lord Millett pointed out, the option of either rejecting thefraudulent transaction or affirming it and claiming damages on the basis that it was effective and caused it loss - which it manifestlydid.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> The issues of breach of fiduciary duty and of conversion have been fully dealt with in the judgments of my Lords. There is nothingI can usefully add to what is contained in them.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> That compound interest was awarded is no longer in issue here. The rests period is. Compound interest bites on the enrichment ofthe fraudster resulting from the fraudulent scheme. Those riches must be disgorged. It was the evidence that, had a legitimate transactionbeen carried out with the assistance of borrowed money, any such loan would have attracted interest at monthly rests. Had it beenlegitimate a prudent businessman would have either reduced the loan, or fully paid it off, at the earliest possible moment.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> For that reason I am a little hesitant in agreeing that monthly rests extending over a period as long as exists in this case, ratherthan the English conventional yearly rests, is appropriate. But the trial judge fully considered the evidence placed before her.It lay within her discretion to make the order she did. In the event I am not persuaded that the exercise of that discretion shouldbe interfered with.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Lord Millett NPJ:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> This appeal arises out of the successful acquisition in August 1985 by the appellant Ch'ng Poh of a majority of the issued sharesin the respondent China Everbright-IHD Ltd ("the Company"). The full facts can be found in the judgments of the trial judge YuenJ and the Court of Appeal and in the joint judgment of Chan PJ and Nazareth NPJ. There is no need for me to rehearse them again.For convenience I shall use the same abbreviations for the names of the various companies involved and state all sums in round figures.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The Company claims that in breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> the appellant used its assets, to wit the proceeds of three bank cashier orders, towards payment of the purchase price for its shares.The total value of the cashier orders was $127 million. The Company claims damages for (i) conspiracy (ii) conversion and (iii) breachof fiduciary duty. It has been awarded damages of $127 million together with compound interest with monthly rests. I agree with thejudgment of Chan PJ and Nazareth NPJ that all three claims succeed. I propose to state in my own words my reasons for dismissingthe appeal, but I shall confine my remarks to three issues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) the appellant's principal defence, which is that the Company suffered no loss as a result of the transaction;</p>        <p>(ii) the causes of action; and</p>        <p>(iii) compound interest.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">NO LOSS</p>    <p class="heading">The transaction</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> The Company was a listed company. It had an overdraft with the Bank of $91 million. On the basis of its unaudited accounts its netassets exceeded $387 million. The agreed purchase price for the shares was $232 million. The Company's assets included an item whichwas shown in its unaudited accounts as an interest-free loan of $89 million due to the Company from Seareef and two other items worth$10 million and $26 million respectively which did not appear in its unaudited accounts but which represented assets held by associatesfor the benefit of the Company. It was a term of the contract for the sale and purchase of the shares that on completion the vendorwould deliver to the appellant a banker's draft of $89 million in favour of the Company in discharge of the Seareef loan. The partieslater agreed that further sums of $10 million and $36 million representing the other two items together with $2 million by way ofinterest on the Seareef loan, making a total of $127 million, should be treated in the same way and be paid to the Company on completionby bankers' drafts.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> Had the transaction been carried through normally the appellant would have paid the balance of the $232 million due to the vendoron completion and would have received bankers' drafts in favour of the Company for $127 million for payment into the Company's bankaccount. The appellant, however, was unable to raise the whole of the necessary finance. Accordingly he made arrangements to usethe $127 million towards the payment of the purchase money due to the vendor on completion. This was possible because, apart fromthe appellant's own corporate vehicle which he was using to buy the shares, all the companies involved in the circulation of funds,i.e. the Company, the vendor, Seareef, Dixon, and Wanfong were customers of the Bank and together with the Bank were ultimately ownedand controlled by the same individuals, namely C H Low and his associates.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> Payment was effected as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) On the morning of the day of completion Wanfong obtained three cashier orders drawn on the Bank's cashier order account in favourof the Company for a total of $127 million. In its application form Wanfong authorised the Bank to debit its account with the costof the orders. There were at that stage insufficient funds in its account, and the Bank did not debit the account until later thatsame day.</p>        <p>(ii) Wanfong took the cashier orders to the completion meeting and handed them to the appellant, who had previously been appointedchief executive of the Company. They were then taken back to the Bank in order to be credited to the Company's account.</p>        <p>(iii) The Bank had previously been provided with eight cheques for a total of $127 million drawn on the Company's account in favourof Dixon, a subsidiary of the Company, together with a further eight cheques for the same total drawn on Dixon's account in favourof Wanfong.</p>        <p>(iv) Without the proceeds of the Company's cheques in its favour there would have been insufficient funds in Dixon's account to supportits cheques in favour of Wanfong; and without the proceeds of Dixon's cheques in its favour there would have been insufficient fundsin Wanfong's account to pay for the cashier orders. But once the cashier orders had been returned to the Bank the circle was complete,and the necessary entries were duly made in the various companies' bank accounts. The value of the cashier orders viz. $127 millionwas credited to the Company's bank account, and a like sum was immediately debited to the Company's account, credited and debitedto Dixon's account, credited to Wanfong's account, and finally debited to Wanfong's account in payment for the cashier orders.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(v) The paying in slips were then taken to the completion meeting as evidence that the Company had received the $127 million in dischargeof the debts due to it and that Wanfong (presumably by the vendor's direction) had received the balance of the purchase price forthe shares. The sale and purchase of the shares was then completed by the delivery of executed share transfers to the appellant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Thus the $127 million went round in a circle: from the Bank (by means of cashier orders) to the Company; from the Company (by meansof ordinary cheques) to its subsidiary Dixon; from Dixon (by means of ordinary cheques) to Wanfong; and from Wanfong (pursuant tothe authority contained in its application for the cashier orders) back to the Bank. The whole process cannot have taken more thana few moments and took place before completion of the sale and purchase of the shares, that is to say while the Company was stillunder the control of C H Low's associates.</p>    <p class="heading">The apparent loss</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Since the money movements were circular, they did not affect the cash position of any of the participants. Each of them paid outthe identical sum that it received. But it does not follow that their net asset position remained unchanged. The payment of $127million to the Company was tendered and treated as made in discharge of the Seareef loan and the other indebtedness to the Company;while the payment of $127 million by Dixon to Wanfong was tendered and treated as made in discharge of the purchase price payableby the appellant for shares in the Company. It is beyond dispute that the appellant used the Company's funds to pay for shares inthe Company contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>. Yet it is contended on his behalf that the payment caused the Company no loss.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The contention is, to say the least, counter-intuitive. Before the money movements the Company had assets of $127 million consistingof liabilities due to it; after the completion of the money movements those liabilities had been discharged and not replaced. Themoney paid to the Company in discharge of liabilities due to it had been spent in acquiring shares in the Company, but these belongedto the appellant's corporate vehicle and not to the Company. The value of the Company's net assets had been reduced by $127 million.How can it be said that it had not suffered a loss of this amount?</p>    <p class="heading">The value of the Seareef loan</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Counsel for the appellant submitted first that the so-called Seareef loan was not an asset of the Company because it was irrecoverable.It did not represent a genuine loan to Seareef, but a book entry which concealed an unlawful withdrawal of funds by CH Low and hisassociates using Seareef as a front. The trial judge found that there probably was no genuine commercial basis for the transfer offunds, and that the same suspicion attached to the other two items totalling $36 million. But, as the Judge rightly observed, thatdid not mean that there was no liability to repay. The moneys had been extracted from the Company, and whether they had been lawfullyborrowed or unlawfully taken they represented liabilities due to the Company and therefore assets of the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Counsel next submitted that the loss suffered by the Company was the value of the Seareef loan, and that this was worthless, sinceSeareef could not have met a judgment against it. There are several difficulties with this argument. In the first place, there isno evidence of Seareef's value beyond the fact that the appellant agreed that it should be sold for a nominal $1; but this was afterits indebtedness to the Company had been repaid. In the second place, on the appellant's own case the indebtedness was not that ofSeareef alone but of C H Low and his associates, and there is no reason to suppose that they would not have been in a position torepay the full $127 million out of the $232 million sale proceeds of the shares. In the third place, and most tellingly, that iswhat they did. While it is, of course, unlawful for a purchaser to use a company's money to pay for its shares, there is nothingimproper in the vendor using the sale proceeds to repay his indebtedness to the company.</p>    <p class="heading">The Company's knowledge of the fraud</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Counsel next argued that the Company could not recover because it was fixed with knowledge of the fraud through the complicity ofits own directors. He accepted that, insofar as the Company was the victim of the fraud, it was not fixed with such knowledge: see<strong>Re Hampshire Land Co.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%202%20Ch%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 2 Ch 743</a>; <strong>J C Houghton &amp; Co. v. Nothard, Lowe and Wills</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1928%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1928] AC 1</a> esp. at p.19 <em>per</em> Viscount Sumner<strong>; Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v.

Accordingly he did not rely on the fraud practised on the Company which deprived it of the $127 million,but on what he alleged was a separate fraud practised on the Bank and of which the Company was the beneficiary. This consisted inthe fact that the Bank was prevailed upon to issue the cashier orders without (at that stage) debiting Wanfong's account with thecost.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> The submission is misconceived. No fraud was practised on the Bank. The failure to debit Wanfong's account with the cost of the cashierorders immediately they were issued was unusual, but it did not affect the parties' financial position. Wanfong had authorised theBank to debit its account with the cost, and whether the entry was made then and there or later made no difference to Wanfong's liabilityto the Bank. Wanfong's account was not sufficiently in credit to support the cost of the cashier orders, and even if their cost hadbeen debited to the account straight away they would still have been issued on credit. Moreover, in the circumstances in which Wanfongobtained such credit, as I shall explain later, the transaction was incapable of causing loss to the Bank and it did not do so.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> I think that the reason why Wanfong's account was not debited with the cost of the cashier cheques before the money movements hadbeen completed has been misunderstood. If for any reason the circle had broken down, the appellant would have been unable to completehis purchase of the shares and the share transfers would not have been handed over. Mr C H Low and his associates would have remainedin control of the Company. Repayment of their indebtedness to the Company was a term of the contract for the sale of the shares andwas conditional on the completion of the sale. If completion had not taken place it would have been necessary to reverse the repaymentof the Seareef loan and the other indebtedness by unwinding the money movements. In these circumstances I infer that the reason fornot entering the debits and credits in the various bank accounts until after completion of the sale of the shares was to avoid theneed to reverse entries already made. This is, of course, further evidence (if such were needed) of the Bank's knowledge of the sourceof the moneys paid for the shares and therefore of its complicity in the fraud practised on the Company, but that is another matter.</p>    <p class="heading">No "real" money</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> The main argument advanced on behalf of the appellant, both here and below, was that the circular movement of cheques was merelya paper transaction when in reality no funds ever existed and that it was accordingly ineffective to discharge any indebtedness tothe Company. If correct, it would of course follow that the Company suffered no loss.</p>    <p><strong>Selangor</strong></p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> The appellant relied on the way in which Ungoed-Thomas J dealt with the second transaction in <strong>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v. Cradock (No. 3)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20WLR%201555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 WLR 1555.</a> By the first transaction, Woodstock had acquired the plaintiff company's shares by the use of its own money. In consequence, Woodstockwas liable to the plaintiff in a substantial sum. By the second transaction, Woodstock sold its shareholding to Sinclair and Burdenand used the proceeds of sale to discharge its liability to the plaintiff. So far, as I have said, there was nothing improper. Thepayment was effected, however, in the course of a circular movement of cheques. These were for identical sums which passed from Woodstockto the plaintiff (in discharge of its liability to the plaintiff); from the plaintiff to Sinclair and Burden; and from Sinclair andBurden to Woodstock for the purchase of the plaintiff's shares. Thus Sinclair and Burden used the plaintiff's money to pay for itsshares. The question was whether, in these circumstances, the transaction caused any loss to the plaintiff. Ungoed-Thomas J heldthat it did not, because it failed to discharge Woodstock's liability in respect of the first transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> By a parity of reasoning, it was submitted on the appellant's behalf that the circular movement of money in the present case wasineffective to discharge the Seareef loan or the other indebtedness to the Company, which accordingly suffered no loss.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The circular money movements in the present case bear a striking similarity to the second transaction in <strong>Selangor</strong>. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal distinguished that case on the ground that it involved the circulation of ordinary cheques,whereas the present case involved the use of cashier orders, i.e. "real money". The trial judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In <em>Selangor</em>, there was a true circle of cheques where the same funds were being circulated. In the present case, however, there was an interpositionof cashier orders, and cashier orders are drafts drawn by a bank upon its own funds. (Indeed, it is for precisely this reason thatcashier orders are treated in the commercial world as being equivalent to cash)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> With respect, <strong>Selangor</strong> cannot be distinguished so easily. Ungoed-Thomas J expressly held that the second transaction was not a sham or mere paper transaction.All the cheques were genuine and were intended to effect the payments for which they were tendered and they were all honoured. Inparticular the cheque in favour of the company was intended to discharge Woodstock's indebtedness to the company. It was duly honoured,and Ungoed-Thomas J held that it was effective <em>as a payment</em>. The absence of any underlying funds did not affect this conclusion. The question was whether the payment was capable of satisfyingthe liability. He held that it was not. He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"......But it does not follow that because the payments are effective as payments, therefore they operate in satisfaction of the debt.So I return to the question asked earlier: were these payments of ï¿¡207,500 and ï¿¡42,000 satisfaction?</p>        <p class="quote">Such payments, if treated in isolation, would constitute satisfaction. But do they constitute satisfaction in the circumstances inwhich they were made? If these payments, amounting to ï¿¡249,500, were only made as part of the three cheque circular movements,by <em>which the payments to the plaintiff were dependent upon corresponding payments out by the plaintiff's directors from the plaintiff'saccount to the payer,</em> by a scheme in which the payer participates and without advantage to the plaintiff, then the payer is giving with one hand what heat the same time takes away with the other. The plaintiff has the satisfaction of a conduit pipe. Even if one whistles half timewhen the money is in the plaintiff's hands, yet it must be the final result that matters in this as in other little games, the moreso if the game is fraudulent and dishonest and fixed from the start. Satisfaction must be true and real satisfaction and not partof what makes satisfaction a mockery. I do not find it surprising that there is no authority for such a conclusion: and it is myconclusion." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> Since Woodstock's liability was not discharged, the company suffered no loss. Ungoed-Thomas J explained:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Did the plaintiff suffer any loss by reason of the second transaction?</p>        <p class="quote">I have concluded that no satisfaction was established by the second transaction, because the payment to the plaintiff under its threecheque circular movement <em>was not, in reality, a payment for the plaintiff to have at all</em>. But as the payment to the plaintiff did not provide any money for the plaintiff, the plaintiff received no money under the secondtransaction capable of being misapplied....." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>For my part, I do not think that it is correct to say that the plaintiff received no money capable of being misapplied. It would bemore accurate, as well as more consistent with the judge's previous finding that the cheques were effective to make payment (as wellas with the intention of the parties), to say that the plaintiff received no money which was not bound to be misapplied.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> Like the trial judge the Court of Appeal distinguished <strong>Selangor</strong> on the ground that in the present case the cashier orders were backed by real funds whereas the cheques in the earlier case werenot. They said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is clear that it was crucial to the judge's conclusion that the payment, if indeed there was one other than a simple book entry,was only made by the bank because of the presence of the two other cheques. Hence, the use of the word 'dependent'. In the presentcase, as the judge correctly pointed out, the Ka Wah Bank had funds with which the cashier orders were backed. The honouring of thecashier orders was, therefore, not dependent upon the existence or presentation of the cheques drawn by Doreen Yong on Dixon's accountin favour of Wanfong."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> I think that this misunderstands what Ungoed-Thomas J was saying. It was not the absence of any underlying funds which made the chequesdependent on each other. That went to the question whether there was payment at all, and despite the interdependence of the chequesUngoed-Thomas J held that they did effect payment. The reason that the payment to the plaintiff did not constitute satisfaction ofthe debt due to it is that it was effected as part of a scheme in which the payer participated and which was structured in such away that it "was not in reality a payment for the [plaintiff] to have at all". It was not the absence of underlying funds which madethe payments mutually interdependent, but their pre-arranged and circular character which deprived the plaintiff of the opportunityof applying the payment for any legitimate purpose of its own.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> The search for "real money" in a circular transaction is a mirage. Such a scheme depends on credit, not money. The Court of Appeal'sapproach would yield no solution where the participating companies had substantial funds of their own but still insufficient forthe fraudsters' purpose. It draws a distinction between the case where the debts are discharged by the circulation of bankers' draftsor suitcases full of banknotes temporarily borrowed for the occasion and the case where they are discharged by ordinary cheques;yet the vice of the scheme does not lie in the absence of underlying funds but in the victim's inability to make use of the proceedsexcept for the purpose for which they are to be misapplied. In my opinion the result in <strong>Selangor</strong> should have been the same even if one or more of the parties had possessed the necessary funds or overdraft facilities.</p>    <p class="heading">The present case</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> The same vice is present in the instant case. The Company had no opportunity to apply the proceeds of the cashier orders for anylegitimate purpose of its own. They only briefly left the possession of the Bank when they were taken to the completion meeting,and they were returned to the Bank before the sale of the shares was completed, that is to say while C H Low and his associates werestill in control of the Company. In accordance with the pre-arranged scheme to which the appellant (the Company's chief executive)was a party) the Bank was already in possession of the cheques drawn on the Company's account to effect the payment to Dixon andthe other cheques drawn by Dixon and Wanfong by which it would itself obtain payment for the cashier orders. The Bank was party tothe scheme and was fully in control of the process. The proceeds of the cashier orders were credited momentarily to the Company'saccount but only for the like sum to be immediately debited with the payment of cheques already in the Bank's possession.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> In these circumstances the proceeds of the cashier cheques were "not in reality a payment for the Company to have at all"; theirreceipt by the Company was dependent on the corresponding payments out by which means alone the Bank was to be repaid; and the Companywas just as much a conduit pipe for the passage of the money as the plaintiff in <strong>Selangor</strong>. In my judgment the present case cannot be factually distinguished from <strong>Selangor</strong>.</p>    <p class="heading">The true ground of distinction</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> But it does not follow that the result is the same, for there is a crucial difference between the two cases. In <strong>Selangor</strong> the plaintiff contended that the circulation of the cheques did <em>not</em> discharge Woodstock's liability to it; so the question was whether it was <em>bound</em> to accept them as satisfaction. In the present case by contrast the Company contends that the circulation of the cheques <em>did</em> discharge the debtors' liabilities to the Company; so the question is whether the Company is <em>entitled</em> to accept them as satisfaction. That is a different question.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> The purported effect of the circulation of cheques in both cases was to substitute one debtor for another. It is trite law that thiscannot be achieved without the consent of the creditor. Because of the circular nature of the money movements neither creditor hadan opportunity to accept or reject the substitution at the time. In <strong>Selangor</strong> the transaction would have substituted Sinclair and Burden as debtors to the plaintiff in place of Woodstock; but the plaintiff rejectedthe substitution, with the result that it was ineffective for want of the plaintiff's consent. In the present case the transactionwas intended to substitute the appellant or his corporate vehicle as debtors to the Company in place of the existing debtors; andthe Company is content to accept the substitution.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> In my judgment the Company is entitled but not bound to accept the payment of $127 million as a discharge of existing liabilities,and it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant, as a party to the scheme, to deny it its right to do so. Counsel for the appellantsubmitted that the Company should not have what he described as the "luxury" of an option whether to accept or reject the transaction.But it is a commonplace that the victim of a fraud has the option of rejecting the transaction or affirming it and claiming damages.The circumstances are often such as to deprive him of the opportunity of rejecting it; but he cannot be denied the right to affirmit and to claim damages on the basis that it was effective and caused him loss.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> It follows that the Company suffered a loss of $127 million as a result of the misapplication of its funds.</p>    <p class="heading">THE CAUSES OF ACTION</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> The appellant was party to the scheme for the misapplication of the Company's funds and was guilty of conspiracy to defraud the Company.The misapplication of the money was a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Company's officers, and the appellant was at thevery least guilty of dishonestly assisting them in their breaches of fiduciary duty. Indeed, since the Company's funds were appliedby his direction and for his benefit, he was guilty of dishonest receipt. But I agree with the Court of Appeal that he committeda breach of his fiduciary duty as chief executive officer of the Company when he caused the cashier orders to be delivered to theBank with the intent that the proceeds should be put into the circle and used to pay for the Company's shares.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> I also agree with the Court of Appeal that the appellant was guilty of conversion of the cashier cheques. It is trite law that conversionmust be conversion of corporeal personal property; choses in action cannot be converted: see <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> p.744 para. 14-41. A cheque can be converted because it is a piece of paper. It is treated as the means of obtaining the money inthe account on which it is drawn and as having the value of the sum payable. As the payee of the cashier orders the Company couldmaintain an action for their conversion. But were they converted?</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> In the present case the cashier orders were drawn in favour of the Company and the proceeds were duly credited to its account. Inthe ordinary way that would not be a conversion of the orders. They then became paid orders and were of no further value. True, themoneys in the Company's account were immediately misapplied, but that was not itself a conversion of the orders which by then hadfulfilled their purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Nevertheless I agree with the Court of Appeal that in the unusual circumstances of this case the cashier cheques were converted.This is because the proceeds were paid into the Company's account with the specific purpose that they should be immediately withdrawnand misapplied. The payment to the Company was "not in reality a payment for the Company to have at all". The difficult questionis whether the fact that the Company has affirmed the transaction by accepting the payment as satisfaction of the indebtedness inrespect of which it was paid precludes it from claiming that the payment constituted a conversion. But I have come to the conclusionthat it should not. The money was paid with the intention not only that the existing indebtedness to the Company should be dischargedbut also to fund the appellant's purchase of the shares. This is what has caused the Company loss, and it has in no sense been authorisedby the Company.</p>    <p class="heading">COMPOUND INTEREST</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> As Lord Goff of Chieveley observed in <strong>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v. Islington London Borough Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 669</a> at p.682, the law of England in relation to the award of interest has developed in a fragmentary and unsatisfactory manner, withthe result that insufficient attention has been given to the jurisdiction to award compound interest. Nevertheless it is well establishedin England that the equitable jurisdiction to award compound interest may be exercised in cases of fraud: ib p.696. Historicallythe Courts of Common Law did not award compound interest, and the Court of Chancery did so only when acting in its exclusive jurisdictionand not in its concurrent or auxiliary jurisdiction. But it did not confine such awards to proprietary claims, and a claim for breachof fiduciary duty would have fallen within its exclusive jurisdiction and attracted an award of compound interest. Accordingly Counselfor the appellant rightly did not dispute the Court's jurisdiction to award compound interest but confined his challenge to the frequencyof the rests.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> Despite this, and because of the unsatisfactory state of the law in England, I think it right for me to say a few words on the positionin Hong Kong as I see it.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> The refusal of English law to award compound interest at common law in cases of fraud while making such an award as a matter of coursein equity is very difficult to defend. There may be concurrent jurisdiction at law and in equity on the same facts. In the <strong>Westdeutsche Landesbank</strong> case at p.696 Lord Goff asked rhetorically:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Is it to be said that, if the plaintiff decides to proceed in equity, compound interest may be awarded; but that if he chooses toproceed in an action at law, no such auxiliary relief will be available to him?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>And he answered his own question:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I find it difficult to believe that, at the end of the 20th century, our law should be so hidebound by forms of action as to be compelledto reach such a conclusion."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The principle on which the English Court of Chancery awarded compound interest was explained by Lord Hatherley in <strong>Burdick v.

If the Court finds ...that the money received has been invested in an ordinary trade, the whole course of decision has tended to this, that the Court presumesthat the party against whom relief is sought has made that amount of profit which persons ordinarily do make in trade, and in thosecases the Court directs rests to be made."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is not easy to see why the same principle should not be applicable to any commercial claim whether based on fraud or not. At firstinstance in the <strong>Westdeutsche Landesbank</strong> case Hobhouse J was in no doubt that he should award compound interest if he had jurisdiction to do so. He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Anyone who lends or borrows money on a commercial basis receives or pays interest periodically and if that interest is not paid itis compounded..... I see no reason why I should deny the plaintiff a complete remedy or allow the defendant arbitrarily to retainpart of the enrichment which it has unjustly enjoyed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Unless the Court awards compound interest, the plaintiff in a commercial case will not receive full compensation for being deprivedof his money.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> The present unsatisfactory state of English law in relation to the award of interest is the product partly of history, partly ofoutmoded social attitudes (Victorian society's hostility to trade in general and to the lending of money at interest in particular),and partly to piecemeal intervention by the legislature. In the <strong>Westdeutsche Landesbank</strong> case Lord Goff and Lord Woolf of Barnes made a powerful case for developing the Court's jurisdiction to award compound interest,to embrace not only common law claims of fraud, but also ordinary cases of restitution such as the case before them. But they werein a minority. The majority considered that the development of the law in this area should be left to the legislature. They tookthis view for two reasons. First, Parliament had twice since 1934 legislated in regard to interest on awards at common law, and oneach occasion it authorised an award of simple interest only. The majority considered that they would be usurping the function ofParliament if they were to develop the common law jurisdiction in the manner proposed. Secondly, the question had not been fullyargued, and while they expressed no concluded view on the question the majority considered that it would be imprudent to introducesuch an important change in the law without the benefit of full argument.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> The majority acknowledged the moral basis of the plaintiffs' claim for compound interest and based their decision to deny the claimon policy grounds. They did not express a concluded view, and the question remains open for reconsideration by the House of Lordsin a future case.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> The position in Hong Kong is not necessarily the same. Its history and social attitudes, particularly in relation to interest, maybe different. Had the Hong Kong Court of Appeal awarded compound interest in a commercial case not based on fraud before 1997, thePrivy Council might well have deferred to the decision of the local court informed by its knowledge of local conditions. In thesecircumstances I do not think that our Court of Final Appeal should necessarily feel constrained by the majority decision in the <strong>Westdeutsche Landesbank</strong> case to abstain from developing the law in a manner suited to local needs. The question does not arise for decision in the presentcase, and its determination must await a more appropriate case in future. Such a case can be fully argued on the basis of Hong Kongconditions, and will raise the question, not whether the change should be left to the English Parliament, but whether it should beleft to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. The policy considerations may well not be the same.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> On the frequency of the rests, I am in full agreement with what has been said by Chan PJ and Nazareth NPJ.</p>    <p class="heading">CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Chief Justice Li :</strong></p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> This Court unanimously dismisses the appeal and makes an order nisi for costs against the appellant with the directions as proposedin para. 65 above in the joint judgment of Mr Justice Chan PJ and Mr Justice Nazareth NPJ.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Andrew Li)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%">(Patrick Chan)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(William Silke)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Chief Justice</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="34%">Permanent Judge</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Non-Permanent Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Gerald Nazareth)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Lord Millett)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Non-Permanent Judge</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Non-Permanent Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Daniel R Fung SC, Mr Anthony Chan and Mr Richard Leung (instructed by Messrs Chan &amp; Tsu) for the appellant</p>        <p>Mr John Griffiths SC and Mr Russell Coleman (instructed by Messrs Richards Butler) for the respondent</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2002/31.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
