The parties and the issues</p>        <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 19 September 1992, the plaintiff (â<u>Mr Unruh</u>â) entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (â<u>the MoA</u>â) with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (â<u>Mr Seeberger</u>â).  The MoA provides that under certain circumstances, Mr Unruh is to become entitled to payment of a â<u>Special Bonus</u>â.  Mr Unruh contends that such entitlement has arisen and, not having been paid, brought proceedings to recover the same from MrSeeberger and from the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant (â<u>Egana</u>â, formerly called Haru International (Holdings) Limited).  Prior to its flotation, Egana was owned by Mr Seeberger.  He remainsa substantial shareholder.</p>        <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Mr Unruhâs claim is resisted by Mr Seeberger on the basis that, properly construed, no entitlement to a Special Bonus (or to anunapportioned Special Bonus) arises under the MoA.  He also alleges that Mr Unruh failed to comply with a âbest endeavoursâ obligationin the MoA said to operate as a condition precedent to any entitlement.  He furthermore adopts the argument, advanced on Eganaâsbehalf, that the MoA is a champertous agreement and therefore void and unenforceable. </p>        <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In a careful and comprehensive judgment, Deputy High Court Judge Saunders (as he then was) rejected all of those arguments and heldMr Seeberger personally liable to pay the Special Bonus.<a>[1]</a>  He gave judgment against him in the sums of HK$25,027,447.13 and NLG290,288.15 with interest and costs.  His judgment in this respectwas unanimously upheld in the Court of Appeal.<a>[2]</a></p>        <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  As against Egana, which is not a party to the MoA, Mr Unruh relied at the trial on an oral contract allegedly made in late May orearly June 1995 between himself and Mr Seeberger, with the latter acting on his own behalf and on behalf of Egana, whereby Eganatook on the liability to pay Mr Unruh the Special Bonus, with Mr Seeberger remaining liable to pay if Egana were to default.  TheJudge rejected this part of Mr Unruhâs case and it was not pursued in the Court of Appeal.</p>        <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr Unruh also contended at the trial that the doctrine of estoppel by convention applies so as to prevent Egana from denying itsliability to pay him the Special Bonus, thereby entitling him to judgment against Egana.  The Judge accepted that submission andadjudged Egana liable to pay Mr Unruh HK$23,335,902.23 and NLG290,288.15 with interest and costs.  The amount of the judgment wasless than that awarded against Mr Seeberger because the Judge accepted that Egana could set-off certain debts owed by Mr Unruh, whichset-off was unavailable to Mr Seeberger.</p>        <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  By a majority, the Court of Appeal upheld the Judgeâs decision in respect of Egana.  Stone J dissented, taking the view that liabilityon Eganaâs part could not be made out.  Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by Rogers VP pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484" class="autolink_findacts">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484">Cap 484</a>. </p>        <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The primary issue concerning Egana on appeal is whether an estoppel by convention arises on the facts, and if so, whether it enablesMr Unruh to establish Eganaâs liability to pay the Special Bonus.  Secondly, Egana raises the issue of champerty.  This is somewhatodd since the argument was directed at the enforceability or otherwise of the MoA, a question obviously relevant to Mr Seebergerâscase but not self-evidently relevant to Egana, which is not a party to that agreement and is not being sued on it.  However, publicpolicy may exclude the raising of an estoppel<a>[3]</a> and Eganaâs argument appears to be<a>[4]</a> that Mr Unruhâs case on estoppel asserts a convention which effectively deems Egana to be a party to the MoA or to an equivalentagreement so that, by reason of the public policy against champertous agreements, such a conventional estoppel cannot arise. </p>        <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The champerty argument will in any event have to be examined in relation to Mr Seeberger who relies on that ground in addition tocontending that the decisions below should be overturned on grounds relating to the construction of, and the best endeavours obligationin, the MoA.</p>        <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Court is indebted to counsel for their assistance.  Mr Unruh is represented by Mr Ashley Burns, appearing with Mr AlexanderStock.  Mr Ambrose Ho SC appears with Ms Linda Wong for Mr Seeberger, and Mr Denis Chang SC appears with Mr Hectar Pun and Mr NewmanLam for Egana.</p>        <p class="heading">B. The main course of events</p>        <p class="heading">B.1. ESCT and the Licence Agreement </p>        <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Eco Swiss China Time Limited  (â<u>ESCT</u>â) is a Hong Kong company founded by Mr Unruh and at the material time was wholly-owned by him.  Its business involved the productionand distribution of watches and other time pieces. </p>        <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 1 July 1986, ESCT entered into a Licence Agreement (â<u>the Licence Agreement</u>â) with Benetton International NV (â<u>Benetton</u>â) and Bulova Watch Company Inc (â<u>Bulova</u>â). This permitted ESCT, on payment of royalties, to manufacture and service what were referred to as âfashion watchesâ usingthe name âBenetton by Bulovaâ.  The Licence Agreement was for a term of eight years with the parties agreeing to enter into negotiationsin good faith with a view to extending its term not later than one year before its expiration.  It also contained an arbitrationclause in favour of the Netherlands Arbitration Institute in The Hague (â<u>the Tribunal</u>â), applying the laws of the Netherlands. </p>        <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It appears that exploitation of the Licence Agreement proved very lucrative.  According to Mr Unruh, âBenetton by Bulovaâ becamethe second biggest selling watch brand in the world, achieving sales of over 5 million watches per year.</p>        <p class="heading">B.2    Acquisition of ESCT and commencement of NAI 1325</p>        <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr Unruh and Mr Seeberger had known each other from previous dealings.  In April 1991, Mr Seeberger was contemplating the flotationof Egana on the Hong Kong stock market.  He began discussions with Mr Unruh for the acquisition of ESCT with a view to its beinginjected into Egana for the purposes of the flotation.</p>        <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  However, as these discussions were progressing, Benetton served a notice dated 24 June 1991 purporting to terminate the LicenceAgreement.  It alleged various wrongful acts on the part of ESCT, including the granting of an unauthorized sub-licence concerningalarm clocks; a failure to pay royalties; providing inaccurate books; understating sales figures to avoid paying royalties; and soforth.  It also relied on the fact that, on 10 April 1991, a receiver had been appointed by a Milan court over an Italian subsidiaryof ESCT called Eco Swiss SpA (â<u>Eco Swiss</u>â) which was alleged to constitute a substantial part of ESCTâs assets.  The eight-year term of the Licence Agreement was dueto run until 30 June 1994, so Benetton was purporting to cut it short by about three years.</p>        <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  ESCT rejected these allegations and, on 28 June 1991, commenced an arbitration against Benetton (which became known as Arbitrationâ<u>NAI 1325</u>â) before the Tribunal.  In its Statement of Claim delivered on 2 March 1992, it specified as part of the relief sought in NAI 1325,a declaration that the Licence Agreement continued in full force; an order for Benetton to continue rendering performance, includingthe commencement of good faith negotiations for its extension; compensation for damages flowing from Benettonâs alleged repudiationâand related misconductâ.  Alternatively, if the Licence Agreement were held not to continue in force, ESCT sought damages resultingfrom the alleged ârepudiation and related misconduct, including lost future profits covering both the initial term and the foreseenextension of the Agreement, in an amount to be proven in a second phase of the proceedings.â</p>        <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Seeberger was not deterred by Benettonâs termination of the Licence Agreement from proceeding with ESCTâs acquisition.  Theparties entered into a series of agreements between August 1991 and September 1992 setting the terms upon which Mr Unruh was to partwith his shares in ESCT, such terms evolving with each new agreement. </p>        <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The net effect of these agreements (including the MoA, whose precise effect receives more detailed consideration below) as at 19September 1992 may be summarised as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) Mr Unruh disposed of all his shares in ESCT in two tranches (sale of  the second tranche being conditional).  The first trancheconsisted of 12,996 shares (representing 49.98% of ESCTâs issued capital), sold to Haru Pacific Limited (â<u>Haru Pacific</u>â, a company wholly owned by Mr Seeberger).<a>[5]</a>  Such shares were subsequently on-sold to Egana.<a>[6]</a>  The second tranche, comprising 13,004 shares, was sold to Egana with completion made conditional upon, among other things, a rulingin the arbitration which was satisfactory to Egana.<a>[7]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) The consideration for each tranche of shares was the nominal sum of HK$1.00.  However, as part of the package, Mr Seeberger grantedMr Unruh an option to purchase 2% of the issued shares of Egana for HK$13 million, which sum was to be provided by Egana to Mr Seebergerfor Mr Unruhâs account.  In addition, Mr Unruh received HK$1 million in cash and was given a further option to purchase an additional2.5% of Eganaâs share capital at the date of listing at the offer price.<a>[8]</a>  The first option was exercised, but not the second.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c) Mr Seeberger became a director and chairman of ESCT.  Mr Unruh was made a director of Egana. </p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(d) Under a Service Agreement between himself and Mr Seeberger, Mr Unruh was to receive a salary of $230,000 per month plus fringebenefits for a term of three years on his agreeing to devote his energies as executive director to the development of the Egana Groupâsbusiness.<a>[9]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(e) He was also obliged under the MoA to use his best endeavours to assist ESCT in connection with âthe Arbitration and otherwisein respect of all outstanding proceedings, claims and otherwise to which ESCT is a party in any way whatsoever.â<a>[10]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(f) Also under the MoA, Mr Seeberger was to pay Mr Unruh a Special Bonus involving a share in monetary compensation received by ESCTin respect of the Arbitration should such compensation exceed US$10 million, subject to conditions considered more closely below.<a>[11]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(g) Mr Unruh and Mr Seeberger became jointly and severally obliged to indemnify Egana against any reduction in value of the assetsof any member of the Egana Group (which would include ESCT upon completion of the second trancheâs acquisition) resulting fromany claims against ESCT, Eco Swiss and/or Contempo SPA (another Italian subsidiary of ESCT).<a>[12]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(h) As between themselves, Mr Unruh and Mr Seeberger agreed to discharge the obligations to indemnify Egana in equal shares.<a>[13]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The second tranche acquisition became unconditional on 24 December 1992.  That was two days after the Tribunal notified the partiesof its initial decision in NAI 1325 in summary form.  That decision was to the effect that Benettonâs termination was invalid,that the Licence Agreement remained in full force with Benetton having to continue performance, and that Benetton would have to paydamages for repudiation of the agreement with such damages to be assessed, if not agreed, in a second phase of the Arbitration. The Tribunal, however, declined to deal with ESCTâs requests for specific orders and penalties relating to Benettonâs continuedperformance.  The ruling was evidently satisfactory to Egana and a Confirmatory Memorandum dated 21 January 1993 was executed statingthat the conditions in the deed of acquisition were satisfied as at 24 December  1992.  The formal award, referred to as the PartialFinal Award (â<u>PFA</u>â â âpartialâ because damages had not been assessed), was published on 4 February 1993.</p>        <p class="heading">B.3    The position of the parties as at 19 September 1992</p>        <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is worth pausing at this point to consider the position of the parties and the commercial considerations which were evidentlyof importance to them as at 19 September 1992, the date of the MoA. </p>        <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In acquiring ESCTâs shares Egana was acquiring a company whose principal asset was unrealized since it consisted of ESCTâs arbitrationclaim against Benetton which would have to be pursued to a successful conclusion before it could be translated into an enforceableaward or a valuable settlement.  It was also an asset of uncertain monetary value since it was not known whether the Tribunal wouldhold Benettonâs termination of the Licence Agreement to be unjustified and if so, what relief it would grant.  It was not knownwhether it might result in an award of damages or in Benetton agreeing to reinstate and extend the Licence Agreement and if so, onwhat terms. </p>        <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The fact that the asset acquired was of an unrealized and uncertain value had two important implications for Mr Unruhâs position. In the first place, the consideration he received for the sale of his shares in ESCT naturally reflected that uncertainty.  Thus,only a nominal consideration of HK$1.00 was agreed for each tranche of shares.  The financial benefits which he immediately receivedwere restricted to a cash payment of HK$1 million and a right to 2% of Eganaâs issued shares valued at HK$13 million.  He was,however, to receive a potential financial benefit which depended on the value of the asset if and when it was realized and quantified. If the âmonetary compensationâ received by ESCT âin respect of the Arbitrationâ should exceed US$10 million, he was to receivea 10% shares of the excess. </p>        <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The second implication for Mr Unruh and plainly recognized by Mr Seeberger and Egana was that he had an important role to play inrealizing the value of that asset.  As indicated above, the parties had requested the Tribunal to deal with any assessment of damagesduring a second phase of the arbitration.  The parties therefore clearly recognized that even if they succeeded in the first phaseof NAI 1325, this did not necessarily mean an end to the arbitration as a second phase might well be required.  Furthermore, theyappear also to have recognized that litigation concerning the claim might not be confined to NAI 1325.  Given Mr Unruhâs involvementin ESCTâs affairs he was uniquely placed to assist in any Phase 2 or related proceedings and Egana and Mr Seeberger were obviouslyconcerned to ensure that he would continue to render such assistance.  He was accordingly required to undertake to use his best endeavoursto assist ESCT âin connection with the Arbitration and otherwise in respect of all outstanding proceedings, claims and otherwiseto which ESCT is a party in any way whatsoever.â  Structuring the consideration for his ESCT shares to include a potential sharein the arbitration proceeds was no doubt also designed to provide an incentive for Mr Unruh to work towards a successful result inthe process.</p>        <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The parties furthermore recognized that the acquisition of ESCT carried with it actual and potential liabilities, especially inrespect of legal costs in the proceedings concerning its Italian subsidiaries.  Mr Unruh and Mr Seeberger accepted that such liabilities,which represented the cost of realizing the value of the asset injected into Egana, should not be borne by the Egana Group but bythemselves in equal shares.  Accordingly, indemnities in respect of such liabilities were given to Egana.</p>        <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Finally, it was intended that Mr Unruhâs experience and expertise in the watch trade should be harnessed to the development ofEganaâs business.  Mr Unruh was engaged to perform duties to that end under a Service Agreement, for which he was remunerated bya salary and fringe benefits.</p>        <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The indemnity arrangements referred to above were supplemented by a Deed dated 31 May 1993 (referred to by the parties as â<u>the Howard Lau Deed</u>â) whereby Mr Unruh and Mr Seeberger covenanted to indemnify ESCT for any claims against Eco Swiss and Contempo and for any chargesor expenses arising out of any such claims.  This indemnity was limited to HK$35 million and was to operate for a period of two years. On the same day, Mr Unruh and Mr Seeberger executed a deed agreeing between themselves to bear in equal shares, any liability toESCT under the Howard Lau Deed.</p>        <p class="heading">B.4    Listing of Egana, Mr Unruhâs status and NAI 1616</p>        <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In June 1993, Egana became listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (â<u>HKSE</u>â).  This was the culmination of a long process which had formed the backdrop for the abovementioned agreements.</p>        <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The publicity associated with the listing, with Mr Unruh named as a director of Egana, had an unwelcome consequence.  On 23 July1993, Simmons and Simmons (â<u>S&amp;S</u>â), Eganaâs and Mr Seebergerâs solicitors, were informed that the HKSEâs Lisiting Division was about to be told that Mr Unruhhad been convicted of a criminal offence in Germany, something which he had not previously disclosed in Hong Kong.  Mr Unruh hadindeed been convicted of fraud in Germany in 1976 and had spent time in prison between 1977 and 1979.  However, the Judge found thatunder German law, if for 15 years after judgment no further offence is committed, a conviction is âerasedâ from all officialrecords and the individual concerned is entitled to be regarded as having no criminal record, it being an offence for anyone thereafterto disclose the erased conviction.  However, that constraint did not apply in Hong Kong and the disclosure (apparently at the behestof a former associate who had fallen out with Mr Unruh) was duly made to the HKSE. </p>        <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  One unrelated but similar matter concerned the bringing of criminal charges in Italy against Mr Unruh in connection with the bankruptcyof Eco Swiss.  These charges had been laid in March 1992 and were being contested by lawyers instructed in Italy.  The Judge foundthat Mr Unruh had earlier disclosed their existence to Mr Seeberger but that, on advice, it was not considered necessary to disclosethem to the HKSE at that stage.</p>        <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In any event, in the light of the German conviction, Egana terminated Mr Unruhâs Service Agreement and removed him from the boardof Egana on 9 September 1993.  On 18 September 1993, he also ceased to be a member of ESCTâs board. </p>        <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Nevertheless, Mr Unruhâs continued assistance in pursuing the Benetton arbitration was plainly considered essential and the partiesimmediately went about drafting a Consultancy Agreement to regulate Mr Unruhâs continued association with Egana.  That agreementwas signed on 29 September 1993, the parties being ESCT, Mr Seeberger, Egana and Mr Unruh (â<u>the Consultancy Agreement</u>â). </p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) It recited that ESCT wished to use Mr Unruh services in relation to the Benetton arbitration and the litigation in Italy regardingthe liquidation of Eco Swiss, among other matters. </p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) It was for a term of two years, expiring on 30 September 1995 and Mr Unruh was to receive a total sum of HK$5 million for hisservices, payable in specified instalments, plus expenses and fringe benefits.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c) It also contained a âNo Claimsâ clause<a>[14]</a> by which, Mr Unruh confirmed that he had no claims against the Egana Group or Mr Seeberger and vice-versa, but with the parties acknowledgingthat this did not relate to Mr Unruhâs rights under Clause 5 of the MoA. </p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Egana was right to anticipate the need for continued assistance from Mr Unruh in the dispute with Benetton.  Attempts to negotiatea settlement came to nothing and, on 3 November 1993, ESCT and Bulova initiated Phase 2 of NAI 1325, seeking an assessment of damagesand other relief.  On 31 January 1994, Benetton retaliated, commencing their own arbitration (known as â<u>NAI 1616</u>â), seeking a declaration that it had rightly ended the negotiations and advancing a counterclaim for compensation.  </p>        <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In the meantime, legal expenses associated with the Italian proceedings had been and were continuing to be incurred.  However, MrUnruh had not kept up with paying his half share of those expenses.  On 26 April 1994, Eganaâs board received advice from Mr AlanEwins of S&amp;S as to Eganaâs right to demand payment by Mr Unruh under the indemnities he had provided.  S&amp;S advised thatthe result of the No Claims clause in the Consultancy Agreement was that Mr Unruh had been released from his obligation to indemnifyEgana or ESCT in respect of liabilities incurred prior to the Consultancy Agreementâs date.  Mr Ewinsâs letter stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âOn the basis of the release contained in the Consultancy Agreement, in my view neither Mr Seeberger nor any member of the EganaGroup can require Mr Unruh to account in any way for expenses or liabilities of ESCT or any other member of the Egana Group whichrelate to the period up to and including 29th September 1993.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p>It also advised that Egana had no right of set-off against the Consultancy Agreement fees.</p>        <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The ability of Egana to recover Mr Unruhâs contribution to the expenses already incurred for the Italian proceedings was thereforeput in doubt.  Additionally, the indemnity obligation contained in the Howard Lau Deed was due to expire on 30 May 1995, after whichEgana might lack a legal basis for claiming an indemnity for expenses and liabilities incurred. </p>        <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The final instalment of HK$1 million was due to be paid to Mr Unruh pursuant to the Consultancy Agreement on 31 December 1994. By then, his share of legal and professional expenses which would have been payable under the indemnities, plus certain personalexpenses paid on his behalf, stood at about HK$750,000.  He refused ESCTâs request that this sum should be set-off against hislast instalment but acceded to their request to enter into a deed acknowledging such liability as a basis for his receiving paymentof the HK$1 million instalment in full.</p>        <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  It was against this background that Egana, ESCT and Mr Unruh executed the Deed of Acknowledgment dated 5 January 1995 (â<u>the DoA</u>â).  In it, Mr Unruh acknowledges liability for his share of the expenses which had been incurred and for half of all future liabilitiesto be incurred in connection with âclaims and otherwise in which ESCT is a party in any way whatsoeverâ as provided for in theMoA.  The DoA also provides that Egana is entitled to set off Mr Unruhâs existing indebtedness and any future liabilities âagainstthe amount of Special Bonus to be payable byâ Egana.  This clause is at the heart of Mr Unruhâs case on estoppel and will requirecloser examination.</p>        <p class="heading">B.5    The alleged  oral agreement and eventual settlement with Benetton</p>        <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  On 2 May 1995, the Tribunal gave a preliminary indication of its ruling in Phase 2, confirming this by its Final Arbitral Awarddated 23 June 1995 (â<u>the FAA</u>â).  In circumstances explained in the FAA, the Tribunal confined themselves to an assessment of damages for repudiation of theLicence Agreement.  In the result, Benetton was ordered to pay to ESCT such damages in the sum of US$23.75 million plus interestand costs.  Bulova was awarded damages of US$2.8 million plus interest and costs. </p>        <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As previously indicated, it was part of Mr Unruhâs original case â rejected by the Judge and not subsequently pursued â thatin May or early June 1995, after the Tribunalâs preliminary indication of its award had been received, he entered into an oralagreement with Mr Seeberger regarding Eganaâs liability to pay him the Special Bonus. </p>        <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  It is unsurprising that the oral agreement was rejected as highly unlikely given that the controversy concerning Mr Unruhâs pasthistory had been resurrected in the press on 18 May 1995 and in an anonymous complaint made to the HKSE shortly thereafter.  Apartfrom the German conviction in the 1970âs, Mr Unruh now also had an Italian conviction.  On 26 October 1994, he had agreed termswith the Italian authorities so that, upon his making certain payments, a conviction was entered and a suspended sentence ordered.</p>        <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Egana was obviously embarrassed and concerned as to the effect Mr Unruhâs history might have on the Benetton award.  It soughtadvice from Mr Shawn Conway (â<u>Mr Conway</u>â), a lawyer with Messrs TrenitÃ© van Doorne, the Dutch lawyers acting for ESCT in the arbitrations.  In his fax dated 18 May 1995,Mr Conway opined that if Benetton were to hear of Mr Unruhâs history it might âtry to use it as an after-the-fact justificationfor its refusal to extend the Licence Agreementâ or even âto have the termination award set aside or to resist execution of theaward.â  However, he evidently did not consider such attacks likely to succeed, stating:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âGiven that Mr Unruh was removed immediately and was no longer a member of management during the period of the ânegotiationsâ,we have positioned ourselves to resist Benettonâs arguments.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Reacting to the adverse publicity, Egana informed the HKSEâs Lisiting Division on 27 May 1995 that it was unlikely that Mr UnruhâsConsultancy Agreement would be extended when it expired on 30 September 1995.  When, in June and July 1995, Mr Unruh tried to secureagreement to an extension of his Consultancy Agreement and an acknowledgment by Mr Seeberger, on behalf of himself and Egana thatMr Unruh was entitled to the Special Bonus, he was unsuccessful.  His Consultancy Agreement therefore expired but the Judge foundthat he thereafter did continue to assist in the arbitrations.</p>        <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Under the MoA, any entitlement to the Special Bonus only arose after receipt by ESCT of the relevant monetary compensation.  Thatwas, in July 1995, still a long way off.  On 10 July 1995, Benetton began a vigorous campaign in the Netherlands courts aimed atsetting aside the Tribunalâs PFA and FFA in NAI 1325.  As Mr Conway had anticipated, Benetton sought to rely in this context onthe bankruptcy of ESCTâs Italian subsidiaries and on Mr Unruhâs plea-bargained conviction on 26 October 1994.  Benetton was alsosimultaneously pursuing NAI 1616 and, on 29 April 1996, it raised the Italian bankruptcies and Mr Unruhâs Italian conviction inthat context.</p>        <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Eventually, Benetton was comprehensively defeated on all fronts.  On 21 January 1996, the Netherlands Court of Appeal held thatthe Italian bankruptcies and conviction were irrelevant to the Licence Agreement.  In NAI 1616, the Tribunal issued a PFA on 27 June1997 holding that the Licence Agreement was still in full force and that Benetton was required to negotiate its extension in goodfaith.  Characteristically, Benetton issued fresh court proceedings to challenge that PFA.  It also took a European Community Treatypoint all the way to the European Court of Justice where its challenge was rejected on 1 June 1999.  On 16 September 1999, anotherdecision of the Netherlands Court of Appeal was published rejecting the contention that Mr Unruhâs non-disclosure of his convictionsamounted to fraud.</p>        <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  At this point, Benetton decided to commence settlement negotiations.  This led to a Final Settlement Agreement dated 31 March 2000(â<u>the FSA</u>â) between ESCT and Benetton.  On the footing that there would be no admission of liability on either side in respect of NAI 1325and NAI 1616 and the âvarious judicial proceedings arising therefromâ and that the settlement would ânegateâ the NAI 1325award, Benetton agreed to pay to ESCT the sums of US$42,086,470.69 and NLG 22,902,881.55 respectively, with both parties thereafterreleasing each other and waiving any claims, etc âarising out of or in connection with the [Licence Agreement], the partiesâconduct in connection therewith, the [related] litigation ..., and otherwise.â  It was, in other words, a global settlement.</p>        <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Pursuant to the FSA, payment of the settlement amounts were made to TrenitÃ© Van Doorne simultaneously with its execution.  In Eganaâsannual report dated 16 May 2000, it stated that a sum of about HK$338 million had been received in the Benetton settlement.  WhenMr Unruh became aware of the settlement, he pressed Mr Seeberger for payment of the Special Bonus under the MoA but to no avail. Eventually on 29 June 2000, S&amp;S rejected his claim.</p>        <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Four days later, on 3 July 2000, Mr Unruh issued the Writ in these proceedings against Mr Seeberger.  It was, however, not until9 November 2001, some 16 months later, that he sought leave to join Egana as a 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to this action.</p>        <p class="heading">C.

Thus, under the MoA Egana only becomes liable to pay the Special Bonus:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) if it has taken professional advice;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) if on the basis of that advice, Egana (presumably by its board) decides that it is lawful and prudent for it, as a company listedon the Stock Exchange, to pay the Special Bonus;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c) if its legal advisers have prepared the necessary documentation to give effect to such liability;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(d) if it has entered into that documentation with all necessary parties (obviously primarily Mr Unruh); and</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(e) if and only to the extent that monetary compensation exceeding US$10 million is received by ESCT in respect of the Arbitration.</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  It is common ground that, apart from (e), those conditions have never been met and that Egana acquired no liability to pay the SpecialBonus as envisaged by the MoA.  Mr Unruhâs case is simple.  He contends that in such circumstances, applying Clause 5âs proviso,Mr Seeberger is liable to pay.  This was accepted by both courts below.  The key words of the proviso are the following:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>Provided that, in the event that, in accordance with the provisions of this Clause, Egana does not pay the amount of any special bonuswhich would otherwise be due to Mr Unruh pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Clause, then Mr Seeberger shall pay the amount of anysuch special bonus in cash to Mr Unruh. </p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Mr Ho SC argues, to the contrary, that those words impose a duty on Mr Seeberger to pay only if, Egana having first entered intothe relevant documentation to make itself legally bound to pay, Egana should fail to meet its obligation.  He argues that this isso because the event which triggers Mr Seebergerâs liability to pay, is a failure on the part of Egana to pay âin accordancewith the provisions of this Clauseâ sums âwhich would otherwise be due to Mr Unruh.â  He contends that no sum could be âdueto Mr Unruhâ from Egana unless Egana had first assumed liability to pay âin accordance withâ the provisions concerning liability-creatingdocumentation.  Since Egana never took on such a liability, there has been no default and Mr Seebergerâs secondary liability topay does not arise.</p>        <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I am unable to accept that argument.  First, as a matter of language, as Mr Burns points out, Clause 5 does not make Mr Seebergerâsliability to pay conditional on Eganaâs failure to do so for any particular reason or in any particular circumstances.  The wordsbear no such qualification: so long as Egana has failed to pay within 28 days of receipt of the monetary compensation by ESCT âfor whatever reason, including the fact that Egana has never taken on liability to make the payment in the first place  â Mr Seebergerâsliability to pay is triggered, provided of course, that the US$10 million threshold set by paragraph (b) of the proviso is crossed.</p>        <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mr Ho sought to argue that this construction involves the illegitimate insertion of the words âfor any reasonâ to make the provisoread âfails for any reason to payâ.  That is not a valid objection.  To say that the condition is Eganaâs failure âfor anyreasonâ to pay does not add to or modify the meaning of the clause.  It merely emphasises that Eganaâs failure to pay is theunconditional trigger for Mr Seebergerâs liability.  On the other hand, I fully agree with the Judgeâs observation that Mr Hoâssuggested construction requires an unjustified re-writing of the condition.  His interpretation requires insertion (as formulatedby the Judge)<a>[15]</a> of the words âhaving entered into documentation to pay the Special Bonus and in breach of the provisions of such documentationâbefore the words âfails to payâ.  Such a construction does add a substantive qualification which is not to be found in the languageof the proviso and cannot be justified.</p>        <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The construction advanced on Mr Seebergerâs behalf also deprives Clause 5 of any sensible commercial purpose.  It attributes tothe parties the intention of catering contractually for the wholly unrealistic prospect of Egana, after having satisfied itself thatit is lawful and prudent to assume the liability and having gone ahead with executing the documentation to do so, proceeding to defaulton its obligations.  It is suggested that the proviso is there to impose a liability to pay on Mr Seeberger solely in the event ofsuch contingency.  I again respectfully agree with the Judgeâs comment<a>[16]</a> that:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...there is no sensible reason why Mr Unruh would require a personal guarantee of an obligation by a public company, once thatpublic company had itself entered into a commitment to pay.  On the other hand, with no present commitment to pay from Egana, andwith the future prospect that Egana may not, for legal or commercial reasons, be able itself to make a commitment to pay the SpecialBonus, there is every reason why Mr Unruh should require the personal guarantee of Mr Seeberger.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p> I take his Lordshipâs reference to âthe personal guarantee of Mr Seebergerâ to be an intended reference to Mr Seebergerâsacceptance of primary personal liability to pay under Clause 5.</p>        <p class="heading">C.3    The monetary compensation to be shared under the MoA</p>        <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The second argument of construction advanced on Mr Seebergerâs behalf concerns the intended scope of the MoA. </p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) The potential entitlement of Mr Unruh under the MoA relates to âmonetary compensation ... received by ESCT in respect of theArbitrationâ. </p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) Mr Ho submits that the definition of âthe Arbitrationâ in Clause 1(h) must be understood to refer exclusively to NAI 1325,which is  the only arbitration fitting the words there used (having been âcommenced by ESCT in 1991 in The Netherlands under theterms of [the Licence Agreement]â).</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c) He argues that the money received by ESCT as a result of the FSA dated 31 March 2000 was a global settlement and so cannot besaid to be âmonetary compensation ... received by ESCT <i>in respect of the Arbitration</i>â.  Indeed, it is to be noted that it was a condition of the FSA that the NAI 1325 award should be negated. </p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Mr Hoâs primary argument is therefore that the FSA settlement monies fall outside the scope of the MoA and that Mr Unruh accordinglyhas no entitlement to any part thereof.  Alternatively, since the sums received were paid by Benetton in settlement not only of NAI1325 but also of NAI 1616 and of the âvarious judicial proceedings arising therefromâ,<a>[17]</a> he argues that Mr Unruh can at best claim an entitlement to an apportioned amount representing 10% of the sums exceeding US$10 millionreceived in so far as such sums can be attributed specifically to Benettonâs settlement of NAI 1325.  Although it was initiallyhis argument that such an apportionment was not possible, at the hearing, he produced suggested figures for apportioned amounts.</p>        <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Mr Hoâs arguments were rejected by the Judge who concluded that âthe expression âthe Arbitrationâ, as used in the MoA, meansthe arbitration known as NAI 1325, and all proceedings flowing from it, including NAI 1616ââ.<a>[18]</a>  Rogers VP, with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed on this point, reached the same conclusion.<a>[19]</a>  I agree with the result arrived at in the courts below but on reasoning which focuses not so much on the meaning of the words âtheArbitrationâ, as on the MoAâs intended scope of application.</p>        <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  While it is clear that the parties to the MoA did indeed have in mind NAI 1325 (the only arbitration then in existence) when theyreferred to âthe Arbitrationâ, I do not accept that their intention was to exclude from the scope of the MoA any other arbitralor judicial proceedings that might flow from the dispute with Benetton over the Licence Agreement which had occasioned commencementof NAI 1325. </p>        <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  In defining âthe Arbitrationâ in Clause 1(h), the parties did not merely do so by referring to the Dutch seat of the arbitralproceedings and its year of commencement.  More importantly, they identified the agreement under which the arbitration arose andthe matter with which it was concerned, namely: âthe arbitration proceedings commenced ... under ... the licence agreement dated1st July 1986 entered into between [Bulova] (1) [Benetton] (2) and ESCT (3) in relation to the âBenetton by Bulovaâ brand name...â In other words, the MoA identified its area of concern as the Benetton dispute and the proceedings commenced to resolve it.  Itwas not seeking to limit the scope of its operation by reference to any particular arbitral, curial or procedural form which resolutionof that dispute might take.</p>        <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  This view is fortified by consideration of the relief claimed by ESCT in NAI 1325 which must be taken to have informed the mindsof the contracting parties when referring to that arbitration in the MoA.  It is clear, and the Judge and the Court of Appeal<a>[20]</a> so found, that as at 19 September 1992, the relief claimed in NAI 1325 encompassed all forms of potential relief flowing from Benettonâsrepudiation and from its refusal to negotiate an extension of the Licence Agreement.  The Judgeâs finding was in these terms:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...it is necessary to remember the scope of NAI 1325, as set out in the relief sought by ESCT in its Statement of Claim in thatproceeding.  ESCT sought first a declaration that the Licence Agreement was to continue in full force and effect, and second an orderthat Benetton continue to perform its obligations, including particularly, the extension negotiations obligation.  Damages were soughtby way of compensation, not only for the repudiation of the Licence Agreement, but also for ârelated misconductâ, which necessarilyincluded any breach of the extension negotiations obligation.  In the alternative, damages were sought to compensate ESCT for therepudiation, which damages were specifically expressed to include future profits covering both the remainder of the initial term,and the term of  the extension of the Licence Agreement.  Thus in NAI 1325, ESCT was already looking to monetary compensation forthe non-extension of the Licence Agreement.â<a>[21]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Although Mr Ho sought to question those findings, there is no doubt that they are correct.  The fact that subsequently, the Tribunaldecided to confine NAI 1325 to a claim for damages for the repudiation of the Licence Agreement, leaving the relief in respect ofthe non-extension claim to NAI 1616, does nothing to support Mr Hoâs argument.  Indeed, the Tribunalâs decision to narrow thescope of NAI 1325 serves to emphasise the fact that the relief originally sought encompassed all aspects of the Licence Agreementdispute.  That was the factual matrix in which the MoA was executed, strongly suggesting that while the parties made reference inthe agreement to the particular arbitration then in existence, they intended this as a reference to the entire process by which ESCTâsclaims arising out of the Licence Agreement against Benetton were to be pursued.</p>        <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  That conclusion receives further support from the terms of Clause 4(A).  That clause imposes on Mr Unruh an obligation to use hisbest endeavours to assist not only in connection with âthe Arbitrationâ but also âotherwise in respect of all outstanding proceedings,claims and otherwise to which ESCT is a party in any way whatsoever.â  This demonstrates that the parties must have realised thatwhile only NAI 1325 was on foot as at 19 September 1992, ESCT might become a party to other claims and proceedings.  The MoA thereforestipulated that, so long as such other claims and proceedings remained outstanding, Mr Unruhâs best endeavours would be requiredalso in connection therewith.  It is noteworthy that the Clause covers ESCT being made a party âin any way whatsoeverâ, indicatingthat the parties were not seeking to limit the best endeavours obligation to proceedings or claims taking any particular form. </p>        <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Mr Ho accepts that Clause 4(A) places this broad obligation on Mr Unruh â an obligation extending to claims and proceedings beyondâthe Arbitrationâ.  However, he seeks to maintain that when it comes to Clause 5, the MoAâs intention is to limit Mr Unruhâsrecompense to a participation solely in NAI 1325 proceeds.  The proposed asymmetry is inexplicable.  If, as Mr Hoâs argument mustadmit, the parties recognized, in Clause 4(A), that the Licence Agreement dispute might involve ESCT in proceedings other than NAI1325 and saw the necessity for securing Mr Unruhâs best endeavours in respect thereof, there is no sensible explanation as to whythe incentive provided by Clause 5 should have been excluded from applying equally to such endeavours. </p>        <p class="heading">C.4    Alleged failure to use best endeavours</p>        <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The next argument advanced on behalf of Mr Seeberger is that Mr Unruh failed to use his best endeavours as required by Clause 4(A)so that he does not qualify for the Special Bonus.  It is contended that satisfaction of the best endeavours obligation is a conditionprecedent to any entitlement to the Special Bonus. </p>        <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mr Seebergerâs pleaded case is that Mr Unruh breached the best endeavours obligation in one specific way, namely, by failing tomake timely disclosure of his German conviction and the Italian charges, the allegation being that the lateness of the disclosureprejudiced the preparation or conduct of ESCTâs case in the arbitration.  At the hearing, there was an attempt by Mr Ho to extendthis argument by suggesting that âthe very existenceâ of the Italian charges and German conviction âcoupled withâ their non-disclosureconstituted a breach which enabled Benetton to prolong the proceedings.</p>        <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In my view, the argument falls at the first hurdle since I can see nothing in the language of the MoA or otherwise to suggest thatcompliance with the best endeavours obligation is a condition precedent to payment of the Special Bonus.  In Mr Seebergerâs printedcase, it is asserted that there is no dispute as to Clause 4(A) having that status, relying on something said by Mr Unruh in evidence.<a>[22]</a>  However, it is a question of construction and hence of law whether a contractual term operates as a condition precedent.  The courtdecides the question objectively and not by reference to the subjective views of the parties to the contract. </p>        <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The structure of the MoA militates against the condition precedent argument.  Payment of the Special Bonus is regulated by Clause5.  So far as that Clause is concerned, two conditions must be satisfied before Mr Unruh is entitled to payment: (i) ESCT must havereceived monetary compensation in excess of US$10 million in respect of the Arbitration; and (ii) Egana must have failed to pay theSpecial Bonus within 28 days of ESCTâs receipt of the money, in which case Mr Seeberger must make payment at the end of that period.</p>        <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  It follows that Clause 5 makes entitlement to the Special Bonus depend on a substantially successful outcome to the claim, an outcomeyielding more than US$10 million in compensation.  If such success is not achieved, Mr Unruh receives no Special Bonus in any event,whether or not he had properly used his best endeavours under Clause 4(A).  But where that degree of success has been achieved andthe two conditions are satisfied, Clause 5 treats Mr Unruh as having earned his Special Bonus comprising a 10% share in the proceedswhich exceed US$10 million, setting a 28 day time-limit for payment to be made.  The language of Clause 5 therefore favours a clear-cutentitlement to payment within the prescribed period upon satisfaction of the stipulated conditions.</p>        <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Where such a substantial degree of success has been attained, any complaint that Mr Unruh may have failed to use his best endeavoursunder Clause 4(A) is inherently likely to involve a breach which is, in relative terms, minor.  This favours the conclusion thatthe parties must have intended that such a best endeavours complaint should sound only in damages and should not operate as a barto Mr Unruhâs entitlement if the requirements of Clause 5 have been met.  The structure of Clause 5 is therefore incompatible withthe condition precedent argument.  There was no counterclaim for damages for breach of Clause 4(A).</p>        <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The Judge<a>[23]</a> and the Court of Appeal<a>[24]</a> were both apparently prepared to entertain the best endeavours argument as potentially resulting in a bar to Mr Unruhâs claim. They found, however, that on the evidence, no breach had been established.  I respectfully agree and their concurrent findings areunassailable.</p>        <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The Judge found that by June 1992, Mr Conway, the lawyer who had the conduct of the claim for ESCT, was informed by Mr Unruh ofthe Italian charges and that by July 1993, all concerned had been made aware of the German conviction.  It was not until 1995, sometwo years later, that Benetton first sought to rely on those matters.  His Lordship found (particularly in the absence of Mr Conway)that there was simply no evidence to show that ESCT had been disadvantaged in any way by the disclosures not having been made earlier. As noted in section B.5 above, Benetton was comprehensively defeated on all fronts and the Netherlands Court of Appeal twice rejectedthe Italian and German convictions as irrelevant.  There is simply nothing to show that the preparation or conduct of the proceedingswere in any way hampered by the timing of the disclosures.</p>        <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  I turn next to Mr Hoâs suggestion that the breach of the best endeavours obligation consisted of âthe very existenceâ of theItalian and German issues âcoupled withâ a lack of timely disclosure since this permitted Benetton to prolong the proceedings. With respect, it is a difficult argument to understand.  If it turns on the âveryâ existence of the Italian and German issues,it is hard to see why the timeliness of disclosure is also mentioned.  If existence of the Italian and German issues cannot standas a ground without also showing that there was a lack of timely disclosure, then it adds nothing to the argument which I have justrejected.  On the other hand, if it is indeed an argument that rests solely on the very existence of the German conviction and theItalian charges (which, after October 1994, became the Italian conviction), then it is difficult to see how Mr Unruhâs conductwhich brought them about is capable of constituting a breach of his duty to use best endeavours to assist ESCT in connection withthe Arbitration, etc under Clause 4(A).  That obligation is executory.  It addresses the conduct required of Mr Unruh after entryinto the contract.  It does not impose contractual obligations of a different character.  It does not operate as a warranty for theabsence of incidents in his past which might have a bearing on his assisting in the Arbitration.  No such warranty was given in theMoA.  Mr Seebergerâs best endeavours argument must accordingly fail.</p>        <p class="heading">C.5    Champerty</p>        <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The next argument is that the MoA is unenforceable because it is champertous and contrary to public policy in that it is an agreementfor Mr Unruh to share in the proceeds of ESCTâs arbitration against Benetton in return for his assistance in its prosecution.</p>        <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr Unruh submits that this argument should be rejected on three grounds: (i) because the agreement is not champertous since it isclear that he had a genuine commercial interest in rendering assistance in the arbitration and receiving a share of the proceeds;(ii) that even if the agreement might domestically be regarded as champertous, it is not against public policy in Hong Kong to enforcesuch an agreement since it involved assisting in an arbitration taking place in a jurisdiction where maintenance and champerty arenot contrary to public policy; and (iii) that maintenance and champerty do not apply to arbitrations at all, whether domestic orinternational.  I shall endeavour to set out the applicable principles before seeking to apply them to the questions in issue.</p>        <p class="heading">C.5a  Maintenance and champerty in Hong Kong</p>        <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The origins of maintenance and champerty are ancient and obscure.  English statutes from at least the 13<sup>th</sup> century were enacted to deal with champerty and maintenance, but there is a solid body of authority for concluding that they havetheir origins in the common law and were supplemented by statute.<a>[25]</a>  Thus, in <i>Neville v London âExpressâ Newspaper Limited</i>, Lord Finlay LC stated as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...maintenance is a common law offence. It is true that various statutes were passed inflicting particular penalties upon variouskinds of maintenance. The statutes are 3 Edw I c 28, 28 Edw I c 11, 1 Edw III c 14, 1 Rich II c 4, and 32 Hen VIII c 9.  Some ofthem relate particularly to the abuse of maintenance by the Kingâs officers and to maintenance by false evidence or other sinistermeans, which would, of course, be an aggravation of the offence, but none of them in any way cut down the common law upon the subject.â<a>[26]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The view has generally been taken that maintenance and champerty form part of Hong Kong law.<a>[27]</a> In <i>Low Chun Song v Ka Wah Bank Ltd</i>,<a>[28]</a> the Court of Appeal was content to take that for granted.  In <i>Cannonway Consultants Limited v Kenworth Engineering Ltd</i>, decided in 1994, Kaplan J held that they applied by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/88/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/88" class="autolink_findacts">Application of English Law Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/88">Cap 88</a>), which imported the common law and rules of equity into Hong Kong.<a>[29]</a>  I respectfully agree.  The common law rules making maintenance and champerty criminal offences, torts and a ground of public policyfor invalidating tainted contracts, were part of Hong Kong law prior to 1997 and remain applicable by virtue of Article 8 of theBasic Law.<a>[30]</a> </p>        <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In England and Wales, the position was changed by the Criminal Law Act 1967.  Section 13(1) abolishes âany distinct offence underthe common law of England and Wales of maintenance (including champerty, but not embracery<a>[31]</a>)â.  And s 14(1) provides:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âNo person shall, under the law of England and Wales, be liable in tort for any conduct on account of its being maintenance or champertyas known to the common law ...â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  However, s 14(2) of the 1967 Act contains an important saving in the following terms:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe abolition of criminal and civil liability under the law of England and Wales for maintenance and champerty shall not affectany rule of that law as to the cases in which a contract is to be treated as contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  It follows that the rules relating to maintenance and champerty survive in England for the purposes of deciding whether contractsare invalidated on such grounds.  This gives continued relevance to post-1967 developments in English case-law, although in our jurisdiction,where no equivalent to the 1967 Act exists, such authorities bear not only on the enforceability of contracts, but also on potentialtortious and criminal liability.  The same applies to the Australian jurisprudence in the field.<a>[32]</a> </p>        <p class="heading">C.5b  The changing content of maintenance and champerty</p>        <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Definitions of maintenance<a>[33]</a> and champerty<a>[34]</a> given over the centuries have retained a notable similarity.  As Lord Coleridge CJ stated in <i>Bradlaugh v Newdegate</i>:<a>[35]</a> âThere are many definitions of maintenance, all seeming to express the same idea.â  Among the older definitions of maintenancewhich his Lordship lists are those of Blackstone and Coke:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âBlackstone calls it âan officious intermeddling in a suit which no way belongs to one by maintaining or assisting either partywith money or otherwise to prosecute or defend itâ.<a>[36]</a> âMaintenance,â says Lord Coke, âsignifieth in law a taking in hand, bearing up, or upholding of a quarrel, or side, to thedisturbance or hindrance of common right.â<a>[37]</a>â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  An early definition of champerty cited by Scrutton LJ in <i>Haseldine v Hosken</i>,<a>[38]</a> taken from the statute 33 Edw I, stat 2,<a>[39]</a> is as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âChampertors be they that move pleas and suits, or cause to be moved either by their own procurement, or by others, and sue themat their proper costs for to have part of the land in variance, or part of the gains.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Echoes of Coke and Blackstone can be heard in <i>British Cash and Parcel Conveyors, Ltd v Lamson Store Service Co Ltd</i><a>[40]</a> where Fletcher Moulton LJ described maintenance in the following terms:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIt is directed against wanton and officious intermeddling with the disputes of others in which the defendant has no interest whatever,and where the assistance he renders to the one or the other party is without justification or excuse.â<a>[41]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  As to champerty, Lord Finlay LC stated in the <i>London âExpressâ</i> case as follows:<a>[42]</a> </p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âChamperty is a form of maintenance, and occurs when the person maintaining another takes as his reward a portion of the propertyin dispute.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p>As the statute of Edward I had indicated, that which marks out champerty from other forms of maintenance is âthe notion of a divisionof the spoilsâ.<a>[43]</a> </p>        <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  However, one must not be misled by the similarity between the early and the modern definitions.  The resemblance lies merely onthe surface.  The prohibition of maintenance and champerty is a matter of public policy and involves a value judgment that certainconduct should be considered âofficious intermeddlingâ in someone elseâs litigation or âtrafficking in litigationâ whichdeserves to be made unlawful.  Unsurprisingly, the content of that value judgment has fundamentally changed, reflecting the radicaldevelopment of society in general and of the legal system in particular over the last seven hundred years. </p>        <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  The early law of maintenance and champerty evolved in an age when:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe mechanisms of justice lacked the internal strength to resist the oppression of private individuals through suits fomented andsustained by unscrupulous men of power.  Champerty was particularly vicious, since the purchase of a share in litigation presentedan obvious temptation to the suborning of justices and witnesses and the exploitation of worthless claims which the defendant lackedthe resources and influence to withstand.â<i> </i><a>[44]</a> </p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In its attempts to bridle such abuses, the early law laid down stringent constraints on participation in other peopleâs litigation. As Lord Coleridge CJ stated, â...the danger of the oppression of poor men by rich men, through the means of legal proceedings,was great and pressing; so that the judges of those days, wisely according to the facts of those days, took strict views on the subjectof maintenance.â<a>[45]</a>  To take one example, it was in olden times the offence of maintenance to give evidence without being subpoenaed to do so â a propositionwhich sounds bizarre when it is today regarded âas part of the duty of citizens to be ready and willing to assist the administrationof justice by giving evidence when they can do so usefullyâ.<a>[46]</a>  Another aspect of such stringency was the common lawâs view that choses in action were not assignable at all.  While that rulewas mitigated by equityâs recognition of equitable assignments, equity nevertheless refused to permit assignments of a âbarecause of actionâ because it âsavoured of maintenanceâ.<a>[47]</a></p>        <p class="heading">C.5c  The shrinking scope of maintenance and champerty</p>        <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The early policy imperatives have long gone and by the 19<sup>th</sup> century, it was widely recognized that maintenance and champerty had acquired a wholly different complexion.  Thus, in 1883 LordColeridge CJ stated that the old authorities âhold a multitude of things to be maintenance which would not be held so now ...â<a>[48]</a>  And in 1982, Lord Roskill commented that in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, âthe courts have adopted an infinitely more liberal attitude towards the supporting of litigation by a third party thanhad previously been the case.â<a>[49]</a></p>        <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  This change has been achieved by the common law in typical fashion.  To cite Fletcher Moulton LJ again:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe present legal doctrine of maintenance is due to an attempt on the part of the Courts to carve out of the old law such remnantas is in consonance with our modern notions of public policy...â<a>[50]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  The âcarving outâ process has produced a catalogue of various instances where conduct which would otherwise constitute maintenanceor champerty has been excluded from the sphere of such liability.  This prompted Fletcher Moulton LJ to remark that âit is fareasier to say what is not maintenance than to say what is maintenance.â<a>[51]</a> </p>        <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  One category of excluded cases involves what may be called the âcommon interestâ category.  Certain relationships have beenjudicially recognized as involving persons with a legitimate common interest in the outcome of litigation sufficient to justify oneof them in supporting the litigation conducted by another without engaging the prohibition against maintenance and champerty.  Thus,in the <i>London âExpressâ</i> case,<a>[52]</a> Lord Finlay LC, citing an 1824 edition of Hawkinsâ Pleas of the Crown, notes that acts otherwise constituting maintenance:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... may be justified in various cases - eg, if there is an interest in the thing at variance, in respect of kindred or affinity,in respect of other relations as lord and tenant or master and servant, or in respect of charity. In s 26, p 460, the learned authorsays: âIt seems to be agreed, that anyone may lawfully give money to a poor man to enable him to carry on his suit.ââ</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  And Lord Coleridge CJ commented that:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... in all these cases the interest spoken of is an actual valuable interest in the result of the suit itself, either present,or contingent, or future, or the interest which consanguinity or affinity to the suitor give to the man who aids him, or the interestarising from the connection of the parties, eg, as master and servant, or that which charity and compassion give a man in behalfof a poor man who, but for the aid of his rich helper, could not assert his rights, or would be oppressed and overborne in his endeavourto maintain them.â <a>[53]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Clearly, this âcommon interestâ category is not closed.  Public policy is likely to regard groups and associations pursuinglegitimate objectives as possessing a sufficient common interest in related litigation to warrant their exclusion from the scopeof maintenance and champerty.  One example is <i>Martell v Consett Iron Co Ltd</i><a>[54]</a><i> </i>where it was held that an association formed to protect fisheries and to prevent the pollution of rivers had a sufficient common interestfor it lawfully to support an action brought by members who claimed that their fishery was being polluted by effluents from the defendantâsironworks.</p>        <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  A second excluded category involves what might today be referred to as cases involving âaccess to justiceâ considerations. In Hong Kong, Article 85 of the Basic Law recognizes access to the courts as a fundamental right.<a>[55]</a>  It has never been a defence to an action nor a ground for a stay to show that the plaintiff is being supported by a third personin an arrangement which constitutes maintenance or champerty.<a>[56]</a>  Neither does liability for maintenance or champerty depend on the action or the defence being bad in law.<a>[57]</a>  It follows that an attack on an arrangement said to constitute maintenance or champerty could well result in a claim which is perfectlygood in law being stifled where the plaintiff, deprived of the support of such an  arrangement, is unable to pursue it.  This isa powerful argument for such cases to be excluded from the ambit of maintenance and champerty.  This was recognized by the PrivyCouncil in <i>Ram Coomar Coondoo v Chunder Canto Mookerjee</i><a>[58]</a> where their Lordships stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...a fair agreement to supply funds to carry on a suit in consideration of having a share of the property, if recovered, oughtnot to be regarded as being, per se, opposed to public policy. Indeed, cases may be easily supposed in which it would be in furtheranceof right and justice, and necessary to resist oppression, that a suitor who had a just title to property, and no means except theproperty itself, should be assisted in this manner.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in <i>R (Factortame Ltd) v Transport Secretary (No 8)</i><a>[59]</a> recently placed conditional fees in the same context, stating:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âConditional fees are now permitted in order to give effect to another facet of public policy â the desirability of access tojustice. Conditional fees are designed to ensure that those who do not have the resources to fund advocacy or litigation servicesshould none the less be able to obtain these in support of claims which appear to have merit.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  It is again obvious that this access to justice category is not static.  The development of policies and measures to promote suchaccess is likely to enlarge the category and to result in further shrinkage in the scope of maintenance and champerty.  Differentmeasures, whether statutory or judicial, may be taken in different jurisdictions.  Here in Hong Kong, a litigant who is funded bythe Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme is required to make a contribution out of recovered proceeds for the benefit of the Fund.<a>[60]</a> In England and Wales, conditional (but not contingency) legal fee agreements have received statutory support in certain types ofcases.<a>[61]</a>   This has entailed the development of after the event insurance against adverse costs orders.<a>[62]</a>  The development of multi-party litigation or class actions raises questions concerning the conduct of promoters and funders of suchlitigation.<a>[63]</a></p>        <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Thirdly, there exists a miscellaneous category of practices accepted as lawful even though, as pointed out by Gummow, Hayne andCrennan JJ in the recent decision of the Australian High Court in <i>Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd</i>,<a>[64]</a> such practices do not differ in substance from practices which have traditionally been roundly condemned.  Their Honours refer tothe sale and assignment by a trustee in bankruptcy of an action commenced in the bankruptcy to a purchaser for value; and the developmentof the doctrine of subrogation as applied to contracts of insurance as instances.</p>        <p class="heading">C.5d  The current approach to maintenance and champerty</p>        <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  The foregoing discussion shows that the thrust of legal development has been (as Fletcher Moulton LJ pointed out) to carve out areasof conduct for exclusion from liability, forming what was referred to in <i>Campbells Cash and Carry</i> as a âpatchwork of exceptions and qualificationsâ.<a>[65]</a>  But by what criteria is one able to determine that certain conduct <i>does</i> attract liability under those heads?  That question translates into one asking: What are the considerations of modern public policywhich result in conduct being characterised as maintenance or champerty?  In particular, what public policy considerations resultin a contract being vitiated on grounds of maintenance or champerty?  I would make four points in answer.</p>        <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  In the first place, the traditional legal policies underlying maintenance and champerty continue to apply although they must substantiallybe qualified by other considerations.  Thus, the mischief to be discouraged by the law of maintenance is still âofficious intermeddlingâin litigation, in particular where this results in oppression of the person against whom the action is brought and possibly if itmay result in the general encouragement of litigiousness.  Thus, the Privy Council in <i>Ram Coomar Coondoo v Chunder Canto Mookerjee</i>,<a>[66]</a> recognized that funding a poor personâs litigation might advance the cause of justice, but their Lordships added that such fundingagreements âought to be carefully watchedâ because of the risk, among other things, that the arrangement may involve âabettingand encouraging unrighteous suits, so as to be contrary to public policyâ.</p>        <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  The public policy against champerty has traditionally involved two concerns and continues to do so. </p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) The first is that an agreement to share in the spoils of litigation may encourage the perversion of justice and endanger the integrityof judicial processes.  As Lord Denning MR put it in <i>In re Trepca Mines Ltd (No 2)</i>:<a>[67]</a> âThe common law fears that the champertous maintainer might be tempted, for his own personal gain, to inflame the damages, to suppressevidence, or even to suborn witnesses.â</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) Next, a champertous arrangement may be objectionable in that it involves a stranger to the litigation in âtraffickingâ orâgamblingâ in the outcome of the litigation.  Thus, in <i>Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse</i>, an assignment was struck down as champertous because it â... involved the possibility, and indeed the likelihood, of a profitbeing made, [by a third party with no genuine commercial interest in the transaction] out of the cause of action â¦ [which] manifestlyâsavours of champerty,â since it involves trafficking in litigation â a type of transaction which, under English law, is contraryto public policy.â <a>[68]</a>  Such activity is obviously unacceptable to the court which sees its role as the administration of justice and not the provisionof a market for speculators in litigation.</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Secondly, the fact that an arrangement may be caught by the broad definitions of maintenance or champerty is not in itself sufficientto found liability.  The totality of the facts must be examined asking whether they pose a genuine risk to the integrity of the courtâsprocesses.  In <i>R (Factortame Ltd) v Transport Secretary (No 8)</i>,<a>[69]</a> Lord Phillips MR stated: â... one must today look at the facts of the particular case and consider whether those facts suggestthat the agreement in question might tempt the allegedly champertous maintainer for his personal gain to inflame the damages, tosuppress evidence, to suborn witnesses or otherwise to undermine the ends of justice.â  It is not enough simply to say that itis the type of agreement which âsavours ofâ champerty. </p>        <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Thirdly, countervailing public policies must be taken into account, especially policies in favour of ensuring access to justiceand of recognizing, where appropriate, legitimate common interests of a social or commercial character in a piece of litigation. The traditional public policies against intermeddling in litigation must be weighed against such competing values and if the balanceis in favour of the latter, the conduct complained of should not be regarded as contrary to public policy.</p>        <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Fourthly, it is important not to confuse related but separate policies with those which properly underlie the operation of maintenanceand champerty.  For example, an agreement to take a share of litigation proceeds may be primarily objectionable because it involvesthe unconscionable exploitation of a vulnerable litigant.<a>[70]</a>  Or it may be considered objectionable for solicitors to enter into such an arrangement because it is thought likely to give riseto conflicts between the solicitorâs interest in financial gain and his duties to the court and to the client.<a>[71]</a>  It may be right to strike down the  arrangement in some cases.  But in others, doing so (and characterising the conduct as criminal)in reliance on the law of maintenance and champerty may be to use too blunt an instrument.  It may, for instance, result in the litigantbeing left with no means to pursue a good claim.  Resort might more appropriately be had in such cases to other doctrines and remediesmore suited to granting relief to the exploited party or to confronting professional misconduct.</p>        <p class="heading">C.5e  The principles applied: genuine commercial interest</p>        <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  There can be no doubt that Mr Unruh independently had a genuine commercial interest in the outcome of the arbitration.  His positionas at 19 September 1992 is examined in section B.3 above.  He was legitimately interested in the arbitration as the means wherebythe value of the asset which he had sold to Egana in an independent business transaction was to be realized.  He was legitimatelyinterested in realizing for himself at the same time what is properly regarded as a deferred part of the consideration he was toreceive for that sale.  As he was uniquely placed to deal factually with Benettonâs complaints, there is no basis for suggestingthat his participation as a witness in the arbitration was in any way artificial or likely to pose a genuine risk to the integrityof the arbitral process. </p>        <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Mr Chang did not make any submissions to the contrary.  His primary argument was that a genuine commercial interest does not availto prevent the MoA, with its provisions for sharing the arbitrationâs proceeds, from being champertous.  He contended that whilea legitimate common interest, including a genuine commercial interest in the proceedings, negatives maintenance, champerty standson a different footing, being regarded by the law as so obnoxious that it cannot be justified by any such interest.</p>        <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  That argument relies on a dictum of Millett LJ (as he then was) in <i>Thai Trading Co v Taylor</i>,<a>[72]</a> a decision of the English Court of Appeal which (as we shall see) is of a problematical status, although such status does not affectthe structure of Mr Changâs argument.  In <i>Thai Trading</i>, a woman successfully brought an action against the defendant.  Her husband, who was a solicitor, had acted for her.  The trial judgefound that he had done so on the footing that he would not charge her if the action failed but would charge his normal fees if theaction succeeded.  This was referred to as a âconditional normal feeâ agreement and the judge held it to be champertous and voidso that the losing side did not have to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of such costs.  Millett LJ, giving the reasoned judgmentof the Court of Appeal, decided that the Judge was wrong and that a conditional normal fee is not champertous.<a>[73]</a>  Plainly, there was a sufficient common interest by virtue of their relationship as man and wife to justify the husband helping theplaintiff in her litigation, so that such help did not constitute maintenance.  Nor did the arrangement become champertous by virtueof the conditional normal fee arrangement.  Accordingly, there is nothing in the ratio of the decision to assist Mr Changâs argumentthat one should differentiate between grounds capable of justifying what would be maintenance as opposed to champerty. </p>        <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  However, it is fair to say that Millett LJ may have accepted obiterthat, notwithstanding the arrangement falling outside the lawof maintenance by virtue of the partiesâ common interest, it would still theoretically have been possible for the husbandâs conductto constitute champerty if the conditional normal fee had been found to be champertous.  Mr Chang seeks to argue that, by analogy,while a genuine commercial interest may prevent the MoA from constituting maintenance, such interest does not save it from beingchampertous.  The dictum of Millett LJ relied on is as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âChamperty was described by Scrutton LJ in <i>Ellis v Torrington</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1920%5d%201%20KB%20399" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1920] 1 K.B. 399</a>, 412 as âonly a particular form of maintenance, namely, where the person who maintains takes as a reward a share in the propertyrecovered.â This last formulation does not assume that the maintenance is unlawful. There can be no champerty if there is no maintenance;but there can still be champerty even if the maintenance is not unlawful.  The public policy which informs the two doctrines is differentand allows for different exceptions.â<a>[74]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  The <i>Thai Trading</i> case is problematical because it was subsequently held in <i>Awwad v Geraghty &amp; Co (a firm)</i><a>[75]</a> to have been decided <i>per incuriam</i> in relation to the status of certain Law Society Rules which have no bearing on this appeal.  The Court of Appeal in <i>Awwad</i> also differed from <i>Thai Trading</i>,holding that a conditional normal fee agreement <i>is</i> contrary to public policy.  However, that decision does not advance Mr Changâs argument either because it involved no separaterelationship between the solicitor and the client (unlike the solicitor and his wife in <i>Thai Trading</i>) where the fee arrangement might avoid maintenance but nonetheless attract liability for champerty.  (I would interject here thatI wish expressly to leave open the question whether the <i>Thai Trading</i> approach or the <i>Awwad</i> approach to conditional normal fee arrangements should be adopted in Hong Kong.  As Schiemann LJ pointed out in <i>Awwad</i>, this is an area âin which judicial perceptions have differed and in which there has been much public ... debate.â<a>[76]</a>  His Lordship also noted that âthere are substantial arguments in favour of the enforceability of normal fee agreementsâ as wellas arguments on the other side.<a>[77]</a>)</p>        <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  I have no hesitation in rejecting Mr Changâs argument that a genuine commercial interest does not avail against a charge of champerty. Such an argument was advanced and convincingly rejected both by the Court of Appeal<a>[78]</a> and the House of Lords<a>[79]</a> in <i>Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse</i>.  Thus, Oliver LJ, having referred to counselâs argument, stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...I am unable to follow why, once it is established that there is a sufficient interest in a third party to justify his supportinganotherâs action, that interest should not equally justify his participating in the proceeds of the action, for instance by takinga charge on such proceeds for what is due to him and for expenses incurred in supporting the litigation. It is perfectly true thatin <i>In re Trepca Mines Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20Ch%20199" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] Ch 199</a>, 219, Lord Denning MR observed that champerty was a species of maintenance for which the common law rarely admits of any just causeor excuse, but that was in the context of an agreement under which the third party who supported the litigation had no conceivableinterest in it beyond that which he had acquired by purchasing a share in it. ... If, therefore, the supporting of the action isitself justified by a sufficient interest in the person lending support, so that he does not (or did not prior to 1967) commit theoffence of maintenance, the fact that he participates in the proceeds cannot logically render him guilty of an offence which, bydefinition, depends upon his also being guilty of maintenance.â<a>[80]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  In the House of Lords,<a>[81]</a> the vice was held not to lie in Credit Suisse taking an assignment of Trendtexâs action against the Central Bank of Nigeria âCredit Suisse having had ample commercial justification for doing so â but in the fact that Credit Suisse intended to re-sell theclaim to a third party who had no genuine commercial interest in the pre-existing transactions.  Lord Wilberforce stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIf no party had been involved in the agreement of January 4, 1978, but Trendtex and Credit Suisse, I think that it would have beendifficult to contend that the agreement, even if it involved (as I think it did) an assignment of Trendtexâs residual interestin the CBN case, offended against the law of maintenance or champerty. As I have already shown, Credit Suisse had a genuine and substantialinterest in the success of the CBN litigation.â<a>[82]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  This aspect of the House of Lordsâ decision was summarised by Lloyd LJ in <i>Brownton Ltd v Edward Moore Inbucon Ltd</i>,<a>[83]</a> as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â(i) Maintenance is justified, inter alia, if the maintainer has a genuine commercial interest in the result of the litigation. (ii) There is no difference between the interest required to justify maintenance of an action and the interest required to justifythe taking of a share in the proceeds, or the interest required to support an out-and-out assignment...â<a>[84]</a> </p>        </blockquote>        <p> That summary was adopted by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <i>Low Chun Song v Ka Wah Bank Ltd</i>.<a>[85]</a></p>        <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  I respectfully agree with the reasoning in those cases and can see no basis in logic or policy for holding that a genuine commercialinterest sufficient to eliminate maintenance from the equation will not suffice to avoid liability for champerty.  As I have alreadyindicated, nothing in the ratio of <i>Thai Trading</i> supports the contrary proposition advanced by Mr Chang in his original argument.  Moreover, both <i>Thai Trading</i> and <i>Awwad</i> were cases concerning fees chargeable by solicitors with particular duties owed by them as officers of the court, raising aspectsof public policy of no present relevance. </p>        <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  In the course of argument, Mr Chang modified his argument to propose instead that while a genuine commercial interest <i>may</i> provide a justification for an otherwise champertous arrangement, this was only so where the court was satisfied that the potentialgain under the relevant agreement is proportionate to the value of the maintainerâs commercial interest.  I do not accept the correctnessof that proposition. </p>        <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  In <i>Advanced Technology Structures Ltd v Cray Valley Products Ltd, Pratt v Cray Valley Products Ltd</i>,<a>[86]</a> a company purported to assign its cause of action against a defendant company to an individual who was an employee of the company. The assignment was held to be a sham entered into with a view to that individual pursuing the companyâs claim at the expense ofthe legal aid fund.  It was also held to be champertous.  Hirst LJ accepted, on the basis of <i>Trendtex</i>, that âwhere an assignee can show that he has a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of a claim assigned to him, he doesnot fall foul of the rules against champerty.â<a>[87]</a>  However, in that case, the individual had a claim for arrears of salary against the company totalling a mere Â£10,000 while theasserted value of the assigned claim was in the region of Â£10 million.  Commenting that while âthere could be no objection toan assignee with a genuine commercial interest in the fruits of litigation obtaining a reasonable profitâ citing <i>Browntonâs case</i>,<a>[88]</a> his Lordship held that these figures were âmassively disproportionateâ making the assignment champertous. </p>        <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  This case should not be read as placing some duty on the court to consider whether the potential return on an allegedly champertousarrangement is proportionate in value to the third partyâs pre-existing commercial interest in the litigation.  Such an enquirywould require a full-blown trial which the court would be ill-placed to conduct.  Rather, this case suggests that a potential returnmay be so vastly disproportionate to the interest alleged as to call into question the genuineness (as opposed to the proportionality)of the commercial interest asserted.  There is, in any event, no basis for suggesting that the Special Bonus provided for by Clause5 was to any degree disproportionate to Mr Unruhâs genuine commercial interest in the outcome of the arbitration.</p>        <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  It follows that the challenge to the MoA as a champertous agreement fails both in respect of Mr Seeberger and, to the extent thatit is relevant, of Egana.  Although this disposes of the champerty ground, it may nevertheless be useful to deal briefly with thealternative argument advanced on Mr Unruhâs behalf regarding Hong Kong public policy on maintenance and champerty in relation toarbitrations in foreign jurisdictions where objections on such grounds do not form part of their public policy.</p>        <p class="heading">C.5f   Public policy regarding foreign proceedings and arbitrations</p>        <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  It is common ground that the doctrines of maintenance and champerty are unknown to Netherlands law.  It is, in other words, notagainst Netherlands public policy for a third person to provide assistance or support to a party to an arbitration or to legal proceedingsin that jurisdiction, whether or not for a share in the proceeds.  Assuming for the purposes of this argument that the MoA would,as a matter of purely domestic law be regarded as champertous, should the court refuse to enforce it, being a contract made in HongKong and subject to Hong Kong law, on the ground that it is champertous notwithstanding the absence of objection under Netherlandslaw?</p>        <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  In my view, as a matter of principle, Hong Kong public policy should not invalidate such a contract.  As discussed in section C.5cof this judgment, considerations regarding access to justice are of increasing importance in discussions of public policy in thisarea.  Access to a court is recognized internationally as a fundamental right and the many countries which have acceded to relevantinternational instruments can be expected to pursue measures appropriate to their individual circumstances to give effect to thatright.  They will strike their own balances between countervailing demands, determining the scope to be accorded to that right inthe light of their resources, institutions and traditions.  Moreover, as we have noted, public policy in a particular jurisdictionin this respect is apt to change.  The continued retention by Hong Kong of criminal and tortious liability for maintenance and champertymay not be justified and this question merits serious legislative attention.  This makes it particularly inappropriate for Hong Kongto seek to impose its current public policy against maintenance and champerty on mature commercial parties (who are likely to includeforeigners) who have chosen to arbitrate in a jurisdiction which does not recognize those concepts and who may accordingly have madearrangements in Hong Kong to finance the arbitral (or judicial) proceedings without being aware of any constraints. </p>        <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Similar concerns were voiced in <i>Trendtex</i> in the Court of Appeal where Oliver LJ stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe judge in the instant case said:  âI must confess to being unhappy that a transaction which business men in Switzerland maywell regard as so unobjectionable that they would enter into it without appreciating that there was any possibility of its beingineffective, should be held to be contrary to public policy in this country.â I share that unhappiness.â<a>[89]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  No direct authority was cited on the question under discussion, but such dicta as exist are against invalidation of such contracts.</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) Thus, in <i>In re Trepca Mines Ltd (No 2)</i>,<a>[90]</a> Lord Denning MR in discussing contracts which were champertous and to be performed in England, remarked: âIf they had concernedFrench litigation, they might have been lawful, because I understand champerty is lawful in France.â  </p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) This was referred to with approval in the Court of Appeal in <i>Giles v Thompson</i>,<a>[91]</a> Steyn LJ stating:</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âAn agreement of a champertous nature made in England is valid if it relates to litigation in a country where champerty is lawful.This illustrates that one is not dealing with an overriding public policy, which applies whenever the agreement is made or to beperformed, such as an agreement to pay a bribe abroad.

The case has therefore been argued throughouton the footing that in applying the law of estoppel, it remains necessary to distinguish among different categories of estoppel,each constituted by particular elements and carrying legal consequences which may vary.  Retention of this approach is championedin the valuable treatise on estoppel by Justice K R Handley, recently published.<a>[93]</a>  The learned author succinctly highlights differentiating aspects of some of the categories in the following summary:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âEstoppel by deed, by grant, and by convention are common law doctrines which preclude contradiction but do not require a changeof position induced by belief in the truth of facts.  Estoppel by representation, developed in equity and borrowed by law, precludescontradiction if the representeeâs belief in the truth of the representation induced a detrimental change of position and the rightsof the parties are governed by the facts as represented.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">Proprietary and promissory estoppels are equitable.  Proprietary estoppel by encouragement enforces proprietary expectations whichthe person estopped has created or encouraged when their repudiation would be unconscionable.  Proprietary estoppel by standing byenforces an equity against the fraud of an owner who seeks to rely on his property rights to profit from the known mistake of another. Promissory estoppel is a defensive equity which restrains the enforcement of positive rights by a person whose promises induceda change of position which makes such enforcement inequitable.  The distinctly equitable estoppels change the rights of the parties,while the others change them indirectly by changing the facts.  Each form has a separate history and a distinct source in law orin equity.  The various rationales â recital, grant, convention, representation, positive promise or encouragement, fraud and mistake,and negative promise are different.  There is no single over-arching principle.â<a>[94]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  This reflects the approach generally adopted in common law jurisdictions.  I will take a like approach.  Invitations to adopt aunifying theory of estoppel, whereby all disparate heads of estoppel are treated as having merged into a single over-arching doctrinegiving rise to a directly enforceable equity have been declined on a number of occasions.<a>[95]</a></p>        <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  At the same time, it should be acknowledged that while they have so far not carried the day, powerful judicial voices have beenheard in support of such a unifying theory.<a>[96]</a>  The learned authors of the current edition of <i>Spencer Bower</i><a>[97]</a> express sympathy with such a doctrine and suggest that there may be âfuture development of the law to remove the obstacles to mergerof the doctrines based on detrimental reliance in terms of over-arching principleâ for the benefit of âdoctrinal coherence, clarityand flexibilityâ.  This is plainly an area where the law continues to develop. </p>        <p class="heading">D.2    Estoppel by convention: statements of principle</p>        <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Statements of principle by Dixon J in two cases in the Australian High Court in the 1930âs have proved extremely influential inthe development of estoppel by convention in the common law world.<a>[98]</a>  In <i>Thompson v Palmer</i>,<a>[99]</a> he identified an estoppel founded on an âassumption [which] formed the conventional basis upon which the parties entered into contractualor other mutual relations, such as bailmentâ as a distinct species of estoppel in pais (by conduct) at common law, stating:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basisof some act or omission which, unless the assumption be adhered to, would operate to that otherâs detriment. Whether a departureby a party from the assumption should be considered unjust and inadmissible depends on the part taken by him in occasioning its adoptionby the other party.  He may be required to abide by the assumption because it formed the conventional basis upon which the partiesentered into contractual or other mutual relations, such as bailment; or because he has exercised against the other party rightswhich would exist only if the assumption were correct, [as in the authorities cited<a>[100]</a>] ... or because knowing the mistake the other laboured under, he refrained from correcting him when it was his duty to do so; orbecause his imprudence, where care was required of him, was a proximate cause of the other partyâs adopting and acting upon thefaith of the assumption; or because he directly made representations upon which the other party founded the assumption.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  In <i>Grundt v The Great Boulder Proprietary Gold Mines Ltd</i>,<a>[101]</a> his Honour explained the object of this estoppel:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe principle upon which estoppel in pais is founded is that the law should not permit an unjust departure by a party from an assumptionof fact which he has caused another party to adopt or accept for the purpose of their legal relations. ...... One condition appearsalways to be indispensable.  That other must have so acted or abstained from acting upon the footing of the state of affairs assumedthat he would suffer a detriment if the opposite party were afterwards allowed to set up rights against him inconsistent with theassumption. ... [The basal purpose of the doctrine] ... is to avoid or prevent a detriment to the party asserting the estoppel bycompelling the opposite party to adhere to the assumption upon which the former acted or abstained from acting.  This means thatthe real detriment or harm from which the law seeks to give protection is that which would flow from the change of position if theassumption were deserted that led to it.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  By 1998, in <i>The âIndian Enduranceâ</i>,Lord Steyn was able to state that the doctrine was well-settled: </p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIt is settled that an estoppel by convention may arise where parties to a transaction act on an assumed state of facts or law,the assumption being either shared by them both or made by one and acquiesced in by the other. The effect of an estoppel by conventionis to preclude a party from denying the assumed facts or law if it would be unjust to allow him to go back on the assumption.<a>[102]</a> It is not enough that each of the two parties acts on an assumption not communicated to the other. But it was rightly accepted bycounsel for both parties that a concluded agreement is not a requirement for an estoppel by convention.â<a>[103]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  I turn to a consideration of the elements of estoppel by convention in greater detail.</p>        <p class="heading">D.3    The common assumption</p>        <p class="heading">D.3a  The commonality of the assumption</p>        <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  As the statements of principle make clear, the parties must enter into some legal relationship on the basis of an assumption thatis shared by or common to them both.  The commonality of the assumption is what marks out estoppel by convention as a distinct formof estoppel. </p>        <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  In this respect, it may differ from an estoppel by representation.  The origin of the common assumption often is, but does not haveto be, a representation made by A to B to induce the assumption in B.  It may arise where A and B independently (and often by mistake)make, and then deal with each other upon, the same assumption.  This appears, for instance, to have occurred in the <i>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co Ltd v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd</i>,<a>[104]</a> where both parties assumed that the plaintiffâs guarantee covered the loans made by the bank to the plaintiffâs subsidiary anddealt with each other accordingly. </p>        <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  It must, however, be shown that the assumption was communicated between the parties and acted upon.  There must be some âmutuallymanifest conduct of the partiesâ as Kerr LJ pointed out in <i>The âAugust Leonhardtâ</i>:<a>[105]</a> </p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âAll estoppels must involve some statement or conduct by the party alleged to be estopped on which the alleged representee was entitledto rely and did rely. In this sense all estoppels may be regarded as requiring some manifest representation which crosses the linebetween representor and representee, either by statement or conduct. It may be an express statement or it may be implied from conduct,eg a failure by the alleged representor to react to something said or done by the alleged representee so as to imply a manifestationof assent which leads to an estoppel by silence or acquiescence. Similarly, in cases of so-called estoppels by convention, theremust be some mutually manifest conduct by the parties which is based on a common but mistaken assumption. The alleged representorâsparticipation in this conduct can then be relied upon by the representee as a basis for this form of estoppel.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  But there is no necessity for the parties or either of them to believe that the assumed state of affairs is true.  Nor is it necessaryfor them (notwithstanding what Kerr LJ stated) to have been mistaken about the matters assumed.  As Dixon J pointed out in <i>Grundt</i>:<a>[106]</a></p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIt is important to notice that belief in the correctness of the facts or state of affairs assumed is not always necessary.  Partiesmay adopt as the conventional basis of a transaction between them an assumption which they know to be contrary to the actual stateof affairs.  A tenant may know that his landlordâs title is defective, but by accepting the tenancy he adopts an assumption whichprecludes him from relying on the defect.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  What <i>is</i> important is for them to act in the belief, manifested by words or conduct, that they are both proceeding with the transaction onthe basis of the same shared assumption.  As Handley puts it: âThe representation is not necessarily that the convention is truebut that it has been mutually adopted and each party relies on its adoption when they enter into the transaction.â<a>[107]</a>  He cites in support, <i>William Parker Burkinshaw v Jonathan Nicholls</i>,<a>[108]</a><i> </i>an authority on estoppel in pais, in which Lord Blackburn stated that where a person induced another to act on the basis that a certainstate of affairs exists: â... their rights should be regulated, not by the real state of the facts, but by that conventional stateof facts which the two parties agree to make the basis of their action.â</p>        <p class="heading">D.3b  The matter assumed must be clear</p>        <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  As Sir Andrew Morritt VC stated in <i>Baird Textiles Holdings Ltd v Marks &amp; Spencer Plc</i>,<a>[109]</a> the content of the common assumption must be âsufficiently certain to enable the court to give effect to itâ.  It was establishedin <i>Woodhouse A C Israel Cocoa Ltd SA v Nigerian Produce Marketing Co Ltd</i>, that the promise relied on in support of a promissory estoppel must be âclear and unequivocal.â<a>[110]</a>  The Vice-Chancellor indicated that he was applying the same test for the conventional estoppel sought to be raised.  While in <i>Troop v Gibson</i>,<a>[111]</a><i> </i>Ralph Gibson LJ suggested that a lesser test might be appropriate because estoppels by convention were likely to involve a courseof negotiation or transactions rather than specific promises, he nevertheless concluded that:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... the extent to which the importance of clear and unequivocal statements is reduced in cases of estoppel by convention is probablysmall. In all cases the representation or statement must be sufficiently clear; and, since the doctrine of estoppel, when applieddeprives a party of the ability to enforce a legal right for the period of time and to the extent required by the equity which theestoppel has raised, the clarity required will seldom fall below what is unequivocal for the relevant purpose.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  I respectfully agree as to the degree of clarity required, but not with the characterisation of an estoppel by convention as equitableor of such an estoppel raising an equity.  The effect of an estoppel by convention is discussed below.</p>        <p class="heading">D.3c  The assumption may be about fact or law</p>        <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Some of the earlier authorities suggest that the doctrine of estoppel by convention is confined to cases where the common assumptionrelates to a factual (and not a legal) state of affairs.  This was problematical because the importance of the common assumptionis plainly linked, not merely to the facts assumed per se, but to their legal implications.  This led to acknowledgment that thecommon assumption may involve âmixed fact and lawâ.  Thus, in <i>Waltons Stores v Maher</i>,<a>[112]</a> Brennan J stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe assumed state of affairs to which a party may be bound to adhere may be more than a state of mere facts; it may include thelegal complexion of a fact as well as the fact itself, that is, a matter of mixed fact and law.  Thus in <i>Sarat Chunder Dey v Gopal Chunder Lala</i> (1892) LR 19 App 203 the subject of the estoppel was the validity of a conveyance, and in <i>Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd v Craine</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1922%5d%202%20AC%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1922] 2 AC 541</a> the subject of estoppel was the validity of a claim lodged out of time under a policy of fire insurance.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  As Lord Steyn states in the passage cited in section D.2 above, it is now settled law that the doctrine applies âwhere partiesto a transaction act on an assumed state of facts or lawâ. <a>[113]</a>  There is no good reason to exclude such assumptions while giving effect to assumptions regarding factual situations (or those saidto involve mixed fact and law) which are significant only because of their legal implications for the transaction or relationshipentered into by the parties.  This is, of course, subject to questions of illegality and any overriding public policy.<a>[114]</a>  As Handley puts it: âAn estoppel by convention cannot make lawful a transaction that was unlawful.â<a>[115]</a> </p>        <p class="heading">D.4    The âtransactionâ</p>        <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  As is made clear in the statements of principle cited in section D.2 above, an estoppel by convention is concerned with a commonassumption relied upon as the basis upon which the persons sharing such assumptions enter into a transaction, with the word âtransactionâto be understood here in the broad sense of the parties engaging in acts or omissions affecting their mutual legal relationship.</p>        <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Thus, Dixon J referred to an assumption which âformed the conventional basis upon which the parties entered into contractual orother mutual relations, such as bailment.â<a>[116]</a>  And later he spoke of assumptions adopted or accepted by the parties âfor the purpose of their legal relationsâ.<a>[117]</a>  And Lord Steyn spoke of the estoppel arising âwhere parties to a transaction act on an assumed state of facts or lawâ. <a>[118]</a>  Many other instances can be cited.  I will merely add a reference to the <i>Texas Bank</i> case,<a>[119]</a> in which both Eveleigh LJ and Brandon LJ applied the formulation appearing in the third edition of <i>Spencer Bower and Turner</i>,<a>[120]</a> which referred to âan agreed statement of facts the truth of which has been assumed, by the convention of the parties, as the basisof a transaction into which they are about to enter.â </p>        <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  The current (fourth) edition of that textbook has modified its definition to speak about ârelationshipsâ rather than âtransactionsâperhaps to take into account Bingham LJâs remarks in <i>The âVistafjordâ</i>,<a>[121]</a> which questioned aspects of the formulation in the previous edition, discussed below.  However, this does not affect the focus ofestoppel by convention upon a transaction or legal relationship entered into in reliance on a common assumption.  As Mance LJ putsit: âIt is ... an established feature of both promissory and conventional estoppel that the parties should have had the objectiveintention to make, affect or confirm a legal relationship.â<a>[122]</a></p>        <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  The link between the common assumption and the transaction based upon that assumption may be illustrated by a few examples.  I usethe letters A and B to refer to the parties who share the common assumption, with B being the party who later seeks to resile fromit. </p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) A and B both erroneously believed that Bâs guarantee covers loans made by Aâs subsidiary C, to Bâs subsidiary D.  On thefaith of that common assumption, A channelled the loans via its subsidiary C to D and allowed interest to build up on the indebtedness. B was not permitted to depart from the common assumption that it was liable under the guarantee: <i>the Texas Bank case</i>.<a>[123]</a> </p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) Landlord B and tenant A engaged in an arbitration in 1974 on the common assumption that there was nothing to restrict Aâs assignmentof the lease.  That was incorrect, a restriction having been overlooked by both.  On the basis of that assumption A effected an assignmentof the lease to C in 1980.  B was not permitted to terminate the lease by reason of the assignment: <i>Troop v Gibson</i>.<a>[124]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c) A and B both believed that service of legal process by A on an authorised agent of B was good personal service on B when thiswas not permitted by the rules.  In reliance on the common understanding, A effected service on the agent and omitted to serve Bpersonally while there was still time to do so.  B was estopped from contending that he had not been properly served and that itwas now too late to serve him: approach suggested obiter by Lord Goff in <i>Kenneth Allison Ltd v A E Limehouse &amp; Co</i>.<a>[125]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(d) A entered into a sub-charter of a cruise ship with B on the common assumption, shared with Bâs authorised agent X, that A wasentitled to payment of commission by B on passenger sales to be achieved by A on the related head charter of the vessel to a thirdparty.  B was not permitted to resile from that common assumption: <i>The âVistafjordâ</i>.<a>[126]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(e) A and B, believing that a London arbitration clause in their charterparty was valid, went through the arbitration in that sharedbelief.  The clause was actually void.  B was not permitted to contend that it was void after the claim had become time-barred inthe jurisdiction where proceedings should have been started: <i>The âAmazoniaâ</i>.<a>[127]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  In the last three examples given, the transaction entered into was between the parties who shared the common assumption.  But thefirst two examples show that this need not be the case.  The transaction entered into by A in each of those two cases was with athird party, as occurred in the <i>Texas Bank</i> case (where the loans went to Bâs subsidiary D) and in <i>Troop v Gibson</i> (where B assigned the lease to C).  Nevertheless, those were transactions entered into by A on the basis of an assumption made regardingthe status of Aâs legal relationship with B: that B was a guarantor of Aâs loan to D; and that B was Aâs landlord who did nothave power to prohibit an assignment to C.  Bâs attempted departure from the common assumption, if permitted, would have causedA detriment which it would not have suffered if it had not had entered into the transaction in question on the footing of the commonassumption.</p>        <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  It is also clear from the second example, <i>Troop v Gibson</i>, that the common assumption may endure for a long time (there for some six years) before a relevant transaction is entered into onthe strength of that assumption and before an attempt is made to desert it.</p>        <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  It is in this context that Bingham LJâs remarks in <i>The âVistafjordâ</i>,<a>[128]</a> should be understood.  His Lordship, in approving and agreeing with an unreported judgment by Peter Gibson J in <i>Hamel-Smith v Pycroft &amp; Jetsave Ltd</i>,<a>[129]</a> criticised the formulation in the third edition of <i>Spencer Bower</i> (cited above) and stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... I do not see why the parties need be about to enter a transaction when they make the common assumption. ... Estoppel by conventionis not dependent on a contract, but on a common assumption. Take, for example, a case where there is a partnership agreement terminableat will, and shortly after the partnership commences all the parties misconstrue an important provision of the partnership agreement.Thereafter the partners continue in partnership on the basis of the misconstrued agreement for many years before the partnershipis terminated, at which point one partner realises the error and seeks to go back on the common assumption. I cannot see on whatrational principle it would be right to say that estoppel by convention could not apply to such a case. </p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">What is important for an estoppel by convention is that there should have been a common assumption which has been acted upon. Further,such action need not follow immediately after the common assumption is made, nor be in the course of the same transaction betweenthe parties. [Citing <i>Troop v Gibson</i> as an example]â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  In my view, Bingham LJ was merely stressing the points which have also been made above, namely: (i) that the transaction enteredinto in reliance on the common assumption and the attempted departure from that assumption may take place years after the commonassumption was first adopted; and (ii) that the transaction in question may involve a third party and not necessarily the partieswho shared the common assumption.  In questioning whether the parties âneed to be about to enter a transactionâ, his Lordshipwas not suggesting that estoppel by convention does not involve a linkage between a transaction and the common assumption.  Indeed,the partnership example given illustrates such linkage.  The partners shared a common assumption as to the contents of the partnershipagreement on the strength of which they entered into many transactions as partners over the years.

First, there must be an attempt by one partyto depart from the common assumption which departure would be unjust because of âthe part taken by him in occasioning its adoptionby the other partyâ.<a>[130]</a> Secondly, the other party would suffer detriment arising out of his having entered into the relevant transaction on the basis ofthe common assumption âif the opposite party were afterwards allowed to set up rights against him inconsistent with the assumptionâwhen abandoning the common assumption.<a>[131]</a></p>        <p class="heading">D.6    Legal effect of an estoppel by convention</p>        <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  There was discussion in argument and in the courts below as to whether Mr Unruhâs reliance on estoppel by convention involvedan impermissible attempt to use it as a cause of action â âa swordâ â on the footing that it is only permissible to deploythe doctrine defensively, as âa shieldâ.  Such nomenclature is not particularly helpful to an understanding of the legal effectof an estoppel by convention and, as Brandon LJ stated, is âno more than a matter of semanticsâ.<a>[132]</a>  </p>        <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  It is clear that, unlike equitable estoppels which create enforceable equitable rights, an estoppel by convention is not a sourceof legal obligation.  However, such an estoppel may, in the circumstances of the particular case, result in an otherwise ineffectiveor incomplete cause of action being made viable.  The doctrine therefore does not play a wholly defensive role in litigation. </p>        <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  In the <i>Texas Bank</i> case,<a>[133]</a> Brandon LJ illustrated this by postulating an action by the bank on the guarantee, a plea by Amalgamated in the defence that theindebtedness fell outside the scope of the guarantee and a plea in the reply that Amalgamated was estopped from questioning the partiesâcommon interpretation of the guarantee.  His Lordship continued:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThis illustrates what I would regard as the true proposition of law, that, while a party cannot in terms found a cause of actionon an estoppel, he may, as a result of being able to rely on an estoppel, succeed on a cause of action on which, without being ableto rely on that estoppel, he would necessarily have failed.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  Brennan J takes a similar view and provides an exposition of the mechanism of the estoppel (which he dealt with in terms of an estoppelin pais):</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe effect of an estoppel in pais is not to create a right in one party against the other; it is to establish the state of affairsby reference to which the legal relationship between them is ascertainedâ <a>[134]</a>  ...</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIt has been said that estoppel in pais is merely a rule of evidence and not a cause of action (<i>Seton v Lafone</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2019%20QBD%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 19 QBD 68</a>; <i>Low v Bouverie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1891%5d%203%20Ch%2082" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1891] 3 Ch 82</a>; <i>Re Ottos Kopje Diamond Mines, Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%201%20Ch%20618" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] 1 Ch 618)</a> but that proposition needs some explanation.  If the estoppel relates to the existence of a contract between the parties, the legalrelationship between the parties is ascertained by reference to the terms of the contract which has been assumed to exist. If, inthe assumed state of affairs, the contract confers a cause of action on the party raising the estoppel, the cause of action may beenforced. The source of legal obligation in that event is the assumed contract; the estoppel is not a source of legal obligationexcept in the sense that the estoppel compels the party bound to adhere to the assumption that the contract exists.â<a>[135]</a> </p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  The second point which may be of relevance in the present case is that an estoppel by convention necessarily âonly applies forthe purposes of the transaction or relationship in which the convention was adopted.â<a>[136]</a>  This follows from the object of the estoppel, which, as indicated in section D.2 above, is to prevent the detriment which flowsfrom a party having entered into the transaction, caused by the opposite party resiling from the common assumption upon which thetransaction was based.  It also follows, as Handley puts it, that: âA convention cannot estop a party against someone who is neithera party nor a privy.â<a>[137]</a>  Moreover, the court will only give effect to the estoppel to the extent that justice so requires.  Where the circumstances havedeveloped and no injustice would result from the opposite party resiling from the common assumption the estoppel is not given continuedeffect.<a>[138]</a> </p>        <p class="heading">E.

It will be recalledthat, in consequence of the âNo Claims clauseâ contained in the Consultancy Agreement, Egana was advised by S&amp;S in April1994 that Mr Unruh had been released from all his liabilities to Egana accrued up to 29 September 1993, including liabilities incurredunder the indemnities given by him.  Efforts to get Mr Unruh to agree to a set-off between his accrued liabilities and the final$1 million instalment payable to him under the Consultancy Agreement were unsuccessful.  The impasse was then resolved when, in responseto a letter of 4 January 1995 from Egana enclosing a draft of the DoA (â<u>the January Egana letter</u>â), Mr Unruh duly executed the DoA, dated 5 January 1995 and received his final instalment without deduction.</p>        <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  The January Egana letter, signed by Mr Peter Lee and Mr Tony Chik, directors of Egana, was in the following terms:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âAs you are aware, we have been pretty engaged in finalising the accounts for 1994 for audit purpose.  As there are certain indebtednessremain outstanding from you in ESCT account as of December 31, 1994, the auditors would probably go through each item of the receivablesin these operating companies and assess its recoverability.  In order not to have any adverse effect on the financial position andto ensure that your indebtedness will be duly reimbursed to ESCT, we suggest that a Deed of Acknowledgement of Debts be entered intoby you in favour of ESCT and [Egana].</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">Please see attached the draft Deed for your consideration.

Notwithstanding with any contrary provisions as provided in the Memorandum [which has been defined as the MoA], Mr Unruh herebyagrees and confirms that [Egana referred to as EIH] shall be entitled to set off the Indebtedness and any further liabilities asabovestated against the amount of Special Bonus to be payable by Egana.  Mr Unruh covenants with Egana that he will pay any balanceof the Indebtedness which are not set-off by the Special Bonus within 10 days from the date of the payment of the Special Bonus ...failing which a penalty default interest shall be charged ...â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="heading">E.2    How Mr Unruhâs case is put</p>        <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Mr Burns submitted that the Court should uphold the Judgeâs decision on estoppel.  However, the argument he developed divergedfrom the Judgeâs approach in one important respect, namely, as to how an operative common assumption could be established.  I shalldeal with both versions of the argument. </p>        <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  Mr Unruh has not at any stage sought to assert a cause of action founded simply on the DoA.  It is not his case that Egana, as aparty to the DoA, made a promise under deed to pay the Special Bonus.  This is quite understandable since the DoA does not containany such promise.</p>        <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  Nevertheless, Mr Unruh submits that the DoAâs conferment of a right of set-off only makes sense if Egana had undertaken an unconditionalliability to pay Mr Unruh the Special Bonus against which his Indebtedness could be set-off.  The Judge agreed, holding that Clause2 of the DoA âamounted to an acknowledgement on the part of Egana that it had agreed to pay Mr Unruh the Special Bonus.â<a>[139]</a>  He pointed out that the words giving Egana the right of set-off were not qualified or conditional on Egana subsequently making itselfliable to pay Mr Unruh because, he suggests, if the DoA had stipulated any such conditions â... it is unlikely that the DoA wouldhave satisfied Eganaâs auditors on the issue of recoverability of the Indebtedness, the purpose for which the DoA was primarilymade.â<a>[140]</a>  The meaning attributed to the DoA is therefore the springboard of both arguments.</p>        <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  It is at this point that the decision of the Judge (supported by the majority in the Court of Appeal) diverges from the case asargued before the Court.  The Judge, held that the relevant common assumption was constituted by Clause 2 in the DoA itself.  Henoted that it is âa critical element of an estoppel by convention that the assumption of the relevant fact or proposition as tothe partiesâ rights must be expressly or impliedly communicated between themâ and found that this had been done âhere in theDoAâ.<a>[141]</a> </p>        <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  He formulated the common assumption in the following terms:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe critical factor that Mr Unruh must establish is that both relevant parties to the DoA, himself and Egana, have acted on anassumed state of facts.  The assumption in this case is that Egana has agreed with Mr Unruh to pay the Special Bonus.â<a>[142]</a> </p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  He then held that Mr Unruh was âinduced to continue to provide assistanceâ in the arbitrations on the basis of this common assumptionand that he had consequently suffered detriment by being deprived of the opportunity to press Mr Seeberger and Egana to enter intolegal documentation to secure Eganaâs liability to pay him the Special Bonus.  His Lordship stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...Mr Unruh knew that if he continued to provide the assistance in the arbitration required by the MoA, in due course, he wouldreceive his Special Bonus.  Had he known, in January 1995, that Egana may not enter into the necessary documentation to secure hisright to the Special Bonus, it would have been open to Mr Unruh to press Mr Seeberger to secure that documentation in terms of MrSeebergerâs obligation under cl 7 of the MoA.  It would have been open to Mr Unruh to negotiate with Egana for formal documentationhimself.  It would have been open to him simply to cease providing assistance, perhaps arguing a failure of consideration.  Havingbeen induced to continue to provide assistance, and relying on the facts assumed, and recorded in the DoA, that he would receivethe Special Bonus, Mr Unruh has been deprived of these opportunities.  I am satisfied that in relying on the statements made in theDoA, Mr Unruhâs position is one which may be described as âworse offâ.â<a>[143]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  There was no independent analysis of the requisite elements of estoppel by convention in the majority judgments in the Court ofAppeal.  Rogers VP noted the reasoning of the Judge which he accepted. <a>[144]</a>  However, he specifically rejected the argument that Clause 2 should not be construed as meaning that Egana had undertaken unconditionalliability to pay the Special Bonus stating:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIf Mr Changâs argument were correct, it would mean that the operative part of the DoA was clause 1 and that clause 2 was, ineffect, highly deceptive verbiage designed to obfuscate the true position from the auditors in order that they should not requirethe accounts to be presented in a manner which they considered was necessary to give a true and fair view of the financial stateof the 2nd defendant.  In consequence, if Mr Changâs argument were correct, clause 2 of the DoA was designed to fool the auditors,deceive the public as to the true and fair view of the financial state of the 2nd defendant and cheat the plaintiff into extendinghis liability in a number of respects.â<a>[145]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  Mr Burnsâ argument differs to the extent that he contends that the common assumption âpre-existed the DoAâ<a>[146]</a> and, although he was unable to say when and in what circumstances it had been adopted, he submitted that the set-off provided forby the DoA compelled the court to draw the logical inference that there must have been an earlier mutual acknowledgment that Eganawas unconditionally liable to pay the Special Bonus.  He relied on the terms of the Consultancy Agreement of 29 September 1993 andcorrespondence leading up to it in support.  Those documents are considered below.</p>        <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  It follows that, as argued in this Court, Mr Unruhâs case was that he and Egana had reached a common assumption at some time priorto 5 January 1995 that Egana would pay the Special Bonus; that this is evidenced by Clause 2 of the DoA; and that in reliance onthat common assumption, Mr Unruh had continued to provide assistance in the arbitration and had suffered the detriment found by theJudge.</p>        <p class="heading">E.3    Mr Unruhâs estoppel case analysed</p>        <p class="heading">E.3a  The construction of the DoA</p>        <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  While I accept that the set-off provision in Clause 2 shows that the parties to the DoA contemplated a liability to pay the SpecialBonus being undertaken at some time by Egana, I am not persuaded that it should be read as meaning that Egana had unconditionallydone so as at 5 January 1995.</p>        <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  First, while Mr Unruhâs argument proceeds purely as a matter of  purported inference from the words concerning a set-off, Clause2 specifically addresses the legal source of Mr Unruhâs Special Bonus.  Its opening words are: âPursuant to Clause 5 of the MoA,Mr Unruh is to receive [the Special Bonus] ... from any successful outcome regarding the Benetton Arbitration.â  It is thereforepursuant to the MoA and not any other arrangement â particularly, not any agreement with Egana â that Mr Unruh is said to havean entitlement to the Special Bonus.  There is no suggestion anywhere in the DoA that the MoA has been modified.  One must thereforetake it that in referring to Mr Unruhâs entitlement pursuant to Clause 5, the parties to the DoA had in mind its terms (set outin section C.1 above) stipulating that Egana was not to be liable to pay unless and until the five conditions referred to in sectionC.2 above were satisfied.  As it is common ground that such conditions had not, as at 5 January 1995, been satisfied, a fact thatmust have been known both to Mr Seeberger and Mr Unruh, the opening words of Clause 2 run strongly counter to the suggestion thatthe parties should be taken to have regarded Egana as there and then unconditionally bound to pay the Special Bonus.</p>        <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  Secondly, the set-off provision itself refers to a set-off  âagainst the amount of Special Bonus <i>to be</i> payable by Eganaâ.  If they were assuming in common that Egana had undertaken liability to pay, one might have expected the clausesimply to refer the âSpecial Bonus payable by Egana.â  Read together with the DoAâs reference to Clause 5 just discussed, âtobe payableâ suggests a future and conditional meaning.</p>        <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  This is supported by a third aspect of the DoA.  For Egana to have an accrued right to set-off the Indebtedness, the debts had tobe owed to Egana.  Yet by Clause 1 of the DoA, the Indebtedness was expressly said to be owed by Mr Unruh to ESCT, not Egana.  Nodoubt it was contemplated that Egana, being ESCTâs parent company would be able to procure ESCT to assign the debt to Egana.  However,this shows that the parties were not at that stage dealing with rights of set-off involving accrued cross-liabilities between Eganaand Mr Unruh, but with a contemplated set-off that could only take effect if and when certain steps were taken in future to makethis possible.</p>        <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  Fourthly, whether there would be any sums derived from the arbitrations available for a set-off was unknown as at 5 January 1995. Egana will have had no doubt realistic hopes of receiving monetary compensation because the Tribunal had issued a PFA in its favourin February 1993 and, on 3 November 1993, it had started Phase 2 with a view to quantifying the award.  But they did not know inJanuary 1995 how much they would get.  If it was less than US$10 million, the set-off provision would have no effect.  Moreover,Benetton had meanwhile started its counter-attack by commencing NAI 1616 which included a counterclaim which might affect any ultimaterecovery.  The FAA did not appear until 23 June 1995 and settlement did not actually occur until 31 March 2000, only after vigorouscourt challenges mounted by Benetton.  The set-off clause was therefore necessarily of conditional application and incapable of takingeffect immediately. </p>        <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  Rogers VP appears to have suggested in effect that Egana could not be heard to advance a construction to similar effect.  He heldthat Egana had executed the DoA primarily to satisfy the concerns of its auditors as to the recoverability of the Indebtedness byshowing that it would be recoverable by means of a set-off.  His Lordship suggested that Egana must obviously have known that a DoAwhich does not contain an immediately operative set-off would not have been accepted by the auditors, so that it must have been representedto them that the set-off took immediate effect.  If the argument now advanced were correct, this would imply that Egana had fooledthe auditors, deceived the public and cheated the plaintiff âinto extending his liability in a number of respectsâ.</p>        <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  I am unable to subscribe to such a view.  It proceeds on the assumption that the auditors were or were predominantly concerned aboutrecoverability in the sense of looking for a means by which Mr Unruhâs Indebtedness would be funded.  It suggests that it was onlyby demonstrating that it could be funded through an operative set-off  that the auditors could be satisfied.  However, it was commonground that Mr Unruh was sufficiently wealthy to pay the debt out of his own resources.  And as pointed out above, the evidence suggeststhat the real concern was about legal irrecoverability in relation first, to the indebtedness accrued for the financial year 1994(as indicated in the January Egana letter) in the light of S&amp;Sâs advice that Mr Unruh been released from liabilities incurredup to 29 September 1993 as a result of the Consultancy Agreement; and secondly, in relation to expenses incurred after that dateespecially given the approaching expiry of the Howard Lau Deed.  It was, in other words, far more likely that the auditorsâ concernsreferred to in the January Egana letter related to the lack of a legal basis to enforce recoverability and not to a need for identifyinga funding source for discharging the debt.  As the very title of the Deed of Acknowledgment suggests, its main purpose was to obtainMr Unruhâs fresh acknowledgment of his liability for the accrued debts (set out in Clause 1) and his liability in respect of futureexpenses.  The set-off appears to me to have addressed an ancillary point made in the S&amp;S letter of advice.</p>        <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  If the auditors had been keen to find an immediately operative set-off, they could not have derived much comfort from the DoA. The value, if any, of the potential Special Bonus was then wholly uncertain so that there might be nothing available to set-off theIndebtedness. </p>        <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  Moreover, given the known facts, it is implausible, to say the least, that Egana would have sought to represent to the auditorsthat it had undertaken liability under the MoA, merely to demonstrate to them that there existed a funding source to ensure recoverabilityof the Indebtedness.  If this had been suggested, the auditors would have been prompted to examine the basis upon which Egana hadtaken on that liability.  They would have discovered that, contrary to what was envisaged in Clause 5 of the MoA, Egana had neverobtained relevant legal advice nor entered into any legal documentation to take on the liability nor passed any board resolutionto do so.  Such issues would have produced far more serious concerns on the part of the auditors.  Provoking such concerns wouldnot have been a rational course for Egana to take.</p>        <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  I therefore do not consider the discussion of the impact of the DoA on the auditorsâ beliefs relevant either to the meaning tobe given to the DoA or to Mr Unruhâs case on estoppel.</p>        <p class="heading">E.3b  The alleged common assumption</p>        <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  The Judgeâs finding that Mr Unruh and Egana had reached a common assumption that Egana would pay the Special Bonus without qualification(as discussed in section E.2 above) rested solely on his construction of the DoA and the inferential meaning he attributed to theset-off provision.  On the view I take of the meaning of the DoA, the Judgeâs finding is wholly undermined. </p>        <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  Mr Burnsâs argument is also severely damaged since he relies heavily on the DoA being given the aforesaid meaning for it to serveas evidence of a pre-existing common assumption involving Eganaâs acceptance of unconditional liability.  But Mr Burns sought torely also on evidence extrinsic to the DoA.  For his case to survive, he had to show (as discussed in section D.3a) that the allegedcommon assumption was mutually manifested by words or conduct on the part of Mr Unruh and Egana.</p>        <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  In my view, Mr Burns was wholly unsuccessful.  If one is to look at the extrinsic evidence, the starting-point must be the MoA dated19 September 1992.  It made it clear that Egana had no liability to pay the Special Bonus and would not take on such liability unlessand until the specified conditions were satisfied.  It follows that Mr Unruh requires evidence that Egana positively took on thatliability at some later stage and communicated this to Mr Unruh, inducing in him a common assumption to such effect. </p>        <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a>  No relevant evidence is identified until we arrive at the Consultancy Agreement dated 29 September 1993.  By its clause 13, Mr Unruhacknowledges that he has âno claims (outstanding or otherwise) of any kind whatsoever against the Group and/or [Mr Seeberger] ...â The Group is defined as Egana and its subsidiaries.  Furthermore, there is an express saving of Mr Unruhâs claims under Clause5 of the MoA, stating:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âFor the avoidance of doubt, this sub-clause shall not be taken to relate to the rights of the Consultant [Mr Unruh] under Clause5 of the [MoA] dated 19th September 1992 and entered into between the Consultant and [Mr Seeberger].â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  It follows that the Consultancy Agreement positively shows that as at 29 September 1993, far from there being any relevant commonassumption, Mr Unruh was expressly acknowledging that he had no claims against Egana and making it clear that the only rights hewas preserving were rights against Mr Seeberger personally under the MoA.  So Mr Unruh needed to put up evidence to counter thisreinforcement of the case against him.  But none was produced in the period leading up to 5 January 1995.</p>        <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  The evidence beyond that date is also against the existence of any common assumption.  It will be recalled that Mr Unruh had originallysought to set up an oral agreement allegedly made at the end of May or early June 1995 whereby Egana was said to have orally agreedvia Mr Seeberger to take up the liability.  That was rejected by the Judge and not pursued in the Court of Appeal.  But the factthat it was thought necessary to make the allegation at all calls into question the existence of any clearly-defined common assumptionthat Egana was already liable at a date prior to January 1995. </p>        <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  Moreover, the documents relied on by the Judge for rejecting that oral agreement provide further good reasons for rejecting thesuggested common assumption.  Those documents consist of communications passing between Mr Unruh and his lawyers in which a âsideletterâ was being drafted which Mr Seeberger would be asked to sign, confirming that notwithstanding expiry of the ConsultancyAgreement, Mr Unruh would remain entitled to his share of âany claim compensation in connection with the arbitrationsâ.  In thecourse of that correspondence, Mr Unruhâs lawyers, Messrs Haldanes, stated in a fax of 7 June 1995 that they were drafting theside letter on the basis that ânothing has been done or signed to varyâ Clause 5 of the MoA.  If there had, by January 1995,been a common assumption that Egana would take on the liability, Mr Unruh would surely have corrected the solicitorsâ misimpression. But he did not do so.  Moreover, the original draft was altered to ask Mr Seeberger specifically to state: âThis letter constitutesacknowledgment of the above matters by ESCT and Egana as well as by me personally.â  It is hard to see why this should have beenneeded if Mr Unruh and Egana already shared a common assumption that Egana would pay the compensation.  The Judge held that the evidentneed for this confirmation showed that there had been no oral agreement.  It also shows that there was no common assumption.</p>        <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  Finally, Mr Chang submits with much force that if Mr Unruh genuinely believed, as part of a common assumption, that Egana had acceptedliability to pay, it is inexplicable that when payment was not forthcoming, his Writ was issued only against Mr Seeberger, with Eganaonly added as a second defendant some 16 months later.</p>        <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  In summary, like Stone J who dissented, I am unable to discern any evidence of a common assumption or agreement for Egana to paythe Special Bonus âcome what mayâ. <a>[147]</a>  Certainly, the evidence comes nowhere near establishing a common assumption of the certainty and clarity required, as discussedin section D.3b above.  On the contrary, the evidence tends completely in the contrary direction. </p>        <p class="heading">E.3c   The transaction</p>        <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  It is hard to identify any transaction which Mr Unruh and Egana can be said to have entered into on the basis of the alleged convention. Mr Unruh relies merely on his continued assistance in the arbitrations.  Yet, as the Judge himself found:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...Mr Unruh knew that if he continued to provide the assistance in the arbitration <i>required by the MoA</i>, in due course, he would receive his Special Bonus.â (emphasis provided)<a>[148]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  As previously noted, Mr Unruhâs assistance in the arbitration was part of the process of realizing the asset he had sold to MrSeeberger which he had undertaken in the MoA to use his best endeavours to promote.  It was also assistance given with a view tocrystallizing part of the consideration he was to receive on the sale (if the arbitration proceeds should exceed US$10 million). His continued assistance is therefore entirely explicable on these bases.  I find it impossible to accept that he would not haverendered such continued assistance but for a belief that Egana had now stepped in to accept liability to pay the Special Bonus. He had always looked to Mr Seeberger, the other party to the MoA, for such payment and would no doubt have continued to do so.  Inthe result, no transaction relevant to an estoppel by convention has been identified.</p>        <p class="heading">E.3d  Detriment</p>        <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  The detriment alleged is that Mr Unruh was lulled by the alleged common belief in Eganaâs acceptance of liability into not doinganything to obtain documentation from Mr Seeberger and Egana to confirm liability on Eganaâs part.  It is suggested that somehowMr Unruh was deprived of an opportunity to obtain such documentation.  The brief answer is that this is not what the evidence shows. As we have seen, Mr Unruh <i>did</i> seek such documentation.  He tried to get Mr Seeberger to provide the side letter in June 1995, as mentioned in section 3.b above. He was initially ignored and then rebuffed both by Mr Seeberger and Egana.  I cannot in any event see how he can be said to havebeen deprived of the chance of asking for documentation even if he believed that there was a relevant â but undocumented â commonassumption. </p>        <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a>  It follows, in conclusion, that Mr Unruhâs case on estoppel by convention falls at every single hurdle.  It is unnecessary todeal with the âsword and shieldâ argument beyond what is said in section D.6 above.</p>        <p class="heading">F.      No case based on alternative oral agreement</p>        <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  Finally, the Judge held<a>[149]</a> that if the estoppel that he found established did not give rise to liability in Egana, such liability could be established on analternative basis, stating: â... the facts giving rise to the cause of action, namely an agreement to pay the Special Bonus, existedindependently of the estoppelâ.  He was evidently referring to some actionable agreement coming into existence at or about 5 January1995.  Rogers VP noted this aspect of the Judgeâs decision but it is unclear whether it was accepted.<a>[150]</a>  Le Pichon JA agreed with Rogers VPâs reasons for dismissing the appeal but placed her own decision primarily on the ground thatthe Judgeâs alternative basis of liability should be sustained so that reliance on estoppel by convention was not necessary forestablishing Eganaâs liability.<a>[151]</a></p>        <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  At the hearing, Mr Burns did not feel able to support this alternative ground of liability.  With respect, I consider his concessionrightly made.  As Stone J succinctly pointed out in his dissent:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...the learned judge was in error in alternatively basing his decision upon a separate and unpleaded oral agreement consistentneither with the specific oral agreement relied upon by the plaintiff (and specifically rejected), nor with the plain terms of theMemorandum of Agreement.â<a>[152]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p class="heading">G.
