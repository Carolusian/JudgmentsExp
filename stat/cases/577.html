strike out the Bankruptcy Petition which had been lodged by the petitioner.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Chao died on 17 February 2001. His son Chao Joachim (the respondent) now represents his estate.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> It appears to be common ground that as a consequence of the provisions contained in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 103</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6">Cap. 6</a> the bankruptcy proceedings are still "alive" and that this appeal can properly be proceeded with.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The background facts have been most helpfully and succinctly summarized by Mr Scott SC who represents the petitioner.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The background to this dispute is two agreements and associated security documents for the construction, sale and purchase for atotal consideration of about US$29.7 million of an oil-tanker designated Hull No. PC440-2 by a Chinese shipyard.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The petitioner as a financier entered into a ship building agreement with the yard and at the same time arranged in terms of a backto back agreement to sell the ship to Finex Shipping Limited (Finex), Chao's company. Chao guaranteed the obligations of Finex tothe petitioner.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Finex only ever paid the first 10% deposit, but has defaulted on the payment of the 90% balance of about US$27 million, despite thecompletion of the vessel and its launch in March 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Finex entered into discussions in September 1999 in an attempt to sell the vessel with the benefit of a charter but Finex never madeany attempt to tender the outstanding purchase price to enable it to take delivery. In the end Chao acknowledged that he was unableto find a buyer for the vessel and Finex failed to pay the 90% balance remaining due. The charter with Oetker was cancelled and thevessel was sold in a falling market for what was claimed to be the best price that could be obtained; US$21.25 million includingbroker's commission.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> There was therefore a shortfall of about US$7 million between the sale price obtained and the price which Finex (guaranteed by Chao)had originally agreed to pay. Nissho Iwai an associated company of the petitioner settled the shipyard's claim by payment of US$6million.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The petitioner claims that Chao is liable as guarantor to make good the deficiency between the purchase price Finex agreed to payfor the vessel and the resale price of the vessel.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>

They had not complied with the terms of the ship sale agreement or paid for the vesseland accordingly could have had no title to sell it.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Over and above this all of the available evidence indicated that Chao's claim in relation to the alleged interference was spuriousand without merit.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Even on Chao's own evidence the value of the vessel had been greatly diminished as a result of the Oetker charter party not beingproceeded with. The reason for this was that it was a 5-year charter party the terms of which had been negotiated in a much morefavourable market.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Chao had not attempted to lay any of the blame for the charter party being cancelled on Nissho Iwai. However as a result of the cancellationthe value of the vessel had immediately fallen significantly. Chao himself accepted that following the cancellation of the charterparty the value of the vessel was not more than US$23 million.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Prior to the shipyard exercising its power of sale under the agreement between itself and the petitioner it had written to Finexand Chao in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"Dated: November 12, 1999</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">FINEX SHIPPING LIMITED (the 'Buyer')<br />        SUNGROWN FOUNDATION VADUZ (the 'Foundation')<br />        Mr. Frank S.B.

Thealleged duty to mitigate therefore did not arise. Further, in the circumstances of this case, it was reasonable for Nissho Iwai tohave sounded out the market and, in the absence of evidence suggesting <em>mala fide</em> on Nissho Iwai's part, no valid complaint has been established by Chao regarding such conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> For all of these reasons it cannot be said that there was any substantial dispute between the parties on this issue.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> It is now necessary to consider the more difficult questions as to whether the claim being made by the petitioner is a liquidatedclaim of such a nature that this bankruptcy petition can proceed.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Mr Scott referred us to a passage at p. 96 in <em>Fletcher - The Law of Insolvency 1990</em> which is of some assistance. Here the author of the work states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The requirement that the debt be a liquidated sum is one of considerable significance, and was originally established by the commonlaw of bankruptcy long before becoming part of the express statutory provisions. It is therefore vital to appreciate which speciesof claim can be classified as 'liquidated', and which cannot, since this quality is so central to the concept of a good petitioningcreditor's debt. The decisive hallmark of a liquidated claim is that the process of quantification is already complete, and thereis an absence of any element of 'penalty' to be imposed over and above the actual loss sustained. Thus, claims in tort are of theirvery nature unliquidated until judgment has actually been given, or until a binding settlement has been concluded between the parties,because until then the process of quantification of damages remains unfinished, albeit the plaintiff may furnish an indication ofa sum of damages which he believes to be appropriate. Claims in contract, on the other hand, are generally liquidated in nature atall stages, but if the sum included an element which is held to be 'penal', this will render the claim an unliquidated one. Likewiseif the true quantum of loss directly and naturally resulting from a breach of contract or a breach of covenant cannot be immediatelyand definitely established, the claim must be considered as unliquidated for the time being."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Mr Scott submitted that this was an accurate statement of the law. The essential requirement was whether it was possible to arithmeticallycalculate the amount due and owing. Le Pichon J had held this to be the case in <strong>Re Kwok Chok-yee</strong> (unreported) being HCB 670/1999.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Mr Scott argued that what was necessary was to have regard to the overall situation and in particular business efficacy. In thisconnection he called in aid the observations made by Roskill LJ at p. 506 of <strong>Hyundai v Pournaras</strong> (1978) 2 Lloyd's Law Reports 502:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Founding himself upon that passage, Mr Thomas submits that the letter of guarantee which I have read is indistinguishable from cl.(XIII) in that case and that, therefore, all that this letter of guarantee did was to bind the guarantor to ensure the performanceby the buyer of the buyer's obligations. He invited us to look at the first limb, as he called it, of the guarantee-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'.... the undersigned hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the payment in accordance with the terms of the contract ofall sums due or to become due by the buyer to you under the contract.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr Thomas says that that language is indistinguishable from the language of the clause in the <em>Lep Air Services</em> case. He accepts that if one looks in isolation at the next 2Â½ lines they are somewhat against his contention. The words are-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'.... and in case the buyer is in default of any such payment the undersigned will forthwith make the payment in default on behalfof the buyer.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">But he says one must look at that second limb as subsidiary to the first limb, and if the first limb, on its true construction, iswithin Lord Reid's second category, then there cannot be a change of meaning merely because of the addition of the second limb tothe first.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">To my mind, the right way of construing this document is not to break it down into a first and second limb but to construe it as awhole against what in a recent case in the House of Lords Lord Wilberforce called 'the factual matrix of the background'. The factualmatrix of the background is, to my mind, plain and not susceptible of any controversy. The respondents are a yard dealing with twoshipowning companies registered in Liberia, to them foreigners. I find it perfectly natural, in those circumstances, that that yardshould wish to have a guarantee of payment from someone other than the persons with whom they are contracting for the constructionof these four ships, the more so because these four ships were in the place of two earlier ships which the buyers had not wishedto have built. It seems natural, when one looks at this as a matter of business, that in those circumstances the respondents shouldwant the financial protection of people against whom liability could be enforced in the event of non-payment by the buyers on thedue dates. It seems to me, with great respect to the argument of Mr Thomas, that to give this guarantee the limited constructionfor which he contends would be flying in the face of the obvious commercial purpose of this document, one of a group of documentsentered into in connection with these shipbuilding contracts. One has two references to 'payment'. One has, as the learned Judgesaid, the express reference in the case of default to the guarantor 'making the payment forthwith'; it seems, putting the mattershortly, that the commercial purport and obvious intent and true construction of this document is such that the contrary, as in effectthe Judge said, is not really arguable. The true meaning is that if the buyer does not pay in time - in the case of the first instalmentwithin seven days of the export licence, and in the case of the second instalment on the due date - the guarantor will pay. Therefore,to my mind, the learned Judge was absolutely right in the view which he took, and if that were the only point in the case I wouldunhesitatingly dismiss the appeals."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The terms of the performance guarantee which had been executed by Chao were clear and unambiguous.

Finex breached the ship sale agreement by failing to pay the instalment payments as and whenthey became due and payable. Mr Ambrose Ho SC for the respondent argued that in relation to the 4th (and final) instalment, the paymentobligation was concurrent with the petitioner's obligation to deliver the vessel. Since the vessel was in fact not delivered to Chao,his payment obligation has not arisen yet. With respect, Mr Ho's argument ignores two things:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) a notice was duly given by the petitioner to Finex pursuant to the terms of the ship sale agreement informing Finex that the vesselwas ready for delivery. Finex did not respond to such notice;</p>        <p>(2) the terms of the ship sale agreement relating to the method of payment provided (among other things) that payment of the 4th (andfinal) instalment should be made by Finex at least 3 business days before the scheduled day of delivery.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> As indicated earlier in this judgment the shipyard had sold the vessel and Nissho Iwai had settled the claim on its guarantee withthe shipyard for US$6 million.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Mr Scott pointed out that his clients owed no fiduciary obligations to Finex or Chao and that all that was necessary for the petitionerwas to take reasonable action to mitigate the loss they had suffered. The vessel had been sold timeously by the shipyard and therewas no substantial dispute concerning the sale. In these circumstances the claim could be arithmetically calculated in such a mannerthat the claim which was being made could be properly characterised as a liquidated claim.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Mr Ho did not accept that the claim was a liquidated claim.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> In this connection he placed particular reliance upon a passage from the judgment of Maule J at p. 25 of <em>Ex parte Broadhurst</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281852%29%2032%20LJCh%2021" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1852) 32 LJ Ch (NS) 21</a> which he claimed adopted the reasoning in the judgment <em>Ex parte Charles</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281811%29%2014%20East%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1811) 14 East 197:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It cannot be treated at law as a specific sum of money to be received, for the right to receive would be co-extensive only with thedamage sustained; and this cannot be so made the subject of computation as to be a fit ground for a petitioning creditor's debt....

I am of the opinion that the questionwhether this bankruptcy, founded as it is upon the sufficiency of the petitioning creditor's debt so constituted, can be supported,ought to be answered in the negative."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Mr Ho also called in aid the passage at 27-008 of the 28th Edition of Chitty on Contracts (Volume 1) where there is a discussionon the distinction between claims for payment of an agreed sum and claims for damages and the differentiation between liquidatedand unliquidated damages codimented upon in 27-009.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Adopting this analysis of the law Mr Ho submitted that in essence the claim which was being made by the petitioner was a common lawclaim for damages rather than a claim for a specific sum under the ship sale agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Mr Ho took us through the relevant articles in this agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The main point made by him was that as the agreement was drafted the 4th instalment only became payable when the vessel was deliveredto Finex.

The right of sale of the vessel in the event of default was exercisableby the petitioner.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> This right had not been exercised. What had happened was that the shipyard had exercised its right of sale under its agreement withthe petitioner.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> So far as the performance guarantee was concerned it was apparent from the terms of the document that what was contemplated was abreach of the contractual terms of the ship sale agreement rather than any general common law claim.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Mr Ho submitted that the observations made by Roskill LJ in <strong>Hyundai</strong> had no application to the present case as in that case the claim had been made in respect of outstanding instalments and there hadbeen no question of delivery of the vessels having been effected.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Although the 4th instalment became payable on the delivery of the vessel to Finex it is common ground that the vessel was ready fordelivery at the relevant time. It is also apposite to note the observations made by Roskill LJ in his judgment immediately followingthe passage already cited:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The second point was somewhat different from the first. Mr Thomas invited us to assume that the view which I have just expressedis right, contrary to his main submission. Then he submitted that that liability under that guarantee presupposed that there remaineda liability under the building contracts and that once the building contracts came to an end - as it is agreed they did on Oct. 21,1976 - the liability to pay the instalments under the guarantees ceased and were replaced by a claim not for debt but for damages.</p>        <p class="quote">In that connection reliance was placed upon a passage in the speech of Lord Diplock at p. 350 of the <em>Lep Air Services</em> case to which I have already referred. Lord Diplock was there discussing the nature of an accepted repudiation of a contract. Hesaid:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'Generally speaking, the rescission of the contract puts an end to the primary obligations of the party not in default to performany of his contractual promises which he has not already performed by the time of the rescission. It deprives him of any right asagainst the other party to continue to perform them. It does not give rise to any secondary obligation in substitution for a primaryobligation which has come to an end. The primary obligation of the party in default to perform any of the promises made by him andremaining unperformed likewise comes to an end as does his right to continue to perform them,. But for his primary obligations thereis substituted by operation of law a secondary obligation to pay to the other party a sum of money to compensate him for the losshe has sustained as a result of the failure to perform the primary obligations. This secondary obligation is just as much an obligationarising from the contract as are the primary obligations that it replaces.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr Thomas, relying on that passage, submitted that whatever the position might have been before Oct. 21, 1976, once the repudiationtook effect on that date and the building contracts were at an end, there ceased to be any liability to pay the instalments underthe contracts and, therefore, there ceased to be any collateral obligations to pay those instalments under the guarantee. With respectto that argument, Lord Diplock in that passage was not dealing with a case where before the date of the acceptance of repudiationthere had been an accrued right to the payment of a debt. That is the position here. I put to Mr Thomas during the argument thisexample: suppose one had had a contract for the sale of goods by instalments, the instalments to be delivered and paid for on May1, June 1, July 1, Aug. 1, and so on. The first delivery was made on May 1 and the buyer, in breach of his obligations, took deliverybut did not pay. Before June 1 he repudiated and the seller accepted that action as a repudiation of the entirety of the contractstill remaining to be performed. If Mr Thomas's argument be right, the seller's accrued claim for the price of the goods deliveredon May 1 would, by some process of law which I confess I do not understand, be suddenly converted to a claim for damages, again Iknow not of what kind, and he would lose the benefit of the accrued right to payment because, due to the subsequent default of thebuyer, he chose to accept the buyer's conduct as repudiation. With respect to Mr Thomas, that quotation from Lord Diplock does notsupport this argument, which seems to me to be wrong both on principle and on authority. To my mind, the fact that these contractscame to an end on Oct. 21, 1976, did not free the buyers from their respective obligations to pay the various instalments, liabilityfor which had already accrued, and accordingly on the construction which I believe to be the right construction, the guarantors'several liabilities for those instalments under the respective guarantees remained wholly unaffected. The second argument thereforealso fails."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> What is apparent from this passage is that an obligation to pay instalments which have already accrued is not extinguished when aagreement comes to an end. Rather than supporting the arguments being advanced by Mr Ho this passage would tend to support the submissionsbeing made by Mr Scott.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> At this point it is necessary to consider the main issue which arises on this appeal namely whether the claim being made by the petitioneris a liquidated claim.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The definition in <em>Fletcher</em> earlier cited in this judgment is in our view an accurate statement of the law.

The fact that the vessel was sold by the shipyard doesnot make the claim an unliquidated one. What is necessary is to consider whether the claim can be arithmetically calculated.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Also if the performance guarantee is read carefully it is clear that the rights of the petitioner are not circumscribed in the mannercontended for by Mr Ho.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Mr Ho accepted that if the main submissions he was advancing were not accepted the claim for the loss of commission would logicallyfollow the same principles as those obtaining for the non-payment of the instalments.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> For the reasons which have been given we are of the view that the claims now being advanced in the statutory demand are liquidatedclaims. This being the case we consider that this appeal is allowed and the Judge's order should be set aside and an order <em>nisi</em> should be made that the petitioner should have the costs both before us and in the court below. This appeal is only concerned withwhether there should be an order striking out the petition, it is not entirely appropriate for this court to decide whether a bankruptcyorder should be made. However, to avoid any doubt and in view of the above matters, the petitioner should be at liberty to restorethe petition for hearing in the bankruptcy court.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Hon Cheung JA</strong>:</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> I agree with the decision and reasons of Mayo VP and Chung J. I would like to add the following observation.</p>    <p class="heading">Nature of the application</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> This is an appeal by the Petitioner ("Bright Islands") against the striking out of its petition by the debtor ("Mr Chao") on theground that the peitition was an abuse of the process of the court. Although it was a striking out application pursuant to Order18 Rule 19 of the Rules of the High Court (applicable to bankruptcy proceedings by reason of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 99(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a> ("the Ordinance")), both parties had in effect treated the application as a determination on whether there was a bona fide disputeon the existence of a debt. This is apparent from the approach taken by the parties in this appeal. They argued the matter as ifit was an appeal from a dismissal of the petition. At the end of the submissions, Mr. Scott S.C., counsel for Bright Islands eveninvited this court to pronounce a verdict on the petition and declare Mr. Chao bankrupt.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> This approach is also consistent with what Rogers J. (as he then was) said in Re ICS Computer Distribution Ltd., (formerly knownas Cheflink Ltd.)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20HKLR%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 HKLR 181</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The procedure of winding up a company for "insolvency" by petition is a summary one. The test which the court applies is whetherthe debt is bona fide disputed on substantial grounds. These are words which appear time after time in the cases. As a matter ofpractice, and not it may be noted as a matter of law, where the court is satisfied that this criteria is satisfied the CompaniesCourt should not embark on a trial to determine the issue of the validity of the debt. The petition is therefore dismissed or "takenoff the file" unless there are unusual circumstances about the case or the issues involved can be disposed of very simply. In thatevent the Companies Court may determine the dispute itself or the petition may be stayed and left on file pending determination.</p>        <p class="quote">As a matter of practice there does not appear to be any difference in approach between the determination of the validity of a defenceto a petition and an application to strike out a petition. Frequently, the 2 are heard and decided at the same time without distinctionbeing drawn."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Although this was said in the context of a striking out application of a company's winding up petition, this approach is applicableto a bankruptcy petition as well as shown in cases such as <strong>Leung Hoi</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20HKC%20276" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 HKC 276.</a> Further, although in this case the striking out application was dealt with separately from the petition itself, this does not distractthe real nature of the application.</p>    <p class="heading">Facts</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> It is not necessary to go into the details of the facts in this case. It is sufficient to note that Bright Islands had entered intoa contract ("the Ship Building Contract") with a shipyard ("the shipyard") in the Mainland, China to buy a vessel. Nissho Iwai Corporation("Nissho Iwai"), the parent company of Bright Islands, guaranteed the shipyard the payment and performance by Bright Islands of thiscontract.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Bright Islands entered into a contract ("the Ship Sales Contract") with Finex Shipping Limited ("Finex") to sell the vessel to Finex.Mr. Chao, the beneficial owner of Finex, guaranteed the payment and performance by Finex.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Finex was to pay the contract sum of US$29,704,000.00 by four instalments. It managed only to pay one instalment and failed to paythe other three instalments or take delivery of the vessel.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Bright Islands by a notice dated 18 October 1999 informed Finex and Mr. Chao that, pursuant to Clause 4 of Article XI of the ShipSales Contract, it had cancelled that contract. It also intended to sell the vessel pursuant to Clause 5 of Article XI.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Bright Islands was unable to fulfill its own obligations to the shipyard. The vessel was eventually sold, not by Bright Islands,but by the shipyard on 19 November 1999 for a net sum of US$20,825,000.00. The shipyard then claimed against Bright Islands and NisshoIwai for the deficiency between the contract price together with costs and interest under the Ship Building Contract and the resaleprice of the vessel amounting to US$7,065,710.86 on 28 December 1999. Nissho Iwai settled the claim for US$6 million.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Bright Islands then claimed against Finex and Mr. Chao. The terms of the Ship Building Contract and Ship Sales Contract are identical.What Bright Islands stood to gain from this back to back arrangement is a commission of US$300,000.00 payable by the shipyard undera separate commission agreement.</p>    <p class="heading">The statutory demand</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> Under the statutory demand issued to Mr. Chao, the debt is US$6,305,772.88, made up as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1) Shortfall on sale of the vessel totalling US$7,065,710.86 but limited to US$6,000,000.00;</p>        <p>2) US$270,000.00 being loss of commission on cancellation of the Ship Building Contract and the Ship Sales Contract; and</p>        <p>3) $35,872.88 being legal fees.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The shortfall</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The shortfall of US$7,065,710.86 was particularised in a letter dated 7 January 2000 from Bright Islands to Mr. Chao. Without goinginto details, it is made up as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1) unpaid contract price of US$26,733,600.00 (i.e. the 2nd, 3rd and 4th instalments) together with interests in delayed payment ofthe 2nd and 3rd instalments and extra costs in building, making a total of US$27,290,390.55;</p>        <p>2) other sums such as interest on unpaid contract price, maintenance, quay fees, dry docking, fees for functional sea trial, makinga total of US$20,825,000.00;</p>        <p>3) from these two sums, a credit of US$20,825,000 was given for the proceeds of sale of the vessel.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> The ultimate shortfall is confined to US$6,000,000.00 because Nissho Iwai's settlement with the shipyard was for that sum.</p>    <p class="heading">Debt of a liquidated sum</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Mr. Ho S.C., counsel for Mr. Chao, now based his case on striking out almost exclusively on this ground : the bankruptcy court hasno jurisdiction to deal with the matter because the petition is based not on a debt in that the claim is not a liquidated sum. Despitehis extremely persuasive arguments, I am not satisfied that there is a substantial dispute on this point which requires the petitionto be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> The requirement that a bankruptcy petition can only be based on a debt in the form of a liquidated sum is clearly provided by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 6(1)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 6(2)(b)</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The distinction of a liquidated sum and damages is likewise well established :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A debt is a definite sum of the performance of a specified obligation by the other party or upon the occurrence of some specifiedevent or condition; damages may be claimed from a party who has broken his contractual obligation in some way other than failureto pay such a debt.</p>        <p class="quote">The term liquidated damages is applied where the damages have been agreed and fixed by the parties (in respect of which the law hasdeveloped criteria for their validity), or fixed by statute as in the case of damages against parties to a dishonoured bill of exchange.Unliquidated damages is the term applied where the damages are at large and are to be assessed by a jury or by a judge sitting asa jury; the rules as to remoteness of damage are the main criteria for such damages."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> 28 Ed. Vol. 1 Paras. 27-008 and 27-009. Para. 6/2/4 of the <em>Hong Kong Civil Procedure</em> further states that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A liquidated demand is in the nature of a debt, i.e. a specific sum of money due and payable under or by virtue of a contract. Itsamount must either be already ascertained or capable of being ascertained as a mere matter of arithmetic. If the ascertainment ofa sum of money, even though it be specified or named as a definite figure, requires investigation beyond mere calculation, then thesum is not a "debt or liquidated demand", but constitutes "damages".</p>        <p>The words "debt or liquidated demand" do not extend to unliquidated damages, whether in tort or in contract, even though the amountof such damages be named at a definite figure (<em>Knight v. Abbott</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2010%20QBD%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 10 Q.B.D. 11).</a> A claim for a stated sum of money paid to the defendant for a consideration which has failed is a recognised form of liquidated demand."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> The difficulty in this case is applying these well known principles to the claim under the statutory demand.</p>    <p class="heading">Bright Islands' case</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Mr. Scott submitted that the sums claimed are liquidated sums. After Bright Islands cancelled the Ship Sales Contract, it becameentitled to exercise its remedies under common law and under that contract specifically against Finex, including an express rightto sell the vessel without being answerable for any loss and damage and set off the proceeds against the sums definite payable byFinex. Finex remained liable for any deficiency between the amounts payable by it and the sale of the vessel. Not having paid thedeficiency, Finex failed to discharge a contract liability and remains in breach. Accordingly, Bright Islands is entitled to demandpayment of the deficiency from Mr. Chao under the guarantee.</p>    <p class="heading">Article XI</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Under Clause 5(a) of Article XI of the Ship Sales Contract, Bright Islands may, after cancelling or rescinding the contract, sellthe vessel "without being answerable for any loss of damage occasioned to [Finex]." In the case of a sale of completed vessel, theproceeds of sale received by Bright Islands will apply first to payment of the expenses of the sale and second to payment of allunpaid instalments and interest : Clause 5(b). There is another provision for applying the proceeds of sale of a vessel in its incompletestate. Clause 5(d) further provides that the excess of the proceeds of sale after it had been applied in accordance with the earlierprovisions is to be returned to Finex. In case of deficiency, Finex "shall promptly pay the deficiency to [Bright Islands] upon request": Clause 5(e).</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> It is clear that in order to rely on Clause 5, Bright Islands must be the one who had sold the vessel and received the proceeds ofsale. This is what the clause provides. If this happens, the claim for deficiency by Bright Islands may well be in the nature ofa liquidated claim because it is payable under the contract. The amount is capable of being ascertained as a mere matter of arithmetic.However, in this case Bright Islands did not sell the vessel and did not receive the proceeds of sale. It therefore cannot rely onClause 5 to claim the deficiency from Finex. This is not a technical point.</p>    <p class="heading">Common Law</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> If Bright Islands cannot rely on Clause 5 in order to constitute the claim as a liquidated claim, then whether its common law remedywill constitute the claim in the form of a liquidated claim will depend on whether it is based on the price or damages for non-acceptanceby Finex. It is fair to say that the present claim does give the impression that it is one based on damages. It is confusing to referto a claim on deficiency under the common law claim. It is helpful to remind oneself of the principles set out in <em>Benjamin's Sale of Goods</em> 5th Ed. Para. 16-054 ï¼</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where the property in the goods has not passed to the buyer, the seller's normal remedy in most circumstances is an action for damages: for damages for non-acceptance under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 50(1)</a>, [of the Sale of Goods Act] for consequential losses or expenses under section 54, or for losses or expenses under section 37. Section50(1) provides that : "Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods, the seller may maintain anaction against him for damages for non-acceptance." This subsection is wide enough to cover non-acceptance when the property hasalready passed to the buyer, in which case it allows damages for non-acceptance as an alternative remedy to a claim for the price.But the advantages of suing for the price as a debt clearly outweigh those of suing for unliquidated damages for non-acceptance.If, however, there is some doubt as to whether the property in the goods has passed to the buyer, the seller who sues for the pricewhen the buyer has not taken delivery of the goods runs the risk that the court may hold that property had not passed to the buyer: in this event, it follows that the seller's only remedy is a claim for damages for non-acceptance, and that the seller would beexpected to mitigate his loss (e.g. by reselling) as from the date when the buyer should have accepted the goods. So long as theseller is claiming the price, he must hold the goods available for delivery to the buyer when the buyer pays the price, but his failureto resell may lead to a reduction in his damages if it is later held that he was not entitled to the price. If the seller resellswhen he is entitled to do so, he is treated as having terminated the contract so that his only claim against the buyer is for damages.If he attempts to resell, this may be taken as an acceptance of the buyer's repudiation of his obligations under the contract, inwhich case the seller is also relegated to his claim in damages."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Claim for unpaid instalments</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> However, in this case, Bright Islands is clearly entitled to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th instalments of the price of the vessel. The termsof payment were provided for in Clause 3 of Article II. Specifically, the 4th instalment was to pay upon delivery of the vessel.Bright Islands had, by a notice dated 30 September 1999, informed Finex that it had received notice from the shipyard to pay theunpaid balance of the contract price and take delivery of the vessel immediately. It then made a similar request to Finex. The failureby Finex to comply with the request constituted default under Clause 1 (a), (b) and (c) of Article XI. The default enabled BrightIslands to rescind the contract under Clause 4(b)(i) of Article XI.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Under Clause 4(b)(iii) the default to pay the 2nd and 3rd instalments also enabled it to "demand, recover and exercise" its rightsunder the guarantee signed by Mr. Chao. This is "without prejudice to its right to recover from [Finex] all instalments due and payablebefore/on delivery of the VESSEL together with all interests, costs and/or expenses by applying the proceeds to be obtained fromsale of the VESSEL pursuant to the provisions set out below and in accordance with the provisions set out in this Contract."</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> While Bright Islands cannot rely on the provisions relating to the sale of the vessel or the proceeds of sale referred to in Clause5, clearly by virtue of the above clause it is entitled to recover the unpaid instalments.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> In <strong>Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.

He further held that<strong>Lep Air Services</strong> had not affected the law because the observation in that case about instalments not becoming payable after the contract was broughtto an end by acceptance of repudiation, was in respect of future instalments and not instalments where right to payment had alreadyaccrued.

It included other claims. But as pointedout in <strong>In re A Debtor</strong> (No. 1 of 1987)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20WLR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 WLR 271</a> (a case referred to <strong>In re A Debtor</strong> (No. 64 of 1992)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 264)</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"deficiencies in the form and contents of a statutory demand, even including errors involving the overstatement of the debtor's indebtednessto the creditor, will not automatically entitle the debtor to have the demand set aside.

After all, the claim for the unpaid instalments isat the core of Bright Islands' claim. This is shown in the particulars of the claim on the shortfall.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> If in substance the debt is based on the unpaid instalments, then it cannot be said there is a bona fide dispute on substantial groundson the validity of the debt. The unpaid instalment are clearly liquidated sums provided by the contract.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> In re A debtor (No. 64 of 1992), a debtor was liable to the creditor under a mortgage. The creditor issued a statutory demand claiminga sum based on the debt under the mortgage less the estimated value of a security held by the creditor. It was held by Colin RimerQ.C., sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge in England, that the claim remained to be a liquidated sum. This approach was followedin Hong Kong in <strong>Re Kwok Chok Yee</strong> (HCB No. 670 of 1999).</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> The English case was, of course, concerned with Rule 6.1(5) of the Insolvency Rules (a similar provision is in s. 6B of the Ordinance)which recognized that it is competent for a secured creditor to place a value on its security and to serve a statutory demand ofthe total debt less such value. But in my view this issue will not necessarily restrict the application of that case in respect ofcredit being given to a debt which is obviously in the form of a liquidated claim. As Colin Rimer Q.C. observed the statutory demandmay be set aside if there is credible evidence that the credited amount is grossly undervalued, but this is not because the debtclaimed is not a liquidated claim but rather, given the true value of the credit, the debtor is not truly indebted at all.</p>    <p class="heading">Undervalue and sabotage</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> As to the contentions by Mr. Chao that the sale was at a gross undervalue and Nissho Iwai had sabotaged his attempt to find a purchaserfor the vessel, these had not been raised by him at all at the time he was notified by Bright Islands in November 1999 of the intendedsale of the vessel at US$21 million or after he received the demand for payment in January 2000. These allegation only surfaced inhis second affidavit of 7 June 2000. The allegation of sabotage was couched in vague terms. It was obviously in the interest of NisshoIwai to obtain a high price in the sale so as to minimize its loss.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> It is important to bear in mind that the actual sale of the vessel was without the benefit of the charterparty. This reduced thevalue of the vessel. It was due to Finex's failure to pay for the instalments and take delivery of the vessel that rendered it unableto fulfill the contract with the charterer. Further, even based on Mr. Chao's own estimate of the value of the vessel at the timeof sale at the maximum of US$23.5 million, there is still a substantial indebtedness of US$3,233,600.00 after deducting the estimatedvalue from the unpaid instalments of US$26,733,600.00. A bankruptcy order can still be made on this basis, as Peter Gibson L.J. observedin <strong>TSB Bank plc v. Platts</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20BCLC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 BCLC 1</a> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We cannot see why the bankruptcy court, if there was material before it enabling it to do so, should not evaluate the maximum whichthe debtor could recover under the cross-claim; and if the net sum after deducting that maximum value of the cross-claim from thedebt was ï¿¡750 or more we do not see why it should not be able to make a bankruptcy order."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> I do not regard these allegations to be so substantial as to merit the striking out of the petition.

In the first of the <strong>Hyundai</strong> cases, Roskill L.J. in the Court of Appeal held that the guarantee should be construed as a whole and not break into different limbs;the commercial purpose of the document was to ensure payment by the guarantor if the buyer did not pay the instalments on their duedates.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> Accepting this to be the proper approach, the issue in this appeal remains to be whether the debts are liquidated sums or not. Ifthey are not, the conclusive evidence clause in the guarantee will not turn them into liquidated claims. This, however, is not amatter that needs to be dwelled upon in view of my decision.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> I will also allow the appeal.</p>    <p><strong>Hon Mayo VP</strong>:</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> The appeal is allowed and the costs order proposed above is made.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Simon Mayo)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Peter Cheung)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">(Andrew Chung)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Vice-President</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="33%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. John Scott SC, instructed by Messrs Deacons, for the Petitioner.</p>        <p>Mr Ambrose Ho SC and Mr Michael Yin, instructed by Messrs Hobson &amp; Ma, for the Respondent.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2002/433.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
