Lonrho Ltd. and others had just completed an oil refinery in Southern Rhodesia, connectedby a pipeline to near the port of Beira in Mozambique, and alleged in their action that by promising and subsequently maintainingalternative oil supplies in breach of the sanctions, the Defendants encouraged the Declaration of Independence and prolonged itsduration, to the detriment of the Plaintiffs and to their expected profits from the pipeline. Their claim was put in the alternative:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...... either as an innominate tort, committed by Shell and by B.P. severally, of causing foreseeable loss by an unlawful act; oras a joint tort of conspiring together to do an unlawful act which caused damage to Lonrho."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>The matter came before the court by way of arbitration proceedings and a series of questions. The question of interest before theirlordships was No. 5 :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Even if there were breaches by the respondents of the 1965 and 1968 Orders" [sc. the sanctions Orders] "(a) whether breaches of thoseOrders would give rise to a right of action in the claimants for damage alleged to have been caused by those breaches and (b) whetherthe claimants have a cause of action for damage alleged to have been caused by such breaches by virtue only of the allegation thatthere was an agreement to effect them."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Both were answered in the negative, but the words used by Lord Diplock in disposing of the second question gave rise to differencesof judicial opinion.

They set out their reasons, which we find attractive, in a comprenensiveanalysis of the authorities and of Lord Diplock's speech in <u>Lonrho</u> itself. They accept that the House deliberately made a policy decision to define and confine what it considered the anomalous tortof conspiracy within limits that were forced upon it by decisions too well established to be set aside. Their conclusion is succinctlyset out in one sentence at p.604 :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In our view the House plainly intended the presence of a predominant intention to injure to be the touchstone of an actionable conspiracy."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>and later at p.609 :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In our view, however, Lonrho is an insuperable obstacle to his claim as pleaded and presented, since M. &amp; R. are unable to contendthat D.L.J. and A.C.L.I., in making the alleged agreement and performing pursuant to that agreement the acts which caused damageto them, had the sole or predominant purpose of injuring them. Lonrho establishes such a purpose as an essential ingredient of theEnglish tort of conspiracy."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> We would respectfully agree.

Williams Furniture</u> are on this view necessarily overruled, are both matters which may, we respecfully suggest, tend to raise doubt to some extent, wedo not think they outweigh the other factors recited by the Court of Appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr. Mills-Owens, for the Plaintiffs, suggests that we should not come to such a firm decision at this stage, but rather being satisfiedthat there is some uncertainty as to the law, leave the question open until the facts to which it will be applied have been discoveredat first instance. This was the course adopted by Vinelott, J., in <u>Derby &amp; Co. v. Weldon (No.5) (Ch.D.)</u>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20WLR%201244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989], 1 W.L.R., 1244</a>, in somewhat similar circumstances. But it is clear that the judge was influenced by the fact that the appeal from the Court of Appealdecision in <u>Metall v. Rohstoff</u> was likely to be heard before his own case was ready for trial. In the event it was not, the parties having eventually settled theirdifferences without the assistance of the House of Lords.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Another case on which Mr. Mills-Owens relied was <u>Lonrho Plc. v. Fayed</u>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%203%20WLR%20631" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989], 3 W.L.R., 631</a>, in which, refusing to strike out a Statement of Claim on the grounds that it disclosed no cause of action, Dillon L.J. remarkedat 639 :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Whether or not that can be made out is a matter for investigation, in my judgment, at the trial of the action. It is not right toendeavour to try complicated issues of causation on a striking out application on what might or might not appear to be on paper,on the balance of probabilities, the foreseeable outcome of a trial."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>We have to observe, however, that the claim there was for wrongful interference with trade or business, a tort which Dillon L.J hadearlier recognised as one for which the detailed limits have yet to be defined; this was, he said at 638C-D, something which shouldbe done "on the actual facts as they emerge at the trial rather than on a set of hypotheses, more or less wide, in very comprehensivepleadings". That is a very different situation from the present, where we are faced with a self-contained question of law which canbe answered quite simply as a preliminary point without reference to any fact whatsoever, as happened in <u>Lonrho</u> itself. Whether it can be expected, as in that case, to save an immense cost in time and money, is difficult to estimate. Mr. Bernacchi,for the Defendant, claims it will. Mr. Mills-Owens suggests otherwise, because the underlying facts will, in his view, still needto be established for the alternative claim in fraudulent misrepresentation. Be that as it may, we think it better that the questionshould be settled at this stage so that the parties and the trial judge will know where they stand in the course of the action. Weappreciate that should the Plaintiffs wish to test the correctness of our conclusion there will, of necessity, be some delay. Weforesee no other problem. In that case the Plaintiffs may prefer to defer their proceeding on the other claims until that is done.This should cause them no undue detriment. Each is a financial institution, and their claims must depend almost entirely upon documentaryevidence. The ultimate resolution of the conspiracy claims must in any event depend upon a final resolution of the question of law.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> We turn then to the second question, can the overt acts as pleaded possibly ground a predominant purpose to injure the 1st Plaintiff.We take them as they appear in the Statement of Claim, without allowing for anything more which may perhaps be unearthed by way ofdiscovery or elicited in cross-examination from the Defendants or their witnesses. We are mindful of Lord Herschell's stricturesin <u>Dow Hager Lawance v. Lord Worreys and Others</u>, [1890], 15 Appeal Cases, 210, at 219 :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It cannot be doubted that the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to dismiss an action which is an abuse of the process of the Court.It is a jurisdiction which ought to be very sparingly exercised, and only in very exceptional cases. I do not think its exercisewould be justified merely because the story told in the pleading was highly improbable, and one which it was difficult to believecould be proved."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> But we do not see the present case within that category at all. Rather we find it more appropriate to the words used by Hirst, J.,in <u>Allied Arab Bank v. Hajjar (No. 2)</u> at 953 :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"indeed to seek to place such an interpretation (i.e. a predominant purpose to injure the bank's interest) upon the facts relied onby the bank would be far-fetched almost to the point of absurdity".</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>In our view no reasonable judge could infer from the facts set out in the Statement of Claim a predominant purpose other than to benefitAlbert Kwok himself. If, as we nave decided a sole or predominant purpose to injure the Plaintiff is an essential ingredient of thetort of conspiracy, the claims in conspiracy as presently put forward are doomed to failure. The judge was therefore wrong to admitthem by way of amendment.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> For this reason we allow the appeal and set aside the judgement below insofar as it extends to the claims in conspiracy, i.e. toparagraphs 28A - 41, 42 - 53, 54 - 65, 66 - 77, 78 - 91, and 92 - 103.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" height="19">(D.
