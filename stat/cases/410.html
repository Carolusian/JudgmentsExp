The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs to be taxed on an indemnity basis. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p><b>Hon. Yuen JA:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  This is the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs appeal from a judgment of Chung J. dismissing the Plaintiffsâ claim for damages for defamation.  In his judgment,the judge said the subject-matter of the action was trivial and he described the action as âmaking a mountain out of a mole hillâ. The judge criticized the Plaintiffs, who are solicitors, for wasting judicial resources on such an unworthy cause.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  This court dismissed the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs appeal without calling on counsel for the respondent.  After hearing submissions, we also ordered that the appellantpay the respondentâs costs on an indemnity basis.  The reasons for our judgment and order for costs appear below.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The background to the action was commonplace enough.  The Defendant Miss Yick owned a flat (33C) in a block of flats.  It was occupiedby a tenant.   A Ms Yiu owned the flat below (32C). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In March - April 2003, water seepage was noticed on the ceiling of 32C.  Ms Yiu instructed a firm of solicitors, Fung, Wong, Ng&amp; Lam ("<u>FWNL</u>"). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 28 April 2003, FWNL wrote to the Defendant complaining of the seepage and demanding that action be taken by her within 5 days.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  At the expiry of that period on 3 May 2003, the Defendant replied to FWNL saying that she was now investigating the complaint ofwater seepage, and indicating that she would seek professional assistance or assistance from a government authority to check if thewater did in fact come from 33C.</p>    <p class="heading">Appointment for surveyor to inspect 33C</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 6 May 2003, FWNL replied to the Defendant saying that Ms Yiu had appointed an expert on 5 May 2003 to confirm the cause of seepage. (Pausing here, it is obvious from this letter that the expert referred to must have been someone other than the solicitors themselves,as the solicitors had been involved before 5 May 2003).  FWNL went on to say that as 33C had not been available for inspection on5 May 2003, another inspection by <i>"oursâ expert"</i> (presumably meaning "our clientâs expert") would be arranged. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On the same day, the Defendant wrote to the management company (with a copy to FWNL) confirming her agreement to allow Ms Yiuâs<i>surveyors</i> to enter 33C for inspection on 13 May 2003 at a stated time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 9 May 2003, FWNL wrote to the Defendant advising that "oursâ <i>expert</i> will come and inspect your premises on 13<sup>th</sup> May 2003 (Tuesday) at about 3:00 p.m. to conduct investigation into the seepage ..." (emphasis added).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  It is thus clear that at no stage had the Defendant agreed that anyone other than Ms Yiuâs <i>surveyor</i> would be permitted entry into 33C. </p>    <p class="heading">Events of 13 May 2003</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 13 May 2003 however, the following 6 persons went to 33C:</p>    <blockquote>        (1) the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, who was a solicitor at FWNL, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, who was a trainee at the same firm;         <p>(2) Ms Yiuâs sister;</p>(3) Mr Stewart Wong, a surveyor ("<u>the Surveyor</u>");        <p>(4) Mr Lee and Mr Choi from the management company ("<u>the Management Staff</u>").</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff had brought along a tape recorder, and a transcript of the tape recording was placed before the judge and this court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Inside 33C were the Defendant and the tenant.  The Management Staff informed the Defendant that the surveyor had arrived. Counselfor the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff accepted that before the 6 persons entered 33C, no one had informed the Defendant that any solicitors were included inthe party. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  After they gained entry, the Defendant asked for their identities.  The Surveyor gave his name card to the Defendant and Ms Yiuâssister was identified as such.  At a point in time which the judge found was "very shortly after the Plaintiffs and the others wereallowed into the Defendantâs flat", and according to the transcript after someone had addressed the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as "solicitor", the Defendant asked the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff for his name card.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  For some reason which this court cannot understand, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff refused to give it to the Defendant.  He referred her to the correspondence.  That was however of no assistance, becausewhat the Defendant was asking for were the name cards of the persons who had entered her premises in order to verify their identities.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  When the Management Staff asked the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff again for his name card, he again said that he would not supply it.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  According to the transcript, the Defendant said at that stage that she would not then know who they were, and asked how she wouldbe able to identify them. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The judge found that the Defendant thereupon asked the Plaintiffs to leave her property.  This finding was based on the evidenceof the Defendant herself, the tenant and the Management Staff (who also said that as they were on private property, the owner hada right to request unknown persons to leave).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Indeed the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs own evidence was that having been asked to leave, he indicated that they would leave.  However, they did not leave,probably because (as the judge found) at that point, the Surveyor said that they were in the same "group" (using the word in English). The Defendant did not then press the Plaintiffs to leave, and the judge found that nothing further was said about the Plaintiffsâpresence. </p>    <p class="heading">Allegedly defamatory statement - Defendantâs letter dated 14 May 2003</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The next day, the Defendant wrote a letter to Ms Yiu, which was copied to the Surveyorâs firm, the management company and FWNL. The letter (in its original text) is reproduced below:</p>    <blockquote>        "Dear Madam,        <p>I refer to your letter from Fung Wong Ng &amp; Lam dated May 9/03 which confirmed âexpertâ will come and inspect my premises onMay 13/03 at 3:00 p.m. to conduct investigation of water seepage.</p>It happened to me yesterday apart Mr Steward S.T. Wong, Proficient Surveyors &amp; Co. claimed as the âsurveyorâ, there had also<i>two unknown men</i> said by the âsurveyorâ that they were the âsolicitorsâ also entered into my premises without my permission despite myselfand the management office demanding them to leave for the reason they were unable to provide any of their identity and proof of theirprofession.        <p>I hereby strongly protest that it is totally beyond our previous agreement and now I would also very doubt of the truthfulness andcorrectness of the water seepage investigation report.  Meanwhile I must stress that I reserve all my legal right and complaint tothe LAW SOCIETY office in Hong Kong".</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Events after Defendantâs letter</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff took offence at this.

As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement, he held that the most injurious meaning it could bear was that the Plaintiffs had trespassed on the Defendantâs propertyand in doing so, had acted unethically and unprofessionally.  However, he held (referring to <i>Groom v Crocker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%203%20All%20ER%20844" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 3 All ER 844</a>, 848) that it was not defamatory to accuse a person of a minor act of tort (para. 42).</p>    <p class="heading">Justification</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In any event, the judge held that the defence of justification applied to both statements.  As for the 1<sup>st</sup> statement, the Plaintiffs had in fact failed to disclose proof of their identities.  As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement, the judge read the letter strictly as a statement that the Plaintiffs had âenteredâ the property without the Defendantâspermission, not that they had continued to âstayâ there without permission.  As the Defendant had asked them to leave shortlyafter they had entered the property and they had not done so, the judge held that their entry was unauthorised.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Accordingly, the judge did not consider it necessary to consider the other defence of honest comment.  The judge also indicated thatthe defence of qualified privilege might have been relevant.  However this had not been pleaded as a defence.

He had described the 1<sup>st</sup> statement as âfailureâ to disclose proof of identity, a word which may be regarded as more accusatory in nature than the wordâunableâ. In any event, I would have thought that in the circumstances, in saying that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was âunableâ to produce proof of his identity when he had actually refused to do so for no good reason, the Defendantcould be said to have been using a more courteous turn of phrase, rather than making a defamatory statement.</p>    <p class="heading">Point (2)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> As for the second point on appeal, I am prepared to accept for present purposes that it is difficult to derive from <i>Groom v Crocker</i> authority for the judgeâs proposition that a statement that a person (in particular a solicitor)  had committed the tort of trespasswas not defamatory.  I do not think it is necessary to decide this issue in the present appeal, because even if the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement did bear that defamatory meaning, the defence of justification was made out. </p>    <p class="heading">Point (3)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> As for the defence of justification of the 1<sup>st</sup> statement, I have discussed earlier (para. 34) the meaning of the word âunableâ in the Defendantâs letter.  But even if a defamatorymeaning is to be given to the word âunableâ, it would be justified.  A solicitor would reasonably be expected to carry his namecard with him whilst going about his clientâs business, and would reasonably be expected to produce it when asked for it.  Whenhe does not do so, he has clearly been unable to produce the most conventional means of proving his identity and profession. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff submitted that it was not true that he was unable to provide âproof of his identity and professionâ, because he hadonly refused to show his name card when the Defendant asked for it, and he had not been asked e.g. for his identity card or his LawSociety membership card. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> I have to say that I was very surprised that such an argument was advanced.  Obviously the purpose of the Defendant asking the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff for his name card was to verify his identity as a solicitor.  Indeed, the transcript shows that the Defendant expresslysaid so.  As I have noted above, a solicitorâs name card is the most conventionally-known means of verifying his identity as asolicitor, even if not the most reliable.  There was no evidence to show that members of the public knew that solicitors carry LawSociety membership cards as another means of proof of their identity and profession.  In any event, the argument is artificial asthe 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff never offered to show the Defendant any alternative means of verifying his identity as a solicitor, such as his Law Societymembership card. </p>    <p class="heading">Point (4)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Finally, it was submitted on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff that (a) he had not trespassed on the property as he had been allowed entry.  That is clearly wrong.  It was not as ifthere was a turnstile at the Defendantâs door serving as a checkpoint for each individual coming through the doorway.  The Defendanthad only consented to entry by the surveyor, and prior to their entry, she was only told that the surveyor had arrived.  Clearlythe 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs initial entry was not with the Defendantâs consent. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> As for (b), counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff submitted that after the Surveyor said that he was with his âgroupâ, the Defendant did not repeat her demand that heleave the property, and so any earlier trespass had been waived with retroactive effect.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> It is clear law that a person cannot be held to have waived or abandoned his legal rights if he does not have full knowledge of thefacts.  When the Surveyor said that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was in his âgroupâ, that statement was ambiguous.  He was representing that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was there in the capacity as part of a surveyorâs team (for whom the Defendant was obliged to permit entry).  At best(for the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs case), the Defendant was given conflicting information about the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs identity and capacity.  At worst, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was staying in the Defendantâs property under false pretences.  A waiver or abandonment of a legal right could not reasonablybe inferred in those circumstances. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> It was submitted on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff that the Surveyor was taking responsibility for him, and that was accepted by the Defendant which was why she did not persistin her request that he leave the property.  That submission is not justified on the evidence.  The Defendant was not concerned withwho would take responsibility for the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs actions on the property.  The question of <i>responsibility</i> was never raised.  The Defendant was expressly concerned with <i>identity</i>, and as the Defendant had just asked the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to leave as he had not verified his identity, what the Surveyor said was obviously directed at that issue to make his continuedpresence acceptable to the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> By reason of the above matters, I do not consider that the Defendant had waived the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs trespass and on the undisputed evidence, the defence of justification was clearly made out.    </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs appeal was accordingly dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Indemnity basis for costs</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> As for costs, it is now established that an award of indemnity costs can be made where there is some special and unusual feature(<i>Town Planning Board v Society for the Protection of the Harbour Ltd (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%207%20HKCFAR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 7 HKCFAR 114).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs conduct in refusing to provide a name card was not only surprising but unreasonable and completely unjustified.  Hiscontinued presence on the property (after the Defendant had asked him to leave), purportedly as part of the surveyorâs âgroupâ,was unwise.  His commencement of the action has already been criticized by the trial judge as making a mountain out of a molehill. Perhaps in the heat of the moment with the Defendant threatening a complaint to the Law Society, a letter of demand was consideredappropriate.  But there was a period of 1Â½ years between the events of May 2003 and the trial in November 2004 for a more matureexamination of the wisdom of maintaining this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> It may have been that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was lacking in objectivity by being involved in this case as both litigant and solicitor.  However, having been remindedby the judge that as an officer of the court, he should not have wasted judicial resources in prosecuting this action, he went furtherand brought an unmeritorious appeal.  I regret to have to say that the appeal has to be described as oppressive and the Defendantshould not have to suffer for it.  An award of costs on an indemnity basis was clearly warranted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p><b>Hon.
