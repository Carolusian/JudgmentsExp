The Registrar I was told determined yea by reasonof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sec. 22</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a> and dismissed the application on the authority of <u>Birkett</u> v. <u>James</u><sup>(1)</sup> and <u>Tolley</u> v. <u>Morris</u><sup>(2)</sup>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> I was asked on appeal to determine the same issue.

No argument was advanced on first cause of action on this issue and I assume that it has no relevance. The dependants set out inthe Statement of Claim are all issues of the deceased and if living today would be 25, 20 and 18 years of age respectively.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> This cause of action is a child of statute and as explained by Lord Blackburn in <u>Seward</u> v. "<u>Vera Cruz</u>"<sup>(3)</sup> at pp. 70, 71:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"an action which, as is pointed out in <u>Pym</u> v. <u>Great Northern Railway Company</u>, is new in its species, new in its quality, new in its principle, in every way new."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The Ordinance gives a right of action to certain dependants of a deceased person for the pecuniary loss they have suffered from thedeath of that person occasioned by a wrong doer. Section 4(1) of the Ordinance provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Every such action shall be for the benefit of the dependants of the person whose death has been so caused and shall except as hereinafterprovided, be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased person."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Section 5(1) provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If and so often as it happens, in any of the cases intended and provided for by this Ordinance, that there is no executor or administratorof the person killed within the meaning of this Ordinance, or that, there being such executor or administrator, no such action asaforesaid has, within six months after the death of the person whose death has been so caused as aforesaid, been brought by and inthe name of his executor or administrator, then and in every such case such action may be brought by and in the name or names ofall or any of the persons (if more than one) for whose benefit such action would have been, if it had been brought by and in thename of such executor or administrator."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Section 8 provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"No more than one action shall lie for and in respect of the same subject-matter of complaint."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> To summarise the three sections, the action is for the benefit of the dependants but it must be brought in the name of the executoror administrator of the deceased unless if there is neither or there being one or the other and no action is brought six months afterdeath then and only then may an action be brought by and in the name or names of all or any of the dependants but only one actionlies.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In the present case it is the administrator of the deceased who has brought the action.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 28(3)</a> (a) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> provides that an action under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> shall not be brought after the expiration of three years from the date of death but this is expressly stipulated to be subject toSection 22(1) which extends the limitation period in the case of infants to any time before the expiration of three years, upon attainingmajority. The extension is subject to the proviso that the section shall not affect any case where the right of action first accruedto some (not under a disability) through whom the person under a disability claim. Mr. Barlow for the Attorney General argues thatthough two of the dependants agewise come within Section 22(1) they are disentitled to bring any action now by reason of the provisoin that the right of action first accrued to the administrator who was and is not under a disability and the dependants have claimedthrough him. This has not been fully argued before me and I say no more about it because of the view I take.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Mr. Jackson-Lipkin as I have said relies on the <u>Birkett case</u> and <u>Tolley</u> v. <u>Morris</u>.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Lord Diplock in <u>Walkley</u> v. <u>Precision Forgings Ltd</u>.<sup>(4)</sup> at pp 617 618 explains the ratio of the <u>Birkett</u> <u>case</u> thus:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="10%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">My Lords, <u>Birkett</u> v. <u>James</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20AC%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) A.C. 297</a> was an action for breach of contract for which there is only one kind of limitation period, and that is a primary limitation periodof six years from the date of the cause of action, during which a plaintiff has an indefeasible right to bring his action. What <u>Birkett</u> v. <u>James</u> decided was that, save in very exceptional circumstances, where all that the plaintiff had done was to let his action go to sleep,it would be an improper exercise of the discretion of the court under the practice approved in <u>Allen</u> v. <u>Sir Alfred McAlpine &amp; Sons Ltd</u>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%202%20QB%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 2 Q.B. 229</a>, to dismiss the action for want of prosecution before the expiry of the applicable limitation period if the plaintiff was likelyto bring a second action within that period. The reason was simple: if after the existing action had been struck out the plaintiffhad an indefeasible right to start a second action for the same cause of action, no useful purpose would be served by dismissingthe existing action; it could only lead to further delay.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          This reasoning has no application in a personal injuries action to any period after the primary limitation period has expired.The plaintiff no longer has an indefeasible right to bring a second action for the same cause of action."</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The Court of Appeal in <u>Tolley</u> v. <u>Morris</u> applied <u>Birkett</u> to a personal injuries action where the plaintiff was an infant.

Thoughthe position of each dependant is considered individually at the hearing, the Defendant if found liable only pays one lump sum asthe apportionment between the dependants has nothing to do with him. Unless all the dependants are still under a disability at thetime of the application to strike out I cannot see how <u>Birkett's case</u> can apply. The foundation of that case is the indefeasible right to bring a fresh action. In the present case at least one of thedependants if not two are no longer under a disability and do not have such a right. If the Defendant's application to strike outwere to succeed then the matter ought to be struck out leaving those still under a disability to bring a fresh action if they areso advised. I further add that I have not considered the effect Section 8 of the Ordinance on any new action so arising.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Jackson-Lipkin, Q.C. &amp; G.
