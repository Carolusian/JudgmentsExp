Four of those defendants, Low Chun Song, Low Chun Seng, C.S. Low InvestmentLtd and Ratonite Inc., claim that the solicitors had no such authority because their principal, mediately or immediately, was theHong Kong Government ("the Government") which had no mandate to sue in the name of the named plaintiff. Since the existence of avalid retainer is not a question which can be raised on the pleadings or at trial the four defendants properly, though somewhat tardily,issued summonses to dismiss, stay or strike out the proceedings or the name of the Bank as plaintiff or, alternatively, to add theAttorney General as co-plaintiff. Low Chun Seng sought and seeks an order in the alternative striking out the paragraphs claimingdamages for conspiracy which appeared in the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim. All summonses were dismissed by Deputy High CourtJudge Jerome Chan on l May last and the four defendants now appeal against such dismissals.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The genesis of this dispute is to be found in an operation mounted by the Government to rescue the Bank, which was on the verge ofliquidation, with the cooperation of China International Trust &amp; Investment Corporation (CITIC) and by use of the Exchange Fund.By an agreement dated 21 April 1986 CITIC agreed with the Bank to subscribe and pay for 200 million new $1 ordinary and 150 millionnew $1 preference shares to be issued by the Bank and to make certain further payments as part of a scheme of reconstruction whichinvolved the reduction of the nominal value of the existing shares from $1 to 05 cents. That agreement was followed by a deed betweenthe same parties dated 23 June whereby, after the expiry of three years running from 23 June 1986 and subject to deductions includingrecoveries and provisions for bad debts, CITIC were to pay to the Bank the amount of certain outstanding loans categorised as "non-performing".Both agreement and deed reflected the obligation of the Government, as set out in a deed dated 22 March, to pay like sums on liketerms to CITIC. Further, CITIC, as by far the majority shareholder in the Bank, accepted full responsibility for its management.The payments were duly made. The Government has also purchased and become the equitable assignee of the Bank's rights in relationto the loans allegedly procured as described in the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim. Such rights are worthless. The debtor, CompactInvestment &amp; Finance Ltd ("Compact"), is hopelessly insolvent and in liquidation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The deed of 22 March 1986 also recited the responsibility of the Government, at its own expense, to seek the repayment of the moniesowed to the Bank for which purpose it was to establish "a team of persons to work in Ka wah and its subsidiaries". CITIC acceptedresponsibility to procure the necessary documentation and authority for legal proceedings from the Bank. The three leading membersof the team, Messrs Banner, Lim and Suen, were made officers of the Bank as its memorandum of 7 August 1986 "supplement to No 1/86to our authorised signatures book ... " and the annexed signatures of Mr Banner and Mr Lim made plain. No provision is to be foundin any of the documents for the Government to initiate, in the name of the Bank, any such proceedings as those with which we arenow concerned. Nonetheless the three leaders of the team incorporated under the style "Cambridge Financial Services Ltd", "launched"this action, and others, ostensibly on behalf of the Bank. The verb "launched" was used on behalf of the Secretary for Monetary Affairsin a letter to the Vice-chairman of CITIC, also Chairman of the Board of the Bank, dated 3 August 1987. The letter continued:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As it can never be the intention of CITIC and the Government that the Bank should be entitled to recover from former directors andother parties through actions funded by Government an amount in respect of loans by way of damages and at the same time claim principaland interest in respect of the same loan under the deed with Government, clause 3.1.1.1(b)(i) should be interpreted to include recoveriesfrom the actions referred to above and any similar action launched in future."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>That clause reads:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"During the period of three years after(23 June 1986) any amount of principal received or recovered from the borrowers or obligorsof the loans (either by payment by such borrowers or obligors or by realising securities held in respect of the loans) shall be forthe account of Ka Wah or its relevant subsidiary ... "</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>On 8 August the Vice-chairman of CITIC, wrote back to the Secretary for Monetary Affairs to say:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We would like to confirm that any amount recovered from legal actions taken by the Government against any person who has fraudulentlyinduced the Bank to enter into a loan or who has caused the Bank to suffer losses from a loan as a result of a breach of fiduciaryduty, duty of care, negligence etc should be for the account of Ka wah or its relevant subsidiary to be used to reduce the outstandingamount of the related non-performing loan..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The related non-performing loans in the instant case are those that had been made by the Bank to Compact.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In the light of these exchanges it seems to me that the Attorney General, by Mr Feenstra, was right to concede at the hearing belowthat the Government, inferentially by Mr Banner and the team, had brought the action in the name of the Bank for its own benefit.But the Government had done so ostensibly and professedly as agents for the Bank which alone had causes of action against the defendants.I cannot accept that Mr Banner and the team embarked upon a frolic of their own.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The Bank has concerted with the Government in the prosecution of the action, as by paying the solicitors' bills, subsequently beingreimbursed by the Government, and by authorising an attorney to inspect and copy documents in Taiwan. Having regard also to the termsof the letters just quoted, to that from the Bank to Deacons dated 26 March 1991 referring to the action begun "on our behalf" andto the resolution of the Bank's Board of Directors dated 20 April 1991 I find it impossible, subject to one outstanding consideration,to resist the conclusion that the Bank accepted and ratified the Government's initiative in commencing this litigation. Ratificationis retrospective in its effect. <u>Alexander Ward &amp; Co Ltd</u> <u>v.

The AttorneyGeneral could not be thought to have a cause of action against the defendants on any other footing.

It is submitted that such agreement is void on grounds of maintenance and champertyand, therefore, not susceptible of ratification. By "maintenance" may be understood the provision of assistance to a party to litigationgiven by another with no legitimate interest in it. If the maintenance is to be rewarded from the proceeds of the litigation thenit is deemed champertous.

Both factors legitimately run together.If brought to a successful conclusion with a judgment satisfied at least in part the Government's liability to CITIC under the deedof 22 March 1986 as well as its call on the Exchange Fund will proportionately be reduced. Even if I were wrong I would long hesitateto conclude that the Bank could not ratify the act of the Government in issuing a writ in its name.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It remains only to consider the submission made only by the third defendant that the learned Deputy Judge should have struck outthat part of the Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim, together with the related prayer, alleging conspiracy against the first to fifthdefendants inclusive.

Wai Man Estates</u>, the judge dismissed a motion to strike out a claim for damages for conspiracy for absence of any averment of predominant purposeon the basis that, having regard to the uncertainty of the law, the House of Lords might reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal;particularly as the deletion of the claim in conspiracy would not significantly have altered the course of the trial or resultedin any substantial saving of time or costs. The same considerations now apply here. By paragraph 17 of the Re-Re-Amended Statementof Claim</p>    <p>               </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the conspiracy and each of the overt acts pleaded in the three preceding paragraphs constituted breaches of trust and/or breachesof one or more of the fiduciary duties referred to in paragraph 4 hereof on the part of the defendant directors or one or more ofthem."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>No grounds warranting interference with the Deputy Judge's exercise of discretion have been demonstrated in the circumstances.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> I would dismiss each of these appeals and make an order nisi that the appellants do pay the costs of the Bank and of the AttorneyGeneral.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Nazareth, J:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><strong>Barnett, J:</strong></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> For the reasons already given by My Lord Kempster JA I too agree that these appeals should be dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I would just add this. As part of his ratification argument, Mr Hatton for the appellants, contended that this action was startedby Mr Banner; that on an objective view he was agent of the Government; and that on proper principles of agency the Bank could notratify Mr Banner's activities.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Mr Hatton said the correct statement of principle appears in the speech of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in the <u>Alexander Ward</u> case where, at p 676, his Lordship said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If something which at the time when it is done is done without authority but is done in the name of <u>and</u> in the purported capacity as an agent for a principal ... " (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><u>Bowstead on Agency</u>, 15th Ed, is therefore wrong, argued Mr Hatton, where at Article 13 it states the general principle of ratification as:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"where an act is done professedly in the name <u>or</u> on behalf of another by a person who has no authority so to do that act ... " (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The "or" in that passage, said Mr Hatton, must be read conjunctively as otherwise it would admit of ratification by a mere nominee.Although Mr Banner professedly acted in the name of the Bank, he did not on an objective view also act on its behalf. Thus, saidMr Hatton, the action is not capable of ratification by the Bank.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> That is an interesting argument with which this court may at some time have to grapple. In my judgment, it is not necessary for thepurpose of this appeal. The argument was focussed too narrowly upon Mr Banner when the wider picture needed appreciation. It is,in my view, unrealistic to assert that Mr Banner and his team embarked upon a frolic of their own, as My Lord has put it. Quite clearlyMr Banner did not give instructions for an action of this size and complexity of his own volition but only after consultation withand the agreement of Government. He was simply an instrument by which Government caused the action to be commenced. I find difficultyin putting any other construction on the first sentence of the letter dated 3rd August 1987 to which My Lord has referred.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It follows that it was Government that started the action and in so doing professed to act in the name of and on behalf of the Bank.No other construction can sensibly be placed upon the material marshalled before us.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>A.J.
