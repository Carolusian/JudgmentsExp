The petition was presented on 18September 2002 by Japan Leasing (Hong Kong) Limited ("Japan Leasing"), which is itself in Creditor's Voluntary Liquidation, havinggone into liquidation on 29 September 1998. The petition is based on the Company's inability to pay its debts, having regard to itsfailure to comply with a statutory demand dated 24 July 2002 for the payment of a debt owing to Japan Leasing of HK$17,305,835.87.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> It appears from the petition and the statutory demand that this sum represents the outstanding amount of a judgment debt (excludingcosts) and interest on it, which is due from the Company to Japan Leasing. The judgment debt was obtained in earlier proceedingsbetween Japan Leasing and the Company (HCMP 4359 of 1998), following an appeal to the Court of Appeal (in CACV 83 of 2000). The amountdemanded in the statutory demand was arrived at after giving credit for the sum of HK$31,345.07 recovered by Japan Leasing undera garnishee order. In HCMP 4359 of 1998, Japan leasing had claimed against the Company in respect of loan instalments and interestdue on loans and advances made under a facility letter dated 23 September 1992, a loan agreement dated 23 September 1996 and a furtherloan agreement dated 16 April 1997, all of which were entered into between Japan Leasing and the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The making of a winding-up order is opposed by the Company, on the basis of the material set out in two affirmations of Mr Wong Shun("Mr Wong"), one of its directors. At the hearing before me, Japan Leasing was represented by Mr Kenneth Ng and the Company by MrJohn J E Swaine.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Mr Swaine did not suggest that there was any irregularity in relation to the judgment debt on which the petition was founded. However,he said that the Company had a claim against Japan Leasing (which I will consider in more detail below), in respect of which it hadcommenced proceedings (HCA 752 of 2000) against Japan Leasing, seeking an award of damages. Mr Swaine submitted that while this wouldordinarily have been a cross-claim, so that there would still have been an undisputed debt due to Japan Leasing in respect of thejudgment debt, the position here was different, since Japan Leasing was in liquidation - because of this, the statutory set off inrespect of mutual dealings arising under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/6">Cap. 6</a>), which applies to the winding-up of Japan Leasing by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s264.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 264</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a>), came into play, so that there was, from the moment that Japan Leasing went into liquidation, only a single debt, in respectof one net balance, as between Japan Leasing and the Company. In these circumstances, Mr Swaine submitted that the debt on whichJapan Leasing relied in support of its petition is disputed, and that the Court should accordingly decline to make any order forthe winding-up of the Company, leaving it to Japan Leasing and the Company to litigate the Company's action in order to establishwhether or not there is in fact any debt due from the Company to Japan Leasing, and thus to establish which way the balance lies.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> I did not understand Mr Ng to dispute that the statutory set off was applicable, or that its effect would be as Mr Swaine suggested,assuming that the Company did indeed have a good claim against Japan Leasing. Mr Ng's position was that, having regard to the statutoryset off, the Company's claim against Japan Leasing stood in a similar position to a defence of set off to Japan Leasing's claim basedon the judgment debt in its favour, so that it was necessary for the Company to satisfy me that the debt relied on by Japan Leasingwas bona fide disputed on substantial grounds by showing that there was substance to its claim against Japan Leasing. Mr Ng submittedthat the Company could not show this, and that a winding-up order should therefore be made against it.</p>    <p class="heading">The factual background</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> It is necessary first to set out certain background facts. The Company was a property holding company, owning Flat 10A and two carparkingspaces at Stubbs Villa, 2 Shiu Fai Terrace, Hong Kong. This property was let by the Company to Shun Kai Finance Company Limited ("ShunKai"), and was used as the residence of Mr Wong, who was, in addition to being a director of the Company, a director of Shun Kai.Mr Wong appears to be the person principally responsible for the business and operations of both the Company and Shun Kai.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On 10 December 1992, Japan Leasing lent some HK$4,800,000.00 to the Company. This loan was secured by a legal charge over the StubbsVilla property. Further loans, also secured by this charge, were subsequently made between 1995 and 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Shun Kai is or was a licensed money lender, which operated a money lending business in the course of which it offered mortgage financeto various persons and other companies. Japan Leasing, which was also a money lender, had a business relationship with Shun Kai,in the course of which it lent money to Shun Kai, on the terms of an agreement dated 19 May 1993 ("the Governing Agreement"). Thearrangement under the Governing Agreement envisaged that in respect of each loan made by Japan Leasing to Shun Kai, Shun Kai wouldon-lend the proceeds by a loan ("a sub-loan") to one of its own customers ("a sub-borrower"). It seems to have been envisaged thatShun Kai would or might lend a sub-borrower by way of a sub-loan more than the amount of the loan to it from Japan Leasing, the differencebeing made up from Shun Kai's own resources. Shun Kai would obtain a mortgage of landed property from the sub-borrower as securityfor the sub-loan, and would in turn give Japan Leasing a sub-mortgage in respect of such property. It seems that Shun Kai would alsoassign the sub-loan in question to Japan Leasing as further security for the loan it had received from Japan Leasing. Shun Kai presumablyearned its income and profits from the interest which it earned on the sub-loan on which it had employed its own funds, and also(in respect of the portion of the sub-loan funded by Japan Leasing) from such difference as there might have been between the rateof interest it charged the sub-borrower, and the rate of interest it was obliged to pay to Japan Leasing.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The Governing Agreement contained provisions by which Japan Leasing authorised Shun Kai to be its exclusive agent to demand, suefor recovery of, collect and receive from sub-borrowers the monthly repayment instalments of sub-loans (which had been assigned toJapan Leasing) as long as Shun Kai was not in default under the terms of its loan from Japan Leasing. This authorisation could berevoked in respect of a particular sub-loan on seven working days' prior notice, if Shun Kai was in default of repayment of the loanto it by Japan Leasing. It was also provided that so long as there was no default by Shun Kai, Japan Leasing would not enforce thesecurity under the sub-mortgage, or give notice of assignment of the sub-loan to the sub-borrower.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> According to the evidence of Japan Leasing, in about January 1998, the Company defaulted in repayment of the loans which had beenmade to it, and in about March 1998, Shun Kai defaulted in repayment of the loans which Japan Leasing had made to Shun Kai. Theseallegations do not appear to be challenged by Mr Wong in the affirmations which he has made in opposition to the petition.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> It appears that on 22 June 1998, Shun Kai being still in default, Japan Leasing notified the sub-borrowers with outstanding loansof the assignment of the sub-loans, and requested that repayments under the sub-loans be made directly to Japan Leasing in future.On the same date (and again on 1 and 23 July 1998) Japan Leasing gave notice to Shun Kai of its revocation of Shun Kai's appointmentas its collection agent under the Governing Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Shun Kai has complained that by doing this, Japan Leasing has breached the terms of the Governing Agreement and has caused substantialloss to Shun Kai. This is the subject matter of proceedings brought by Shun Kai against Japan Leasing in HCA 13826 of 1998, in whichShun Kai seeks damages from Japan Leasing in respect of such alleged breaches by it of the Governing Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> On 28 August 1998, the Company being still in default under the various loans made to it, Japan Leasing commenced HCMP 4359 of 1998against the Company, seeking repayment of the outstanding amounts of the loans and interest on them, and possession of the StubbsVilla property under the mortgage.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Apart from the actions and proceedings which I have already mentioned, the relationship between Japan Leasing and Shun Kai has engendereda considerable amount of further litigation between the parties, with no less than nine other actions or proceedings having beencommenced.</p>    <p class="heading">The litigation between the Company and Japan Leasing</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> I shall deal next with the proceedings between the Company and Japan Leasing. These consist of HCMP 4359 to which I have just referred,and HCA 752 of 2000, in which the Company asserts the claims which it considers it has against Japan Leasing, as this is relevantto one of the arguments which Mr Ng advanced in support of his case that the Company had failed to show that the debt was bona fidedisputed on substantial grounds.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> As I have noted, the proceedings in HCMP 4359 of 1998 were commenced on 28 August 1998. Thereafter, Japan Leasing took out an applicationfor judgment, and Shun Kai sought to be joined as an intervener in the proceedings, on the basis that it was a lawful tenant of theCompany and in occupation of the Stubbs Villa property. The Company resisted the application for judgment, but apparently only inrelation to the amount of interest claimed (it being contended that provisions for overdue interest to be paid were unenforceableon various grounds, and that on the proper construction of the loan agreements, overdue interest was payable only on the outstandingand overdue instalment amounts, and not on the entire amount of the outstanding loan). Both these applications were heard by MasterB Kwan, and on 9 October 1999, she dismissed Shun Kai's application to intervene, and gave judgment in favour of Japan Leasing forprincipal and interest under the three loans relied upon against the Company, in the amounts claimed by Japan Leasing, thus rejectingthe Company's arguments as to interest. She also ordered delivery up of vacant possession of the Stubbs Villa property to Japan Leasing.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Both the Company and Shun Kai appealed against this judgment. The appeal was heard by Suffiad J on 4 January 2000. At the beginningof the appeal, Shun Kai's position was resolved by agreement between itself and Japan Leasing, by amending Master B Kwan's orderin relation to delivery up of vacant possession so as to provide only for possession to be delivered by the Company to Japan Leasing,without prejudice to the rights of any alleged tenants of the Stubbs Villa property. At this hearing, Shun Kai was represented byMr Swaine, the Company being represented by different counsel. On 11 February 2000, Suffiad J dismissed the Company's appeal, andaffirmed the money judgment entered against it by Master B Kwan.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Before Suffiad J delivered his judgment, the Company brought its claim against Japan Leasing in HCA 752 of 2000. The Statement ofClaim in this action was dated 21 January 2000. Mr Wong has said that the Company was not advised as to the possibility of pursuingthis claim until after the order of Master B Kwan on 9 October 1999, by which judgment against the Company had been entered. It seemsthat such advice was received after Mr Swaine was instructed to advise the Company. Although Mr Wong says that the Company was advisedto bring its claim in separate proceedings as judgment had already been entered against it by Master B Kwan, he does not indicateprecisely when any of the advice it was given was obtained, and when it was decided to pursue the claims which the Company considered(or was advised) that it had against Japan Leasing.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Also before Suffiad J delivered his judgment, Japan Leasing managed to obtain a garnishee order in respect of money owing to theCompany. However, this eventually produced only HK$31,345.07 by way of recovery.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The Company appealed to the Court of Appeal against Suffiad J's order upholding the terms of the money judgment entered against itby Master B Kwan. The appeal (CACV 83 of 2000) was, like the hearings before Master B Kwan and Suffiad J limited to the questionof the amount of interest payable. This appeal (CACV 83 of 2000) was heard on 13 July 2000, and judgment in the Company's favour,varying the amount of interest payable under the judgment, was given on 18 July 2000. The Company's appeal was conducted by Mr Swaine.There is no reference in the judgment of the Court of Appeal to the Company's proceedings against Japan Leasing in HCA 752 of 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Thereafter, no further steps were taken by the Company in relation to its claim against Japan Leasing. Nor has any proof of debtbeen filed by the Company with the liquidators of Japan Leasing. Mr Wong says that it was (and remains) the Company's intention tohave its claim in HCA 752 of 2000 dealt with after Shun Kai's claims against Japan Leasing in HCA 13826 of 1998 have been dealt with.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In its Statement of Claim in HCA 752 of 2000, the Company's case against Japan Leasing is put in this way:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) All of the loans relied upon were negotiated between Mr Wong acting for the Company and a Mr Ronald Leung ("Mr Leung") actingfor Japan Leasing (paragraph 5(i) of the Statement of Claim);</p>        <p>(2) When entering into the first loan, Mr Leung (and thus Japan Leasing) was well aware that the Stubbs Villa property was to be letto Mr Wong, either directly or through Shun Kai, that Shun Kai was a licensed moneylender and that Mr Wong derived his substantiallivelihood from Shun Kai's business, and that the Company intended to on lend the loan proceeds to Mr Wong or Shun Kai to form partof Shun Kai's operating capital (paragraph 5(ii) of the Statement of Claim).</p>        <p>(3) When entering into the subsequent loans, Mr Leung (and, through him, Japan Leasing) was well aware that the Stubbs Villa propertywas to continue to be let to Mr Wong through Shun Kai, and that the proceeds of these loans, too, would be used to form part of ShunKai's operating capital (paragraph 5(iii) of the Statement of Claim).</p>        <p>(4) Japan Leasing was informed that the Stubbs Villa property had been let to Shun Kai and that the proceeds of the loans were lentdirectly or indirectly to form part of the operating capital of Shun Kai. Japan Leasing was informed of these matters by being providedwith copies of the tenancy agreement and renewals in respect of the Stubbs Villa property, by being provided with the Company's annualaccounts which showed the loans to Mr Wong and/or Shun Kai and the rental income, and through social and business communicationsbetween Mr Wong and Mr Leung from time to time (paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) It is said that Japan Leasing encouraged and acquiesced in these matters, and that the Company relied on such encouragement andacquiescence (paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Statement of Claim). However, this allegation appears to be based only on the fact that theloans were made, and the alleged knowledge on the part of Japan Leasing which I have already described.</p>        <p>(6) Various terms of the Governing Agreement between Shun Kai and Japan Leasing are set out, and it is alleged that Japan Leasingwas in breach of that agreement (or a separate collateral agreement to similar effect), and had procured the sub-borrowers to breachtheir contracts with Shun Kai, thus causing loss to Shun Kai, which, it is said, has rendered Shun Kai unable to pay rent to theCompany, and has disabled Shun Kai and Mr Wong from repaying their debts to the Company. It is alleged that Japan Leasing's allegedbreach of the Governing Agreement or the collateral agreement, and procuring of the alleged breaches by the sub-borrowers, were theonly causes of Shun Kai and Mr Wong being unable to meet these obligations (paragraphs 9 to 15 of the Statement of Claim).</p>        <p>(7) It is then said that the Company has suffered loss and damage in the form of loss of rental income from Shun Kai, the loss ofthe prospect of repayment of the loans it made to Shun Kai and Mr Wong, the institution of HCMP 4359 of 1998 and the possible lossof the use of the Stubbs Villa property in future (paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim). Although not put in so many words, thesuggestion appears to be that the Company's failure to meet its obligations to Japan Leasing in respect of the loans made to it byJapan Leasing was caused by the alleged breach by Japan Leasing of its obligations to Shun Kai, and the alleged procuring by it ofthe breaches alleged by the sub-borrowers.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(8) This loss and damage is said to have been due to Japan Leasing's negligence, in breach of a duty of care said to arise at commonlaw which required Japan Leasing not to conduct its own affairs negligently so as to injure the Company (paragraph 17(i) of the Statementof Claim).</p>        <p>(9) Such loss and damage is also said to have been due to interference by Japan Leasing with the Company's business, using unlawfulmeans (viz., breaches of contract and procuring of breaches of contract), well knowing and intending the consequences of its conduct(paragraphs 17(ii) and (iii) of the Statement of Claim).</p>        <p>(10) In support of the allegation of knowledge and intention, reliance is placed on Japan Leasing's knowledge (mentioned in sub-paragraphs(2) and (3) above), the allegedly deliberate and secretive manner in which Japan Leasing deprived Shun Kai of its business (it beingsaid in particulars that the only inference to be drawn from Japan Leasing's conduct is that it was deliberate, and that the failureto warn Shun Kai of its intention to affect its business when such warning could have been expected, given the previous cooperationbetween Japan Leasing and Shun Kai, rendered it secretive), and the fact that injury to the Company was and would have been knownto Japan Leasing to be a necessary consequence of its acts against Shun Kai, having regard to the circumstances pleaded in the Statementof Claim (further and particulars under paragraph 17(iii)(b) of the Statement of Claim).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The applicable legal principles</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> I turn now to consider the applicable legal principles. Given the fact that Japan Leasing is in liquidation, the statutory set offclearly applies, so that there is, as between Japan Leasing and the Company only a single balance that can be claimed, by one sideor the other (see e.g. <strong>Stein v Blake</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20AC%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 AC 243</a>, per Lord Hoffman at 255F-G; <strong>Japan Leasing (Hong Kong) Ltd v Shun Kai Finance Co. Ltd</strong> (unreported, HCMP 3604 and 4999 of 1999, Mr Recorder Edward Chan S.C., 28 March 2001, at 13G-15N)). The position here is thereforeone in which the Company disputes the debt on which the petition is based, rather than one in which it does not do so, but relieson a cross-claim that is said to be greater in amount than the petitioning creditor's debt.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It is well established that the appropriate test to be applied in disputed debt cases is for the court to ask whether the petitioningcreditor's debt is bona fide disputed on substantial grounds (see, e.g., <strong>Re ICS Computer Distribution Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20HKLR%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 HKLR 181</a> and <strong>Periwin Development Ltd v Grandfield Pacific Hotel Ltd</strong> (unreported, HCCW 29/2001, Kwan J, 3 January 2002). In this context substantial grounds means grounds of substance. In my view, thismust involve that there is both legal and factual substance to the dispute that is raised.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> So far as factual substance is concerned, it is clear from both of these cases that while the test bears some similarities to thatwhich would apply to an application for summary judgment under RHC Order 14 rule 3, the analogy is not a complete one. As in applicationsfor summary judgment, it is not sufficient for the company simply to assert the existence of a dispute, or to baldly assert the existenceof a claim which is said to be available as a set off. Similarly, the court will ask itself whether the evidence put forward by thecompany is believable (as distinct from whether or not it should be believed). However, there are also differences - whereas a defendantwill be entitled to leave to defend if he can show that he has a fair probability of establishing a bona fide defence, a companyresisting a winding-up petition must go further, and establish that it actually has a substantial defence (meaning a defence of substance),and not just a fair probability of one. Moreover, it is also necessary for the company to put forward sufficiently precise evidencefrom which such a defence can be demonstrated.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> In both the <strong>ICS</strong> and <strong>Periwin</strong> cases, reference was made to the fact that there was no injustice in requiring a company faced with a winding-up petition to meeta test that was in some respects more stringent than that applicable under an application for summary judgment, since whereas a successfulapplication for summary judgment would be the end of the matter, the making of a winding-up order would not deprive the company ofany claim it might have against the petitioner, since such a claim could be pursued by the liquidator if he thought it appropriateto do so.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> While this is a factor in cases in which the nature of the dispute arises out of a set off or counterclaim, I do not see that itis a critical factor, since there will be many cases in which the defence asserted to the debt relied on by the petitioner will notgive rise to the possibility of any counterclaim by the company. There is nothing in the authorities to which I was referred to suggestthat the test in such a case is any different.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Mr Swaine suggested that the test to be applied should be regarded as similar to that applicable on a striking out application. However,the onus on an applicant seeking to strike out a claim or defence is an extremely high one - it is necessary to show that the claimor defence in question is unarguable. Just as there is recognised to be a difference between applications for summary judgment andpetitions to wind up, it seems to me that there is a similar difference between applications to strike out and winding-up petitions,in that a claim, while not perhaps completely unarguable, could, I think, be said nonetheless to lack substance. This may be so becausethe claim itself is extremely weak, or it may appear from the surrounding circumstances of the claim, and the way it has been advanced,that it is lacking in substance.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> In applying the test in this case, it is pertinent to bear in mind that, so far as the evidence supporting the underlying claimsin HCA 752 of 2000 is concerned, the Company's evidence consists solely of a statement by Mr Wong in his affirmation that the matterspleaded in the Statement of Claim and the further and better particulars provided by the Company are true. It is also relevant tonote that Japan Leasing has not put forward any evidence to contradict the allegations of knowledge that are made against Mr Leung.</p>    <p class="heading">Japan Leasing's submissions</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Mr Ng submitted that the Company could not show that Japan Leasing's debt was bona fide disputed on substantial grounds because:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) the negligence claim asserted in HCA 752 of 2000 was bad in law, as there could be no duty of care owed by Japan Leasing to avoidthe infliction of economic harm on the Company arising in the circumstances pleaded;</p>        <p>(2) the alternative claim for interference with business using unlawful means was defective in that the facts pleaded did not demonstratean intention to injure, which is an essential element of the tort;</p>        <p>(3) there was no sufficient evidence put forward to show that the Company had or would suffer loss in an amount equal to or exceedingthe amounts owed by it to Japan Leasing under the loan agreements;</p>        <p>(4) since on the Company's case its claim in HCA 752 of 2000 would presumably be equal to or exceed the amount of the Company's liabilityto Japan Leasing under the loan agreements, this was a claim which should have been raised by way of counterclaim to Japan Leasing'sclaim in HCMP 4359 of 1998, and this not having been done, it would be an abuse for the Company to seek to litigate it by separateproceedings; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) even if not an abuse, the circumstances were such that the Court should conclude that the claims advanced in HCA 752 of 2000 werenot such as to give rise to a bona fide dispute between the Company and Japan Leasing on substantial grounds.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> For present purposes, I shall assume (without deciding) that Japan Leasing was in breach of its obligations to Shun Kai, particularlysince it was not suggested that I should try to decide this question in the absence of Shun Kai, and there (in any event) is no materialon which I could do so. The question that remains is whether, notwithstanding this, it is or could be liable to the Company, on thebases alleged.</p>    <p class="heading">The negligence claim</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> So far as the claim in negligence is concerned, Mr Ng submitted that as the nature of the loss which the Company claims to have sufferedis purely economic in nature, a duty of care on the part of Japan Leasing to avoid the infliction of such loss on the Company couldonly arise if the Company could bring itself within the bounds of the liability for negligent misstatement established by <strong>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 465.</a> He said that this followed from the decision of the House of Lords in <strong>Murphy v Brentwood District Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 AC 398</a>, where Lord Keith explained (at 468D-E) that, prior to the decision in <strong>Anns v Merton London Borough</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 728:-</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The right to recover for pure economic loss, not fowing from physical injury, did not then extend beyond the situation where theloss had been sustained through reliance on negligent misstatements, as in <em>Hedley Byrne</em>."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Lord Keith went on to hold (at 471B-C) that the <strong>Anns</strong> case did not proceed on any basis of established principle, but introduced a new species of liability governed by an indeterminateprinciple which could cover a wide range of situations in which it had never been previously thought that the law of negligence hadany proper place, and concluded that <strong>Anns</strong> was wrongly decided, should no longer be followed, and cases decided on the basis of it regarded as overruled. The other membersof the House of Lords in the <strong>Murphy</strong> case agreed with these views.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Mr Ng submitted that so far as I was concerned, this approach was one which I was bound to take, having regard to the decision ofthe Court of Final Appeal in <strong>Bank of East Asia Ltd v Tsien Wui Marble Factory Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%202%20HKCFAR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 2 HKCFAR 349</a>, in which Litton and Ching PJJ, with whom Nazareth NPJ agreed, held that in the light of the decision in <strong>Murphy</strong>, economic loss was only recoverable on the basis of the <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong> principles involving a special relationship or assumption of responsibility for the making of a statement or performance of a service,coupled with reliance on the part of the plaintiff on the defendant's statement or performance of services (see the <strong>Bank of East Asia</strong> case at 374D and 419A).</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> While Mr Swaine did not dispute the correctness of the <strong>Murphy</strong> and <strong>Bank of East Asia</strong> decisions, he suggested that the question of liability for negligently inflicted economic loss was still in the process of development,so that it would not be appropriate for me to dismiss the possibility of the negligence claim advanced by the Company eventuallysucceeding.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In my view, in the current state of the law, it is clear that in order for the Company to succeed on a claim against Japan Leasingfor pure economic loss (which is the nature of any loss that it might have suffered), it is necessary for the Company to plead andprove facts which would show that it stood in a special relationship with Japan Leasing, whereby Japan Leasing voluntarily assumedresponsibility to the Company in respect of its actions (in this case, the way in which it conducted its relationship with Shun Kai),and that it relied on Japan Leasing to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Apart from the fact that the pleading is not couched in terms that are apposite to a claim of this type as it mentions neither anyassumption of responsibility on the part of Japan Leasing, nor any reliance on the part of the Company, it seems to me that thereare insuperable difficulties that stand in the way of a successful negligence claim by the Company against Japan Leasing in respectof the loss which it has allegedly suffered.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> First, it seems to me that the fact that the Company and Japan Leasing were themselves in a contractual relationship in respect ofthe various loans made by Japan Leasing to the Company is itself a matter that militates against the existence of any such tortiousduty on the part of Japan Leasing. The Governing Agreement was entered into before all except the first of the loans to the Companywas advanced. It would therefore have been possible for the parties to have agreed that its terms (or terms similar to them) shouldgovern the relationship between them. There is no evidence that this was done. Nor is there any suggestion, either in the pleadingsor the evidence that there was any representation or other indication by Japan Leasing that it would so conduct its affairs withrespect to Shun Kai so as not to affect the Company adversely.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Further, it seems to me that there is nothing else to indicate that Japan Leasing are to be regarded as having undertaken any responsibilityto the Company in respect of the way in which it conducted its relationship with Shun Kai. I do not consider that the allegationsthat the Company was aware, when the loans were entered into, that the Stubbs Villa property was to be let to Mr Wong, either directlyor through Shun Kai, that Shun Kai was a licensed moneylender and that Mr Wong derived his substantial livelihood from Shun Kai'sbusiness, and that the Company intended to on lend the loan proceeds to Mr Wong or Shun Kai to form part of Shun Kai's operatingcapital take the matter any further. These would, at best, indicate that it may have been foreseeable that an interruption to ShunKai's business might have an impact on the Company. However, it seems to me that foreseeability alone is not enough. If it were,it would seem to follow that any person who stands in a contractual relationship to another could find himself liable to third partiesfor economic losses which he can foresee might be caused to them by reason of the way in which he conducts his affairs in relationto the contract. This is a potentially wide-ranging basis of liability, which is not, in my view, recognised by the law as it presentlystands.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Similarly, there is no suggestion in the pleading or evidence to suggest that the Company relied on Japan Leasing to conduct itsbusiness with Shun Kai in a particular way.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Further, it seems to me that to accept the possibility of a liability for negligence of the type asserted by the Company in HCA 752of 2000 would involve serious inroads into established principles of contract law relating to privity of contract, since it wouldopen up the possibility of persons who are not parties to a contract being able to seek damages for losses occasioned to them bya breach of it.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Finally, I would also observe that a duty of care of this type would seem to render superfluous the recognised economic torts whichare based on intentional interference with economic interests.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> For all of these reasons, I am of the view that the Company has not demonstrated the existence of a substantial dispute as to thedebt which it owes to Japan Leasing, so far as that dispute is based on the alleged claim it has against Japan Leasing on the basisof negligence at common law.</p>    <p class="heading">The claim for unlawful interference with business</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Turning to the claim for unlawful interference with business, Mr Ng submitted that it was fundamentally defective, since there wasno pleading of an intention to injure. He submitted that it was not sufficient simply to assert the existence of such an intention,but that it was necessary to plead facts which would justify the court in finding that such an intention in fact existed, and nosufficient facts were pleaded in the Statement of Claim or particulars thereof. He said that it was not open to the Company simplyto plead a breach by Japan Leasing of its contract with Shun Kai and invite the court to infer that such a breach was deliberateand intended to injure the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Mr Ng also submitted that there was a fundamental inconsistency between what he described as the Company's primary claim of negligence,and the claim of intentional interference.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Mr Swaine, for his part, submitted that there was nothing inconsistent in the two claims, and that even if there was, there was nobar to a party pleading inconsistent alternative bases of claim. He also submitted that sufficient facts had been pleaded to makeout the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> So far as the alleged inconsistency with the negligence claim is concerned, I agree with Mr Swaine. It seems to me that there isno necessary inconsistency between the two claims. The negligence claim, if it were a good one, would proceed on the basis that JapanLeasing should have realised that its actions would have certain effects on the Company. Japan Leasing would be liable to the Companyeven if it did not in fact subjectively realise this. It does not seem to me to be any the less a breach of a duty of care wherethe party in breach positively realises and intends the consequences of his actions, which fall short of the standard of care tobe expected of a reasonable person. Moreover, even if there were an inconsistency, I see no reason why it should not be open to theCompany, like any other litigant, to advance inconsistent alternative cases. I do not see any reason to attach any significance tothe order in which such alternatives are pleaded. By contrast to the Statement of Claim, the unlawful interference claim is mentionedfirst in Mr Wong's affirmations.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> So far as the substance of the claim is concerned, both parties referred me to passages in <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Tort</em> (18th edition) dealing with unlawful interference with economic and other interests. At paragraph 24-89, it is stated that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... The 'purpose or intention of inflicting injury on the plaintiff' is an essential criterion of the tort; but no 'predominant purposeto injure' need be proved ... so long as the unlawful act was 'in some sense directed against the plaintiff or intended to harm theplaintiff."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The learned authors also point out that "the move from intentional to foreseeable injury is not a step but a leap" (<em>ibid.</em>), and make the point that desire to injure, and motive, are not required, but that deliberate action, appreciating the probable consequences,will be sufficient (see n.3 to paragraph 24-89, and n.12 to paragraph 24-90).</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> It seems to me that paragraphs 17(ii) and (iii) of the Statement of Claim in HCA 752 of 2000 do (although not perhaps very clearly)allege that Japan Leasing interfered with the Company's business by breaching its contract with Shun Kai, knowing and intending theconsequences, including injury to the Company. However, as the Company has particularised its claim, and has stated the facts onwhich it relies, it seems to me that it is necessary to consider, whether on the basis of those facts, it can be said that the Companyhas demonstrated the existence of a bona fide and substantial basis for such a claim, and thus for disputing the debts owed to JapanLeasing.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> It is necessary, I think, to bear in mind that the tort of unlawful interference is based on intention, and not negligence or foreseeability.While it is not necessary to demonstrate any motive on the part of the defendant, it is necessary, I think, at least to demonstratenot just that his actions were deliberate (and not accidental), but that he knew or appreciated that injury would be caused to theplaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> It seems to me that the facts which have been pleaded in relation to the Company's knowledge, which are not in any way expanded onor fleshed out in its evidence, would at most indicate that Japan Leasing should perhaps have been aware that its actions as againstShun Kai might have an adverse impact on the Company. I do not think that they go so far as to demonstrate that Japan Leasing infact appreciated this or must have done so. Although it is suggested that Mr Wong earned his livelihood from Shun Kai's business,it does not follow from this that he had no other source of funds or income from which to meet his obligations or fund those of theCompany. Similarly, while it is said (at paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim) that the making of the sub-loans constituted themajor part of the business of Shun Kai, it does not appear to me that it is suggested that Japan Leasing knew this, or (more pertinently)that it was so wholly dependent on this business that it could not meet its obligations to the Company without it. The evidence filedby the Company does not take matters any further, since it simply consists of a confirmation of the matters pleaded, without anyelaboration.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Moreover, given that the situation at the time of the alleged breach by Japan Leasing of its contract with Shun Kai was that bothShun Kai and the Company were already in default of their obligations to Japan Leasing (a fact which, as I have noted, is not controvertedby any evidence from the Company), it seems to me that it is at least as likely, if not more so, that Japan Leasing would have hadin mind the protection of its own interests rather than any damage or injury to those of the Company.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> In these circumstances, I do not consider that the Company is at all likely to be able to establish any claim against Japan Leasingin respect of the alleged deliberate or intentional interference with its business. That being so, it seems to me that this basisfor suggesting that its debt to Japan Leasing is substantially disputed is also not made out.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> I do not regard the reliance that is placed by Mr Wong in his evidence on other decisions in the litigation between Japan Leasingand Shun Kai to be particularly helpful. In neither of the cases that he relied on does there seem to have been any decision or viewexpressed on the merits of Shun Kai's case that Japan Leasing was in breach of contract as against it. Nor, apparently, was any attackmade by Japan Leasing on the bona fides of such claims. In any event, for the reasons which I have set out above, I do not considerthat the Company has demonstrated a bona fide dispute of substance between itself and Japan Leasing even assuming (without deciding)that Shun Kai has a good claim for breach of contract against Japan Leasing.</p>    <p class="heading">Lack of evidence of loss and damage</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Mr Ng also took the point that damage is of the essence of either of the tort claims, and that no sufficient evidence of damage hadbeen put forward by the Company. Given the manner in which the Company has chosen to deal with the petition, by simply assertingby affirmation that the matters pleaded are true, it seems to me that this point, too, is made out, in that the Company has failedto put forward any evidence of a precise nature to explain what the losses are which it claims to have suffered, and how it is thatthese are said to arise as a result of the alleged breach of contract by Japan Leasing vis-a-vis Shun Kai.</p>    <p class="heading">Alleged abuse of process</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> In these circumstances, it is not necessary for me to express any concluded view on the contention advanced by Mr Ng to the effectthat, not having raised its claims by way of counterclaim in the course of HCMP 4359 of 1998, it is barred from doing so in separateproceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> That said, however, I would confess to having doubts as to whether this would necessarily have been the case here. This argumentis based on the decision of the Privy Council in <strong>Yat Tung Investment Co. Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 581.</a> In that case, Lord Kilbrandon said (at 590E-F) that the power to shut out a "subject of litigation" was limited to cases where reasonablediligence would have caused a matter to be earlier raised, and that negligence, inadvertence or accident would not suffice to excusethe failure to raise such matters. However, he went on (at 590H-591A) to refer with approval to the description of such matters asbeing matters which "went to the root of the matter on the prior occasion" by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in <strong>Hoystead v Commissioner of Taxation</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1926%5d%20AC%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1926] AC 155</a> at 171.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> In the <strong>Yat Tung</strong> case, the claim that was shut out as an abuse of process was one which the Privy Council held could and should have been raised inprior proceedings, since the defendant bank in Yat Tung had made a counterclaim for the balance due to it, after the realisationof security which it held, and the proposed claim, as to the propriety of the realisation, and whether it had been at a serious undervalue,was clearly a matter that went to the question of whether there was any balance due to the bank at all. This was, as Suffiad J pointedout in <strong>Tang Kin Wah v Cheng Choy Kam Chee</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20HKC%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 HKC 552</a>, clearly something which went to the root of the counterclaim by the defendant bank.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> In this case, while it is fair to say that the size of the claim for damages in HCA 752 of 2000 has been asserted to be such as wouldwipe out the debt that is relied upon as the basis of Japan Leasing's petition, it seems to me that the issues (both factual andlegal) that would be raised in HCA 752 of 2000 (if it raised, contrary to the view which I have come to, a bona fide dispute of substance)would be quite distinct from those which would have arisen in HCMP 4359 of 1998. While no doubt it would have been open to the Companyto have counterclaimed in those proceedings, I would hesitate to say that it should necessarily have done so on pain of being shutout from litigating them elsewhere, particularly as it seems to me that they would have operated by way of cross-claim and not asa defence of set off, not being connected with the subject matter of Japan Leasing's claim, so that it might well have been thatJapan Leasing would have been entitled to judgment in any event.</p>    <p class="heading">History of litigation between the parties</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Finally, Mr Ng suggested that the history of the litigation between the parties shows that the claim in HCA 752 of 2000 is such asto show that it is not one that is bona fide or substantial. He drew attention to the following matters:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) HCA 752 of 2000 was not instituted until January 2000, after HCMP 4359 of 1998 had been heard by Master B Kwan and Suffiad J.</p>        <p>(2) The claim was not raised in a cross-claim in HCMP 4359 of 1998, nor was any attempt made to stay execution of the judgment (whichhad been enforced to some extent) in reliance on it.</p>        <p>(3) No proof of debt had been filed with Japan Leasing's liquidators.</p>        <p>(4) There has been a conspicuous lack of progress in the action.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Mr Swaine responded that an explanation had been given by Mr Wong as to the reasons for failing to raise the claims advanced in HCA752 of 2000 in the other proceedings, and that it was thought that there was little point in pushing on with the action while otheractions, in particular the claim between Shun Kai and Japan Leasing, were pending.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> While I accept that there might be sense in not pushing on with HCA 752 of 2000, pending the resolution of Shun Kai's claims againstJapan Leasing, this does not of itself indicate that the claims in HCA 752 of 2000 are of substance. As I have noted, Mr Wong's evidenceas to the timing of the realisation of the existence of a potential claim by the Company is rather imprecise and lacking in concretedetail. Moreover, there is no explanation for the failure to lodge a proof of debt with the liquidators of Japan Leasing. AlthoughI do not base my decision on these points, it seems to me that they do not inspire confidence in the existence of a belief on thepart of the Company in a genuine claim against Japan Leasing.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Finally, I was also referred by both counsel to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <strong>Re Bayoil SA</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20All%20ER%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 All ER 374.</a> That case dealt with the position where the company could not dispute the debt on which the petition was founded, but asserted across-claim which was said to exceed the amount of the debt. Given the effect of the statutory set off arising on Japan Leasing'sliquidation, I do not consider that that decision is strictly applicable. However, it does not seem to me that the test is significantlydifferent from that which applies in the case of disputed debts, and I do not think that its application would have led to any differencein the result.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> I therefore conclude that the Company has failed to demonstrate that the debt on which the petition is based is bona fide disputedby it on substantial grounds. Accordingly, I shall make the usual winding up order against the Company.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> I should add that Mr Ng sought an order for costs against the Company on an indemnity basis in respect of the petitioner's costsof the second day of the hearing before me, which proved to be abortive due to the indisposition of Mr Swaine. Mr Ng sought thisorder on the basis that this was the fifth occasion in the various actions between Japan Leasing and the Company, Shun Kai and MrWong that there had been delay to proceedings as a result of counsel being indisposed, and also because Japan Leasing's solicitorswere not informed of the problem until late the afternoon before, when it was too late to effect any saving in costs. While it isunfortunate that there should have been such delay and costs, it does not seem to me to be appropriate to visit the consequencesof this on the Company by ordering a higher basis of taxation, as Mr Swaine confirmed that he had been feeling unwell, that he informedthose instructing him once that was realised, and they informed those representing Japan Leasing immediately thereafter. Mr Swainealso accepted that had I found for the Company, it should not be entitled to the costs of that day - in the result, however, thisdoes not arise.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Aarif Barma, SC)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Kenneth Ng, instructed by Messrs Baker &amp; McKenzie, for the Petitioner</p>        <p>Mr John Swaine, instructed by Messrs Fan Wong &amp; Tso, for the Company</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2003/180.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
