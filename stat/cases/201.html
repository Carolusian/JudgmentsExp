("the petitioner"), on the ground that the Company is unable to payits debts. The debt in the petition arose out of a deed of guarantee dated 12 January 2001 ("the Guarantee") executed by the Companyin favour of the petitioner in respect of the liability of Bel Trade (China) Company Limited ("Bel Trade China") to make paymentto the petitioner. The petitioning debt is in the sum of US$2,423,173.78.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The Company opposes the petition on two grounds. Firstly, there is a bona fide dispute based on the construction of the Guarantee.Secondly, it is alleged by the Company that it may rely on serious and genuine cross-claims of Bel Trade China and the Company againstthe petitioner based on economic torts and misrepresentation.</p>    <p class="heading">The background</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The background matters, which are not in dispute, may be stated as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The petitioner is and was at all times engaged in the business of manufacturing production machinery for the heat transfer industry.From 1994 to 2000, the petitioner had supplied various goods to Bel Trade China and the goods manufactured by the petitioner weresold by Bel Trade China to customers in Mainland China. Bel Trade China failed to settle the outstanding contract sum in the invoicesissued by the petitioner totalling US$3,313,173.78, despite demands for payment by the petitioner. In September 2000, the petitionerpresented a petition to wind up Bel Trade China on the aforesaid debt. Subsequently, in January 2001, the petitioner and Bel TradeChina reached an agreement by which Bel Trade China was allowed time to repay the petitioning debt of US$3.3 million odd by 24 monthlyinstalments, that the Company was to provide the Guarantee to the petitioner, and the petitioner agreed to the dismissal of the winding-uppetition against Bel Trade China. A letter dated 12 January 2001 was issued by the petitioner's solicitors to the solicitors forBel Trade China setting out the terms upon which the parties had agreed to settle the winding-up proceedings and this was countersignedby Bel Trade China to signify its acceptance of the terms therein. This agreement is referred to as "the Settlement Agreement" inthe Guarantee and I shall use the same term here.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Bel Trade China rendered payment to the petitioner for the months of January 2001 to November 2001 in the total sum of US$840,000.00.The instalment for December 2001 was not paid. A demand for payment of the then outstanding contract sum of US$2,473,173.78 was servedby the petitioner on the Company under the Guarantee and on Bel Trade China under the Settlement Agreement on 16 January 2002. Onor about 25 January 2002, Bel Trade China paid an additional sum of US$50,000.00 to the petitioner. No further payment has sincebeen made. As at 8 July 2002, being the date of the presentation of the petition, the outstanding contract sum owed to the petitioneramounted to US$2,423,173.78.</p>    <p class="heading">The Settlement Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The material terms of the Settlement Agreement may be set out as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The amount of US$3,313,173.78, being the sum in which Bel Trade China was indebted to the petitioner as at the date of the SettlementAgreement, was described as "the Indebtedness" in the agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> By clause 1, Bel Trade China agreed to repay the sum of US$3,313,173.78 due to the petitioner by way of 24 monthly instalments asper the repayment schedule annexed. The second and subsequent instalments were to be made on the 20th day of each month. Accordingto the repayment schedule, the instalment for December 2001 was in the sum of US$360,000.00 and payment was due on 20 December 2001.As only US$50,000.00 was paid on 25 January 2002, in respect of the instalment for December 2001, there was an amount which had accrueddue in the sum of US$310,000.00.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> By clause 3, the Company undertook to execute a guarantee in the sum of US$3,313,173.78 in favour of the petitioner on or before12 January 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> There was a further provision which I need to set out verbatim:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Upon [Bel Trade China's] failure to comply with any of the terms of this letter or should a winding up petition be presented against[Bel Trade China] and/or [the Company] or should they make any composition with its creditors, all of our client's rights to immediaterepayment of the Indebtedness shall immediately become due and payable and <em>this agreement shall forthwith determine</em>.

The "Indebtedness" was defined in the agreement as the sumof US$3,313,173.78, being the amount in which Bel Trade China was indebted to the petitioner as at the date of the Settlement Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Mr Swaine further submitted that this pre-existing indebtedness was not what the Company had undertaken to guarantee by the termsof the Guarantee. Clause 1 provided that the Company was to guarantee payment by Bel Trade China "of the outstanding contract sumin the total amount of US$3,313,173.78 <em>under the terms of the Settlement Agreement</em>". This could only refer to the payment by instalments under the repayment schedule in the Settlement Agreement, making the Guaranteethe first of the two possible forms of agreement as envisaged by Lord Reid in <strong>Lep Air Services Ltd v Rolloswin Investments Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] AC 331</a> at 344H. As the Company had only undertaken to guarantee payment by instalments, once there was breach of the Settlement Agreementby Bel Trade China and the obligation to pay by instalments was determined forthwith automatically and replaced by the petitioner'sright to immediate payment of the pre-existing indebtedness, this would have the following effect: firstly, the Company could notbe liable for any future instalments due after the breach of Bel Trade China, as no instalment not then due would ever fall due;secondly, the Company could not be liable in respect of the pre-existing indebtedness as that was not the subject of the Guarantee.The only possible liability of the Company in this situation is in respect of any instalment that had accrued due by the time ofthe breach of Bel Trade China, similar to the guarantee in <strong>Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd v Papadopoulos</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 1129.</a></p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> I should mention that even on this argument, the Company is liable to the petitioner in the sum of US$310,000.00, being the outstandingsum on the instalment for December 2001.</p>    <p class="heading">The petitioner's arguments on the liability under the Guarantee</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Mr William Wong, who appeared on behalf of the petitioner, submitted that by the Settlement Agreement, Bel Trade China had undertakentwo obligations: firstly, to pay the outstanding contract sum by 24 monthly instalments; secondly, upon breach of the first obligation,to pay immediately the whole outstanding contract sum.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> He further submitted that on the proper construction of the Guarantee, the obligation of the Company is in respect of the outstandingcontract sum in the total amount of US$3,313,173.78 (clause 1) and the Guarantee applies to the whole and every part of outstandingcontract sum, not just the payments by instalment in accordance with the repayment schedule in the Settlement Agreement (clause 3).The Guarantee is the second of the two possible forms of agreement discussed by Lord Reid in <strong>Lep Air Services, supra.</strong> at 345B. This construction is reinforced by clause 4, which makes clear that the determination of the terms of the Settlement Agreementwould not discharge or affect the Company's liability under the Guarantee. Where the whole outstanding contract sum has become immediatelypayable upon breach by Bel Trade China of the obligation to pay by instalments, the Company has also undertaken to guarantee theperformance of this obligation of Bel Trade China which arose under the Settlement Agreement.</p>    <p class="heading">The Company's liability under the Guarantee</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The crux of the matter is what the Company had in fact undertaken to do by the terms of the Guarantee. As stated by Lord Reid in<strong>Lep Air Services, supra.</strong> at 344H to 345B, there are at least two possible forms of agreement,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A person might undertake no more than that if the principal debtor fails to pay any instalment he will pay it. That would be a conditionalagreement. There would be no prestable obligation unless and until the debtor failed to pay. There would then on the debtor's failurearise an obligation to pay. If for any reason the debtor ceased to have any obligation to pay the instalment on the due date thenhe could not fail to pay it on that date. The condition attached to the undertaking would never be purified and the subsidiary obligation[to pay damages for breach of the primary obligation to pay by instalments] would never arise.</p>        <p class="quote">On the other hand, the guarantor's obligation might be of a different kind. He might undertake that the principal debtor will carryout his contract. Then if at any time and for any reason the principal debtor acts or fails to act as required by his contract, henot only breaks his own contract but he also puts the guarantor in breach of his contract of guarantee. Then the creditor can suethe guarantor, not for the unpaid instalment but for damages. His contract being that the principal debtor would carry out the principalcontract, the damages payable by the guarantor must then be the loss suffered by the creditor due to the principal debtor havingfailed to do what the guarantor undertook that he would do."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Parties are of course free to make any agreement they like, including modifying or excluding the common law rules by the terms ofthe contract. In construing the Guarantee it is pertinent to remind oneself of what the common law rules are to see whether the partiescould have intended a result that would have made nonsense of the commercial purpose of requiring the Company to provide a guarantee.On the construction put forward by the Company, the petitioner would lose the benefit of the Guarantee at the moment when it is mostneeded, namely, on a repudiation by Bel Trade China of its obligation to make instalment payment (<strong>Lep Air Services, supra.</strong> at 355C and 356H, per Lord Simon of Glaisdale).</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In <strong>Lep Air Services</strong>, Lord Diplock made a historical analysis of the obligation and liability assumed by a surety at common law and came to the followingconclusion at 348H to 349B:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It follows from the legal nature of the obligation of the guarantor to which a contract of guarantee gives rise that it is not anobligation himself to pay a sum of money to the creditor, but an obligation to see to it that another person, the debtor, does something;and that the creditor's remedy for the guarantor's failure to perform it lies in damages for breach of contract only. That this wasso, even where the debtor's own obligation that was the subject of the guarantee was to pay a sum of money, is clear from the factthat formerly the form of action against the guarantor which was available to the creditor was in special assumpsit and not in indebitatusassumpsit: <em>Mines v Sculthorpe</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281809%29%202%20Camp%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1809) 2 Camp. 215.</a></p>        <p class="quote">The legal consequence of this is that whenever the debtor has failed voluntarily to perform an obligation which is the subject ofthe guarantee the creditor can recover from the guarantor as damages for breach of his contract of guarantee whatever sum the creditorcould have recovered from the debtor himself as a consequence of that failure. The debtor's liability to the creditor is also themeasure of the guarantor's." (See also 356H to 357F, per Lord Simon of Glaisdale)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Thus, under the common law rules, prima facie the surety is treated as guaranteeing that the principal debtor will perform his contractso that if the debtor is in breach and the creditor exercises his rights to terminate the contract, the debtor's liability is therebytransmuted into a liability for damages but the surety remains liable for the performance of that duty, as he is liable for the performanceof the original duty (<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, 28th ed., Vol. 2, para. 44-076). As stated in the same passage in <em>Chitty</em>, it is theoretically possible that the surety has guaranteed only the debtor's primary obligation under the contract, and not thesecondary obligation to pay damages in the event of breach, but is this a viable construction in this instance?</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> In my judgment, all indications here are to the contrary. Far from merely applying the common law rules by implication, express provisionwas made in the Settlement Agreement so as to leave the matter in no doubt that upon breach of the primary obligation to make paymentby instalments, Bel Trade China would come under a liability to make immediate payment to the petitioner of the entire contract sumthen outstanding, which is of the same measure that the petitioner would have been entitled to recover in damages at common law onthe repudiation by Bel Trade China of its obligation to pay by instalments. The legal consequence of the obligation assumed by theCompany under the Guarantee in this situation is as stated by Lord Diplock at 351C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was the debtor's failure to perform his primary obligation to pay the instalments in circumstances which put an end to it thatconstituted a failure by the guarantor to perform his own primary obligation to the creditor to see that the instalments were paidby the debtor, and substituted for it a secondary obligation of the guarantor to pay to the creditor a sum of money for the losshe thereby sustained. It is the guarantor's own secondary obligation, not that of the debtor, that the creditor is enforcing in hisclaim for damages for breach of his contract of guarantee."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> There is hardly any justification for reading into the words "under the terms of the Settlement Agreement" in clause 1 of the Guaranteean intention to refer only to the primary obligation of Bel Trade China to pay by instalments, but not the secondary liability ofBel Trade China to pay damages on repudiation of the primary obligation.

Ltd ("Oak Japan"); and</p>        <p>(2) the petitioner had dealt directly with Bel Trade China's customers in the Mainland market by offering prices lower than thosewhich it offered to Bel Trade China, without disclosing or offering such lower prices to Bel Trade China, thus misrepresenting toBel Trade China the price at which the petitioner was willing to deal and taking dishonest advantage of the promotional and marketingeffort made by Bel Trade China in relation to these customers.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> In a subsequent affirmation made by Mr Sy Chin Mong Stephen, the chairman and chief executive officer of the Bel Trade group of companies,he has put a further gloss on the alleged misrepresentation, after his attention was drawn to the letters of the petitioner to BelTrade China dated 5 July 2000 and 25 July 2000 when he was reviewing the correspondence for the purpose of preparing his affirmation.It is alleged by Mr Sy that in stating in these letters that the Company "intends to continue working with [Bel Trade China] on futureprojects" and that "[Bel Trade China's] direct competitors are now other trading organizations in and around China", the petitionerhad made misrepresentations in that its true intention was not to continue working with Bel Trade China and that the direct competitorsof Bel Trade China were not other trading organizations in China but were the petitioner itself and Oak Japan.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Leaving aside for the time being whether there is any serious and genuine cross-claim available to Bel Trade China as a set-off tothe petitioner's claim so that the Company is entitled to rely on it as the surety, I first consider if there is any viable cross-claimthat can be advanced by the Company on its own. The Company's claim in fraudulent misrepresentation may be disposed of quickly. Thereis simply nothing in the evidence to support any such claim by the Company, the alleged misrepresentations were made by the petitionerto Bel Trade China as all business transactions were conducted between the petitioner and Bel Trade China.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> As for the alleged claims that might be brought by the Company in the tort of conspiracy to injure and the tort of unlawful interferencewith the business of the Company, I am not persuaded on the basis of the tenuous connection of the Company with the wrongs complainedof (merely because the Company would have suffered loss as the holding company of Bel Trade China if the latter should suffer loss)to accept that the Company would have a serious claim in these causes of action. On the present allegations, any unlawful acts ofthe petitioner would only have been directed against the Company in a very loose sense as the holding company of the intended victim.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> That leaves the cross-claims that might be brought by Bel Trade China against the petitioner. There are a number of difficultiesabout that as well.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Firstly, there is no or no sufficient evidence that the amount of the cross-claims would be not less than the petitioning debt ofUS$2.4 million. The only attempt at quantification of Bel Trade China's claim in damages, in the 1st affirmation of Mr Ahmed, isthat out of the value of business estimated to be lost due to the alleged wrongs being US$4.5 million, Bel Trade China would havesuffered a loss of profit of US$900,000.00. No particulars were given as to how the estimated loss of business or the estimated lossof profit was arrived at, let alone any documents in support of the alleged loss. It is further alleged that Bel Trade China hadsuffered wasted expenditure of HK$1 million. If it is the case of Bel Trade China that it could claim damages for both heads of loss,it is not clear to me how Bel Trade China would have been entitled to damages for loss of profits on the basis of incurring expenditureto earn the profits claimed and claim damages at the same time for wasted expenditure. Even if both items were recoverable, theystill fall short of the petitioning debt by a considerable margin.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> I should also mention that in the subsequent affirmation of Mr Sy, he mentioned that prior to the injuries brought about by the petitioner,he estimated that the Company could have sold Bel Trade China for HK$50 million and that the shareholding of Bel Trade China wouldnow fetch "nothing or almost nothing at all" if sold as it now has no business activity. A bare allegation of this nature would notdo. There are no details given to support the estimate or that the fall in the value of the shareholding was caused by or materiallyattributable to the alleged wrongdoings of the petitioner. There is also evidence to the contrary in a previous affirmation of MrSy made in December 2000 for the purpose of opposing the petition to wind up Bel Trade China which would appear to suggest that BelTrade China's financial difficulties were due to the fact that it had made an investment of HK$29 million in a property developmentin Wuhan, China. Further, on the available evidence, Bel Trade China had already been in liquidity problems since about April 2000(this would be before the alleged wrongdoings of the petitioner on the evidence adduced by the Company), when it was unable to settleoutstanding contract sums to the petitioner, causing Mr Franks to write to Mr Sy on 19 April 2000 expressing his concern about thefinancial circumstances of Bel Trade China and asking for a detailed plan of paying the debt within the next 12 months.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Secondly, the Company could only rely on the cross-claims of Bel Trade China against the petitioner's demand if the cross-claimsof Bel Trade China should arise out of the same transaction as the debt guaranteed. An unconnected and independent cross-claim arisingout of a separate and distinct transaction would not avail the surety (<em>Rowlatt on Principal and Surety</em>, 5th ed., para.4-91). The debt owed by Bel Trade China to the petitioner was in respect of the outstanding contract sum for goodssupplied by the petitioner to Bel Trade China and formed the basis of the winding up petition in September 2000. There is no suggestionthat the fraudulent misrepresentation (the alleged misrepresentations in writing were found in the letters dated 5 July 2000 and25 July 2000) or the conspiracy to injure or the unlawful interference with business had taken place at more or less the time ofthe sale and purchase transactions that gave rise to the debt. Indeed, the indications are to the contrary on the available evidence,as it was only upon the failure of Bel Trade China to settle the debt that the petitioner terminated the exclusive sales agency ofBel Trade China by its letter dated 9 June 2000 and opened up all sales in China.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Thirdly, I have grave reservations as to the factual basis on which the cross-claims are put forward.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The evidence put forward by the Company contained merely bare allegations without sufficiently precise factual evidence, as one wouldexpect to find if there is indeed a serious and genuine cross-claim. The cross-claim was mentioned for the first time in the 1staffirmation of Mr Ahmed, there is no evidence that Bel Trade China has made any cross-claim against the petitioner, such as by letter.The evidence disclosed by Mr Sy being his letter to the petitioner dated 8 May 2002 does not mention or even suggest that Bel TradeChina might have any cross-claim at all. On the contrary, in that letter, having pointed out that "for the past several months" BelTrade China found itself thwarted from the market as the petitioner had decided to enter the market and Bel Trade China could notcompete with the petitioner in selling the petitioner's own products, Mr Sy urged and implored the petitioner to allow Bel TradeChina to continue to sell as an exclusive agent as in the past for another two to three years, otherwise Bel Trade China would notbe able to generate sufficient revenue to settle its outstanding debt to the petitioner.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> If it is sought to explain that no cross-claim has been advanced because it was only in May 2002 that Bel Trade China discoveredthat the petitioner had entered the market itself and was directly offering its products to the customers of Bel Trade China at lowerprices, I find this wholly incredible. For one thing, this is not consistent with Mr Sy's letter of 8 May 2002 in which he statedthe state of affairs had been happening "for the past several months". Further, in Mr Ahmed's 2nd affirmation, he said that Bel TradeChina's business of selling the petitioner's machinery had grown to a "very substantial level from 1991 to 2001" and gave the figuresfor the turnover in the financial year 2000/2001, which amounted to US$5.3 million odd. He went on to say that as a result of thealleged wrongdoings of the petitioner, in the financial year of 2001/2002, turnover had fallen by over 85% to about US$693,000.00.If the substantial fall in turnover was indeed attributable to any alleged wrongdoings of the petitioner, it is wholly improbablethat Bel Trade China would not have found out the reason for the substantial drop in business much earlier and raised the matterwith the petitioner well before May 2002 if it had been misled into thinking that the petitioner would not enter the market itselfwhen the exclusive agency was terminated in June 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The cross-claims sought to be advanced by Bel Trade China is simply incompatible with the evidence of the contemporaneous documents.According to these documents, in April 2000, the petitioner had expressed great concern as to the outstanding indebtedness of BelTrade China. In June 2000, the petitioner informed Bel Trade China that the latter would cease to be its exclusive sales agent andif the debt situation of Bel Trade China was not to improve significantly, the petitioner "will be forced into a position where itwill be impossible for [the petitioner] to do any business with [Bel Trade China] at all". There was no suggestion from Bel TradeChina that the petitioner was not entitled to terminate the exclusive sales agency. In July 2000 the petitioner again impressed onBel Trade China that more would have to be done about the repayment plan and although the exclusive sales agency was terminated,the petitioner was still prepared to supply goods to Bel Trade China. As the debt was not paid, winding up proceedings were commencedin September 2000 and the proceedings were settled in January 2001 with the repayment schedule of 24 months. From June 2000 to theend of the financial year in 2001, the business turnover of Bel Trade China was apparently not affected at all, notwithstanding thetermination of the exclusive agency, according to the turnover figure given by Mr Ahmed.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> For the above reasons, I hold that there is no serious and genuine cross-claim whether of the Company or of Bel Trade China thatthe Company may rely on to resist the petitioner's claim under the Guarantee.</p>    <p class="heading">Orders</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> As the Company has failed on both grounds of opposition, I make a winding-up order against the Company and order that the petitioner'scosts are to be paid out of the Company's assets.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(S Kwan)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr William M F Wong, instructed by Messrs Johnston Stokes &amp; Master, for the Petitioner</p>        <p>Mr John J E Swaine, instructed by Messrs Johnny K.K.
