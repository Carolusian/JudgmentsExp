Background</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a> On 8 September 1998 the Plaintiff ("Chong") was working at a construction site ("the Site") around the Jusco Department Store atTuen Mun Town Plaza I in the New Territories. The 1st Defendant ("Fong"), Chong's employer, had instructed Chong to install air-conditionersat the site. To carry out his work, Chong had to hold one side of an air-conditioner unit with his left hand while climbing up awooden ladder ("the ladder") with the aid of his right hand. A co-worker (named Ah Kwan) held on to the other side of the air-conditionerwhile climbing up another wooden ladder. When Chong was about 8 feet above the ground, the rung of the ladder on which he was standingsuddenly broke. Chong fell to the ground and sustained injury.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The 4th Defendant ("Quiet &amp; Cool") was the nominated sub-contractor for the installation of air-conditioning units at the Site.Quiet &amp; Cool engaged the 3rd Defendant ("Yau Luen") as sub-contractor. Yau Luen engaged the 2nd Defendant ("Siu Yip") as sub-sub-contractor.The proprietors of Yau Luen and Siu Yip are brothers. Siu Yip engaged Fong as sub-sub-sub-contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> There is a dispute between the 5th Defendant ("HKC") on the one hand and the 1st and 2nd Third Parties (respectively, "Ping Kai"and "Ping Kee") on the other as to who the principal or main contractor at the Site was. Ma Hung Kwan ("Ma") or Ping Kee is the controllingshareholder and director of Ping Kai. I will consider the issue between HKC, Ping Kai and Ping Kee in detail below. For now, I notethat there was no evidence at the hearing before me of any formal sub-contract having been executed between either HKC or Ping Kaion the one hand and Quiet &amp; Cool on the other.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> At the time of Chong's accident the Site was owned by Entertainment City Limited ("ECL"), a subsidiary within the Sino Group ("Sino").ECL was the Employer for the Site project which involved renovation and decoration work.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> By the accident Chong sustained a pilon (distal end) fracture of the left tibia involving the ankle joint. He initially sufferedfrom post-traumatic oedema. An operation was postponed until the oedema was controlled. On 17 September 1998 Chong underwent an operationentailing close reduction and external fixation. He was hospitalised for 17 days. On 11 November 1998 he was re-admitted to TuenMun Hospital because of an infection from an inserted wire. The wire was removed and 6 days later Chong was discharged. He was againhospitalised for 4 days in December 1998 for removal of the external fixator. This was followed by regular treatment and physiotherapy.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Chong still suffers from residual pain and stiffness of the left ankle, with a chance of degenerative arthritis. The pain and stiffnessare aggravated when Chong walks on uneven surfaces or goes for prolonged walks. The pain and stiffness may be due to damage to thearticular surface of Chong's distal tibia. He will have to minimise strenuous use of his left ankle in the future. Chong cannot returnto his pre-injury occupation of installing air-conditioners at construction sites. But he can take up light duty jobs such as thatof an indoor cleaner and a car-park attendant.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> On 7 January 2002 Deputy Judge Yu gave judgment in Chong's favour against Fong as Chong's employer in Employees' Compensation CaseNo. 877 of 1999. Judge Yu awarded Chong a total of $337,974.40 in employees' compensation together with interest from the date ofapplication for compensation to date of judgment at half the judgment rate and thereafter at the judgment rate until payment.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Judge Yu further found that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) HKC was the principal contractor at the Site;</p>        <p>(2) Quiet &amp; Cool was HKC's sub-contractor;</p>        <p>(3) Yau Luen was Quiet &amp; Cool's sub-contractor;</p>        <p>(4) Siu Yip was Yau Luen's sub-contractor; and,</p>        <p>(5) Fong was Siu Yip's sub-contractor.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Accordingly, Judge Yu held that Siu Yip, Yau Luen, Quiet &amp; Cool and HKC were respectively liable under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees' Compensation Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282">Cap. 282</a>) ("ECO") <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 24</a> for the amount awarded to Chong. As against Fong, the judge gave Yau Luen, Quiet &amp; Cool and HKC an indemnity under ECO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 24(2)</a> in respect of such employees' compensation as they might pay Chong.</p>    <p class="heading">II. Discussion</p>    <p class="heading">A. Chong's claims</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Neither Fong nor Siu Yip served a Defence. On 1 February 2002 Chong obtained an Interlocutory Judgment on liability against themwith damages to be assessed. Therefore, as far as Fong and Siu Yip are concerned, the trial before me was for the assessment of damagespayable by them. I shall refer below to the other Defendants (that is, apart from Fong and Siu Yip) as "the Remaining Defendants".</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Mr Chan (appearing on Chong's behalf) concentrated on the following claims against the Remaining Defendants:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">Yau Luen and Quiet &amp; Cool breached their respective duties of care at common law and under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap. 314</a>) ("OLO").</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">HKC breached its duty of care as principal contractor under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I">Cap. 59I</a> sub. leg.)

They suggested that, having been caused by a defective ladder, Chong's injurycannot be attributed to "dangers due to the state of the premises or to things done or omitted to be done on them" (see OLO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 2(1)).</a></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In their support, Mr Hingorani and Mr Wong cited Chapman J in <strong>Wheeler v. Copas</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%203%20All%20ER%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 3 All ER 405</a> (at 408c-d):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The plaintiff puts his case to a considerable extent on the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, but it seems to me that there may be considerabledifficulty in relation to that because the Act is dealing with an occupier. It is true that it covers moveable structures, such asvessels, vehicles and aircraft. I do not doubt that in appropriate circumstances it could apply to a ladder, but I see considerabledifficulty in saying that once the defendant had handed the ladder over to the plaintiff and his partner for the purpose of the bricklayingthe defendant was still the occupier of this ladder."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>They also mentioned <strong>Lam Yuet Kam v. Tsui Fong Fun</strong>, unrep., HCPI 235/2001, 9 October 2002, where Suffiad J stated (at Â§48):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"[T]he cause of the accident was due to the defective ladder. This is not a case relating to dangerous premises or a danger on thepremises, rather it is a case concerning defective or dangerous equipment brought along or provided by Mr Chan (for whom the 1stdefendant must be vicariously liable)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Although attracted at first to the notion that application of the OLO could be dismissed because a ladder cannot be premises, onfurther reflection I do not think that the analysis is so straightforward. Chong was required to work at a height on Site. Unlessthe occupier of the Site (whoever that might be) provided a means of access to that height, the premises (including the height fromwhich Chong was expected to work) would constitute a danger. The danger would arise because of the failure to provide a safe meansof access to that higher level of the premises in which Chong was supposed to install an air-conditioning unit.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The real question is whether any of the Remaining Defendants were "occupiers" and (if they were) whether they can rely on OLO ss.3(3)(b)<sup>1</sup>. According to <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> (18th ed.), Â§10-09(p. 565):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Apart from owners and lessees, a person is likely to be regarded as an 'occupier' if he has sufficient degree of control over premisesto be able to ensure their safety, and to appreciate that a failure on his part to use care may result in injury to a person comingon to them. The control need be neither entire nor exclusive. So someone with the immediate supervision and control of premises,such as a builder in <em>de facto</em> control of part of a house, may be an occupier, whether or not he has the power of permitting or prohibiting the entry of other personto it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>On that footing, both Yau Luen and Quiet &amp; Cool would qualify as "occupiers" within the meaning of the OLO. Quiet &amp; Cool asnominated sub-contractor for installing air-conditioners at the Site would have had sufficient supervision and control over workingconditions to ensure that the Site was safe for its employees and agents to work. Similarly, Yau Luen would have had enough controlof the Site to ensure safe working conditions for employees and agents.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Mr Chan's difficulty in ascribing liability to Quiet &amp; Cool and Yau Luen is that each sub-contracted all or part of the workfor which they were responsible at the Site to sub-contractors who were experienced in the installation of air-conditioners and whomight reasonably have been expected in the exercise of their calling to appreciate and guard against the obvious and ordinary risksarising from installing air-conditioning units at a height.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Quiet &amp; Cool, for instance, sub-contracted work to Yau Luen. The evidence of Chan Shun Kwong (also known as Tai Kong), the soleproprietor of Yau Luen, was to the effect that he had previously been engaged in air-conditioning installation work. There was nosuggestion made in cross-examination that Yau Luen was inexperienced or incompetent. Chan Shun Kwong also mentioned that he had previouslysub-contracted work to Siu Yip and knew that the work at the site which Siu Yip was asked to do was within Siu Yip's expertise andcompetence. This evidence was not challenged in cross-examination.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> On the evidence, both Quiet &amp; Cool and Yau Luen could reasonably expect their respective experienced sub-contractors (Yau Luenin the case of Quiet &amp; Cool and Siu Yip in the case of Yau Luen) to know what they were doing and to appreciate the obvious factthat, if one uses ladders to install heavy air-conditioning units, safe ladders must be used. This is not a situation where a putativeoccupier has engaged a plainly incompetent contractor or failed to take steps to ensure that an appropriate person was hired to workin relevant premises. Even if Quiet &amp; Cool and Yau Luen could be characterised as occupiers, they would be entitled to rely onOLO s. 3(3)(b) in their defence against Chong's claim. They complied with their common duty of care in the circumstances of thiscase.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Mr Chan did not press an argument that, regardless of the position on the OLO, Quiet &amp; Cool and Yau Luen breached their respectiveduties of care owed at common law. Insofar as Quiet &amp; Cool and Yau Luen can be said to have fulfilled their common duty of careunder the OLO, they would also have met the standard of reasonable care required of them at common law.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Chong's evidence was that, prior to its use, he obtained the ladder from a room at the Site where air-conditioners and other ladderswere stored. There was no evidence as to who owned the ladder or provided it for Chong's use. Presumably, Fong as employer wouldhave arranged for the ladder to be made available to Chong. Beyond that I do not think that I can safely infer anything else in lightof the paucity of evidence on the point. It is hard to see how I can attribute negligence at common law to Quiet &amp; Cool or YauLuen in respect of the provision of the ladder.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> In my

Guidance on the application of CSSRReg. 2(2) is given by Hooper J in <strong>Attorney General v. John Lok &amp; Partners and another</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20HKLR%20325" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] HKLR 325</a>, at 335F-I:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A person can carry out, carry into practice or carry through construction work without actually performing the physical work himself.There have been many cases where a principal contractor has contracted for the carrying out f the work, but has in fact sub-contractedthe whole of the operation to someone else. Indeed the case of <em>Tom K Engineering &amp; Construction Company Ltd</em>. Crim App No. 2/78, unreported, was one such case. In my view, he can carry out the construction work even though he does not performthe physical work involved in the operation. He is undertaking construction work there if he is managing, organizing or supervisingetc. the work. I am of the opinion that there is an implication in the use of the words 'is undertaking' that the contractor hasmade himself responsible for the carrying out of construction work which has been commenced or entered upon. It would be ludicrousif a head contractor or principal contractor having made himself responsible for the carrying out of certain works could avoid liabilityunder these provisions by saying that though work had begun, he had not himself performed any physical work or acted in accordancewith his contractual obligations. The whole purpose of this legislation is to make sure that the person having the primary responsibilityunder the contracts in relation to the carrying out or carrying into practice or carrying through the construction work, should beresponsible for the site where that construction work has commenced."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Hence, the principal contractor would be the person who makes himself primarily responsible contractually for undertaking the wholeof the construction work to be done at a site. That person may sub-contract all or part of the work (including the work of supervision)which he has agreed to carry out. But, even though he actually performs none or only some of the construction work which he has contractuallyundertaken, that person remains statutorily liable for any failure to observe the obligations imposed on a principal contractor bythe CSSR.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Kwok Tin Yan ("Kwok"), HKC's executive director, gave evidence on the relationship between HKC and Ping Kai. Kwok stated that, despitehaving been invited by Sino to tender for the Site project, HKC was uninterested since its main business was construction, not renovation.But Wu Ming Sang ("Wu") of HKC's staff mentioned that Ma was interested in tendering for the work. The problem was that ECL was notprepared to engage Ma or Ping Kai as the main contractor on the Site project because ECL had not previously dealt with either.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr Kwok stated that a meeting was arranged between Ma and Ko Chin Fung ("Ko"), HKC's managing director.

According to Ma, Wu told him that HKC was looking for sub-contractors to do general buildingwork in future projects. Ma expressed an interest and Wu introduced him to HKC. Consequently, Ma did a few projects for HKC in late1997 and early 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Ma denies entering into an agreement of the nature alleged by Kwok. Ma stated that in June 1998 Kwok invited Ma to tender with HKCfor builder's works at the Site project. Since Ma did not understand English, Kwok explained to him details of the tender in Chinese.On Ping Kai's behalf, Ma submitted an initial tender (which was restricted to builder's works) on about 30 June 1998. Since the specificationswere revised on a number of occasions, the initial tender was also amended several times. But at no time did the scope of works forwhich Ping Kai tendered, ever include items, such as air-condition installation, for which there would be specialist sub-contractors.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Ma admits that he caused Ping Kee to file a Form BA10 ("the BA10") with the Building Authority. In the BA10 Ping Kee identifies itselfas the building contractor for the Site. Ma says that he only did this because in July 1998 "[HKC] told me that since we were doingthe builder's works we had to be responsible for it, and so we had to be the one to file a BA10 notice to the Building Authority".Ma filed the BA10 in the name of Ping Kee rather than Ping Kai because the former (but not the latter) was registered as a buildingcontractor and only a registered contractor could complete the BA10.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Ma said that work commenced at the Site on 21 July 1998. He says that he later provided to ECL a Letter of Undertaking which guaranteedthat the works would be carried out in accordance with specifications. He states that he did this because Kwok and Ko asked him todo so. He comments that: "This undertaking is to be given by the registered contractor who put in the BA10 notice, and the Employerhad to know who was the registered contractor responsible for completing the BA10 notice." Ma agreed to Ko's request "since it wasour obligations to carry out the builder's work properly as the sub-contractor and having given the BA10".</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> So much for the conflicting accounts by Kwok and Ma of what happened and of what was intended.

As main contractor, the scope ofHKC's obligations included supervision of the MVAC works, including the air-condition installation work undertaken by Quiet &amp;Cool as nominated sub-contractor.

Ma acknowledged and accepted this fact by signing first a copy of the 1st award letter and later a copy of the 2nd award letter.Thus, the scope of work of Ping Kai, as HKC's sub-contractor, also involved supervision of the MVAC works on the Site, includinginstallation of air-conditioners by Quiet &amp; Cool.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(3)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%">There was no evidence that Quiet &amp; Cool entered into a contract (whether in writing, orally or by conduct) with either HKC orPing Kai.

Before 18 September 1998 (Mr Hingorani submitted) there could only have been a relationship betweenECL and Ping Kai since no binding contract had yet been signed between ECL and HKC. Given that Ping Kai had been admitted onto theSite in late July 1998 and commenced works there and that Ping Kai (through Ping Kee) had submitted a BA10 and a Form of Undertakingbefore 18 September 1998, the inference (Mr Hingorani suggested) must be that, whatever the position was after 18 September 1998,Ping Kai was in charge of the Site as main contractor on 8 September 1998 when the accident occurred.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> I disagree. Mr Hingorani's case is at odds with the Amended Defence. The latter does not draw any difference between the period beforeand after 18 September 1998. The case is also at odds with Kwok's evidence. Kwok characterised the arrangement between HKC and PingKai as being "back-to-back". He did not distinguish between the period before and after 18 September 1998 in terms of the existenceof a back-to-back arrangement.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> More fundamentally, Mr Hingorani's argument is contrary to the evidence. Thus, documents show that from the beginning HKC was heavilyinvolved in the Site project. For example, the minutes of a project site meeting on 24 July 1998 record HKC as having been in attendancein the persons of F Y Cheng ("Cheng"), K F Yu ("Yu") and Ma. Cheng and Yu were employees of HKC charged with supervising Ping Kai'swork on-site. Although Ma worked for Ping Kai, he is listed as having attended on behalf of HKC, because as far as everyone was concernedHKC was going to be the main contractor on the Site. In item Â§5 headed "Main Contract", a number of tasks were assigned to HKC (forexample, submission of an organisation chart, provision of a master programme indicating a critical path, provision of a BA10, submissionof a site office location, provision of a sequence of work, provision of insurance and implementation of site safety and fire safetymeasures) which one would expect to have been given to Ping Kai if (as Mr Hingorani suggests) HKC was not involved as main contractoruntil after 18 September 1998. It may have been the case (as Kwok said in the witness box) that some or all of those tasks were passedon by HKC to Ping Kai as HKC's back-to-back sub-contractor. But that does not change the reality that HKC was (and was universallyregarded as) the main contractor responsible for the Site as early as July 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> It may be the case that the formal contracts regulating the parties' relationships among each other were not all signed until 18September 1998. But it seems that, taking the evidence as a whole, the formal documents executed at that later time were merely intendedto record in writing the arrangements orally worked out and agreed among the parties beforehand.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Mr Hingorani attached significant weight to the fact that Ping Kee on behalf of Ping Kai submitted a BA10 and Letter of Undertaking.These would conventionally be done by a main contractor. Mr Hingorani asked rhetorically: Why would Ping Kee undertake the heavyresponsibilities associated consequential on the filing of such documents unless it was the main contractor?</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Here I accept Ma's evidence that he filed such documents because HKC asked him to do so. Ma wanted the work at the site (which inmonetary terms was the largest he had ever undertaken). He thought Ping Kai could do a good job. Ping Kai was not registered as acontractor with the Building Authority, but Ping Kee was. Ma saw no harm in Ping Kee filing the BA10 and Letter of Undertaking atHKC's instruction. In so doing he did not pay any regard to the fact that the standard forms once completed would identify Ping Keeas the main contractor on the Site. Ma is not a lawyer. His English is poor. He wanted to get on with the work. If that meant filingthe BA10 and Letter of Undertaking, so be it.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> I should not be taken to be saying that a registered person can sign a BA10 or a Letter of Undertaking lightly. Undoubtedly by signingsuch documents, a person assumes responsibilities and liabilities towards the Building Authority and an Employer. But that seriousconsequence is different from the limited issue before me here, namely, to determine in the specific circumstances of this case whothe principal contractor with responsibility for the Site was.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Mr Hingorani also put weight on the fact that much correspondence between HKC and various sub-contractors was copied by HKC to PingKai for action by the latter. Ping Kai personnel even corresponded with sub-contractors using HKC letterhead. These circumstancesseem to me to be consistent with my conclusion and the case pleaded in Amended Defence Â§3 that HKC sub-contracted its obligationsunder the Main Contract to Ping Kai.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Given that HKC was the principal contractor, was it in breach of CSSR regs. 38A, 38B and 38C as Mr Chan alleges? In my judgment,it breached all 3 regulations.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The ladder provided to Chong was clearly sub-standard in violation of Reg. 38O. A proper ladder would not have rungs which breakwhen used.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Given the ladder was the means provided for access to higher levels of the Site, the ladder could not have been regarded as a safemeans of access to such heights. There was thus a violation of Reg. 38A.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> There was evidence from Yau Luen that metal scaffolds (not on wheels) were available at the Site. It is unclear how many scaffoldswere provided or how many were in use at the time of the accident. In order to climb up to the working platform of a metal scaffoldwhich was at a height of 4 to 5 feet above ground, it would still be necessary to use a ladder. Therefore, it seems to me that itcan hardly be said that any available metal scaffold was safer to use than the ladder. Further, the scaffolds supplied were not convenient.To be moved from place to place, they had to be dismantled and then re-instated. This feature would hardly render a scaffold reasonableor practical for a worker such as Chong to use, since he would have to install a number of air-conditioning units in different placesin the course of a day. For all these reasons, I find that there was a breach of Reg. 38B.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> I conclude that HKC (and not Ping Kai) was liable to Chong as principal contractor for breach of the statutory duties imposed byCSSR regs. 38A, 38B and 38O.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> My conclusion on this issue makes it unnecessary for me to determine whether Mr Chan is right in suggesting that HKC is estoppedby Judge Yu's findings in connection with the incidence of compensation under the ECO from denying that HKC is the principal contractorunder the CSSR.</p>    <p class="heading">A.4 Contributory negligence?</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> HKC's Amended Defence alleges that Chong was contributorily negligent by:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">"Failing to take any or any adequate care for his own safety";</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(2)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">"Exposing himself to the risk of danger he knew or ought to have known"; and,</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%"></td>                <td valign="top" width="85%"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="5%">(3)</td>                <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">"Failing to take reasonable care for his own safety and to take necessary measures to prevent the said accident".</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>I reject the allegation.

Clause 3 stipulates that the relevant sub-contractor shall indemnify the main contractor against loss or damage resultingfrom the sub-contractor's performance of its obligations. See Â§Â§6-8 of HKC's Statement of Claim dated 7 November 2003 against Quiet&amp; Cool.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> I do not follow Mr Hingorani's reasoning. I do not understand how the failure by Quiet &amp; Cool to take out employees' compensationin accordance with its obligations to ECL gives rise to a claim for contribution against it by HKC. I do not see why the impliedterm suggested needs to be read into the contract between ECL and Quiet &amp; Cool to give it business efficacy. Nor am I certainhow reading a term into a contract between ECL and Quiet &amp; Cool, gives rise to a claim by HKC which is not privy to that contract.This is especially so where the alleged implied term is that Quiet &amp; Cool should enter into a specific form of sub-contract whichin fact Quiet &amp; Cool never entered into with HKC.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Mr Hingorani says that Quiet &amp; Cool in failing to file a Defence must be taken to have admitted HKC's claim for contribution.I do not think that it follows from the failure to file a Defence that a Court is bound to give judgment when the alleged claim doesnot make sense or is ill-founded. See, for example, RHC Order 19 Rule 7 and <em>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</em> Note 19/7/13 (pp. 333-4). The Court retains a discretion in the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> I do not see that the 16 January 2002 letter (written more than a year before HKC raised its claims in October and November 2003by a Notice of Contribution and a Statement of Claim against Quiet &amp; Cool) advances Mr Hingorani's contentions. Properly construed,I do not think the letter is anything other than an acceptance by Quiet &amp; Cool of any claim which might be made against HKC asa result of Quiet &amp; Cool's negligent performance of its obligations. The letter does not excuse HKC from having to establishthat Quiet &amp; Cool was negligent in the first place. In any event, whatever Quiet &amp; Cool's letter might mean, it cannot amountto an admission of any claim whatsoever which HKC might plead against Quiet &amp; Cool.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> For the above reasons, I reject the 1st limb of HKC's claim for contribution against Quiet &amp; Cool.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> CLCO s. 3(1) provides that to maintain a claim for contribution a defendant must establish that he and the alleged contributor arejointly or severally liable in respect of the "same damage".</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> CLCO s. 2(3) stipulates:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A person is liable in respect of any damage for the purposes of this Ordinance if the person who suffered it (or anyone representinghis estate or dependents) is entitled to recover compensations from him in respect of that damage (whatever the legal basis of hisliability, whether tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or otherwise)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The relevant damage is that suffered by Chong. In respect of that, the test for a claim of contribution is as has been stated byLord Bingham in <strong>Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v. Hammond</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20WLR%201397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 WLR 1397 (HL)</a>, at Â§6 (pp. 1401-2):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"When any claim for contribution falls to be decided the following questions in my opinion arise: (1) What damage has A suffered?(2) Is B liable to A in respect of that damage?

I do not thinkit matters greatly whether, in phrasing these questions, one speaks (as the [CLCO] does) of 'damage' or of 'loss' or 'harm,' providedit is borne in mind that 'damage' does not mean 'damages' ... and that B's right to contribution by C depends on the damage, lossor harm for which B is liable to A corresponding (even if in part only) with the damage, loss or harm for which C is liable to A."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> I have explained above why in my view Quiet &amp; Cool cannot have been liable for Chong's accident. It follows that an essentialingredients for HKC's claim in contribution to succeed (namely, that Quiet &amp; Cool is liable in whole or part for Chong's injury)is missing. HKC's claim against Quiet &amp; Cool for contribution under the CLCO must accordingly fail.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> I conclude that HKC has no basis for claiming contribution against Quiet &amp; Cool.</p>    <p class="heading">B.2 HKC's claims against Ping Kai and Ping Kee</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> HKC claims contribution or indemnity from Ping Kai or Ping Kee under a number of heads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) under CSSR s. 2(2);</p>        <p>(2) under an express oral agreement for an indemnity;</p>        <p>(3) under the CLCO;</p>        <p>(4) under the OLO; and,</p>        <p>(5) at common law.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Mr Hingorani advanced the possibility that HKC and Ping Kai were joint principal contractors under the CSSR. In my view, the evidencedoes not justify such a conclusion. Ping Kai was simply a sub-contractor of HKC. I reject the claim by HKC based on the CSSR.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> As for an alleged oral indemnity, I am not persuaded that Ma orally agreed with Ko to indemnify HKC as alleged by Kwok in his witnessstatement. Kwok was not impressive on this point. In the course of cross-examination, Mr Wong pointed out to Kwok that, accordingto him, an indemnity was expressly agreed between HKC and Ma. Kwok said that he could not remember. Mr Wong directed Kwok to Â§5of his witness statement. Kwok said that this is what his statement said and matters were carried out in accordance with the spiritof the contract between HKC and Ping Kai. Mr Wong then suggested to Kwok that he could not now recall whether the question of indemnitywas discussed or agreed. Kwok replied in the affirmative. Despite Mr Hingorani's submissions to the contrary, I do not see why Ishould take Kwok's statement otherwise than at face value. In light of his present inability to recall whether or not an expressindemnity was given by Ma on behalf of Ping Kai, I am unable to hold that one was agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> I do not think that there can be a claim under the CLCO. As sub-contractor, I do not see in what way Ping Kai could have been liablein respect of the damage suffered by Chong. Again, an important ingredient for ascribing liability under the CLCO is missing. Thechoice of Quiet &amp; Cool as sub-contractor was not made by Ping Kai. ECL nominated Quiet &amp; Cool for the MVAC installation.Ping Kai had no say in the matter. Quiet &amp; Cool chose a competent sub-contractor (Yau Luen) to carry out installation of air-conditioning.In turn, Yau Luen cannot be faulted for choosing Siu Yip. In the premises, Ping Kai can hardly be liable for Fong's default, furtherdown the line of sub-contractors, in providing a safe system of work for Chong.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Finally, for the same reasons that Quiet &amp; Cool and Yau Luen cannot be liable under the OLO and at common law, Ping Kai cannotbe liable under either head.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> HKC's claim for contribution or indemnity against Ping Kai fails.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> As for Ping Kee, there is likewise no basis for the claim against it. That case must also be rejected.</p>    <p class="heading">C.

As a result, Ping Kai lost the possibility of being reimbursed against liability to Chong by the insurers. Had itbeen able to make a claim under the insurance policy in respect of Chong's injury, Ping Kai would have claimed the amount for whichit would have to indemnify or make contribution to HKC. There would have been a complete set-off by Ping Kai of HKC's claim againstmonies receivable under the insurance policy.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Second, Ping Kai says that HKC owes $500,000 for works carried out on the Site. That amount is evidenced by an Invoice</p>    <p>No. 01/02113 dated 27 December 2001. There is no dispute that HKC owes that amount. HKC claims to be entitled to set-off that amountagainst any contribution payable by Ping Kai to HKC in respect of Chong's injury.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> In light of my conclusions, there is no need for me to determine Ping Kai's 1st head of counterclaim. As for the 2nd head of counterclaim,HKC not being entitled to any contribution from Ping Kai, the $500,000 claimed must be payable immediately.</p>    <p class="heading">D.

HKC says that the appropriate amount should be $250,000. Although not always consistent, recentcases (for instance: <strong>Lau Kin Wah v. Lam Shu Kan</strong> [2000] HKLRD (Yearbook) 379; <strong>Ho Sik Tung v. Lau Kin Sun</strong> [2001] HKLRD (Yearbook) 429; <strong>Wong Woon Hei v. Dickson Construction Co.
