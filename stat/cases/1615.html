Where in any employment, personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to an employee,section 5(1) makes the employer liable to pay compensation. </p>        <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In the present case, there is no dispute that the appellant suffered personal injury in a work-related accident which occurred on18 September 2002 at a building known as Causeway Bay Plaza I.  He was welding a part in an air-conditioner when the welding rodsuddenly shattered and a fragment struck his left eye.  In consequence, he had to spend a month and a half in hospital and suffereda 30% loss of vision in that eye.  He was assessed to have suffered a 45% loss of earning capacity.</p>        <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The issue between the parties is whether he was an employee of the respondent at the time of the accident.  The ECO defines âemployeeâ(subject to a proviso to which I will return) as â... any person who has ... entered into or works under a contract of service... with an employer in any employment, whether by way of manual labour, clerical work, or otherwise, and whether the contract isexpressed or implied, is oral or in writing.â<a>[1]</a> </p>        <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In the District Court, Deputy Judge P Li (as H H Judge Li then was) held that he was not an âemployeeâ and dismissed his applicationfor compensation.<a>[2]</a>  The Judge was upheld by the Court of Appeal.<a>[3]</a>  Leave to appeal to the Court was granted by the Appeal Committee on 22 May 2006.</p>        <p class="heading">A.  The relationship between the parties</p>        <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Judge found:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) that there was no obligation on the respondentâs part to supply the appellant with work and that the appellant, in turn, hadno obligation to turn up for work or to accept any work offered by the respondent (an arrangement which the Judge found inconsistentwith an employer-employee relationship);</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) that the appellant was free to take up jobs for others and did not require the respondentâs permission to do so (a fact againfound to be inconsistent with an employer-employee relationship);</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c) that from November 2000 to February 2001, the appellant had worked not only for the respondent but also for another enterprise,although the appellant would give the respondent preference if he was needed (a fact which the Judge thought âstrangeâ and apparentlyregarded as a factor against finding an employment relationship);</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(d) that, unlike others who were employees of the respondent, the appellant had chosen to make his own Mandatory Provident Fund (â<u>MPF</u>â) arrangements as a self-employed person because he wished to âmaintain flexibilityâ (a fact considered to be âa strong indicationthat there was no employer-employee relationshipâ);</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(e) that the appellant was paid a daily wage of $550 for working from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm (plus overtime if applicable) as well astravelling expenses where he had to travel while at work, keeping his own time sheets and records of expenses; and that during theperiod from February to September 2002, he had worked for 117 days, receiving payment at the end of each job or at irregular intervalswhen he submitted claims for payment (an arrangement described as one where âthe [appellant] was employed when need arose ... âona casual as required basisââ);</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(f) that the respondent supplied most of the equipment used, particularly any heavy equipment (a fact which the Judge considered âneitherhere nor thereâ); and,</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(g) that the appellant was an experienced air-conditioning worker and did not require supervision on the job.</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Woo VP, with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, placed particular emphasis on the absence of any mutual obligationto supply and take up work; and on the MPF arrangements made by the appellant <i>qua</i> self-employed person, when upholding the Judge. </p>        <p class="heading">B.  Classifying a work relationship as an employer-employee relationship</p>        <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In the great majority of cases, deciding whether or not A is Bâs employee presents little difficulty.  Most people take up jobswhich are regular and stable, doing the work assigned to them, supervised by the boss and receiving regular wages and other benefitsin return.  They are obviously employees.  However, in certain instances, the answer to the question whether an employer-employeerelationship exists is elusive, as recognized by Lord Griffiths in <i>Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung</i><a>[4]</a>:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThis has proved to be a most elusive question and despite a plethora of authorities the courts have not been able to devise a singletest that will conclusively point to the distinction [between an employee and an independent contractor] in all cases.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The relationship may bear features suggestive of employment, as well as features indicating some other type of relationship.  Often,the court is asked to decide whether someone is an employee as opposed to an independent contractor: in traditional language, whetherthe person engaged is a servant under a contract of service or an independent contractor under a contract for services.  Or the questionmay be whether the relationship involves a contract of employment as opposed, for example, to a contract of carriage<a>[5]</a> or a contract of bailment<a>[6]</a> or, indeed, a relationship involving no enforceable contract of any kind.<a>[7]</a></p>        <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In the earlier case-law, whether the master controlled the manner of doing the work was regarded as the single test for identifyinga master and servant relationship, particularly in the context of vicarious liability, there being an evident logic in founding themasterâs vicarious liability on his control over the servant who inflicted the damage.<a>[8]</a>  However, it became clear that the control test as originally conceived was too narrow.  As Mackinnon LJ observed in <i>Wardell v Kent County Council</i>,<a>[9]</a> many a person who is clearly an employee âpossesses, and is engaged to exercise, some qualification of skillâ so that his methodof working cannot be said to be under his employerâs control.  His Lordship was there dealing with a qualified hospital nurse andgave as other examples âa chef, or a cabinet-maker, or a compositor, or even a professional football playerâ.</p>        <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The test was therefore widened to embrace indirect forms of control.  Thus, in <i>Short v J and W Henderson Ltd</i>,<a>[10]</a> Lord Thankerton applied âthe four indiciaâ of a contract of service suggested by Lord Justice-Clerk Alness in <i>Park v Wilsons and Clyde Coal Company Ltd</i>,<a>[11]</a> consisting of the following:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â(a) The Masterâs power of selection of his servant; (b) the payment of wages or other remuneration; (c) the Masterâs rightto control the method of doing the work; and (d) the Masterâs right of suspension or dismissal.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  But control as a test has no obvious relevance to determining for instance, whether a person ought to be considered an employeeso as to qualify for minimum wages,<a>[12]</a> or for employment protections against redundancy<a>[13]</a> or unfair dismissal,<a>[14]</a> or whether he ought to be insured by the employer under a national health scheme,<a>[15]</a> or, in ECO cases, whether his employer ought compulsorily to insure him against accidental injury at work.<a>[16]</a>  While control (broadly conceived) continues to be regarded as one of the indicia of employment, the courts have increasingly turnedto the economic or commercial aspects of the relationship as more suitable guides to the allocation of such statutory rights andduties.</p>        <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Thus, in the Privy Council in 1947, having pointed to the inadequacy of control as a single test, Lord Wright stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIn the more complex conditions of modern industry, more complicated tests have often to be applied. It has been suggested thata fourfold test would in some cases be more appropriate, a complex involving (1) control; (2) ownership of the tools; (3) chanceof profit; (4) risk of loss.â<a>[17]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Two English first instance decisions have proved influential.  First, in the <i>Ready Mixed Concrete</i> case Mackenna J identified three conditions for the existence of a contract of employment as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â(i) The servant agrees that, in consideration of a wage or other remuneration, he will provide his own work and skill in the performanceof some service for his master. (ii) He agrees, expressly or impliedly, that in the performance of that service he will be subjectto the otherâs control in a sufficient degree to make that other master. (iii) The other provisions of the contract are consistentwith its being a contract of service.â<a>[18]</a> </p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It was in respect of the third condition that his Lordship explained how one partyâs reservation of a right to control the mannerof working could be overridden by economic or commercial realities which point to the other party being engaged as an independentcontractor and not as an employee.  This was illustrated by Dixon Jâs decision in the Australian High Court in <i>Queensland Stations Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i>,<a>[19]</a> which involved a drover employed to drove 317 cattle to a certain destination pursuant to a written agreement which included a termrequiring him to obey and carry out all lawful instructions.  This, Dixon J pointed out, could not âoutweigh the countervailingconsiderations which are found in the employment by him of servants of his own, the provision of horses, equipment, plant, rations,and a remuneration at a rate per head delivered.â  Such a âreservation of right to direct or superintend the performance of thetask cannot transform into a contract of service what in essence is an independent contractâ.<a>[20]</a>  Mackenna J also referred (among other authorities) to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <i>US v Silk</i>,<a>[21]</a> which involved the question whether men working for the plaintiffs were âemployeesâ for the purposes the Social Security Act1935, noting that there:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe test was whether the men were employees âas a matter of economic reality.â  Important factors were said to be âthe degreesof control, opportunities of profit or loss, investment in facilities, permanency of relation and skill required in the claimed independentoperation.ââ<a>[22]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The other influential first instance decision is that of Cooke J in <i>Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security</i>.<a>[23]</a>  It earned the Privy Councilâs accolade in <i>Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung</i>,<a>[24]</a> where Lord Griffiths stated that their Lordships âagree with the Court of Appeal when they said that the matter had never beenbetter put than by Cooke Jâ in that case.  The passage approved of runs as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... the fundamental test to be applied is this: âIs the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing themas a person in business on his own account?â  If the answer to that question is âyes,â then the contract is a contract forservices.  If the answer is âno,â then the contract is a contract of service.  No exhaustive list has been compiled and perhapsno exhaustive list can be compiled of the considerations which are relevant in determining that question, nor can strict rules belaid down as to the relative weight which the various considerations should carry in particular cases.  The most that can be saidis that control will no doubt always have to be considered, although it can no longer be regarded as the sole determining factor;and that factors which may be of importance are such matters as whether the man performing the services provides his own equipment,whether he hires his own helpers, what degree of financial risk he takes, what degree of responsibility for investment and managementhe has, and whether and how far he has an opportunity of profiting from sound management in the performance of his task.â<a>[25]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The modern approach to the question whether one person is anotherâs employee is therefore to examine all the features of theirrelationship against the background of the indicia developed in the abovementioned case-law with a view to deciding whether, as amatter of overall impression, the relationship is one of employment, bearing in mind the purpose for which the question is asked. It involves a nuanced and not a mechanical approach, as Mummery J emphasised in <i>Hall v Lorimer</i><a>[26]</a> (in a passage approved by the English Court of Appeal<a>[27]</a>):</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIn order to decide whether a person carries on business on his own account it is necessary to consider many different aspects ofthat personâs work activity.  This is not a mechanical exercise of running through items on a check list to see whether they arepresent in, or absent from, a given situation.  The object of the exercise is to paint a picture from the accumulation of detail. The overall effect can only be appreciated by standing back from the detailed picture which has been painted, by viewing it froma distance and by making an informed, considered, qualitative appreciation of the whole.  It is a matter of evaluation of the overalleffect of the detail, which is not necessarily the same as the sum total of the individual details.  Not all details are of equalweight or importance in any given situation. The details may also vary in importance from one situation to another.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="heading">C.  The primary grounds of decision below</p>        <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The foregoing approach is applicable to deciding whether the appellant was the respondentâs employee at the time of the accidentso as to render the respondent liable to pay compensation under the ECO.</p>        <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Woo V-P sets out a list of eight criteria derived from <i>Chitty</i>,<a>[28]</a> as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â(1)   the degree of control exercised by the employer;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> (2)   whether the workerâs interest in the relationship involved any prospect of profit or risk of loss;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> (3)   whether the worker was properly regarded as part of the employerâs organisation;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> (4)   whether the worker was carrying on business on his own account or carrying on the business of the employer;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> (5)   the provision of equipment;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> (6)   the incidence of tax and national insurance;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> (7)   the partiesâ own view of their relationship;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote"> (8)   the traditional structure of the trade or profession concerned and the arrangements within it.â<a>[29]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  However, the Judge and Woo V-P considered two factors to be crucial, effectively ruling out the existence of any employment contract. These were (i) the absence of any mutual obligation to provide and accept work; and (ii) the appellantâs decision to make hisown MPF arrangements as a self-employed person (to which the Judge added the fact that the appellant had done jobs for differententerprises).</p>        <p class="heading">D.  Grounds for intervention on appeal</p>        <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is âfirmly established that the question of whether or not the work was performed in the capacity of an employee or as an independentcontractor is to be regarded by an appellate court as a question of fact to be determined by the trial court.â<a>[30]</a>  Accordingly, so far as the trial judgeâs classification of the contract is concerned, an appellate court can only intervene on<i>Edwards v Bairstow<a>[31]</a></i> grounds.  In other words, a finding that an employer-employee relationship does or does not exist can only be interfered with onappeal if it can be shown that the tribunal misdirected itself in law or came to a decision which no tribunal, properly directingitself on the relevant facts, could reasonably have reached.</p>        <p class="heading">E.  Error of law relating to the absence of mutual obligation to provide and accept work</p>        <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In my judgment, the courts below misdirected themselves in law by regarding the absence of a mutual obligation to provide and acceptwork as inconsistent with the existence of a contract of employment.</p>        <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  As noted in section A above, that is what the Judge held and, in upholding that finding, Woo V-P stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âAs the judge found, the respondent did not require the applicant to work in the month of March 2002.  This supports the fact thatthe respondent was not obliged to give the applicant any work, which was inconsistent with an employer/employee relationship.  Onthe other hand, the applicant was not obliged to work for the respondent, especially in view of the evidence that he had work offeredby another company.  The judge considered this lack of obligation on both sides as more consistent with the absence of an employer/employeerelationship.  This view can find support in the majority decision of the Privy Council in <i>The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club</i>.â<a>[32]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  His Lordship had earlier observed in relation to the <i>Golf Club</i> case<a>[33]</a> that âthe lack of mutual obligations between the parties was decisive of the matter in the circumstances of that case.â<a>[34]</a>  Whether Woo V-Pâs approach is supported by the <i>Golf Club</i> case is dealt with separately later. </p>        <p class="heading">E.1  ECO provision for persons whose employment is of a casual nature</p>        <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  As the Judge held and everyone accepted, the appellant had been engaged âon a casual as required basisâ.  It is therefore necessaryto consider the provisions in the ECO dealing with persons casually employed, an exercise which the courts below did not adequatelyundertake.</p>        <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Although the drafting is somewhat convoluted, there is no doubt that the ECO covers most classes of persons in casual employment. This was accepted in <i>Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung</i>.<a>[35]</a>  As we have seen, section 2(1) of the ECO defines an âemployeeâ as a person who works under a contract of service.  It continueswith a proviso which materially states as follows:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âProvided that the following persons are excepted from the definition of âemployeeâ ... (b) any person whose employment is ofa casual nature, and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employerâs trade or business, not being a person employedfor the purposes of any game or recreation and engaged or paid through a club and not being a part-time domestic helper.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The effect of that proviso is to include within the definition of âemployeeâ for ECO purposes, a person working under a contractof service even if his employment is of a casual nature, provided that such casual employment is for the purposes of the employer'strade or business.<a>[36]</a>  It is closely based on s 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906,<a>[37]</a> which was similarly explained by Cozens Hardy MR in <i>Hill v Begg</i>:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIf a man for the purposes of his trade or business employs another, it matters not that the employment is of a casual nature, suchas, for example, that of a dock labourer, and the man so employed is a âworkmanâ within the meaning of the Act.â<a>[38]</a> </p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The ECO provides a mechanism for calculating compensation where an injury is suffered in the course of casual employment.  Compensationis generally calculated by reference to an employeeâs monthly earnings, but obviously, it may be difficult to establish what suchearnings are in the case of a casual employee.  Section 11(2) accordingly provides:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â(2)   Where by reason ... of the casual nature of the employment, ... it is impracticable to compute the rate of remuneration ofsuch employee at the date of the accident, regard may be had to the average monthly amount which, during the 12 months previous tothe accident, was being earned by a person of similar earning capacity in the same grade employed at the same work by the same employer,or, if there is no person so employed, by a person of similar earning capacity in the same grade employed in the same class of employmentand in the same district.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The ECO furthermore recognizes that a casual employee may find work with more than one employer and addresses the calculation ofcompensation in such cases:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âWhere the employee had entered into concurrent contracts of service with 2 or more employers under which he worked at one timefor one such employer and at another time for another such employer, his monthly earnings shall be computed as if his earnings underall such contracts were earnings in the employment of the employer for whom he was working at the time of the accident: [subjectto provisos of no present relevance].â<a>[39]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  These provisions are also modelled on the UKâs Workmenâs Compensation Act 1906.<a>[40]</a>  In the related case-law, casual workers were routinely regarded as covered by the Act notwithstanding that there was obviously nomutual obligation between the employer and such workers for work to be provided or accepted.  Thus, in <i>Perry v Wright</i><a>[41]</a> the successful claimant âhad no regular employment, but worked some days for one firm and some days for another, just as a jobturned upâ.  Similarly, in <i>Cue v Port of London Authority</i><a>[42]</a>it was said of the claimant that: âHe was only employed by the employers when there was a job and a vacancy, and there was no obligationon him to work for them, and no obligation on them to employ him.â  In <i>Manton v Cantwell</i>,<a>[43]</a> Lord Birkenhead LC, stated without qualification: â... if a man be employed for the purposes of the trade or business the employeris liable to him even though the employment be of a casual nature.â</p>        <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  There is similarly nothing in the ECO to suggest that a mutual obligation to supply and take up work must exist before a workerqualifies as an employee.  On the contrary, the Ordinance recognizes that casual work is by its nature irregular, with gaps occurringbetween stints when there is work, and provides a mechanism for determining compensation based on notional monthly earnings usingexternal evidence of comparable remuneration.  It also recognizes that such workers may find stints of work with more than one employer. These are clearly provisions designed to operate where the parties are not mutually obliged to offer and take up work.</p>        <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  These ECO provisions were not drawn to the Judgeâs attention.  This is pointed out by Woo V-P,<a>[44]</a> but his Lordship does not go on to discuss their significance.  Properly understood, such provisions weigh heavily against the suggestionthat absence of a mutual obligation to supply and accept work removes the appellant from the ECOâs ambit.</p>        <p class="heading">E.2  âUmbrella contractsâ and specific engagements </p>        <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  That erroneous view rests on a failure to distinguish between two different types of contract which may arise in the context ofcasual employment. </p>        <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  As and when a particular casual job is offered and accepted, the parties enter into a contract in relation to that engagement. That contract may well be classifiable as a contract of employment on an analysis of the type discussed in section B above.  Plainly,such a contract does not involve any general obligation to provide or accept work.  It comes into existence in relation only to thespecific engagement and normally terminates by performance when the engagement is completed.  It has nothing to do with the mutualobligation under discussion.</p>        <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On the other hand, it is possible (although uncommon) for the parties to enter into an overall contract whereby they <i>do</i> undertake mutual obligations to provide and accept work.  Such a contract has been called an âumbrellaâ or âglobalâ contract,to indicate that it is an over-arching and continuous agreement between the parties, encompassing a series of specific engagementswithin its span.  Where an umbrella contract exists, the question may arise as to whether it is a contract of employment (whetheror not each specific engagement within its ambit gives rise to its own such contract).  Such a question is generally only relevantwhere a person claiming a particular statutory right needs to establish a period of continuous employment by relying on an umbrellacontract and cannot do so merely by showing that he has worked in a series of specific engagements.</p>        <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  An umbrella contract therefore embodies an obligation mutually undertaken by the parties to supply and take up work.  It obviouslyfollows that if no such obligation is undertaken, no umbrella contract comes into existence.  But the fact that there is no umbrellacontract does not prevent the court from finding that the parties have nevertheless entered into a contract of employment each timea specific engagement occurs.  And in the ECO context, such a finding suffices.  Where the employee is injured in an accident arisingout of and in the course of a specific engagement, he is entitled to claim compensation provided that engagement constitutes a contractof employment.</p>        <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The foregoing propositions are well-established on the authorities.  Thus, the potential existence of contracts at two levels whendealing with casual workers was acknowledged in <i>McMeechan v Secretary of State for Employment</i>,<a>[45]</a> where Waite LJ stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âTemporary or casual workers pose a particular problem of their own, in that in their case there will frequently be two engagements(to use a neutral term) which the tribunal may be called upon to analyse. There is the general engagement, on the one hand, underwhich sporadic tasks are performed by the one party at the behest of the other; and the specific engagement on the other hand whichbegins and ends with the performance of any one task. Each engagement is capable, according to its context, of giving rise to a contractof employment.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The possibility of inferring an umbrella contract out of a sustained course of conduct involving a series of specific engagementswas noted in <i>Hellyer Brothers Ltd v McLeod</i><a>[46]</a> by Slade LJ:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âOn the particular facts of such a case it may be open to the industrial tribunal properly to infer from the partiesâ conduct(notwithstanding the absence of any evidence as to any express agreement of this nature) the existence of a continuing overridingarrangement which governed the whole of their relationship and itself amounted to a contract of employment.  Such a contract is frequentlyreferred to as a âglobalâ or âumbrellaâ contract.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p>Such an inference was in fact drawn in <i>Airfix Footwear Ltd v Cope</i>,<a>[47]</a> an occurrence that is likely to be rare.</p>        <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  <i>O'Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc<a>[48]</a></i> illustrates why establishing an umbrella contract may be necessary.  The claimants were seeking to bring claims for unfair dismissalwhich required them to have had 52 weeks of continuous employment working a specified minimum number of hours in each week for thatweek to be counted.  It was not sufficient for them to show that they had worked in a sporadic series of specific engagements.  Additionally,they needed to show that they had been dismissed which posed problems if each specific engagement had been terminated by performancewithout any dismissal.  They were unable to establish a global contract and their claim failed.</p>        <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In <i>Carmichael v National Power plc</i>,<a>[49]</a> Lord Irvine of Lairg LC stressed that the claim by the part-time tour guides for statutory particulars under the Employment ProtectionAct 1978 âwas not advanced on the basis that when they actually worked as guides they did so under successive ad hoc contractsof employment.â  His Lordship observed that âit may well be that, when performing that work, they were being employed. But thatwould not be enough for the applicants. They could succeed only if the 1989 engagement created an employment relationship which subsistedwhen they were not workingâ,<a>[50]</a> that is, if there was an umbrella contract based on an engagement letter of 1989.  The House of Lords held that no umbrella contractand indeed, no contract of any description had come into existence, and their claim therefore failed.</p>        <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  In <i>Clark v Oxfordshire Health Authority</i>,<a>[51]</a> after analysing the authorities, Sir Christopher Slade stated that they: â... require us to hold that some mutuality of obligationis required to found a global contract of employment.  In the present case I can find no such mutuality subsisting during the periodswhen the applicant was not occupied in a âsingle engagementââ.<a>[52]</a>  However, the non-existence of any umbrella contract did not mean that there could be no contract of employment.  The court remittedto the Industrial Tribunal the question of whether âthere existed a specific engagement which amounted to a contract of serviceand could provide the basis for a claim for unfair dismissal.â<a>[53]</a> </p>        <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In his powerful dissent in the <i>Golf Club</i> case, Lord Hoffmann<a>[54]</a> recognized that it may be quite sufficient for certain purposes (including the assertion of rights under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>) to establish a contract of employment based on specific engagements, regardless of the absence of any over-arching global contract. He referred to the golf caddie in question as âa casual employee, in the same way as a casual waitress, gardener or labourer,employed from time to time as and when he presented himself for work and the Club had work to offer.â  His Lordship continued:âfor the purpose of deciding whether he was a casual employee, the fact that neither party was under an obligation to employ orbe employed is of course irrelevant. That is the nature of casual employment.â  The caddieâs statutory entitlements could besecured if the specific engagements when taken together could be deemed to constitute the necessary period of continuous employmentby virtue of Schedule 1 to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/57" class="autolink_findacts">Employment Ordinance</a>.  I respectfully agree with those comments and, for reasons discussed in section E.3 below, consider that nothing said by the majorityin the <i>Golf Club</i> case runs counter to them.</p>        <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The foregoing approach was explained and applied in <i>Wong Man Kwan v Chun Shing Holdings Ltd</i><a>[55]</a> with accuracy and cogency by Deputy High Court Judge Lam (as Lam J then was).</p>        <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  It follows that the absence of a mutual obligation to supply and to take up work, while fatal to the existence of an umbrella contract,is irrelevant to the existence of a contract of employment arising out of a specific engagement.  The courts below fell into errorin holding that the absence of the relevant mutual obligation was inconsistent with an employment relationship without differentiatingbetween these two types of contract.  The appellant was undoubtedly injured while contractually engaged by the respondent to workon the air-conditioner in question.  The material question is whether that contract was a contract of employment, to be answeredby applying the principles discussed in section B above.</p>        <p class="heading">E.3  The Golf Club case</p>        <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Before turning to those principles, it is necessary to refer to <i>Cheng Yuen v The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club</i>.<a>[56]</a>  As noted in section E above, Woo V-P claims support from that decision for his conclusion that absence of the relevant mutual obligationprecludes the existence of any contract of employment.  In his Lordshipâs view, the Privy Council affirmed the Hong Kong Courtof Appealâs decision in that case:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... on the main basis that there was no mutual obligation between the parties.  The club was not obliged to give the caddie anywork or to pay him other than the amount owed by the individual golfer for whom he caddied.  And he was not obliged to work for theclub and he had no obligation to the club to attend in order to act as a caddie for golfers playing on the club premises.â<a>[57]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p>He adds:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... the majority view of the Privy Council was that the lack of mutual obligations between the parties was decisive of the matterin the circumstances of that case.â<a>[58]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  With respect, confusion appears to have crept into the notion of an âabsence of mutual obligationâ in Woo V-Pâs reading ofthe <i>Golf Club</i> case.  It is perfectly true that Lord Slynn of Hadley, giving judgment for the majority, held (among other things) that:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â...The Club was not ... obliged to give him [the caddie] work or to pay him other than the amount owed by the individual golferfor whom he caddied. Conversely he was not obliged to work for the Club and he had no obligation to the Club to attend in order toact as a caddie for golfers playing on the Club premises.â<a>[59]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  However, that was stated in the context of the majority deciding that there was no contract of any sort between the club and thecaddie (as opposed to individual contracts arising between each golfer and the caddie).  Lord Slynn stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIt is to their Lordships clear that the only reasonable view of the facts is that the arrangements between the Club and Mr Chengwent no further than to amount to a licence by the Club to permit Mr Cheng to offer himself as a caddie for individual golfers oncertain terms dictated by the administrative convenience of the Club and its members.â<a>[60]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p>The analysis accepted by the majority (which I respectfully consider somewhat surprising) was that the club merely acted as âanagent collecting the fee and guaranteeing its payment to the caddie.â<a>[61]</a></p>        <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Accordingly, the majority held that there was âno mutual obligationâ between the club and caddie, but only in the sense thatthere was no contract of any sort between them.  They specifically acknowledged that contracts of employment might arise as betweenthe caddie and the individual golfer for each caddying engagement, while rejecting the existence of any such contract as betweenthe caddie and the club.  Thus, Lord Slynn stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThere is no reason why there should not be a separate contract of employment each time Mr Cheng agreed to act as caddie for a particulargolfer and whether that was a contract of service or for the provision of services it is not necessary to decide.â<a>[62]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p>And earlier, his Lordship had stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âMr Cheng was not an employee of the Club whether on a continuing basis or by separate contracts, like a casual worker, each timehe actually worked.â<a>[63]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  It follows that, far from supporting the proposition that absence of the relevant mutual obligation precludes the existence of anycontract of employment, both the majority and Lord Hoffmann in the <i>Golf Club</i> case recognized that notwithstanding such absence, a contract of employment could arise each time a caddying engagement was offeredand accepted.  The majority considered such a possibility  to exist only as between the caddie and the golfer, while Lord Hoffmannâsview was that such contracts arose between the caddie and club on each caddying engagement.</p>        <p class="heading">F.  Was the appellant working under a contract of service with the respondent at the time of the accident?</p>        <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The courts below having misdirected themselves in law, it is open to this Court to undertake for itself classification of the contractunder which the appellant was working at the time of the accident.</p>        <p class="heading">F.1  The indicia of employment</p>        <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  I return later to consider the significance of the MPF arrangements made by the appellant and the Judgeâs concern as to employmentby more than one employer.  Leaving those matters aside, in my view, the only reasonable conclusion to be reached on the undisputedfacts is that, in carrying out the Causeway Bay Plaza I assignment, the appellant was working for the respondent under a contractof service when the accident occurred.</p>        <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The air-conditioning business belonged to the respondent.  The appellantâs venture into an air-conditioning business on his ownaccount had failed some years previously.  The respondent decided which, if any, jobs should be assigned to the appellant and paidhim to do them at the daily rate of $550, plus any overtime.  All the profits and losses of the business were for the respondentâsaccount.  The appellant bore no financial risks and reaped no financial rewards beyond his daily-rated remuneration.  The respondentmanaged the business and hired several other workers, some of whom would sometimes work alongside the appellant on a job.  The appellantpersonally did the work assigned to him.  He did not hire anyone to help.  Travel expenses incurred in the course of the work wereborne by the respondent who sometimes drove the appellant to the work site in his van, particularly where heavy equipment had tobe transported there.  Such equipment was owned by the respondent and not the appellant.  Whenever items had to be purchased by theappellant for work purposes, he was reimbursed by the respondent, even where the amounts were very small.  The appellant was a skilledair-conditioning worker and, like the others who were undoubtedly the respondentâs employees, did not require supervision or controlover the manner of carrying out the work.  So the control test is, in the circumstances, of little relevance.  But the other indiciaall point clearly to an employer-employee relationship entered into for each specific engagement.  The main difference between theappellant and the other workers was that his employment was of a casual nature whereas theirs was permanent and paid on a monthlybasis.</p>        <p class="heading">F.2    The MPF arrangement</p>        <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Is this picture altered by the fact that the appellant made his own arrangements for an MPF scheme as a self-employed person?  Thatfact, the Judge thought, was âa strong indication that there was no employer-employee relationshipâ.  Woo V-P thought it âverysignificantâ.  He referred on the one hand to Lord Denning MRâs observation in <i>Massey v Crown Life Insurance Co</i> that:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">ââ¦if the partiesâ relationship is ambiguous and is capable of being one or the other, then the parties can remove that ambiguity,by the very agreement itself which they make with one another.  The agreement itself then becomes the best material from which togather the true legal relationship between them.â<a>[64]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p>And he cited, on the other hand, <i>Ferguson v Dawson &amp; Partners (Contractors) Ltd</i>,<a>[65]</a> where Megaw LJ stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âMy own view would have been that a declaration by the parties, even if it were incorporated into the contract, that the workmanwas to be, or was to be deemed to be, self-employed, an independent contractor, ought to be wholly disregarded â not merely treatedas not being conclusive â if the remainder of the contractual terms, governing the realities of the relationship, showed the relationshipof employer and employee.  â¦ I find difficulty in accepting that the parties, by a mere expression of intention as to what thelegal relationship should be, can in any way influence the conclusion of law as to what the relationship is.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Woo V-P considered it right to give substantial weight to the appellantâs MPF arrangements in the present case, stating:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âWere the partiesâ intentions not be respected by the courts to hold that there was an employer/employee relationship, there wouldbe serious ramifications.  The employer respondent would then be liable to criminal sanction for failing to take out employeesâcompensation insurance (see section 40 of the Employeesâ Compensation Ordinance) and to join the MPF scheme for the employee applicant.â<a>[66]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p>Given that the appellantâs MPF arrangement was:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... a conscious decision on his part and an agreed arrangement he had made with the respondent, [it ought to] be regarded by thecourt, in Lord Denningâs words, as âthe best material from which to gather the true legal relationship betweenâ the parties. Otherwise, where the parties carried out their activities in accordance with their agreed arrangement, as in the present case, butsuch arrangement was disregarded by the court, a wrong would be done to the respondent which might result in criminal liability beingattached to him.â<a>[67]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Woo V-Pâs concern was therefore that failure to give effect to the partiesâ expressed intention that the appellant should betreated as self-employed (and therefore outside the coverage of the ECO) would unjustly result in the respondent being saddled withunexpected criminal liability for non-compliance with ECO obligations which are owed to employees but not to self-employed persons. This sentiment comes close to suggesting that the parties should be accorded freedom to contract out of the ECO, a proposition whichwould run counter to section 31(1):</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âAny contract or agreement whether made before or after the commencement of this Ordinance, whereby an employee relinquishes anyright to compensation from an employer for personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, shall,subject to subsection (2), be null and void in so far as it purports to remove or reduce the liability of any person to pay compensationunder the provisions of this Ordinance.â<a>[68]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  If, on the facts viewed objectively and applying the indicia of employment discussed above, the person injured is properly to beregarded as an employee, the ECO applies and any agreement seeking to remove that person from its scope is void.  It may be, as LordDenning suggested in the <i>Massey</i> case,<a>[69]</a> that where the relationship is highly ambiguous and it is not at all clear that the injured person is an employee, the partiesâexpress agreement as to the status of that person may be important.  However, if there is objectively an employer-employee relationship,the compulsory statutory duty which the employer bears cannot be overridden by the express stipulation of the parties.  As MegawLJ observed:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe parties cannot transfer a statute-imposed duty of care for safety of workmen from an employer to the workman himself merelybecause the parties agree, in effect, that the workman shall be deemed to be self-employed, where the true essence of the contractis, otherwise, of a contract of service.â<a>[70]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  This was also the approach in <i>Young &amp; Woods Ltd v West</i><a>[71]</a>where the claimant had freely opted for self-employed terms but when dismissed, was allowed to resile from that choice and to suefor unfair dismissal because he had objectively entered into an employment relationship.  Stephenson LJ stressed that it was âthecourtâs duty to see whether the label correctly represents the true relationship between the partiesâ<a>[72]</a> for to do otherwise would be âto presuppose some kind of estoppel against invoking the statute equivalent to, or closely analogousto, a power to contract out of the Act; and to give effect to it would, in my judgment, be plainly wrong.â<a>[73]</a>  And as Sir David Cairns stressed:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â... it is of great importance as a matter of public policy that an employer should not be able to avoid his statutory responsibilitiesas an employer â responsibilities for safety, redundancy payments, compensation for unfair dismissal and other matters â by offeringto those who are, or are about to become, in substance employees a form of contract purporting to put them in another category andoffering tempting fiscal advantages.â<a>[74]</a></p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The Hong Kong Court of Appeal has expressed similar sentiments in <i>Chan Kwok Kin v Mok Kwan Hing</i>,<a>[75]</a> where Clough JA stated:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIt was for the court and not the applicant to evaluate the facts and determine the legal relationship of the applicant to the firstrespondent.  The applicant no doubt knew who he was working for, namely the first respondent, but in all the circumstances we thinkhis classification of their legal relationship and of his legal relationship with Law can have no significant evidential value.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In the present case, the objective facts strongly support the conclusion that the appellant was an employee at the time of the accidentand the fact that he labelled himself a self-employed person for MPF purposes does not change the picture <ins>concerning</ins> <ins>the respondentâs</ins> <ins>liability under the ECO</ins>.<ins>  Lest there be any doubt, I should make it clear that</ins> <ins>this judgment</ins> <ins>is not intended to affect</ins> <ins>the position of</ins> <ins>casual</ins> <ins>employees</ins> <ins>under</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/485" class="autolink_findacts">Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/485">Cap 485</a>)</ins><ins>.

As we have seen, the ECO makes provision for compensation to be payable employees who work onconcurrent contracts of employment<a>[76]</a> and in Workmenâs Compensation cases like <i>Perry v Wright</i><a>[77]</a> referred to in section E.1 above, such a pattern of work has never been treated as a bar to a claim. </p>        <p class="heading">G.
