It happened when the car in which he wastravelling as a passenger was negligently driven onto its incorrect side of the road and collided with an oncoming motor vehicle. He was in the employ of the respondent, designated as commercial director.  The respondent is a Hong Kong company in the Whirlpoolgroup.  This group is centred in the United States, but is also present and active in many other parts of the world.  As the appellantâscontract of employment with the respondent expressly provided, he was âbased in Shanghai â¦ with responsibilities toâ a Mainlandcompany headquartered in Shanghai.  This company is named Whirlpool Narcissus (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (âWNSâ).  It served as the corporatevehicle for a joint venture in the Mainland between the Whirlpool group and a Mainland company named Shanghai Narcissus ElectricAppliances Co. Ltd.</p>    <p>3.   By an express term of the appellantâs contract of employment with the respondent, he was entitled to a car and driver.  Thatimplies, he says, a professional driver or a driver who can be regarded as a reasonably competent driver even though not a professionalone.  He also relies on the common law rule that employers are duty-bound to take reasonable care for their employeesâ safety. This duty (as was pointed out in the Court of Appeal in England by Lord Greene MR in <i>Davidson v. Handley Page Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1945%5d%201%20All%20ER%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1945] 1 All ER 235</a> at p.237G-H) is not confined to the time when employees are performing âthe precise actsâ that they are employed to perform. It âextends to cover all such acts as are normally and reasonably incidental to [an employeeâs] dayâs workâ.  The standardof care demanded is (as we said in <i>Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd v. Wong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282006%29%209%20HKCFAR%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2006) 9 HKCFAR 371</a> at p.376 F-G) ânaturally a high one since personal safety is at stakeâ.  As for the content of the duty, it is of course a singleduty on the part of employers to take reasonable care for their employeesâ safety.  But it is (as we said in the <i>Cathay Pacific</i> case at p.382 H-J) conveniently thought of âas involving the provision of safe co-workers, a safe place of work, safe equipment,a safe system of work, proper instructions and supervision and (where called for) adequate training.â  The duty is non-delegablein that the employer remains responsible for the performance of the duty even if he has delegated its performance.</p>    <p>4.  When in Shanghai where he was normally based, the appellant was driven by a full-time driver in a company car.  At the time ofthe accident, he was being driven from Beijing airport to a nearby resort for the purpose of attending a sales conference there organisedby WNS.  The car in which he was being driven to the resort had been hired for that purpose by WNS through its Beijing office.  Andthe driver was Mr Zheng Guo Bin, a person employed by WNS at that office as a technical administration representative in the servicesection of the commercial department.  Mr Zheng held a driving licence which he first obtained on 14 February 1996.  But he was nota professional driver.  What is known about him as a driver comes from a statement of his which the appellant adduced in evidenceat the trial.  In that statement Mr Zheng says this about himself : âI am the most senior licensed driver in the Beijing regionand had no accident record, and I was always the person to pick up senior officers when they came to Beijing in the past.â</p>    <p>5.  It is common ground between the appellant and the respondent that this accident was due to Mr Zhengâs negligence.  Two claimswere brought by the appellant against the respondent in respect of this accident.  His first claim was one commenced in the DistrictCourt against the respondent for employeesâ compensation.  It was compromised by way of a consent judgment for employeesâ compensationin the sum of $2,294,015.75.  Then the appellant commenced a claim in the High Court against the respondent for damages for breachof contract and in the tort of negligence.  The writ was of course served on the respondent in Hong Kong.  And it has never beensuggested that the law applicable in Beijing was such as to leave the double actionability rule unsatisfied in the present case. Out of this High Court claim has arisen the present appeal.  It comes to us from the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Cheung andTang JJA and Barma J) affirming the judgment of the High Court (Suffiad J) dismissing the appellantâs claim in a trial as to liabilityonly. </p>    <p>6.  Strictly speaking, three bases have been put forward on the appellantâs behalf as ones on which he can hold the respondent responsiblefor this mishap.  Of these three bases, the first is employersâ common law duty of care.  The second is contractual liability despitedelegation of performance.  And the third is vicarious liability.  As the appellantâs case was presented, there is no practicaldistinction between the first two bases.  Both boil down to the appellantâs contention that he was entitled to a professional driveror a driver who can be regarded as a reasonably competent driver even though not a professional one.</p>    <p class="heading">Reasons why the courts below decided against the appellant</p>    <p>7.  At first instance Suffiad J found as a fact that Mr Zheng was a reasonably competent driver, saying this :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the evidence is to the effect that [Mr Zheng] had held a valid driving licence in [the Mainland] for some two years beforethe accident and during this period, he had never been involved in a traffic accident.  There is also evidence that [Mr Zheng] hadalways been the person chosen to drive executives of [WNS] when they were on business in Beijing.  That fact alone that [Mr Zheng]holds a valid driving license in [the Mainland], in my view, makes him a reasonably competent driver.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Suffiad J then referred to âall other circumstancesâ.</p>    <p>8.   I pause to mention the case of <i>Sweeney v. Kennedy</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%2048%20Lloyds%20Rep%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 48 Ll LR 294</a> (decided by the Divisional Court of the High Court of Eire).  The respondent cites what Kingsmill Moore J said at p.297 for the propositionthat anyone who has a driverâs licence is deemed to be reasonably competent to drive.  What that case decided is that where a proposalform contained an accurate statement that none of the assuredâs drivers were under the age of 21, the insurance policy issued pursuantto that proposal was not avoided by the subsequent employment of a driver under the age of 21.  And what Kingsmill Moore J actuallysaid at p.297 as to competency is this : âThe law provides that licences to drive motor vehicles may be given to persons of specifiedages, the ages varying with the class of the vehicle; and when a person is driving a vehicle of the category which by his age heis entitled to drive, there is, I think, some presumption that, as far as age reflects on competency, he is competent to drive it.â In his book <i>Negligence on the Highway</i>, 4th ed. (1962) at p.336 Dr O C Mazengarb QC (an experienced practitioner as well as the writer of a textbook much used by practitioners)observes that âit does not follow that everyone possessed of a licence to drive, issued after an examination and test, has theskill and ability to driveâ.  It is important to note therefore that Suffiad J did not actually confine himself to the fact ofMr Zheng having held a driving licence.</p>    <p>9.   The Court of Appeal affirmed Suffiad Jâs finding that Mr Zheng was a reasonably competent driver.  Cheung JA (with whose judgmentthe other members of the Court of Appeal agreed) said this :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn this case the evidence showed that [Mr Zheng] was a Beijing resident and had a driving licence for two years.  During this periodhe had never been involved in a traffic accident.  [Mr Zheng] had always been the person chosen to drive executives of [WNS] whenthey were on business in Beijing.  In my view [WNS] had properly discharged this duty when it chose [Mr Zheng] to be driver.  Theavailable evidence showed that he was a reasonably competent driver to be given the task by [WNS] to transport [the appellant].â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>10.   On vicarious liability, the appellant has pleaded that Mr Zheng âwas at all material times an employee or agent of the respondentalternatively an employee ofâ WNS, âthe agent ofâ the respondent.  This âchain of agencyâ averment of vicarious liabilitywas rejected by the courts below. </p>    <p class="heading">Respondentâs stance</p>    <p>11.   The respondent asks that the result reached by the courts below be affirmed.  It is said in terms in the respondentâs printedcase that its âsubmissions are in substance the same as the reasoning to be found inâ Cheung JAâs judgment. </p>    <p>12.   In addition to supporting the Court of Appealâs reasons, the respondent contests this appeal by way of two special objections. The first special objection consists of the respondentâs contention that the appellant is asking this Court to review concurrentfindings of fact in the absence of any circumstances that would warrant such an exercise.  And the second special objection consistsof the respondentâs contention that the appellantâs arguments before us are new ones which are either absolutely barred by thestate of the evidence or at least incapable of surmounting the hurdle of not having been raised on intermediate appeal.</p>    <p>13.   Save that unfamiliarity with local conditions will never be a factor, this Courtâs practice in regard to concurrent findingsof fact is (as we said in <i>Sky Heart Ltd v. Lee Hysan Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d98%29%201%20HKCFAR%20318" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-98) 1 HKCFAR 318</a> at pp 333F-333B) the same as that of the Privy Council (as explained by their Lordships in <i>Devi v. Roy</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1946%5d%20AC%20508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1946] AC 508</a> at p.521-522).  So this Court will not review concurrent findings of fact save in rare and exceptional circumstances.  Such circumstancesarose, for example, in regard to the concurrent finding of dishonesty which was reviewed and reversed in <i>Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Brothers</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%203%20HKCFAR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2000) 3 HKCFAR 70</a> at pp 90G-93C. </p>    <p>14.   As to new points, this Courtâs approach appears from our decisions in <i>Wong Tak Yue v. Kung Kwok Wai (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d98%29%201%20HKCFAR%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-98) 1 HKCFAR 55</a> and <i>Flywin Co. Ltd v. Strong &amp; Associates Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 356.</a>  It was held in the <i>Flywin</i> case at p.369B-J as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   Where a party has omitted to take a point at the trial and then seeks to raise that point on appeal, he will be barred fromdoing so unless there is no reasonable possibility that the state of the evidence relevant to the point would have been materiallymore favourable to the other side if the point had been taken at the trial.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)   Even where a new point is not barred on that basis, the circumstances must be very exceptional before this Court will entertaina point not taken on intermediate appeal, especially if entertaining and accepting it would constitute a major development of thelaw.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Employersâ duty of care/contractual liability</p>    <p>15.   Whatever else employersâ common law duty of care and contractual liability despite delegation of performance involves in acase like the present, the appellant cannot succeed under either of these two bases of liability or both of them combined unlesshe can persuade us to reverse the concurrent findings of the courts below that Mr Zheng was a reasonably competent driver.  Aftergiving the matter anxious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that there are no circumstances that would justify us in theexceptional course of disturbing those concurrent findings.  It is true that there is no evidence as to when Mr Zheng joined WNS,how long he had driven executives on his behalf or how often he did so.  But the main thrust of the appellantâs case in the courtsbelow in regard to the sort of driver required was that a professional one was required.  That was the focus below, most significantlyat the trial.  Otherwise there might have been more evidence about Mr Zhengâs activities as a driver. </p>    <p class="heading">Vicarious liability</p>    <p>16.   On appeal to us, the main thrust of the argument for the appellant on vicarious liability was not the âchain of agencyâargument advanced on his behalf in the courts below.  Instead it was in effect an argument on what is sometimes described as âenterpriseliabilityâ, and runs along the following lines :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   Both the respondent and WNS were throughout engaged together in the enterprise of furthering the overall interests of the samegroup of companies.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)   The appellant and Mr Zheng were co-workers at the time of the accident in the sense that they were working together within thatgroup, one going to a sales conference and the other driving him to that conference.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)   So Mr Zheng was no less a representative of the relevant enterprise than the bicycle courier paid per delivery in <i>Hollis v. Vabu Pty Ltd</i>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282001%29%20207%20CLR%2021" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2001) 207 CLR 21</a> (decided by the High Court of Australia).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)   As to the decision of the High Court of Australia in <i>Sweeney v. Boylan Nominees Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282006%29%20226%20CLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2006) 226 CLR 161</a>, the position regarding an employed person like Mr Zheng in these circumstances is not to be equated with the position regardinga person in business on his own account like the mechanic in that case in those circumstances.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)   WNS and by extension Mr Zheng were agents for the respondent in performing for it the legal obligation which it owed to theappellant to provide him with transportation by car and driver.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(f)   Decisions like that of the High Court of Australia in <i>Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society v. Producers and Citizens Co-operative Assurance Co. of Australia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%2046%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 46 CLR 41</a> and of the Queenâs Bench Division in <i>Nottingham v. Aldridge</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%202%20QB%20739" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 2 QB 739</a> show that such agency suffices for vicarious liability even in the absence of âcontrolled employmentâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(g)   But such control, if necessary, is in any event to be found in the control exercised at the holding company level over all subsidiarycompanies within the Whirlpool group.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(h)   There was sufficient proximity between all concerned, and sufficient close connection between all the matters concerned, forthe purposes of vicarious liability.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   In the circumstances, it is legally sound and neither unfair nor unduly burdensome that the respondent be held vicariously liableto the appellant for Mr Zhengâs negligent driving.  Accordingly that is the just course.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>17.   The two problems which the appellant faces on the foregoing argument as to vicarious liability are these.  First of all, itcannot be said that there is no reasonable possibility that the state of the evidence relevant to the point would have been materiallymore favourable to the other side if the point had been taken at the trial.   Secondly, entertaining that point would certainly involveentertaining a point which was not taken in the courts below but which, if accepted, would constitute a major development in thelaw. </p>    <p>18.   For those reasons, I do not think that the appellant can in the circumstances succeed on vicarious liability.  I say nothingon how the law of vicarious liability may develop in future.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p>19.   The appellant has recovered employeesâ compensation.  Hopefully he will find some solace in that.  I can find no basis onwhich to enable him to recover more.  In the result, I would dismiss the appeal with costs and make an order for legal aid taxationof the appellantâs own costs.  It is common ground that costs should be dealt with that way if, as it has turned out, the appealis dismissed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Mr Justice Chan PJ :</b></p>    <p>20.
