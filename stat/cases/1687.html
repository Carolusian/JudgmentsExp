The Plaintiff was a carpenteraged 36 at the time of the accident. The accident occurred while he and another worker were removing a wooden work-table from theBanquet Hall on the first floor to the Coffee Shop on the ground floor of the Regal Airport Hotel, where decoration works were beingcarried out. He fell and hurt his back as he was descending a marble staircase leading to the ground floor. There is no dispute thatthe 3rd Defendant was the principal contractor of the hotel where the accident took place and that the 2nd Defendant was its nominatedsub-contractor. The 1st Defendant's defence is that he was a co-worker of the Plaintiff and both of them were under the employmentof the 2nd Defendant. The 2nd Defendant's case is that the Plaintiff was not its employee but an employee of its sub-contractor,namely, the 1st Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The issues to be determined in this case are: (1) who was the Plaintiff's employer; (2) how the accident occurred; (3) whether itoccurred as a result of any breach of the employer's duty to provide a safe system of work or of statutory duty; (4) whether the3rd Defendant was in breach of its duty of care under the common law and under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a> and regulation 38A(2) of the Construction Site (Safety) Regulation, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap 59</a>; (5) whether the Plaintiff was contributory negligent;and (6) the quantum of damages.</p>    <p class="heading">THE IDENTITY OF THE PLAINTIFF'S EMPLOYER</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiff first came to know the 1st Defendant as a co-worker of a contractor in 1996. Towards the end of 1997, the 1st Defendantrecruited him to work together in the 2nd Defendant's construction site. There is no dispute that on that occasion, the 1st Defendantwas a co-worker and recruited the Plaintiff, in the capacity of an agent, commonly called a "snake head", for and on behalf of the2nd Defendant. In November 1998, the 1st Defendant told the Plaintiff that a site in Chek Lap Kok was recruiting workers and invitedhim to join. The 1st Defendant did not say who the employer was. When the Plaintiff started working, he saw the foreman of the 2ndDefendant, Fong Kwan Hop, whom he met before. Thence, he knew the site was under the control of the 2nd Defendant. The 1st Defendantgave him a work-permit issued by the 3rd Defendant with a code "SK", identifying him as an employee of the 2nd Defendant workingfor the 3rd Defendant. On the day of the accident, Fong instructed the 1st Defendant who in turn told the Plaintiff to remove a woodenwork-table from the Banquet Hall to the Coffee Shop. After the accident, the Plaintiff presented his sick leave certificates to the1st Defendant who told him to give them to the 2nd Defendant and took him to the office of the 2nd Defendant for that purpose. The1st Defendant told the Plaintiff to go after the 2nd Defendant for compensation and not him.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The 1st Defendant's case is that he began working for the 2nd Defendant as a sub-contractor in June 1998 and the works under thesub-contract were completed in mid November 1998. The 2nd Defendant then invited him to find a few temporary workers for doing modificationwork and repairs on the works which had been completed and for clearing up the sites. Hence, he worked as a "snake head" and recruitedthe Plaintiff and two other workers to work for the 2nd Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> According to the 2nd Defendant, the 1st Defendant had been his sub-contractor in a site in Taipo in 1997. Towards the end of 1997,he sub-contracted the decoration works in respect of the Regal Airport Hotel from the 3rd Defendant for about $11 million and hesub-sub-contracted all carpentry works to the 1st Defendant for about $3 million, inclusive of materials and labour. He producedpayment records signed and acknowledged by the 1st Defendant in respect of works in Siu Sai Wan, Taipo and the Regal Airport Hotel.He produced photocopies of crossed cheques made payable to the 1st Defendant which corresponded with those payment records. The chequeswere for substantial and sometimes round sums. It is extremely unlikely that these were payments to a "snake head" for distributionto workers recruited by the "snake head". These payments covered a period from September 1997 to March 1999. There are also invoicesissued by the 1st Defendant covering period up to February 1999. All these contemporaneous documents support the 2nd Defendant'scase that the 1st Defendant was his sub-contractor at the time of the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The 2nd Defendant's director, Mak Sang Kay, said a few days after the accident, the 1st Defendant together with the Plaintiff wentto his office and asked if the 2nd Defendant could claim compensation for the Plaintiff as the 1st Defendant had not taken out anyinsurance policy for his workers. This was denied by the 1st Defendant, while the Plaintiff's evidence was that he could not recallsuch conversation. Mak agreed to the 1st Defendant's request and referred the claim to his insurance agent, AIU. As a result, a completedform ("Form 2") signed by Mak on behalf of the 2nd Defendant reporting the accident and admitting to be the Plaintiff's employerwas filed with the Labour Department.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> After about two years, the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and another sub-contractor went to the 2nd Defendant's office and told Makthat the insurance company refused to pay compensation to the Plaintiff. After some negotiation, they entered into a tripartite writtenagreement in which the 1st Defendant acknowledged he was a sub-contractor of the 2nd Defendant and the Plaintiff undertook not toclaim compensation from the 2nd Defendant until the compensation has been paid over by the insurance company. The 1st Defendant admittedknowing the contents of the agreement and that the Plaintiff had told him to think carefully before signing. He explained that hewas not the 2nd Defendant's sub-contractor but he signed the agreement in order that the Plaintiff may obtain compensation. It isdifficult to see how that acknowledgement could help the Plaintiff. At the time, the 2nd Defendant must have known that the insurancecompany had declined liability as the 2nd Defendant's insurance policy did not cover injuries suffered by employees of its sub-contractors.Obviously, the 1st Defendant was tricked by Mak into signing this agreement as evidence that the 1st Defendant was the Plaintiff'semployer and not the 2nd Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> I find the 1st Defendant's evidence utterly incredible. It is contradicted by the invoices and payment records which show clearlythat the works he sub-contracted were still progressing even as late as early 1999. His evidence that he had completed his sub-contractin mid November 1998 could not be believed. His evidence is also contradicted by the Plaintiff who said that there were more than10 workers working in the Business Centre, the Banquet Hall and the Coffee Shop for which the 1st Defendant was responsible. Thusthe 1st Defendant's evidence that he was employed by the 2nd Defendant as a "snake head" with three other workers doing modificationand repair work is incredible. Even though I find Mak dishonest in colluding with the 1st Defendant in attempting to deceive theinsurance company into paying compensation for an uncovered risk, I am satisfied on the totality of evidence that the Plaintiff wasan employee of the 1st Defendant who in turn was a sub-contractor of the 2nd Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">HOW THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The 3rd Defendant disputed that the accident had occurred. Its foreman, Ng Kwok Sun, responsible for marble work in the ground tosecond floors, testified that he was not aware of any accident on 4 December 1998 and if an accident had occurred he would have beennotified. The 3rd Defendant's safety officer, Leung Ting Man, also confirmed that no report of any accident involving the Plaintiffhad been received, though a few days later, the 2nd Defendant's foreman, Fong Kwan Hop told him about the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> According to the 1st Defendant, he was informed of the accident while he was working in the Coffee Shop on the ground floor. He wentto the staircase and saw the Plaintiff sitting on the floor. Similarly, Fong said he was informed of the accident by a foreman ofthe 3rd Defendant. He went to the scene and saw the Plaintiff sitting on the floor. Someone called for the ambulance and the Plaintiffwas taken to hospital. I do not think on the basis of such evidence, it could hardly be disputed that the accident had occurred.Unless there was a conspiracy among the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and Fong to defraud the insurers, there is no reason why the1st Defendant and Fong would have so testified. The 1st and 2nd Defendants might stand the risk of having to indemnify the 3rd Defendantor the insurers in respect of any compensation paid to the Plaintiff. On the other hand, there were a number of foremen responsiblefor various trades, including in particular carpentry work, who could have been aware of the accident, informed Fong and called forthe ambulance without informing Ng or Leung. Despite I have certain doubts about the credibility of the Plaintiff, I am satisfiedthat an accident had occurred. The question is how.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The Plaintiff said that the marble staircase where the accident occurred was covered by wooden plywood boards as a form of protectionfor the marble surface. When he stepped onto the step, the plywood board skidded and came off. As a result, he lost balance and fell.His waist and back landed on the staircase first and he skidded for four to five steps, causing injuries to his waist and back.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Despite some misunderstanding by the 3rd Defendant as to on which staircase the accident occurred, it is the 3rd Defendant's casethat all staircases paved with marble were covered by plywood boards as a means of protection for the marble surface and as an anti-skidmeasure for people walking on the staircase. The steps were first covered by bubble plastic sheets of two feet in width and affixedto the marble surface by adhesive tape running diagonally and from one side to the other. The plastic sheet provided traction tothe interface between the plastic sheet and the marble below and between the plastic sheet and the plywood above. The plywood waseight feet long and the steps were more than ten feet in length. Thus two plywood boards making up the total length of the step wereplaced on the step and affixed to plastic sheets by adhesive tapes. One end of the tape was affixed to the adjacent wall on one side,while the other end was affixed to the plastic sheet not covered by the length of the plywood board. A second piece of board of appropriatesize was used to pave the uncovered area of the step and secured by adhesive tape affixed to the adjacent wall and the other pieceof plywood board. The horizontally placed board and the vertically placed board were affixed together by adhesive tape running alongthe entire edge where they met. The boards were further secured by two adhesive tapes running, one on each side of the staircase,all the way from the top step to the bottom step of the staircase. After the staircase had been covered up, it was checked by Ngto make sure that the boards were properly secured and safe to walk on before others were allowed to walk on the staircase. Ng wasin charge of marble work from the ground to the second floors and had to walk on the staircases on numerous occasions everyday. Wheneverhe discovered any adhesive tape had been worn out or plywood boards were loosen, he would arrange for them to be fixed. In the opinionof Leung, the safety officer of the 3rd Defendant, such measures were appropriate and widely adopted in the trade as a safety measurefor workers and protection for marble staircase. Leung also inspected and walked on the staircases everyday. He was satisfied thatthe plywood cover was secure and the staircase was safe to walk on.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> It is unfortunate that there was no inquiry by the Labour Department. The other witnesses who were present at the scene immediatelyafter the accident were unhelpful. They confirmed that the staircase was covered by plywood and did not notice anything unusual.In fact, none of them had directed their attention to the condition of the plywood covering on the staircase. I place no weight ontheir evidence as to the condition of the staircase. On the other hand, neither Ng nor Leung were informed of the accident at thetime and they could not offer any evidence as to the condition of the plywood covering shortly after the accident. I am thus leftwith the Plaintiff's evidence that the plywood covering was insecure and the total lack of supporting evidence on the one hand, andthe 3rd Defendant's evidence that the plywood covering was reasonably secured on the other. So the Plaintiff's case stands or fallson his evidence and his credibility.</p>    <p class="heading">Credibility of the Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The Plaintiff has impressed me as being an unreliable and exaggerating witness. Upon admission to Princess Margaret Hospital afterthe accident, he told the doctor that he slipped and fell with his buttock landing on the ground while lifting heavy object and complainedof low back pain and left buttock pain. The Plaintiff's account to the doctor is utterly inconsistent with his evidence in court.What he said in court was that he fell on the staircase with his waist and back landing, instead of the buttock, on the staircasefirst and then skidded for four to five steps causing injuries to his waist and back. With his back hitting the staircase and skiddingfor four to five steps, one would expect some redness or abrasion on his back; but there was no such finding by the doctor and nosuch account given to the doctor as well. The doctor's examination merely revealed tenderness over the Plaintiff's lower back andleft buttock with restricted movement of the back. The doctor found no neurological deficit. The X-ray of the spine and pelvis wasnormal. While some allowance must be given to a patient in distress, the discrepancies are so great and his evidence in court isso unsupported by the doctor's finding that these suggest his evidence in court is an exaggeration not to be believed.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Thereafter, the Plaintiff repeatedly complained of low back pain. On 4 January 1999, he was admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole EasternHospital ("PYNEH") for pain at the level of the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae (L3/L4) and sciatica. But radiological examinationshowed a perfectly normal spine, though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a postero-lateral disc protrusion at L4/L5 vertebraldisc with no compression on the nerve roots or cauda equina. It was highly unlikely that the doctor would have misidentified L4/L5for L3/L4 and in any event, the disc protrusion at L4/L5 has not caused any compression on the nerve roots as to give rise to anypain. His complaint of pain at L3/L4 is not supported by any medical evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> But just two months before the accident, the Plaintiff attended PYNEH and complained of on and off back pain for one year and backand left leg pain for three days. Medical examination revealed essentially normal finding. The Plaintiff explained that he had noback pain before the accident. He said his father died of liver cancer and he was worried that he might develop a similar conditionso in order to obtain a thorough examination for himself he made a false complaint to the doctor. I find this explanation incredible.Firstly, on his own evidence, after his father's death, he had been called to attend an examination in Prince of Wales Hospital inconnection with his father's disease. So the Hospital Authority had taken the initiative to check out his liver condition and therewas no need for another check by PYNEH. Secondly, during the examination in PYNEH, he refused treatment but insisted on a referralto the orthopaedic clinic. Indeed the parties common expert, Dr Lau Hoi Kuen, opined that the degeneration of the Plaintiff's spineand mild protrusion of the L4/L5 disc took a long time to develop and should have existed before the accident. Hence, the Plaintiffwas symptomatic before the accident on 4 December 1998. Clearly, his visit to PYNEH on 3 October 1998 was out of concern for hisorthopaedic problem than his liver problem. He was aware of the problem of his back before the accident. His explanation in courtwas just to cover up his already existing orthopaedic problem which he dishonestly attributed to the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> During the examination by Dr Lau Hoi Kuen, the Plaintiff demonstrated severe limitation of the straight leg raising of both legs,severe motor weakness and severe sensory deficit of both lower limbs. But when tested in the supine position without the Plaintiff'snotice, Dr Lau found that his severe limited straight leg raising improved dramatically. Dr Lau concluded that he was exaggeratinghis symptoms and that the extensive motor and sensory deficit of his legs does not fit in with the anatomical arrangement of thenerves in the lumbar region of the spine. I do not think Dr Lau's evidence could be doubted. The Plaintiff is an exaggerating witness.His evidence has to be taken with the greatest caution.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The Plaintiff complained of severe pain during the early stage of his recovery. At present, he complained of weakness of his waistand back and stiffness and numbness of his left leg. He complained of severe pain after standing or walking for more than 10 to 15minutes and he had to do forward bending exercise to relieve his spine. However, a surveillance video tape taken by the 3rd Defendant'sdetective in May 2002 showed that the Plaintiff conducted his activities in a normal manner. He was seen carrying two large and bulkyschoolbags, one on each side of his shoulders when he escorted his two children to and from school. He exhibited no difficultiesduring the journeys which lasted 10 to 30 minutes, though on one occasion he was seen performing a bending exercise for less thanone minute. He walked with a normal gait which suggests he was not having the discomfort or weakness or pain he described in court.He stood up every now and then in court to do exercise at irregular intervals. Dr Lau's opinion is that in the average cases withsuch back sprain, symptoms should subside within a few months, certainly not more than a year. It is now four and half years afterthe accident, yet the Plaintiff still complained he was unable to return to work. I think he was only exaggerating his condition.I think his bending exercises in court are also exaggerations.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> I find the Plaintiff a very exaggerating witness. His account of the accident given to the doctor in Princess Margaret Hospital isinconsistent with his evidence in court. He was exaggerating the seriousness of the accident when saying that his back hit the staircaseand he skid four to five steps. His complaint of pain at L3/L4 is inconsistent with objective medical evidence. He attempted to deceiveDr Lau Hoi Kuen by exaggerating the extensive motor and sensory deficit of his legs. He concealed his pre-existing low back problemand dishonestly attributed it to the accident. I find the Plaintiff an unreliable witness who has the propensity of exaggeratingin order to achieve his own ends. I cannot be sure if he was not exaggerating when he said he fell because the plywood board coveringthe staircase came off. If the accident was indeed caused by the loosen plywood board, it would be strange that he did not make animmediate complaint to the 1st Defendant or Fong.</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiff failed to discharge burden of proof</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> On the evidence of Ng and Leung, I am satisfied that the 3rd Defendant had in place a system for covering up the marble staircasesand for checking if the plywood cover was secure and safe to walk on. I am satisfied that the plywood boards were reasonably securedfor the purpose. Ng and Leung inspected the staircases every day. Ng, in particular, was the foreman in charge of marble works andresponsible for the ground to the second floors. He walked those staircases many times during the day. Whenever he noticed any wornout adhesive tapes and plastic sheets he ordered them to be replaced and made sure that the boards were secure. Mr Shum, for thePlaintiff, suggested that there were other means of securing the plywood boards. I do not have to consider them here, as the issueat this stage is whether the accident occurred in the way the Plaintiff described and not whether the measures taken by the 3rd Defendantwere adequate.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Though there is no evidence from any of the Defendants to rebut the Plaintiff's account as to how the accident occurred, the burdenof proving how it occurred rests on the shoulders of the Plaintiff. Given the very unfavourable view I formed of the Plaintiff'scredibility on the one hand, and the very credible evidence of Ng and Leung as to how the plywood boards were secured and the systemin checking the plywood cover on the other, I find it was unlikely that the board had come off as alleged by the Plaintiff. The boardswere secured by strong adhesive tapes to the side wall, to the plastic sheets below and along the edge with one another. It was difficultif not practically impossible for any piece to come loose by walking on it, unless those who installed the boards did not do so properly.As against that likelihood was the evidence of Ng and Leung who inspected the staircases and walked on them many times every day.I cannot be satisfied even on a balance of probability that the accident occurred because one of the plywood boards came off as thePlaintiff described. This is not a case where the doctrine <em>res ipsa loquitur</em> can assist the Plaintiff as the accident was the Plaintiff's slipping and falling which could be caused by a multiplicity of reasonsin isolation or in combination, including the Plaintiff's own carelessness in not watching where he was going, the existing weaknessof his back, his failure to cope with the speed of his co-worker while descending the staircase, the presence of loose materials,such as sand or newspaper and other debris or as the Plaintiff alleged, the loosen plywood board. This is not the classic case ofan object falling from height and the plaintiff did not know how that occurred but in normal course of event it would not have occurredhad it not been for negligence of the party responsible for the object. If I were satisfied that the plywood board was not properlysecured and came off when the Plaintiff stepped on it, then the irresistible inference is that those who covered up the staircasehad not exercised proper care and skill and the 3rd Defendant might be vicariously liable for their negligence. But even then, themaxim <em>res ipsa loquitur</em> does not apply as the cause of the accident was ascertained. Suffice it to say, the Plaintiff bears the burden of proving how theaccident occurred and unfortunately he has failed to discharge that burden. This must necessarily mean that he failed to dischargethe burden of proving breach of duty on the part of any of the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The above is sufficient to dispose of the matters before me, but for the sake of completeness, and in the event of an appeal, I shallalso consider the questions of contributory negligence, quantum of damages which I would have awarded if I had found any of the Defendantsliable and apportionment as between the three Defendants. This would necessitate a consideration whether the measures taken by the3rd Defendant in covering the marble staircase were sufficient in discharging its duty of care owed to its visitors at common lawand under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap 314</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 38A(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap 59</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">3RD DEFENDANT'S LIABILITY AS OCCUPIER AND PRINCIPAL CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SITE</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The 3rd Defendant's duty under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> and the common law was a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances was reasonable to see that the visitor would be reasonablysafe in using the premises for the purposes for which he was invited or permitted to be there. At the same time, as the principalcontractor responsible for the construction site, he was under a statutory duty to ensure so far as was reasonably practicable suitableand adequate safe access to and egress from every place of work on the site is provided and properly maintained. The 3rd Defendant'sduty as an occupier must be wider than the statutory duty under Regulation 38A of the Construction Site (Safety) Regulations as theformer covers all aspects of the premises the visitor was invited or permitted to be on while the latter covered only access to andegress from place of work on the site. So far as the staircase was concerned, the duty under Regulation 38A must be more onerousthan its duty as an occupier. The duty to do what was reasonably practicable must be a more onerous duty than taking reasonable carein all the circumstances.

Moreover, this computation falls to be made by the ownerat a point of time anterior to the accident.

The duty is to ensure suitable and adequate safe access andegress so far as is reasonably practicable. To determine whether a contractor responsible for the site has discharged its obligationunder regulation 38A(2), two questions have to be asked: (1) whether the measures adopted by the contractor were suitable and adequateand (2) whether there were no other reasonably practicable, suitable and adequate measures which the contractor could have been adopted.What is suitable and adequate depends on all the surrounding circumstances of the construction site. What is reasonably practicableinvolves the balancing of risk on the one hand against the costs and inconvenience in providing the measures necessary for avertingthe risk on the other.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> While public policy would impose on the employer an obligation to ensure that his employees work under as safe an environment aspossible, and on an occupier of premises to ensure that it is reasonably safe for his visitors, one cannot lose sight of the realityof the conditions in a construction site, the contractor's usual obligation to progress with works diligently and in accordance withprogramme and the fact that those who work there must be aware of the inherent danger of working in a construction site. By this,I do not mean the contractor responsible for the construction site may be at liberty to cut corners and sacrifice safety for costand progress of work because there should be no compromise when human lives may be at stake. But the very much higher standard ofcare required to ensure, for instance, the safety of the general public walking in a busy MTR station undergoing renovation workmay not be applicable to workers working in a construction site because the danger is not an usual one which the general public wouldbe alert to and the risk of accident is high due to the volume of traffic.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The staircase where the accident occurred was covered by plywood boards in the manner as I have described above. The purpose of installingthe boards was to protect the marble surface from damage and as a safety measure because the marble surface would be slippery ifwater was spilled on it or if people walk on it wearing wet shoes. In my view, covering the marble steps was a necessity and theway the steps were covered with bubble plastic sheets and then plywood board was reasonably safe and secure for people to walk on,even if they were carrying heavy objects. The measure adopted by the 3rd Defendant were suitable and adequate.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> There were other measures, as suggested by Mr Shum, which could have made the plywood board more secure. For example, thicker woodenboards could have been used so that the vertical and horizontal boards could be fixed together by nails. Alternatively, a tooth shapedwooden plank cut into the shape of the steps and nailed to the adjacent walls could be used to keep the plywood boards in position.Mr Leung considered these not reasonably practicable. The use of nails might damage the marble surface and even worse would be apotential danger if the nails exited through the boards or otherwise became exposed. The tooth shaped wooden plank method could notbe used because the adjacent walls would have to be marbled as well and glass panels would be installed by the wall for aestheticpurpose. If the planks were not to be nailed to the marble, they would have to be secured one metre away from the wall leaving littleroom in the staircase for people to walk on resulting in a even greater hazard than the danger they were intended to prevent. Notonly were these measures unsuitable, they were very costly in terms of materials and workmanship. In terms of costs, they were outof proportion with the risk, especially in view of the availability of the equally, if not more, effective measures of using plywood.In my view, these alternative measures were neither suitable nor reasonably practicable.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> There were many other alternatives that could be considered, including leaving the side wall to be marbled after all works had beencompleted or closing the staircase to any traffic altogether. Such measures were impracticable and would delay the progress of work.Workers in a construction site are aware of the inherent danger of their employment. They are expected to be alert to usual dangers.The risk of the plywood boards secured in the manner as adopted by the 3rd Defendant coming loose was very low but the costs andimpracticality of alternative measures were out of proportion with the risk.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> In my view, the measures adopted by the 3rd Defendant was suitable and adequate and there were no other reasonably practicable measureswhich were suitable and adequate and which the 3rd Defendant could have adopted. I am satisfied that the precautions taken by the3rd Defendant were sufficient to discharge its duty under both the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I/s38a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 38A(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a> and under the common law. This conclusion is premised on my finding that the Plaintiff was unable to discharge the burden of provingthat the accident occurred as a result of the plywood board coming loose. If on the facts I were satisfied that the accident wasindeed caused in the way as described by the Plaintiff, the irresistible inference must be that those who were responsible for installingthe boards had not exercised proper skill and care and the 3rd Defendant would be in breach of its duty of care under common lawor the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a> or in breach of regulation 38A(2) of the Construction Site (Safety) Regulation.</p>    <p class="heading">LIABILITY OF THE 1ST AND 2ND DEFENDANTS AS EMPLOYER AND SUPERIOR SUB-CONTRACTOR RESPECTIVELY</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The Plaintiff's case against the 1st Defendant as his employer is that he was in breach of the employer's duty to take reasonablecare of the safety of his employee while at work, namely that he failed to provide the Plaintiff with and/or maintain a safe placeof work and/or means of access thereto or egress therefrom.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The extent of an employer's duty of care in respect of the safety of his employees depends on the particular circumstances of thesite where work has to be carried out. The 1st Defendant contracted to execute works in the Business Centre on the second floor,the Banquet Hall on the first floor and the Coffee Shop on the ground floor. The Plaintiff was required to remove a work-table fromthe Banquet Hall on the first floor via some common area into the Coffee Shop on the ground floor. The staircase where the accidentoccurred was clearly in the common area of the hotel which could not be regarded as part of the work place. The staircase was underthe control of the principal contractor, i.e. the 3rd Defendant. The 1st Defendant had no control over the staircase and could notimprove on the condition of the staircase.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The principal contractor responsible for the construction site would have more resources, manpower and expertise than its sub-contractors.The principal contractor is required by law to employ a safety officer. It is the person in overall charge and the occupier of theconstruction site. Unless a sub-contractor has reason to suspect that the principal contractor is adopting an unsafe system of workor is in breach of statutory duty or otherwise incompetent in looking after the safety of the construction site, it might well bereasonable for the sub-contractor to expect or even to assume that the principal contractor is competent in discharging its dutyof ensuring that the common area in the construction site would be safe for its workers as well as those of his sub-contractors.The employer's duty of care in respect of the safety of his employees over common area of the construction site over which he hasno control would be discharged if he warns his employees of dangers which he is aware of and brings that to the attention of theprincipal contractor or contractor responsible for the site so that any unsafe condition can be rectified.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In the present case, the 1st Defendant was entitled to rely on those measures taken by the 3rd Defendant as adequate for the safetyof his employees. There is nothing to suggest that the 3rd Defendant was incompetent in discharging its statutory duty and commonlaw duty. In fact, I have found the measures taken by the 3rd Defendant sufficient to discharge those duties. There was no dangerfor the 1st Defendant to warn the Plaintiff of. Accordingly, I find that the 1st Defendant was not in breach of any duty of careowed to the Plaintiff. The 2nd Defendant was the superior contractor to the 1st Defendant. The duty it owed to the Plaintiff couldnot be higher than that owed by the 1st Defendant or the 3rd Defendant. The 2nd Defendant is therefore likewise not liable for anybreach of duty to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">LIABILITY OF THE 1ST AND 2ND DEFENDANTS AS JOINT OCCUPIERS WITH THE 3RD DEFENDANT</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Mr Shum submitted that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were joint occupiers of the staircase with the 3rd Defendant. In view of my conclusionabove, it is not necessary for me to consider this issue. However, that argument is plainly wrong. Though the word "occupier" isnot defined in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a>, it has been judicially defined by Lord Denning in <strong>Wheat v Lacon</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20AC%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] AC 522</a> where Lord Denning said at 577 and 578:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the Occupier's Liability Act, 1957, the word 'occupier' is used in the same sense as it was used in the common law cases on occupiers;liability for dangerous premises. It was simply a convenient word to denote a person who had a sufficient degree of control overpremises to put him under a duty of care towards those who came lawfully on to the premises........</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Translating this general principle into its particular application to dangerous premises, it becomes simply this: wherever a personhas a sufficient degree of control over premises that he ought to realise that any failure on his part to use care may result ininjury to a person coming lawfully there, then he is an 'occupier' and the person coming lawfully there is his 'visitor'; and the'occupier' is under a duty to his 'visitor' to use reasonable care. In order to be an 'occupier' it is not necessary for a personto have entire control over the premises. He need not have exclusive occupation. Suffice it that he has some degree of control. Hemay share the control with others. Two or more may be 'occupiers'. And whenever this happens, each is under a duty to use care towardspersons coming lawfully on to the premises, dependent on his degree of control. If each fails in his duty, each is liable to a visitorwho is injured in consequence of his failure, but each may have a claim to contribution from the other.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In <em>Salmond on Torts</em> (14th Edn., 1965) p. 372, it is said that an 'occupier' is 'he who has the immediate supervision and control and the power of permittingor prohibiting the entry of other persons'. This definition was adopted by Roxburgh, J., in <em>Hartwell v. Grayson Rollo and Clover Docks, Ltd.</em>, and by Diplock, L.J., in the present case. There is no doubt that a person who fulfils that test is an 'occupier'. He is the personwho says 'come in'; but I think that that test is too narrow by far. There are other people who are 'occupiers', even though theydo not say 'come in'. If a person has any degree of control over the state of the premises it is enough."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> As for the position of independent contractors, Lord Denning said at page 595:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Fourthly, where an owner employed an independent contractor to do work on premises or a structure, the owner was usually still regardedas sufficiently in control of the place as to be under a duty towards all those who might lawfully come there."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> On the fact, there is no dispute that the 1st or 2nd Defendant had no power of control over the staircase. Neither of them couldcontrol how the staircase might be used. They had no power to exclude others from using the staircase or to improve on its safety.It could not be said that they had sufficient degree of control over the staircase as to put them under a duty of care towards thosewho use the staircase. The argument of joint occupier must fail.</p>    <p class="heading">CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> It was the 3rd Defendant's defence that workers were prohibited from using the staircase. However, even according to the evidenceof Ng and Leung, there was no such prohibition. What the 3rd Defendant did was to advise its sub-contractors during monthly sitemeetings not to use the staircase but this advice was not even communicated to the 1st Defendant or his workers. There were no noticesof the advice posted up in the site or near to the staircase. The advice was not mandatory. Ng did not expect it would be followedand would not prevent workers from using the staircase either, unless while work was being carried out on the staircase. Thus, theprohibition as a defence or as a claim for contributory negligence must fail.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Mr Leung submitted that there were other alternative and safer or even shorter routes from the Banquet Hall to the Coffee Shop andthe Plaintiff was contributory negligent in not using those alternative routes. These include the rear staircases or fire exit staircasesand cargo lifts. The Plaintiff said he was unaware of these alternatives. Even if that was not credible, I think in the absence ofexpress prohibition a worker was free to use any route he chose. The rear staircases were about four and half feet wide. Though notimpossible, they were obviously too narrow for two persons to carry a work-table of that dimension and the workers would have totravel through narrow passages to access the staircase or cargo lifts. On the other hand, the marble staircase, if properly covered,was a much safer route to use when carrying large bulky objects. I do not think the Plaintiff liable for contributory negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">QUANTUM</p>    <p class="heading">Pain suffering and loss of amenities</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The Plaintiff was 36 years old at the time of the accident. He complained of severe pain at the time of the accident and now of residualpain after walking for more than 10 to 15 minutes. He complained of weakness and stiffness of his back and numbness of his left leg.He said he could not sleep or enjoy playing basket ball, swimming and cycling which he used to enjoy. He said he had problem havingsex also. An MRI of his lumbar spine showed degeneration and mild protrusion of the L4/L5 disc, which Dr Lau Hoi Kuen opined wasa pre-accident condition. Dr Lau found he was exaggerating the condition of his legs and back. I also found the Plaintiff exaggeratingand do not accept his evidence about the pain he is suffering now and at the time of the accident. The surveillance video tape takenin May 2002 showed he had no difficulties carrying out his daily activities. Dr Lau assessed the Plaintiff to have suffered 5% impairmentof the whole person because of the condition of his back and attributed 2% of his impairment to the accident.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The starting point for serious injury category is around $460,000: see <strong>Yu Kwok Wing</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%202%20HKLRD%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 2 HKLRD 306</a> and <strong>Lawati Bhawani Bikram v Ting Kau Contractors Joint Venture</strong> CACV 3/2002. The injuries suffered by the Plaintiff fell far short of the "serious injury" category. The injury he suffered was aminor one and he had a good recovery. He did not suffer any disc prolapse or bone fracture as a result of the accident. Accordingto Dr Lau, any pain the Plaintiff suffered should be of a mild degree and would have subsided in a few months. Essentially the Plaintiffwas exaggerating his pre-injury condition. I consider an award of $50,000 for pain, suffering and loss of amenities adequate.</p>    <p class="heading">Pre-trial loss of earnings</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The Plaintiff was a carpenter earning $800 a day. It was Dr Lau's opinion that in the average cases with such back sprain, symptomsshould subside within a few months and certainly not more than one year. Dr Lau's opinion is that the Plaintiff is now fit to returnto his work as a carpenter. The Plaintiff claimed loss of earning from the date of accident until 1 August 2002. Based on Dr Lau'sopinion, the claim is grossly exaggerated. Nine months' earning is the maximum I would be prepared to award to him and that includedan allowance for the time needed for him to find new employment after returning from sick leave. The Plaintiff said he was in fulltime employment before the accident. Hong Kong has witnessed a downturn in the property market and the construction industry since1997. Though there is no evidence as to what the labour market was for carpenters, I think it would not be inappropriate to givea notional reduction of 4 days from the usual 26 days month for manual labourers in 1999. As I consider the Plaintiff exaggerating,I would not award him any loss of earning in respect of any period of sick leave given beyond this nine-month period, i.e. beyond3 September 1999. There is no reason why any of the Defendants should be responsible for his not returning to work when he could.Accordingly, I would award him $158,400 ($800 x 22 x 9) as total accrued loss of earnings. The Plaintiff was not entitled to anymandatory provident fund payment during that period of nine months.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> As for loss of earning from 4 September 1999 until the date of trial, I would allow for a further notional reduction of work to 20days a month due to the downturn in economy and would award him loss of earning based on his loss of earning capacity of 2% attributableto this accident. Accordingly I would award him $14,803 ($800 x 20 x (46 + 8/31) X 2%) loss of earning and a further amount of $502($800 x 20 x (31 + 11/31) x 2% X 5%), being the employer's contribution to the Mandatory Provident Fund with effect from 1 December2000. The pre-trial loss of earning and contribution to MPF would therefore be $173,705.</p>    <p class="heading">Loss of future earning</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> As the Plaintiff is now 41 years old. I consider a multiplier of 12 appropriate. For the purpose of assessing future loss, I assumework will be available for 24 days in a month. I would assess his loss of future earning inclusive of employer's MPF contributionas $58,061 ($800 x 24 x 12 x 12 x 2% x 105%).</p>    <p class="heading">Special damages</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> I would allow the Plaintiff medical expenses of $8,800 and traveling expenses of $6,400 for his 400 visits to the hospital for treatment.The Plaintiff's claim for tonic food would be disallowed.

The Plaintiff should be left to his remedy in a no fault liability claim under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282" class="autolink_findacts">Employees Compensation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/282">Cap 282</a>. There is no need for me to consider the issue of contribution, indemnity or apportionment as between the Defendants. Imake an <em>order nisi</em> that the Plaintiff pay the costs of the Defendants to be taxed, including the costs of the 3rd Defendant's notice of contributionand indemnity. The Plaintiff's own costs shall be taxed in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Anthony To)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Edward Shum, instructed by Messrs Pang, Wan &amp; Choi, assigned for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Victor So, instructed by Messrs Peter Wong &amp; Partners, for the 1st Defendant</p>        <p>2nd Defendant appearing in person</p>        <p>Mr Raymond Leung, instructed by Messrs Susan Liang &amp; Co., for the 3rd Defendant</p>        <p>4th Defendant absent</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2003/298.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
