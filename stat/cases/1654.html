Various clarifications were made :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) There was no such position of "Permanent President" in the defendant's structure.</p>        <p>(2) The plaintiff was the Chairman of the 1st Executive Committee of the defendant but had left without prior notice and had failedto account for the affairs and business of the defendant.</p>        <p>(3) In default of payment of his annual subscription and wreath fee for three months, the plaintiff ceased to be a member of the defendantin 1974, in which case he should no longer have any right in the affairs and business of the defendant.</p>        <p>(4) 13 persons named in the plaintiff's letter of 8 October 1999 (names given) were not members of the defendant. In addition, itwas revealed upon investigation that some of the signatures found therein were forged. The plaintiff's alleged representation forthe others was also doubted.</p>        <p>(5) The plaintiff's allegation that somebody was manipulating power (ç©å¼æ¬å) in the defendant was a serious one.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The plaintiff was further requested to produce evidence substantiating his alleged membership and position of "Permanent President"of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> On 12 April 2001, PC wrote to the plaintiff again, advising him that the defendant had been unable to retrieve from its record anydocument concerning the creation of the position of "Permanent President".

(This defence, if established, is a complete answerto the plaintiff's claims unless it is defeated by express malice.)</p>        <p>(III) If not, whether the defendant can successfully justifies the parts complained of?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(IV) If not, what relief is the plaintiff entitled to?</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I will deal with them in turn. Where applicable, I will first set out the law and then discuss the evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">ISSUE I : WHETHER THE PARTS COMPLAINED OF ARE DEFAMATORY?</p>    <p class="heading">(1) The law</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The tort of libel and slander consists of publication of matters (usually words) that convey a defamatory imputation. It is difficultto define with precision the meaning of "defamatory" : see <em>Gatley on Lible and Slander</em>, (2004 edn), para.2.1 ("<em>Gatley</em>"), quoting Lord Atkin in <strong>Sim v. Stretch</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2052%20LT%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 52 LTR 669.</a> But it has been generally that a defamatory imputation is to the complainant's discredit; or which tends to lower him in the estimationof others; or causes him to be shunned or avoided; or exposes him to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or damages his reputation in theoffice, trade or profession : see <em>Gatley, ibid</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> In order to be defamatory, the imputation must tend to lower the complainant in the estimation of right-thinking members of the societygenerally. In <strong>Tolley v. Fry</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%201%20KB%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] 1 KB 467</a>, Geer LJ said at p.479 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Words are not defamatory unless they amount to an attack on a man's reputation or character; they must tend to disparage him in theeyes of the average sensible citizen. Words are not defamatory, however much they damage a man in the eyes of a section of the community,unless they also amount to disparagement of his reputation in the eyes of right thinking men generally. To write or say of a mansomething that will disparage him in the eyes of a particular section of the community, but will not affect his reputation in theeyes of the average right thinking man, is not actionable within the law of defamation...When the point arises whether words arecapable of a defamatory meaning, the question is : Are they capable of being construed as a statement of something that would beregarded by ordinary reasonable people as disparaging to his character or reputation, and calculated to bring him into ridicule,dislike or contempt?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> When written words are the medium whereby the defamatory imputation is conveyed, the imputation may be conveyed by the words themselvesin their natural and ordinary meaning or by reason of extrinsic facts known to the recipients. The latter case gives rise to an "innuendo",which is a separate cause of action : see <em>Gatley</em>, para.3.2, at pp.76-77 and para.3.18 at p.96.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(a) Natural and ordinary meaning</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Natural and ordinary meaning of the words refer to the meaning in which reasonable people of ordinary intelligence, with the ordinaryperson's general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs, would be likely to understand them. The question is what would thewords conveyed to the mind of the ordinary, reasonable, fair-minded reader? See <em>Gatley</em>, para.3.15 at pp.92-93.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The notion of natural and ordinary meaning has two elements in it, namely, literal meaning and implication. In <strong>Lewis v. Daily Telegraph</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20233" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 233</a>, Lord Reid said at p.258 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the claimant has been called a thief and a murderer. Butmore often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regardedas part of their natural and ordinary meaning."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is therefore immaterial whether the defamatory imputation is conveyed by words of direct assertion or by suggestion, for insinuationmay be defamatory as an explicit statement : see <em>Gatley</em>, para.3.16 at p.94.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The complaint must plead in his statement of claim and prove at trial the defamatory imputation which he contends the words complainedof, in their natural and ordinary meaning, convey.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(b) Innuendo</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Where the complaint pleads innuendoes, he must not only identify in his statement of claim the defamatory meaning which he contendsthe words convey but also identify the relevant extrinsic facts and prove that those facts were known to at least one of the recipients: <em>Gatley</em>, para.3.18 at p.96.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> With the above principles, I now consider if the parts complained of in the Letter and the Notice are defamatory as alleged. I firstdeal with the objectionable parts in the Letter.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) The objectionable parts in the Letter</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> To recap, the parts in the Letter that the plaintiff finds objectionable are :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"æ¬æåä»»çäºé·èå¶æ¾åçå¨è·æå§èæå¡ä¹éæéé¢ç³¾ç´ï¼æ­¤äºæè§è·å®ï¼ä¸å¨å¸ä»»åå®å¨æ²æäº¤ä»£è²¡æ¿å¸³ç®ï¼è¡æ¿ç´éï¼ä¸­éæèªé¢ä»»ï¼ä½¿æåå·¥ä½åå°æ¥µå¤§çæå®³..."</p>        <p>("the 1st Paragraph")</p>        <p class="quote">" èåçå¤æ¬¡èªç¨±[æ°¸é æé·]ï¼å¯¦æçç¨ä¹å«..."</p>        <p>("the 2nd Paragraph")</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The 1st Paragraph relates to how the plaintiff conducted himself as the chairman of the defendant's 1st Executive Committee. The2nd Paragraph relates to his being suspected of using the title "Permanent President" improperly and without authority.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> As to the 1st Paragraph, it should be borne in mind that it referred to the time when the plaintiff was the chairman of the defendant's1st Executive Committee between April 1974 and March 1976. It did not cover events prior to April 1974 or events that took placewhen the plaintiff was the chairman of the 46th Executive Committee of the Association. The plaintiff has not contended otherwise.Accordingly, I find that on the 2nd Imputation, the point that the defendant had wrongfully alleged that the plaintiff did not performhis duties during his chairmanship in 1973 is not substantiated. Save as aforesaid, I am satisfied that the 1st Paragraph, in itsnatural and ordinary meaning, did contain the 1st to 5th Imputations.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> As to the 2nd Paragraph, I am satisfied that in its natural and ordinary meaning, it bears the 6th Imputation.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> The 1st to 6th Imputations are all defamatory and I so find. As I understand Ms Wu, counsel for the defendant, she did not seriouslycontend otherwise in her closing submissions.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> On the alternative plea of innuendo, the undisputed evidence before me is that members of the defendant did know that the plaintiff,as the chairman of the 1st Executive Committee, was responsible for the management of the defendant in 1974. I am therefore satisfiedthat when the 1st Paragraph was read and understood in the circumstances, they would denigrate the plaintiff's characters in theeyes of the defendant's members. However, I am not satisfied that such knowledge of the defendant's members has any bearing on theimputation conveyed in the 2nd Paragraph. Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff succeeds in his plea of innuendo on the 1st Paragraphonly.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) The objectionable parts of the Notice</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> To recap, the plaintiff finds the following part in the Notice objectionable :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"è¿å¹´ä¾ï¼'èå¶æ¾åç'ä»¥éæå¡èº«ä»½å¤æ¬¡å°æ¬ææåä½åºå¹²æ¶ï¼ä¸¦æ¶å«éç¨'æ°¸é æé·'åé..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>On the face of it, two points are raised by this statement. First, the plaintiff interfered with the defendant's affairs repeatedlyalthough he was not a member ("the 1st Point"). Second, he was suspected of using the title "Permanent President" improperly ("the2nd Point").</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> On the 1st Point, the plaintiff has not pleaded in the amended statement of claim what its natural and ordinary meaning was and howa defamatory imputation is conveyed. In the absence of proper pleading, the plaintiff's claim that the 1st Point in its natural andordinary meaning is defamatory, must fail. The plaintiff also relies on innuendo to make good his claim on the 1st Point. But againknowledge on the part of the defendant's members that he was responsible for the defendant's management of the defendant in his capacityas the chairman of the Executive Committee in 1974 has nothing to do with the 1st Point at all. In the circumstances, I rule thatthe plaintiff's claim that the 1st Point is defamatory by reason of innuendo fails.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> As regards the 2nd Point, Ms Wu submitted that no reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence, with the ordinary person's generalknowledge and experience of worldly affairs would understand the words, in light of the clear qualifying words (æ¶å«), indicatingreservation, to mean that the plaintiff did actually use the title of Permanent President without proper authority. With respect,I disagree. In the Notice, the defendant did make the point that it does not have the title Permanent President. The 2nd Point, properlyunderstood in context, must carry the implication that the plaintiff had used the title and that his use was without authority. Itherefore rule that the 2nd Point in its natural and ordinary meaning bears the 6th Imputation.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> As noted above, knowledge of the defendant's members that the plaintiff was responsible for the management of the defendant in 1974as the chairman of the defendant's Executive Committee has no bearing on his use of the title Permanent President. The plaintiff'splea that the 2nd Point by reason of innuendo is defamatory therefore fails.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> To recap, my finding on Issue I is as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Subject to what I have said in para.54 above on the 2nd Imputation, the 1st Paragraph is defamatory in both its natural and ordinarymeaning and by reason of innuendo in that they carried the 1st to 5th Imputations.</p>        <p>(2) The 2nd Paragraph is defamatory in its natural and ordinary meaning but not by reason of innuendo in that it carried the 6th Imputation.</p>        <p>(3) The 1st Point fails.</p>        <p>(4) The 2nd Point is defamatory in its natural and ordinary meaning but not by reason of innuendo in that it carried the 6th Imputation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> I next turn to the defence of qualified privilege.</p>    <p class="heading">ISSUE 2 : WHETHER THE DEFENCE OF QUALIFIED PRIVILEGE IS ESTABLISHED?</p>    <p class="heading">(1) The law</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> I first note that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21">Cap.21</a> ("the Ordinance"), which sets a limitation on privilege at elections, is not applicable to the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> At common law, the defence of qualified privilege recognizes that there are certain circumstances in which a person may make defamatorystatements yet without attracting liability on grounds of public policy and convenience. The person is protected if the statementis fairly warranted by the occasion, that is, within the scope of the purpose for which the law grants the privilege and so longas it is not shown that the statement is made with malice, that it, with some indirect or improver motive or knowing it to be untrue,or with reckless indifference as to its truth : <em>Gatley</em>, para.14.1 at p.379.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Generally speaking, it is the occasion, as opposed to the publication, that attracts the privilege. And the occasions that give riseto qualified privilege can neither be catalogued nor rendered exact. But they can be very broadly divided into two categories, althoughone must bear in mind that these two categories are imprecise and may overlap. The first category is cases where the maker of thestatement has a duty (whether legal, social or moral) to make the statement and the recipient has a corresponding interest to receiveit ("the duty-interest category"). The second category is cases where the maker of the statement is acting in pursuance of an interestof his and the recipient has such a corresponding interest or duty in relation to the statement, or where he is acting in a matterin which he has a common interest with the recipient : <em>Gatley</em>, para.14.6 at p.384. As I understand Ms Wu, she is relying on the duty-interest category only.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(a) Duty</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Whether for the purposes of qualified privilege in the duty-interest category a duty on the part of the marker to make the publicationexists is for the court to determine. While it is not difficult to determine whether there was a legal duty to make the publication,the great difficulty in defining what constitutes social or moral duty has long been recognized : see <em>Gatley</em>, para.14.10 at pp.388 and 399. But it would appear from the authorities cited by <em>Gatley</em>, <em>ibid.</em> that the court would apply the standard of the ordinary reasonable man and ask whether a duty, moral or social, was recognized byhim in the circumstances. If so, a moral or social duty, as the case may be, would arise.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> In considering whether an occasion was privileged, the court will regard the alleged libel and will examine by whom it was published,to whom it was published, when, why and in what circumstances it was published, and will see whether these things established a relationbetween the parties which gives rise a social or moral right or duty, and the consideration of these things may involved the considerationof questions of public policy : <strong>James v.

In the present case, no question of public policy arose.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(b) Corresponding interest</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> As regards corresponding interest, the word "interest" is not used in any technical sense, but in the broadest popular sense, "aswhen we say that a man is 'interest' in knowing a fact - not interested in it as a matter of gossip or curiosity, but as a matterof substance apart from its mere quality as news" <strong>: Howe v.

I will first deal with the circumstancesleading to the publications. I will then address the duty-interest aspects for both publications. Finally, I will come to the questionof malice.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Why published the Letter and the Notice?</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The evidence on this point is given by Mr Chui Pak Keung, the chairman of the Executive Committee between 1 April 1998 and 31 March2004 ("Mr Chui"). Mr Chui explained that the Executive and Supervisory Committees decided to publish the Letter and the Notice becausethe plaintiff's conduct had aroused concerns and dissatisfaction from the members, especially the older ones. Someone had even madea report to the ICAC concerning the defendant. Mr Chui is well connected in the Mainland. He is a member of Consultative Committee(æ¿å) in the Mainland. (It is not clear whether his membership is at the provincial or national level.) Through his contact, helearnt that the plaintiff had complained to the local government of Nam Hoi City, as well as other associations like "åæµ·å¸åè¯"in respect of the conduct of business and affairs of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> In such circumstances, the Committees decided that it was necessary to account to its members (ä¸å®è¦åæå¡äº¤å¾ï¼ä»¥æ­£è¦è½).A "special committee " (å°è²¬èª¿æ¥å°çµ) ("the Special Committee") comprising of Mr Chui himself, one Mr Lee Kwok Hung (æåé)and Mr Wong Sing Kei (çä¸åº) was formed for the purpose of investigation of the matters concerning the plaintiff. There was asspecial reason for the composition of the Special Committee. The three members were selected on the basis that they all belongedto a new generation. None of them had any personal knowledge (è¦ªèº«ç¶æ­·), emotion (æç·) nor historical burden (æ­·å²åè¢±)of what had happened, in which case they could cast a much fairer eye at the cause (è¼å¬å). The Special Committee had visitednumerous senior members of the defendant (èµ°è¨ªäºå¤ä½è³æ·±æå¡), including Mr Chui Yeung Sing (å´é¤æ), Mr Leung Hong Kwong(æ¢åº·å»£) and others to gather evidence. The Special Committee had also consulted and made reference to the past minutes and recordsand Articles of Association of the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> With the benefit of the Special Committee's investigations and after repeated meetings, the Committees decided to issue the Letterand the Notice.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Mr Chui's evidence on the above matters is not seriously challenged. Indeed, the plaintiff has not adduced any credible evidenceto contradict Mr Chui.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> I now look at the duty-interest aspects of the Letter and the Notice in greater detail.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) The Letter</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> The Letter was an internal publication. It was published to the defendant's members only.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(a) Duty to publish</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The first question is whether the defendant was under a duty, legal, social or moral, to publish the Letter to its members. Nothingin the evidence before me suggests that the defendant is obliged by the law to publish the Letter.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> I am however satisfied that that the defendant was plainly under a moral or social duty to publish the Letter. The defendant is aclansman's association with the primary objective to promote, foster unity and friendly (and in some cases long term) relationshipamongst its members. The daily management is vested with Executive Committee, subject to the supervision of the Supervisory Committee.In the course of discharging their duties, the Committees are plainly under a duty to speak to its members concerning any matterthat may affect the business, affairs interests or welfare of the defendant or the members <em>qua</em> members. In discharging such a duty, the Committees should be able to speak freely and frankly in order to convey to the memberswhat they honestly believe to be true. This point is indeed borne out by the undisputable evidence of Mr Chui as summarized in paras.71to 73 above.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(b) Corresponding interest</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> The next question is whether members of the defendant have any corresponding interest in the matters set out in the Letter. As notedabove, the defendant, a clansman association, aims to promote unity and friendship of its members, who are mostly clansmen of thesame clan. The defendant is akin to a club. Like the members of a club, members of the defendant have every interest in the mattersof the defendant, including those serious matters referred to in the Letter : see <strong>Khan v. O'Dea &amp; Shroff</strong>, unreported, HCA5850/1982, 27 February 1985, Hunter J.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) The Notice</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> The Notice is a publication on newspaper. It is therefore a publication to the world at large.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(a) Duty to publish</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Again, there is no legal duty on the defendant to publish the Notice. Contending that the defendant was under a social or moral dutyto do so, Ms Wu submitted that the information contained in the Notice was so important that the defendant owed a duty to renderit even to the public. To make good her submissions, Ms Wu relied on the following factors.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> First, the defendant was in the best position to tell whether a particular person (i.e. the plaintiff) was its member and whetherthere was any position of "Permanent President" in its structure. This was knowledge within the absolute confines of the defendantto which the outsider would have no access.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Second, any association in the position of the defendant (with a person claiming to be its "Permanent President") was bound to makethe clarifications as it did. In cross-examination, Mr Chui said that the plaintiff's alleged position in the defendant had arousednumerous external speculation ("å¼èµ·å¤ççå¤çªæ£æ¸¬") and that other friendly associations (åæ) like Nam Hoi Association("åæµ·åéæ") queried about the structure of the defendant ("æäººåé¦æ¸¯åæµ·æ²é ­åéææéå¬å¸çæ¯ä»éº¼å¶åº¦").In re-examination, Mr Chui further explained that had there been the position of "Permanent President", the holder of it would resemblethe "head or No.1" of the defendant (é¦é·/ç¬¬ä¸æäº¤æ¤).</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Third, the defendant, a non profit-making institution, is dependent on subscription and donation by charity organizations (Clause3(1) of the Memorandum of Association as amended pursuant to the special resolution dated 8 December 1998). For this reason, thedefendant has to be careful in maintaining its image so as not to discourage its subscribers or otherwise impairs its ability incarrying out charitable objects. As said by Mr Chui in re-examination, the defendant has an image to maintain, and the conduct ofthe chairman of the Executive Committee will reflect on it ("ææä¸åå½¢è±¡ï¼èº«çºè² è²¬äººï¼ä»çåè¡æå®è¥çµ¦äººæçæ³çæåï¼äººå®¶æææ¨£çä½ ").</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> I entirely agree.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(b) Corresponding interest</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> The second question is whether the public had a corresponding interest. I remind myself that the word "interest" should be construedin the broadest popular sense, as opposed to a technical sense.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Ms Wu asked me to note that pursuant to the special resolution dated 8 December 1998, Articles 3 and 4 of the Articles of Associationwere amended to the effect that anyone can join the defendant as a member, following which any member of the public now becomes apotential member of the defendant. The conduct of affairs and business of the defendant is among one of the very factors influencinga person's decision as to whether to join the defendant or other associations. She further contended that as is the case with anycharitable organization, the public that is subscribing and making donations to the defendant or is going to do so would have therequisite interests in this connection.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Again, I agree.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Conclusion on duty-interest aspects</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Accordingly, I find that the duty-interest aspects for both the Letter and the Notice are established. I rule that the occasionswhere the Letter and the Notice were published were privileged, subject to the plaintiff's allegation of express malice, to whichI now turn.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Express malice</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(a) The law</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The defence of qualified privilege will be defeated by proof of express malice on the part of the defendant.

Initially, this pleading requirement was ignored in the amended reply. The amended reply was then re-amended to add a newpara.14 : see para.42 above. The particulars set out there referred to two instances of issuing letters threatening legal action.I fail to see how threatening legal action in hostile litigation, <em>per se</em>, is capable of constituting express malice in rebuttal of the defence of qualified privilege. Mr Yam, counsel for the plaintiff,has not been able to convince me otherwise. In my view, this plea of express malice fails <em>in limine</em>.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(c) Absence of honest belief</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> When cross-examining Mr Chui, Mr Yam did suggest to him that the plaintiff's misdeeds were not recorded in the record of minutesof meetings of the Executive Committee and Joint Meetings. It is not clear if Mr Yam is suggesting that the defendant did not honestlybelieve that the matters referred to in the Letter and the Notice were true. For completeness, I will deal with this point on thebasis that it had been raised.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> In the absence of proper pleading, the plaintiff is not entitled to rely on it. More importantly, the plaintiff has failed to provethat the defendant did not have honest belief or was reckless or indifferent as to the truth of the matters published in the Letteror the Notice. As noted in paras.71 to 73 above, the defendant had taken steps of setting up the Special Committee to carry out thoroughinvestigation into the matters. And the relevant records kept by the defendant which the Special Committee had considered did containinformation that supported the matters referred to in the Letter and the Notice. These records are :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The minutes of the 19th Joint Meeting of the 1st Executive and Supervisory Committee of the defendant dated 15 November 1975 concerningthe misappropriation of funds (è§ç©ºå¬æ¬¾) by the then secretary (åæ¸è¨), Mr Ng Shek Fung (å³é«é³³).</p>        <p>(2) The minutes of the 20th Joint Meeting of the 1st Executive and Supervisory Committee of the defendant dated 5 December 1975 proposingto investigate the actual amount of misappropriated funds.</p>        <p>(3) The minutes of the Ordinary General Meeting of the members of the defendant dated 7 December 1975 concerning the plaintiff's assumptionof personal liability for the surety money (æä¿éé¡) of Ng Shek Fung in the sum of HK$2,000.00 out of his own volition.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) The minutes of the 1st Joint Meeting of the 2nd Executive and Supervisory Committee of the defendant dated 8 May 1976 which confirmedthe absence of the plaintiff thereat.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> In the circumstances, even if properly raised, the point of absence of honest belief on the part of defendant must fail on evidence.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><em>(d) Improper motives</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> In the course of cross-examining Mr Chui, Mr Yam alluded to the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) The defendant aimed at stopping the plaintiff from further interfering with its conduct of affairs and business.</p>        <p>(b) There was hostility between Mr Chui and the plaintiff personally.</p>        <p>(c) PC (the defendant's legal representative) had issued various letters to the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> It seemed that Mr Yam sought to rely on the above to show that the defendant had improper motives. Again, none of these matters havebeen pleaded in the reply. The plaintiff is simply not entitled to rely on any of them to substantiate his case of express malice.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> In any event, the plaintiff has been unable to substantiate these allegations on evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> On the first allegation, Mr Yam argued that there was no reason why the defendant would publish in 2001 the Letter and the Noticecontaining matters which went back to the 1970's. The only purpose of the two publications was to defame the plaintiff in the eyesof the members of the defendant in retaliation so as to prevent him from making further petitions or objections to the defendant.But such an argument is flatly contradicted by the undisputable evidence of Mr Chui as to why the defendant decided to publish theLetter and the Notice : see paras.71 to 73 above. To recap, the defendant decided to publish the Letter and the Notice in order toaccount to its members and to put the matters correct on record. And the defendant has taken the caution to investigate thoroughlyinto the matters concerning the plaintiff before deciding to publish the Letter and the Notice. No improper or ulterior motive assuggested by Mr Yam can be inferred. His submission is wholly unmeritorious. And I reject it.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> On the second allegation, Mr Yam argued that the defendant published the Letter and the Notice in order to harm the plaintiff. Thus,it was put to Mr Chui in cross-examination that there was a verbal dispute between the plaintiff and Mr Chui in 1998 in which MrChui said : "æä¿å¤§å­¸çï¼åéæçäºé·ä¿å°å­¸ççäºæ...ä½ å¯¦å¨å¤ªæ²å¡µï¼æè¦å±è¡°ä½ ...". Mr Chui deniedthis allegation. He said that he was first introduced to the plaintiff through the introduction of one Mr Wu Kam Hon in 1996. Thereafter,he had about two to three telephone conversations with the plaintiff, during which they did not talk about the defendant. I acceptMr Chui's evidence. I see no reason why Mr Chui had to "bad-mouth" the plaintiff as alleged. Further, if this allegation were true,it would not have been necessary for the defendant to take the cautionary step to carry out investigation by the Special Committee.It would have issued the Letter and the Notice right away.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> On the 3rd allegation, the particulars of the letters were not identified with precision during cross-examination. In any event,none of the letters issued on behalf of the defendant by its solicitors could possibly constitute any improper motive as alleged.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> For the above reasons, I hold that the plea of express malice fails.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> For the above reasons, I will answer Issue II in the affirmative and hold that the defence of qualified privilege is establishedfor both the Letter and the Notice. It is a complete answer to the plaintiff's complaints. On this basis, the plaintiff's claim isdismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">ISSUE III : WHETHER THE DEFENCE OF JUSTIFICATION IS ESTABLISHED?</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> In light of my conclusion on Issue II, it is not necessary for me to deal with the defence of justification. However, for completeness,I will state my views as follows. Again, I will begin by stating the law.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) The law</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> It is a defence for the defendant to establish that the imputation in respect of which he is sued is substantially true. It willbe sufficient if the defendant is able to prove the main charge, or gist, of the liable is true. It is not necessary for him to justifyeach and every statement or comment which does not add to the sting of the charge : <strong>Edwards v. Bell</strong> (1824) 1 Bing.403; see also <em>Gatley</em>, paras.11.9-11.10 at pp.275-277 and section 26 of the Ordinance.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Witnesses</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> As to evidence, apart from himself, the plaintiff has called two witnesses, namely Mr Fung Kwok Lau ("Mr Fung"), the assistant tothe Investigation Department of the 1st Executive Committee of the defendant, and Mr Chow Chiu Kwong ("Mr Chow"), one of the presidentsof the 1st Executive Committee of the defendant. The defendant has called Mr Woo Ying Lou ("Mr Woo"), the chairman of the 2nd ExecutiveCommittee of the defendant. They are all of advanced age. Mr Chow is aged 82 while others are all over 70. And their evidence ison matters that took place nearly two decades ago. It is not unlikely that their memory of the events had faded over the years. Iwill therefore approach their evidence with caution. Further, I do not propose to deal with every singly aspect of their evidence.Suffice it to say that I have already carefully considered all the evidence. With these markers, I will now look at the 1st to 6thImputations in turn.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) The 1st Imputation</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> The defendant seek to rely on various incidents for justification revealed in Mr Woo's oral testimony.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> First, in the latter half of 1975, the plaintiff was in need of money. As a result, he had to instigate a "hwei" (æ) among thefellow members of the defendant including Mr Wu Chan (è¡æ¯), Mr Fung Sang (é¦®ç), Mr Wu Gai Chau (è¡ç¹¼å), Mr Ho Him Tai (ä½è¬æ³°),Mr Li Sai Loi (æä¸ä¾), Mr Mok Hing (è«æ¶) and Mr Woo himself. Since the plaintiff was the head of the hwei, he took over themoney gathered from the other nine members, with each contributing HK$1,500.00 for his own use. Afterwards, the whereabouts of theplaintiff could no longer be located. As a result, Mr Fung Sang and Mr Woo were forced to take up the second and the third meetingrespectively. Up until now, no repayment has yet been made by the plaintiff to the then members of the hwei.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> Second, some time in 1974 and 1975, Mr Chui Cham (å´æ¹) told Mr Woo that he had advanced to the plaintiff a loan in the sum ofHK$7,000.00. As repayment, the plaintiff drew Mr Woo a cheque. But it was later dishonoured.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Third, in 1974 or 1975, the plaintiff was indebted to Mr Chui Koon Gueng (å´æ¬ç« ) and Mr Chui Jiu Cheung (å´ç§ç« ) who operatedthe business of Tai Luen Coffee Company Limited, (å¤§è¯åå¡æéå¬å¸) in the sum of HK$20,000.00. That was balance of the goodsadvanced to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Fourth, in 1974 or 1975, Mr Woo advanced to the plaintiff a loan in the sum of HK$7,000.00 which had not been repaid.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> The plaintiff denied that any of the above incidents had taken place. In relation to "hwei", the plaintiff admitted that he instigateda "hwei" in 1978, the members of which included Mr Woo. After the third meeting, owing to the absence of Mr Woo, no further meetingwas called. Notwithstanding that, the plaintiff made repayment to the members of the "hwei", except Mr Ho Him Tai and Mr Wu Chan.In the case of Mr Wu Chan, his son refused any repayment to be made by the plaintiff out of love and affection.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> Mr Fung corroborated the plaintiff by saying that the plaintiff did not instigate any "hwei" during his chairmanship. Both Mr Fungand Mr Chow said it was in 1978 when the plaintiff instigated a "hwei" which failed following Mr Woo's absence.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> In relation to loans, the plaintiff said that in 1979, Mr Woo lent certain money to him. But the plaintiff had already repaid MrWoo personally or to his company, "Dor Hing Meat Company" in 1979 to 1980.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> A number of points arose from the plaintiff's cross-examination :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The plaintiff said that he had altogether three businesses at the material time, namely "Sing Hing Cheung" (çèç¥¥), sellingsundry goods (éè²¨); "Kut Cheung" (åç¥¥), carrying on the business of import of salt from Taiwan; and "China City Restaurant"(ä¸­ååå¤§éæ¨). The restaurant was established in 1974 when he invested in the sum of HK$500,000.00 and he held the positionof Director Manager (è£äºç¸½ç¶ç).</p>        <p>(2) The plaintiff admitted that he obtained loans for the purpose of his business in the period of 1974 to 1976. He said it was notsurprising at all for any businessman to do so.</p>        <p>(3) He was asked about the source of his loans. He first mentioned about the banks. He then said he could not recall if there wereother sources. When pressed further, the plaintiff admitted that it was possible that he might have borrowed from "individuals" andthat he might have borrowed from the members of the defendant.</p>        <p>(4) As to the suggestion that the plaintiff might have borrowed from the members of the defendant, the plaintiff first said that hedid instigate a "hwei" prior to 1978, referring to the period of 1974 to 1976 in particular. He then said that the "hwei" that heinstigated during the period might have failed, yet even if so repayment must have already been made by him to anyone from whom heborrowed subsequent to 1978 ("å°±ç®æçå°¾ï¼æé½å·²ç¶é æ¸ï¼æç¡æ¬ ä»»å¯äººé¢... é¢æå·²ç¶æ¼1978 å¹´å¾éæ¸....").</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) The plaintiff denied that he was in any financial difficulty between 1974 and 1976. He said that Sing Hing Cheung had a monthlyturnover in the sum of HK$45,000.00 and even the monthly expense of China City Restaurant already went as high as to HK$150,000.00.However, he could not give any satisfactory reason why he still needed to borrow money from others.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> Having considered the evidence in the round, I find Mr Woo's evidence more satisfactory that that of the plaintiff. He was consistentand was not shaken under cross-examination. On the other hand, what the plaintiff said under cross-examination contradicted to asignificant extent his evidence-in-chief on the "hwei" matters. In the end, he admitted that he might have raised money through "hwei"during his chairmanship. That being the case, I will disregard the evidence of Mr Fung and Mr Chow that the plaintiff had not instigateda "hwei" during his chairmanship. In sum, I am satisfied that the plaintiff did have financial disputes with other members of thedefendant during his chairmanship. The 1st Imputation is therefore justified.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) The 2nd Imputation</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> As noted above, the 2nd Imputation does not cover events in 1973. This imputation is premised on the fact that the plaintiff hadmoney or financial disputes with other members during his chairmanship. In this connection, I have already found that the 1st Imputationis justified. When the plaintiff got himself involved in those financial disputes with members, he brought the office of the chairmanof the Executive Committee into disrepute. This is a certainly a dereliction of duty. I therefore find that the 2nd Imputation isjustified.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) The 3rd Imputation</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> The plaintiff admitted that in December 1975 he left three months before his term of chairmanship expired. However, he said he hadapplied for and obtained permission from the 1st Executive and Supervisory Committees beforehand. There is simply no record in therecord or minutes kept by the defendant considering the plaintiff's application for leave. Given his position and the possible impactof his departing before his term fully expired, his application must have called for attention and concern. The same should be reflectedin the record or minutes. The plaintiff then dismissed his early departure as something trivial. It only showed nothing but disregardof his duties as the chairman of the Executive Committee. I find that the plaintiff had without proper excuse and prior approvalof the defendant abandoned his chairmanship before the term expired.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> The plaintiff said that despite his early leave, the conduct of affairs and business of the defendant customers to run as smoothlyas in the past. I have difficulty in accepting this allegation. The sudden departure of the plaintiff as the chairman must have causedsignificant disruption to the defendant's business and affairs. This is to certain extent confirmed by the difficulty Mr Woo facedwhen he took over the Chairmanship for the 2nd Executive Committee.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> According to Mr Woo, when he succeeded the plaintiff to become the chairman of the 2nd Executive Committee, the plaintiff was absentfrom the 1st Joint Meeting of the 2nd Executive and Supervisory Committees. He did not attend to hand over the accounts, book, financialand administration records. Mr Woo admitted in cross-examination that the documents and minutes of the 1st Executive Committee werekept at the defendant's premises or by the then secretary; that more important certificates, e.g. conveyancing documents were keptat the safe deposit; and the bank books and cheques were with the then treasurer. But it is also Mr Woo's evidence that upon hissuccession, he had to retrieve all the documents. He then found out that all accounts and bank statements were in a mess. As a result,each department had to take time to sort things out. There is no credible evidence before me to contradict Mr Woo. I accept his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> As noted above, the plaintiff did not attend the 1st Joint Meeting of the 2nd Executive and Supervisory Committees. I accept thedefendant's evidence that the joint meeting was meant to be a "hand-over" ceremony, with significant symbolic meaning in accordancewith the defendant's tradition and practice. There is no justifiable excuse for his absence.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> In summary, I find this imputation justified.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) The 4th Imputation</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> This has already been dealt with in para.117 above. For those reasons, I find this imputation justified.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) The 5th Imputation</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> I accept Mr Woo's evidence that the plaintiff had caused serious damage to the defendant's reputation, and that because of his absence,nobody represented the defendant to attend meeting with the association, causing adverse publicity. I find this imputation justifiedas well.</p>    <p class="heading">(8) The 6th Imputation</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> There is simply <em>no</em> position of "Permanent President" in the defendant's Articles of Association after its incorporation. Under cross-examination, theplaintiff admitted that he was only the "Permanent President" of the Association. However, he has all along been claiming to be the"Permanent President" of the defendant. His use of the title "Permanent President" is plainly wrong and without authority. This imputationis justified.</p>    <p class="heading">(9) Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> For the above reasons, I hold that the defence of justification is established in relation to each of the 1st to 6th Imputations.</p>    <p class="heading">ISSUE IV : WHAT RELIEF IS THE PLAINTIFF ENTITLED TO?</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> In light of my findings, this issue does not arise for my determination.</p>    <p class="heading">CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> The plaintiff's claim having failed in its entirety, I dismiss it accordingly.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> I see no reason why costs should not follow the event. I therefore make an order <em>nisi</em> that the defendant shall have the costs of this action, including all the costs reserved, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(J.
