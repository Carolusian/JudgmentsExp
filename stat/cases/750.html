The flat became registered in the name of <b>W C Lee</b> in 2004.  W C Lee soon moved out.  At the material time, his sister, <b>H Lee</b>, lived, and still lives, there with their mother.  The two siblings, as the owner and the occupant respectively, now sue togetheras the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Flat 6K is immediately above Flat 5K.  <b>Cheung</b> and <b>Shuk</b> are the registered owners of Flat 6K.  Neither of them resides there.  They are named together as the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 10 May 2010, an injunction was granted and judgment for damages to be assessed was entered against Cheung and Shuk.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Cheung and Shuk used to put forward a counterclaim on the basis that the complaint by H Lee constituted nuisance and interferenceto them.  At the beginning of the trial, their counsel conceded that such counterclaim had to be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The water leakage and damage</b></p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In about late December 2005 or early January 2006, Cheung and Shuk commenced extensive renovation works in Flat 6K.  Since then,H Lee had discovered water leakage in her flat. The first complaint about that was lodged with the management office of the buildingon 9 January 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On the same day, a joint inspection at Flat 6K was conducted by the representative of the management office, the incorporated ownersand H Lee.  It was revealed that the internal partitions of Flat 6K were being altered; and the flat was being sub-divided into 3separate units with individual toilets.  Water pipes connecting the 3 self-contained units were embedded in raised floor slab.  Waterseepage was noticed near a water tap installed at the right end of Flat 6K.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Days later, the water leakage became more serious.  Complaint was lodged with the management office and the Food and EnvironmentalHygiene Department (â<b>FEHD</b>â).  Due to the suspected unauthorised structural alterations in Flat 6K and the water leakage, complaint was also lodged with theBuildings Department (â<b>BD</b>â).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On two occasions in January 2006, attempt by the consultant contractor of BD to inspect Flat 6K did not succeed.  Eventually, on26 January 2006, a joint inspection of the two premises was conducted by the consultant contractor of BD and the Chairman of theincorporated owners.  It was discovered that the area in the ceiling of Flat 5K affected by the water leakage had expanded significantly.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The water leakage problem persisted until March 2006 when H Lee lodged another complaint to the management office.  A joint inspectionof the two premises by the representative of the incorporated owners, the management office and the then contractor of Flat 6K wasconducted in April 2006.  Continuous water dripping from the ceiling and bulging ceiling plaster were recorded.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In the meantime, an order dated 23 March 2006 was issued by the BD requesting for the removal of the unauthorised building works,namely, the thickened floor slab, in Flat 6K and the reinstatement of the parts affected.  Cheung and Shuk complied with the orderthe BD also certified that in writing on 12 April 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In late April 2006, a hole measuring 2 inches in diameter was discovered at the corner of the ceiling of H Leeâs bedroom.  Thehole was through and through.  A couple of days later, the hole was somehow sealed on the side of Flat 6K.  It was believed thatthe hole was caused during the renovation work at Flat 6K.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The belief that the water leakage had been contained was apparently short-lived.  On 6 May 2006, H Lee complained to the Joint Officeof the FEHD and BD (â<b>the Joint Office</b>â) for persistent water leakage.  Inspection by the Joint Office on 17 May 2006 confirmed signs of water leakage at the ceilingof the living area of Flat 5K. However, attempt to enter Flat 6K for investigation failed, as no one answered the door.  Letter wasleft in the flatâs letterbox.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  By letter dated 13 September 2006, the Joint Office reported the result of its investigation over the past months.  It confirmedthat the water leakage to Flat 5K was due to the damage to the water-proofing materials in the floor slab of Flat 6K.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Upon the instruction of H Lee, Daniel Ho, an architect and authorised person (â<b>the Architect</b>â), inspected Flat 5K on 19 May 2007.  Water leakage at the ceiling of the living-dining area was recorded.  The leakage had causedthe paint to peel off and mould to grow.  Lighting and electricity fittings on the ceiling were affected.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Architect could not gain access to Flat 6K for inspection in May 2007.  Application to the court for such purpose was made inSeptember 2007.  It was on 7 November 2007 did the Architect manage to enter and inspect Flat 6K.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The Architect discovered that despite the compliance with the building order in April 2006, Cheung and Shuk had apparently had theirflat again sub-divided into 3 self-contained units, each fitting with living-dining and bed space, bathroom and kitchen.  There wasalteration of the communal water pipe on the external wall outside the bathroom/kitchen of Flat 6K in the light well, including alterationof the approved sanitary fitment locations, addition of water closets, floor drain, basins and sinks as well as omission of bathtub.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Most of the drainage pipes were again embedded in the raised floor slab and connected to the main drainage stack on the externalwall in the light well.  It was believed that the drainage pipes embedded in the raised floor slab, which was less than 75mm in diameterand sub-standard.  It is believed that the leakage to Flat 5K was caused by flush water, use of shower and the floor drains.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In April 2008, the BD confirmed that Cheung and Shuk had repeated the unauthorised building works in their flat after they had compliedwith the previous order for their removal. In the same month, the BD issued another order in respect of the raised floor slab ofFlat 6K.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Due to the damage to the light weight canopy outside the external wall of Flat 5K facing the light well, Cheung and Shuk had theircontractor rebuilt one for the Leeâs.  However, the new canopy became the subject of a building order issued by the BD on 22 January2008 against W C Lee, as the owner of Flat 5K, requesting for its demolition.  The Leeâs had the new canopy removed.  Compliancewith the order was certified in August 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  As to the re-constructed unauthorised building works in Flat 6K, further buildings orders were issued in April 2008 to Cheung andShuk for the removal of those works.  On the one hand, they had lodged appeal against the orders.  On the other hand, they had indicatedtheir readiness to comply.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The fact was that their appeal was dismissed; and they had never complied with the orders.  Prosecution followed and both were foundguilty and fined in May 2009.  Notwithstanding that, Cheung and Shuk had yet to comply with the building orders at least as of lateFebruary this year.  Further prosecution has been threatened.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Considering the evidence of witnesses and the contemporaneous documents, including the correspondence of the incorporated owners,the various government authorities and the photographs produced, I find the above to the facts.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The claim</b></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The pleaded items of claim may be grouped into the following heads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)                 cost of repair in Flat 5K and incidental expenses;</p>        <p>(2)                 cost of demolishing the light weight canopy;</p>        <p>(3)                 cost of rebuilding the canopy;</p>        <p>(4)                 medical expenses of H Lee;</p>        <p>(5)                 air ticket charges for the mother;</p>        <p>(6)                 cost of alternative accommodation;</p>        <p>(7)                 cost of the photographs;</p>        <p>(8)                 cost of infra-red examination; and</p>        <p>(9)                 general damages for nuisance, distress, discomfort and inconvenience.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The parties have filed an agreed list of issues.  The quantum was also adjusted and thus the pleading amended during the trial.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Cost of repair and incidental expenses: item (1)</b></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  According to H Lee, Flat 5K underwent major renovation in 2003.  In about December 2005, the entire flat was re-painted.  The relevantreceipts evidence that.  That means the water leakage happened soon afterwards.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In February 2006, H Lee obtained a quotation from a contractor for the various repairs and incidental works.  The total quoted costwas HK$128,200.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Pursuant to the courtâs leave, the Leeâs adduced the expert report of Boris Chi-kin Yung, Registered Architect and AuthorisedPerson, dated 29 June 2010 (â<b>the Expert Report</b>â) in relation to the following issues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)                 the remedial work necessary to make good the damage caused by the water leakage;</p>        <p>(2)                 the cost of such remedial work;</p>        <p>(3)                 whether the cost incurred by the Leeâs for demolishing the canopy is fair and reasonable; and</p>        <p>(4)                 the cost for reinstating the canopy.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The Expert Report recorded the results of the inspection at Flats 5K and 6K attended by the parties and the expert on 15 May 2010. The internal alteration in Flat 6K remained unchanged since the last inspection by the Architect in January 2008.  The water seepagein Flat 6K had relented.  The damage from seepage in Flat 5K had stopped propagation and the sites affected had dried up.  The necessaryremedial works and the incidental cost, which were similar to those items in the quotation obtained in 2006, were itemised in thereport.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Recoverability</i></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr Fung argued that the Leeâs are not entitled to recover the cost of the repair in Flat 5K because none of it has been incurredup to now.  He submitted that there is no claim for an indemnity for the cost of repair.  In the premises, they are said to be entitledto nominal compensation in the sum of HK$100 only.  Mr Fung referred to <i>Tse Chit Sang &amp; Anor v Ho Mei Ling &amp; Anor</i>, DCCJ 2404/2005 (19 June 2009) at paras.59-61.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I disagree.  Upon proof of the tortuous act causing physical damage to the property, the liability of the defendant to compensatethe plaintiff accrues.  Unless there is evidence that the plaintiff never intends to or will not carry out the repair, the fact thatthe necessary repair is yet to be carried out is no bar to the claim for the cost of it.  Insofar as what the learned Judge (as hethen was) intended the short para.59 of <i>Tse Chit Sang</i> to really mean what Mr Fung suggested, I with respect would decline from agreeing.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Ceiling repair and re-painting</i></p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  According to the Expert Report, the area of the ceiling needing repair and repainting measured up to 275 square feet.  Mr Fung challengedthat, saying that the Leeâs should not have <i>carte blanche</i> to re-decorate the whole or its surroundings at the expense of his clients.  He relied on the caveat to such effect made by the learnedMaster in <i>Chan Fei Lung v Mansion Products Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20HKC%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] HKC 504.</a></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In principle, Mr Fung is right.  But I am not satisfied that in fact the projected repair to the ceiling exceeds what is reasonablynecessary to achieve the resultant effect of the repaired parts blending in with the existing whole.  The extent of damage to theceiling is quite apparent even by judging from the photographs.  In the absence of contrary expert evidence, I allow the cost ofrepairing the ceiling in the sum of HK$20,000 and repainting the ceiling in the sum of HK$10,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Wall re-painting</i></p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  A sum of HK$15,000 is claimed.  According to the Expert Report, the work would entail the removal of the old paint on the wall,application of primer and water based moisture resistant paint.  The area covered is 438 square feet.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I have reservation about this item of claim, in view of lack of evidence of significant, if any, damage to the wall of Flat 5K asa result of the water leakage.  I decide not to allow this item of claim.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Wall-mounted cabinet</i></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The cost of replacement of the wall-mounted cabinet in the sum of HK$9,000 is agreed.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Ceiling lightings</i></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  It was first pleaded that the cost of replacement of the hanging lightings was HK$6,000.  The amount was increased to HK$7,060 duringtrial.  Mr Li suggested that the amount consists of the cost of the lightings in the sum of HK$3,060 and the cost of work and labourin the sum of HK$4,000.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  According to the quotation H Lee obtained in February 2006, removal and installation of 4 sets of ceiling lightings would cost HK$3,000. According to the Expert Report, removal of the 4 sets of existing light fittings and replacement and reconnection of new light fittingswould cost HK$4,000.  Neither the quotation nor the Expert Report suggests that the quoted amount is for work and labour only. Theother items actually suggest quite the contrary.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The quoted HK$3,060 cost of the lightings was obtained in May 2010.  I do not consider the cost of removal of the old lightingsand the reconnecting of the new ones should amount to another HK$4,000.  For this item, I allow HK$4,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Replacement of the dining table</i></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr Fung submitted that it is unreasonable to replace the dining table.  Sheer water, as Mr Fung suggested, is not expected to stainthe marble top.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  But the evidence is more than that.  The water dripping from the ceiling, according to the Architect, came from flush and waterdrainage.  Both H Lee and the photographs suggested that the water was nothing but yellowish.  I am satisfied that it is not unreasonableto dispose of the table so stained.  I accept the evidence of the quoted cost of a replacement table at HK$6,950 and allow this sum.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Storage of furniture during repair</i></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The amount claimed was adjusted from HK$12,400 originally pleaded to HK$19,000 for packing, removal and storage (for 1 month) ofthe furniture items of Flat 5K before and after the repair.  In view of the extent of the repair work, and hence the necessary packing,removal and storage, needed inside the flat, I have reservation about the reasonableness of the amount claimed.  I allow HK$10,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Removal of debris and general cleaning</i></p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Mr Fung submitted that this item of cost is unnecessary, in view of the limited repair needed to the ceiling.  I do not agree. He then argued that alternatively, the cost should be lesser than that claimed.  The sum of HK$9,000 quoted does appear to be onthe high side.  I allow HK$6,000 instead.  I also allow the HK$6,000 claimed for professional cleaning of the flat after work.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Insurance</i></p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The Leeâs obtained a quotation for third party and workmen insurance to cover the repair work needed to be done.  Mr Fung suggestedthat the quoted amount should be adjusted downwards to reflect the limited area of the flat that needed repair.  Mr Fung could notconvince me with evidence of how, and by how much, the insurance premium would necessarily be less because of smaller area of work. I allow the amount of HK$5,000 claimed.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Alternative accommodation during repair</i></p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  I do not believe that the cost of alternative accommodation during repair is part of the cost of repair expected to be includedin the Expert Report.  Such cost is not within the expertise of the maker of the report.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Both counsel suggested that alternative accommodation could be rented at HK$8,000 per month.  That was indeed the rate at whichH Lee and her mother rented the flat that they moved into for 7 months in 2006.

There is dispute whether they are entitled to recover such cost.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  As mentioned above, the new canopy had to be removed pursuant to the building order issued by the BD to W C Lee on 22 January 2008. According to the terms of that building order, the canopy became subject of enforcement because it was unauthorised building work.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In its letter dated 3 April 2008, BD explained that the building was a target of 2006 âBlitzâ operation in which all lightweightcanopies projecting more than 500mm from the external wall of the building were actionable unauthorised building works subject toenforcement action.  The newly erected canopy exceeded that size and therefore fell into this category of actionable unauthorisedbuilding works.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In effect, any existing light weight canopies, be they old or newly erected, that projected from the external wall of the buildingfor more than 500mm would have had to be removed.  But for that, the new canopy outside Flat 5K would not have had been consideredto be caught.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In court, Shuk came up with evidence of how she managed to know that the new canopy was a copy of the original canopy insofar asthe size was concerned.  Her evidence in this respect is utterly unbelievable.  It is not proved that the original canopy would havebeen caught in the âBlitzâ operation so that he would have had to incur the cost of removing it in any event.  I find Cheungand Shuk are liable to indemnify the cost of demolishing that canopy erected by their contractor, i.e., HK$5,000.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Cost of rebuilding the canopy: item (3)</b></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The Leeâs also claim for the cost of re-installing a canopy on the external wall outside his flat. Mr Fung submitted that theyare not entitled to that.  Counsel exchanged argument on the principle of illegality.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The matter could be viewed in more practical terms.  No owner is in a position to claim the right to build any canopy on the externalwall of the building.  It matters not whether the intended canopy would project outside the external wall for more than 500mm ornot.  Such measurement could only be the criteria for selecting actionable cases as a matter of executive decision of the BD.  Thiswas more likely than not a matter of setting priority in enforcement, in view of the prevalent unauthorised structures outside buildingsin Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Mr Li submitted that it is possible for his client to obtain such authorisation to rebuild the canopy. This perhaps cannot be denied. But this, in my view, does not suffice for the purpose of substantiating the claim for the cost of it when there is no evidenceof even the slightest indication by the BD of its stance about such intended re-building work.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Medical expenses of H Lee: item (4)</b></p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  H Lee claims to have suffered from depression, anxiety, frustration, poor concentration, insomnia and various other physical conditionsas a result of the stressor created by the water leakage episode.  Numerous medical receipts and records were produced, which showthat H Lee has sought medical treatment from various practitioners including psychiatrists.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  As far as the consultation summaries of the psychiatric treatment can tell, a major complaint made by H Lee was indeed about thewater leakage episode.  The memorandum of Dr Lo Chun Wai, psychiatrist, who saw her in March 2006 suspected that she was sufferingfrom adjustment disorder.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  H Lee was referred to the Department of Psychiatry of the United Christian Hospital.  After the first consultation, the provisionaldiagnosis was mild depressive episode. Medication was prescribed and she continued her follow-up attendance until February 2008. She still complained about noise at night due to the sound of running water pipe upstairs.  But she took medication only when shecould not sleep well.  Other than that, her mood had improved.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Despite challenge by Mr Fung, I am satisfied that there was a causal link between the water leakage episode and H Leeâs psychiatriccondition.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Various medical receipts and sick leave recorded diagnosis such as allergic rhinitis, gastritis, epigastric pain and discomfort,non-ulcer dyspepsia, low back pain during menstruation, premenstrual syndrome, ovarian cyst and pelvic endometriosis.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In view of the evidence of the bulging and peeling off plaster and dust from the ceiling, which I accept, I am prepared to believethat there was some causal link between that and H Leeâs condition of allergic rhinitis.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  However, I would not say the same in respect of the other specific physical conditions.  It was suggested that H Lee did not haveany of these physical condition prior to the water leakage episode.  This is not entirely true.  For instance, the medical chit dated10 January 2006 recorded that H Lee had epigastric pain for months by then.  In any event, in the absence of proper medical opinionevidence, the causal link between those specific physical conditions and the water leakage episode is simply not obvious.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Considering the above, I allow a lump sum of HK$3,500 for the medical expenses.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Air ticket charges for the mother: item (5)</b></p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  According to H Lee, her mother was in her late 70s when she was distressed by what the water leakage did to the condition of thefamily home.  As a relief, and to save the cost of moving out, her mother went to stay with another daughter in the US during theperiod between March and August 2006.  In the meantime, H Lee moved out to stay with her elder sister in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  During the trial, it transpired that for that trip to the US in March 2006, the mother made use of the return trip of the round-tripticket previously purchased well before the water leakage episode by her daughter in the US. Notwithstanding H Leeâs explanationin court, I find that the mother was expected to make use of that ticket to visit her daughter in the US.  As that was expected,it cannot fairly be said that the cost of that return trip to the US was incurred as a result of the water leakage episode.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  For the motherâs return to Hong Kong in August 2006, it was again her daughter there who purchased another round-trip ticket forthe mother.  As the mother would have visited the US (by using the previous return trip ticket in hands), I doubt whether the burdenof paying for the following trip back to Hong Kong should fairly be the liability of Cheung and Shuk.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The water leakage episode might have affected the timing of that trip to the US.  But I am not satisfied that in principle and thefact, such cost was indeed caused by the tort committed by Cheung and Shuk.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Cost of alternative accommodation: item (6)</b></p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  H Lee and her mother moved out of Flat 5K during the period between 24 February and 23 September 2007.  According to H Lee, hermother was diagnosed with a serious disease in late 2006 to early 2007.  With a view to alleviate the possible effect of the thendisturbing and uncomfortable condition of the flat on her condition and recovery, H Lee decided to move out to rented accommodationon a temporary basis.  Through property agent, H Lee rented a flat at the monthly rent of HK$8,000.  According to H Lee, that wasa studio flat with a size of about 300 square feet.  The relevant tenancy agreement evidences that.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The flat was located at the Western District.  As H Lee explained in court, this was convenient for her mother to visit the QueenMary Hospital for treatment.  Mr Fung then questioned that proximity to the hospital was the real reason behind the decision to movethere, rather than the condition of Flat 5K.  He also suggested that notwithstanding the condition of the living-dining area, theother parts of the flat could still have been used.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Mr Fungâs suggestion is not fair.  I accept on the evidence that H Lee was quite entitled to take the view that the conditionof Flat 5K was not beneficial to the health condition and recovery of her mother.  This did not have to be the only reason. Accordingto the medical report from the United Christian Hospital dated 9 August 2010, this was also how H Lee explained to the psychiatristher decision to move out.  The concern about proximity of the alternative accommodation to the hospital might have influenced thechoice of the location, but not the decision to move out.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Considering the evidence, I am satisfied that both the rental expenses (in the sum of HK$56,000) and the incidental estate agencycommission (in the sum of HK$4,000) are reasonable and should be allowed.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Cost of the photographs: item (7)</b></p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The amount claimed in the sum of HK$368 is agreed.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Cost of infra-red examination: item (8)</b></p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The amount claimed in the sum of HK$2,500 is agreed.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Nuisance, distress, discomfort and inconvenience: item (9)</b></p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  There is no dispute that H Lee is entitled to claim general damages for the nuisance, distress, discomfort and inconvenience causedby the water leakage episode.  The parties differ as to the quantum.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Duration and severity of the damage</i></p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The water leakage was discovered in January 2006.  In court, she recounted the experience of being awakened by her mother in thesmall hours of one day in January 2006 because of the water dripping from the ceiling of the living-dining area.  Utensils had tobe placed on various spots to contain the water.  The utensils filled with water had to be emptied 2 times that day.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  In its letter dated 14 January 2006, the incorporated owners recorded the result of the joint inspection of Flat 6K.  Water wasfound dripping at the rate of 1 drop every 5 seconds.  The letter from the incorporated owners 2 weeks later recorded that the problemgot worse.  The joint inspection by the consultant contractor of BD confirmed the increased severity of the damage caused by thewater leakage.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  According to H Lee, affected by the dripping water, the television set in the living-dining area was left un-used.  Spark came outwhen the light switch was turned on.  The marble top of the dining table was stained.  As mentioned above, the Architect confirmedthat the water leakage came from the flush and water drainage pipes embedded in the raised floor slab upstairs.  The photographsshow that the water dripping and staining the dining table was not clear water.  The evidence also shows that the leakage had causedbulging of the ceiling plaster and peeling off of paint.  Mould grew.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In April 2006, the 2-inch hole on the ceiling of her bedroom was discovered.  The hole remained through and through for a few daysbefore the other side of the hole in Flat 6K was sort of covered up.  Though short-lived, the embarrassment and surprise caused toH Lee on top of the persistent water leakage should not be under-estimated.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  The Leeâs say that since discovered, the water leakage lasted until late 2008.  By letter in early September 2008, the solicitorsfor Leeâs indeed put on record the persistent water leakage.  However Cheung and Shuk contend that the leakage ceased in late 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Whether the water leakage in fact persisted during the period between late 2007 and late 2008, the evidence does not show significantaggravation of the condition of Flat 5K over that period.  Even according to H Lee in court, what was discovered in about September2007 was very small patch of water on top of the refrigerator on 2 occasions.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Nevertheless, the concern in the present case is not merely the duration of actual water leakage but that of the entire episode. It is significant to note that the Leeâs were made to put up with the situation as a result of the lack of responsible responseof Cheung and Shuk to the repeated complaint and intervention of the management office, the incorporated owners and the governmentdepartments.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Worse still, soon after securing the confirmation of the BD for complying with the order to remove the unauthorised drainage installationby raising the floor slab, Cheung and Shuk had them reinstalled.  This was contrary to the reminder against further unauthorisedbuilding works when their compliance was certified in April 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Whether the repetition of the unauthorised building works in fact caused any further water leakage, the uncertain situation simplydid not facilitate the commencement of repair work at Flat 5K.  The Expert Report made clear that any proposed repair works wouldbe futile if the seepage continues.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The conduct of Cheung and Shuk was clearly irresponsible use of their property for financial gain entirely without regard to thewell being of the other owners.  Seeing Shuk testify and considering what she said in court, I find her evidence to be incredible. I have no doubt that she chose to do what she did blatantly with her eyes shut to the obvious.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>H Leeâs condition</i></p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Details of the physical and mental condition of H Lee as a result of the episode were discussed above. I accept the evidence ofH Lee that the water leakage and the resultant condition of their family home had caused H Lee and her mother distress, discomfortand inconvenience.  If H Lee happened to be mentally more vulnerable to the situation, Cheung and Shuk would have take their victimas she is.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Quantum</i></p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  In <i>Lau Ting Hang &amp; Anor v Leung Chi Wing</i>, DCCJ 6539/2005 (18 February 2008), I said (at para.34) that for such intangible loss, there is no real formula of mathematical assessment(referring to <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>).
