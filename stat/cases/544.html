Introduction</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  Since 1991 the Plaintiff (â<u>Ma</u>â) carried on construction site sub-contracting business as main contractor dealing in high value construction contracts and contractdocumentation (eg quotations/tenders, contracts and invoices).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In 1998, Ma came to know the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (â<u>Wong Jr</u>â), a structural engineer, when they worked together at a construction site at Tai Ping Road (â<u>TPR Site</u>â). Afterwards they continued to work together at other construction sites, and kept in contact until Wong Jr left Hong Kong anddisappeared in/about April 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (â<u>Wong Sr</u>â) is Wong Jrâs father. All along he lived at the cockloft above the ground floor garage at No.22 Ho Man Tin Street, Kowloon (â<u>Cockloft</u>â) with his wife é¢ç§æ (â<u>Wife</u>â), daughter é»è¼å® (â<u>Daughter</u>â) and mother-in-law Koo Lan Ching (â<u>Koo</u>â). Wong Jr no longer lived there after he got married. Wong Sr did not dispute that Wong Jr left Hong Kong and disappeared in/aboutApril 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Since 1969 the Cockloft was rented by Kooâs husband. Wong Sr moved in with them in 1970 when he married the Wife. When Kooâshusband passed away, she became the tenant and paid the rent. The ground floor garage was initially used by the landlord and laterlet to an estate agency.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The present dispute arose out renovations to the Cockloft in/about 1999 (â<u>Renovation</u>â) by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant (â<u>Kou</u>â). It was not until early 2002 (ie about two years after completion of the Renovation) when Ma came with Wong Jr to the Cockloft(â<u>Home Visit</u>â) that he met and spoke with Wong Sr for the first time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>II. Maâs claim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Ma claimed Kou chased Wong Sr for unpaid charges for the Renovation (â<u>Charges</u>â). In/about August 1999, Wong Jr on behalf of Wong Sr asked Ma for a loan of HK$150,000.00 to be paid directly to Kou for partialsettlement of the Charges. Wong Jr offered to guarantee repayment of such loan. Although Ma and Wong Sr had no prior business/moneydealings, out of loyalty (ç¾©æ°£) and helpful spirit (å©äººç²¾ç¥) Ma agreed to grant such loan to Wong Sr (â<u>Alleged Loan</u>â or â<u>Alleged Loan Agreement</u>â) and paid the money to Kou directly.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In 2001-2002, Ma chased Wong Jr and Wong Sr in vain for repayment of the Alleged Loan. During the Home Visit Wong Sr agreed to repaythe Alleged Loan, but when Ma subsequently chased him he became evasive and eventually even changed his home telephone number (â<u>Home Number</u>â). After April 2002 Wong Jr could not be found, so Ma continued to chase Wong Sr. In the latter half of 2002, Ma engaged debt collectionservice to no avail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In/about mid-2003, Wong Sr agreed to repay the Alleged Loan to Ma by monthly deposit of HK$4,000.00 into Maâs bank account untilfull repayment (â<u>Maâs Agreement</u>â). Between 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2003 and 4<sup>th</sup> May 2005, Wong Sr paid Ma a total sum of HK$95,000.00 by 24 instalments (â<u>Paid Sum</u>â), but failed to make further repayment. Ma claimed for the outstanding balance of the Alleged Loan in the sum of HK$55,000.00and damages for breach of contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>III. Wong Srâs defence and counterclaim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Wong Sr denied he borrowed any money from Ma or authorised Wong Jr to do so on his behalf. Since the latter half of 2002 debt collectorsposted up or left dunning letters (â<u>Dunning Letters</u>â) at the Cockloft. In 2003 red paint was sprayed over the main entrance of the Cockloft (â<u>Paint</u> <u>Spray</u> <u>Incident</u>â). Wong Sr claimed that Ma authorised these activities with a view to persuade him to make payments. Wong Sr reported such incidentsto the police, but feared for his and his familyâs safety. In such circumstances, Wong Sr agreed under duress to make monthly depositsof HK$4,000.00 into Maâs bank account up to a limit of HK$100,000.00 (â<u>Wong Srâs Agreement</u>â).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Wong Sr agreed that between 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2003 and 4<sup>th</sup> May 2005 he paid the Paid Sum to Ma, but mistakenly thought he had paid HK$100,000.00. After 4<sup>th</sup> May 2005, Ma turned back on his word and wrongfully demanded further payment of HK$50,000.00 (now HK$55,000.00) accompanied by furthernuisance from debt collectors. Wong Sr denied Maâs claim and counterclaimed for restitution of monies he paid under duress.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>IV. Legal proceedings</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In November 2005 Ma commenced legal proceedings in the Small Claims Tribunal against the Wife, Daughter and Kou for recovery ofthe outstanding balance of the Alleged Loan in the sum of HK$50,000.00 (â<u>SCT Claim</u>â). On 16<sup>th</sup> January 2006 (ie shortly after the first hearing on 11<sup>th</sup> January 2006), Ma wholly discontinued the SCT Claim against all defendants. On the same day, he commenced the present proceedingsagainst Wong Sr, Wong Jr and Kou.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 24<sup>th</sup> February 2006, Maâs claim against Kou was struck out. On 28<sup>th</sup> March 2007, Ma wholly discontinued his claim against Wong Jr. I am only concerned with Maâs claim against Wong Sr and Wong Srâsdefence and counterclaim against Ma.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Save for Maâs challenge to the authenticity of two faxes respectively dated 16<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> September 2003 (â<u>16/9/03 and 18/9/03 Faxes</u>â or collectively â<u>Disputed Faxes</u>â), the documents in the trial bundle were agreed as to admissibility and authenticity.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Ma, Wong Sr and Koo gave evidence. Ma intended to call Kou as his witness, but Mr Wong, counsel for Ma, informed the court thatMaâs solicitors were unable to serve the witness subpoena on Kou. However, it transpired from Maâs evidence that after he gavethe Alleged Loan to and thereby came to know Kou, they became such good friends thathe introduced Kou to work on decoration projectsin Macau. Ma also confirmed â[Ma]å®¶ä¸é½æå[Kou]ä¾å¾â up to the time of trial. He even saw Kou a few days before trialat a MTR station.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Such evidence does not sit well with the suggestion of being âunableâ to serve the witness subpoena on Kou. Although Ma saidhe maintained contact with Kou, there is no evidence he invited Kou to clarify the Renovation, Charges, Cheque (see below) and hisdealings with Wong Sr (if any), or to give evidence on these matters. One is left to wonder (as Mr Chan, solicitor for Wong Sr, did)whether such âinabilityâ to serve the witness subpoena was in fact an election not to have Kou testify so that adverse inferencesmight be drawn (see <i>Ip Man Shan Henry v Ching Hing Construction Co Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKC%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKC 256</a>, 307). However, in coming to my decision below, it is unnecessary for me to draw adverse inferences from the omission to call Kouto testify.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In assessing witnessesâ credibility, the court should consider the totality of their evidence against the documentary evidence,inferences based on inherent improbabilities and/or undisputed facts (see the principles set out by Chung J at paragraph 12 of <i>Star</i> <i>Glory Investment Ltd v Kai Tua (H.K.) Technology Ltd &amp; ors</i> HCA3523/2002 (unreported, 13<sup>th</sup> August 2005)).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In my view, Ma was not honest or reliable. His evidence was unimpressive and in some respects unbelievable when viewed against undisputeddocument(s). I have come to the unhappy conclusion that Ma made up some aspects of his evidence, which immediately casts doubt onhis overall credibility. He gave the distinct impression of being prepared to go to any length to recover the Alleged Loan irrespectiveof the propriety of his assertions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On the other hand, even though I am ultimately not with Wong Sr on his counterclaim, I find he gave clear and straightforward evidencein respect of the events that happened. Although he must have been aggrieved by Wong Jrâs prodigal behaviour that put him and hisfamily in the present jeopardy and disconcerted by the demands by Ma and the debt collectors, his fortitude that was so eloquentin his demeanour and testimony gave his evidence on factual events a ring of truth. As for Koo, who was almost 90 years old at thetime of trial, her evidence on the various incidents she personally experienced is plainly honest and truthful.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>V.

I further accept Wong Sr did not discuss the Renovation or Chargeswith Kou because (and Kou knew) Wong Jr rather than Wong Sr was responsible for the Renovation and Charges.

Secondly, since Ma believed that Wong Jr also lived at the renovated Cockloft, Wong Srâs residencethereat was not determinative of the identity of the borrower of the Alleged Loan or the contracting party who commissioned the Renovation.Thirdly, if Ma claimed Wong Sr enjoyed the fruits of the Renovation, he must have thought Wong Jr also shared the same benefit. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The other reason Ma gave for believing Wong Sr to be the true borrower of the Alleged Loan was that Wong Jr previously brought himto the ground floor vicinity of No.22 Ho Man Tin Street, Kowloon.

However, Maâs reference toWong Jr being an engineer in fact lent weight to the view that he looked towards Wong Jr rather than Wong Sr for repayment.

I reject Maâs claim in respectof the Alleged Loan Agreement and Alleged Loan. There is insufficient evidence before this court as to the details of the true arrangementbetween Ma and Wong Jr. But since Ma paid Kou the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Payments which Kou acknowledged in the Kou Defence to be part payment of the Charges, I am prepared to find that Ma lent such sumsto Wong Jr who commissioned the Renovation and who was therefore liable for the Charges.

Kou gave Ma a copy of a cheque for HK$150,000.00 (exhibit D1, â<u>Cheque</u>â) which he claimed was dishonoured, so he asked Wong Sr to settle the remaining balance of the Charges.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(b) Cheque</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The copy Cheque was dated 9<sup>th</sup> June 2000 and drawn by Ma on behalf of Shing Fai Engineering Co (Maâs sole proprietorship company) on Dao Heng Bank payable toKou in the sum of HK$150,000.00. There was a stamp by Hang Seng Bank Limited across the face of the copy Cheque.

Ma did not know whether any passenger would have takenthe Cheque, but there might have been such opportunity if he (as driver) had to leave to his car.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Ma had no idea the Cheque was missing from his chequebook. When his solicitors informed him of the copy Cheque disclosed by WongSr in the present proceedings, he checked his bank statements and found an entry in early July 2000 showing that the Cheque was dishonouredupon presentation for payment. Ma said he had no prior knowledge of such dishonour because he rarely visited his friendâs officeat Kowloon Bay (which was used as his correspondence address with the bank) and did not read his bank statements. But after he becameaware of the copy Cheque, Ma still did not ask Kou for clarification (because he did not suffer any loss) or report loss of the Chequeto the police (because he did not wish to become embroiled in further litigation).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(d) Discussion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  I have no hesitation in accepting Wong Srâs evidence in paragraph 32 above whilst I regard Maâs explanation to be a blatantuntruth. In my view, Wong Jr was so financially straitened that he caused Ma to pay not only the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Payments to Kou, but also a further sum of HK$150,000.00, which Ma did in June 2000 by way of the Cheque that was subsequently dishonoured.This would be consistent with what Kou told Wong Sr in 2001 and as stated in the Kou Defence. Since Kou did not receive the balanceof the Charges due to the dishonour of the Cheque and Wong Jrâs failure to pay, Kou approached Wong Sr in 2001 to press for payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I find it wholly incredible that Ma would write the Cheque in the manner described above if all he wished to do was to record thefact he gave HK$150,000.00 to Kou. Ma retained the pay-in slip as record of the 1<sup>st</sup> Payment, and he could easily have asked for a copy of the cheque for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Payment from his bankers even if he had not retained any copy. Had Ma wished to make a personal record of the Alleged Loan, he couldhave written on the cheque stub, chequebook cover or even on the back of the Cheque. If he had to write on the face of the Cheque(although there was no good reason why), he could have written a narrative record without filling in the particulars as if it werea <i>bona fide</i> cheque and/or sign his name as drawer. Ma could not satisfactorily explain why he crossed the Cheque or dated it with a date (ie9<sup>th</sup> June 2000) wholly irrelevant to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Payments. The overall evidence suggested the Cheque was intended to be a cheque payable to Kou on 9<sup>th</sup> June 2000, which echoes the conclusion in paragraph 38 above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  This is further supported by the fact that the Cheque had been presented for payment. Since it was a crossed cheque and the tenorof Maâs evidence in paragraph 34 above was that Kou presented it for deposit into his bank account, the irresistible conclusionin light of what Kou told Wong Sr (see paragraph 32 above which evidence I accept) was that the Cheque was dishonoured when Kou presentedit for payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Maâs claim that the Cheque inexplicably disappeared does not hold water at all. There was no evidence Kou had ever been a passengerin Maâs car. It is impossible to imagine that someone would have taken the Cheque from Maâs car and attempted to or passed toKou to attempt to deposit it into Kouâs bank account when such person could not assume that Ma would not read his bank statementsand thereby would not discover the dealings in relation to the Cheque in the following month. Maâs assertions were so incrediblethat they are unbelievable. His untruths in this respect severely and adversely affect his overall credibility and reliability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>IX. Wong Srâs payment to Kou</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I accept Wong Sr did not know the arrangement between Wong Jr and Kou, but when Kou asked him to pay the balance of the Chargesin/about 2001 Wong Sr was persuaded to do so by various instalments over a period of one odd year. Wong Sr emphasised he had no obligationto pay the Charges because the Renovation was arranged between Wong Jr and Kou. He went on to say in his witness statement dated28<sup>th</sup> June 2006 <i>inter alia</i> that âåå¾[Wong Jr]å çºç¶æ¿åé¡ï¼å[Wong Sr]åé¢æ¯ä»é¨ä»½è£ä¿®è²»äºå·¥äºº[Kou]ï¼[Wong Sr]ç­æï¼ä¸¦å·²ä»£çºåæä»æ¸åå­[WongJr]æ¬ [Kou]çè£ä¿®è²»ï¼éæ¹æ©å·²è§£æ±ºè£ä¿®è²»äºå®â. Save that at the material time Wong Sr was unaware of Kouâs allegationin the Kou Defence that the total Charges were HK$270,000.00, the above matters were consistent with the Kou Defence (see paragraph20 above).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In my view, Wong Sr did not assume any personal or contractual liability for the Charges by making payment to Kou. Contractual liabilityfor paying the Charges fell squarely on Wong Jr, and Wong Sr merely made voluntary payments to Kou to help Wong Jr who was then infinancial difficulties. One cannot ignore the familial relationship between Wong Sr and Wong Jr. Wong Sr very fairly did not doubtKou actually incurred costs and charges for the Renovation. I find the above factors prompted Wong Srâs willingness to make somevoluntary payments, but it is a far cry from adopting liability for the Charges. This is also in line with Wong Srâs stance thathe would have awaited clarification from Wong Jr and not made payment had Kou asked for the full Charges of HK$300,000.00.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>X. Maâs alleged demand for the Alleged Loan</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Ma claimed that since Wong Sr failed to repay the Alleged Loan, he chased Wong Jr and asked to meet Wong Sr directly. This, Ma claimed,led to the Home Visit in early 2002. In light of the above findings, I disagree that Wong Sr failed to repay the Alleged Loan. However,I accept Ma did chase Wong Jr for loan repayment some time before the Home Visit, but even on Maâs case there was no satisfactoryexplanation why he chased Wong Jr when the deadline for repayment was only by Chinese New Year in 2002. This raised doubt as to thetruthfulness of Maâs assertions in relation to the Alleged Loan Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XI. Home Visit</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  There is no dispute Ma came with Wong Jr to the Cockloft in early 2002 and was introduced to Wong Sr. This was the first time Maand Wong Sr met or spoke with each other.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(a) Maâs case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Ma claimed that during the Home Visit he also met the Wife and an old lady (later known as Koo). When he chased Wong Sr for repaymentof the Alleged Loan, Wong Sr admitted liability and promised to repay as soon as possible. At that time Ma thought Wong Jr was stillliving at the Cockloft.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(b) Wong Srâs case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Wong Sr claimed the Home Visit was in early 2002 before Chinese New Year. He was entertaining friends at the Cockloft when WongJr and Ma showed up. Wong Sr thought Ma was a friend of Wong Jr. They left after a while. Although Ma paid another visit to the Cockloftduring Chinese New Year, Wong Sr was not at home. He was subsequently informed of Maâs visit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(c) Discussion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Since I have found there was no Alleged Loan or Alleged Loan Agreement, I disagree Wong Jr specifically brought Ma to the Cockloftto introduce him to Wong Sr so that he could chase Wong Sr for repayment of the Alleged Loan. I also do not accept that during theHome Visit Ma chased Wong Sr for repayment of the Alleged Loan or Wong Sr admitted liability and promised to repay the same. Moreimportantly, without any Alleged Loan or Alleged Loan Agreement, there was no reason for Wong Sr to agree to any repayment. I preferWong Srâs evidence that he was entertaining friends at the Cockloft when his son (ie Wong Jr) dropped by with a friend (ie Ma).It was not surprising given that the Cockloft was close to where they worked (ie the TPR Site).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XII.  Authority of Wong Jr</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Even if Ma and Wong Jr entered into the Alleged Loan Agreement (which I disagree), I am of the view that Wong Jr did not have anyactual authority to borrow the Alleged Loan on behalf of Wong Sr. Wong Sr did not even know about the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Payments until Kou told him in 2001, so such knowledge had no bearing on the issue of Wong Jrâs actual authority in August 1999.Further, the Home Visit also did not evidence any actual authority by Wong Jr to enter into the Alleged Loan Agreement on behalfof Wong Sr or amount to Wong Srâs ratification of such agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  I do not accept Mr Wongâs submission that because Wong Sr and not Wong Jr lived at the Cockloft and the Alleged Loan was for partialsettlement of the Charges that Wong Jr had apparent authority to borrow the Alleged Loan on behalf of Wong Sr. Such submission wasbased on a mistaken understanding of Maâs case. In fact, Ma claimed he all along believed Wong Jr, a working adult with a respectablejob, also lived at the Cockloft. Consequently, Wong Srâs residence at the Cockloft would not amount to any unequivocal representationto Ma that Wong Jr had authority to act on his behalf not just in respect of the Renovation but also to seek finance to pay for thesame.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Since there was no communication between Wong Sr and Ma prior to early 2002, all that was left was Wong Jrâs representation toMa. But Deputy Judge Ribeiro QC (as he then was) in <i>Leung Shuk Kam v Cheung Suet Fun Maria Ausilla and anor</i> HCA6182/1991 (unreported, 7<sup>th</sup> October 1992) said at paras.34 and 35 that :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦ It is elementary and not disputed that in law a person does not constitute himself an agent simply by asserting, however convincingly,that he has been appointed as such by the alleged principal. â¦â¦ In such a case, â¦â¦ unless the principal has subsequentlyratified the purported agentâs conduct, that conduct does not result in a contract binding on the principalâ. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">In such circumstances, there was no effective holding out by Wong Sr that Wong Jr had authority to borrow the Alleged Loan on hisbehalf.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XIII. Benefit from the Alleged Loan Agreement</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr Wong argued that even if Wong Jr did not have any actual or apparent authority to enter into the Alleged Loan Agreement on behalfof Wong Sr, the Alleged Loan was applied for the benefit of Wong Sr who lived at the renovated Cockloft, so he was liable in equityto restore such monies to the extent that they had been so applied.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  This alternative cause of action was not pleaded. At the commencement of trial Mr Wong applied for leave (which I granted) to furtheramend the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, but he did not seek leave to plead such alternative cause of action. Nevertheless, Mr Wongpursued it in his closing submissions. Unsurprisingly, Mr Chan (who had by that time finished his closing submissions) objected.When I enquired whether he wished to seek leave to further amend Maâs pleadings, Mr Wong declined saying that Ma was entitled toraise such alternative cause of action without amendment since it was a mere matter of law. I disagreed and disallowed him from doingso.

After September 2003, Ma could not contact Mr Leung who likeWong Jr had disappeared.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Ma did not know the name of the debt collection company (because Mr Leung did not tell him) or its responsible or contact person.The debt collection company did not charge him any fees for the debt collection service. Ma did not know whether debt collectorswent to the Cockloft in March/April 2003 and/or telephoned to demand payment. Ma claimed that even if they did, they were not onhis instructions. He only became aware of the debt collection activities much later when the police told him to recover any indebtednessby proper means (ie by civil claim). But he knew that at some stage Wong Sr changed the Home Number.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(c) Discussion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  I accept that Wong Sr made reports to the police in relation to debt collection activities as early as in 2002-2003 and in relationto the Paint Spray Incident in May 2003. It is also common ground that Ma retained the services of a debt collection company. I findhe did so in the latter half of 2002 (ie after Wong Jr disappeared in April 2002 and Wong Sr refused to pay) as Wong Sr said andas Ma admitted in his pleadings, and not from mid-2003 to September 2003 as Ma alleged in his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  I further find that pursuant thereto debt collectors telephoned the Home Number and visited the Cockloft to dun for payment of HK$150,000.00(eg posting up/leaving Dunning Letters, kicking the main entrance, committing the Paint Spray Incident and making a nuisance of themselves).Although the identities of those who committed these acts were unknown, I find as a matter of inference they were seeking to collectrepayment of Maâs loan of HK$150,000.00 to Wong Jr (see paragraph 30 above) or make demands related to such loan.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I find Maâs vagueness unconvincing. Although he claimed he did not remember the name of the debt collection company or its responsibleor contact person, he admitted he had been contacted by someone from the debt collection company, and more interestingly he was ableto engage the debt collection company for debt collection service again in 2005 (see paragraphs 105-109 below) when Mr Leung (whomMa said made all the arrangements on his behalf) had already disappeared. Further, Ma admitted the police liaised with him over debtcollection matters shortly before he commenced the SCT Claim in November 2005. I find Maâs inability to recall any details suspect.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  I further find Ma was liable for the actions of the debt collectors notwithstanding the terms of the alleged arrangement betweenMa and the debt collection company <i>inter alia</i> that the latter should use lawful means. Similar scenario has been considered by the Court of Appeal in <i>Wong Wai Hing &amp; another v Hui Wai Lee</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%201%20HKLRD%20736" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 1 HKLRD 736</a>, which neither Mr Wong nor Mr Chan cited.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In that case, the defendant engaged the services of a debt collection agency to obtain payment of an unpaid debt. The contract providedthat only lawful means would be used for collecting the debt. But the defendantâs operatives used threats and engaged in conductthat constituted assault and intimidation. It was held on appeal that the defendant was liable for the actions of the debt collectionagency.

I will discuss below whether the debt collection activitiesconstituted duress.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XVI.

Wong Sr said he did so inorder to protect his family from further disturbance, but made clear this was not his ârepaymentâ as he never borrowed moneyfrom Ma. Wong Sr said had Ma refused to accept the above offer he would not have paid HK$150,000.00 to Ma.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Wong Sr in his witness statement dated 28<sup>th</sup> June 2006 said that ââ¦â¦ [Wong Sr]æ¯å¨è¢«åé·ææ»æ¾åææ¼çææ³ä¸ï¼ç¡å¥å[Ma]ä½åºå¯ä¸ä¸æ¬¡å£é ­åè­°ï¼ä½ä¸¦éå¿ç¶çç¾©åææ¿è«¾ï¼æ¯æ[WongSr]çç¶æ¿çæ³èå®ï¼åææ«ä»£[Wong Jr]ééæ¯é  âä¾æ­·ä¸æçæ¬ æ¬¾âï¼ä»¥æ¾è¬åçºä¸éï¼æééæ¹é½è¦å°æ¾[WongJr]å°è³ªâ.

Wong Sr admittedhe owed Ma the Alleged Loan and voluntarily proposed to make monthly instalment payments of HK$4,000.00 each until full repayment.Wong Sr also promised to accelerate payment whenever he had more money. Ma claimed there was no reason for him to agree to Wong SrâsAgreement as it did not reflect the true indebtedness due to him.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(c) Discussion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(1) Wong Srâs Agreement</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  On balance I reject Maâs evidence and find the parties reached agreement in terms of Wong Srâs Agreement. Despite Maâs demandsto Wong Sr for payment, Wong Sr steadfastly refused to make any payment for more than a year after Wong Jrâs disappearance. Madid not give any satisfactory explanation why Wong Sr suddenly offered to make instalment payments for the entire Alleged Loan inmid-2003. I find Wong Sr only offered to make instalment payments up to a limit of HK$100,000.00 because he was disconcerted by thedebt collection activities and wanted to put an end to the nuisance. I further find Ma accepted the offer although the proposed paymentwas less than the Alleged Loan because he knew he had no right to dictate terms.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  There was also no reason for Wong Sr to offer (and I find he did not offer) to make accelerated payment if possible. Maâs evidencein this respect was startling when Wong Sr had been unwilling to make payment at all over the past year or so. This is nothing buta poor attempt to explain away the actual accelerated payments made by Wong Sr in September 2003 under Wong Srâs Agreement (seeparagraph 88 below).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Given my finding against the existence of any Alleged Loan Agreement, I disagree that Wong Sr offered to repay the Alleged Loan.However, Mr Wong seized upon the Chinese characters âæ¤éâ in paragraph 4 of Wong Srâs witness statement dated 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2006 to submit that Wong Srâs offer to make instalment payments was for repayment of the Alleged Loan. In my view, WongSrâs choice of Chinese characters must be read in context of his homemade witness statement (ie he was unrepresented at that time).In paragraph 4 of such witness statement, Wong Sr made clear it was out of concern over his familyâs safety that he entered intoWong Srâs Agreement âä»¥æ¸¯å¹£æ¾è¬ååéæ¤éâ. These references to his familyâs safety and to the amount of HK$100,000.00were plainly inconsistent with any contractual obligation to repay the Alleged Loan of HK$150,000.00. I also bear in mind that inparagraph 6 of the same witness statement Wong Sr clearly denied any liability to make repayment to Ma on behalf of Wong Jr. Uponproper construction, Wong Sr did not âadmitâ liability to repay the Alleged Loan by using the Chinese characters âæ¤éâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>(2) Ratification</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Since I have found there were no Alleged Loan Agreement and/or Alleged Loan on behalf of Wong Sr, there was no contract or loanfor Wong Sr to ratify. But even if I am wrong, I do not agree Wong Srâs Agreement could amount to any effective ratification.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  <i>Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency</i> 18<sup>th</sup> ed (2006) para.2-070 at p.77 made clear that an express ratification must be âa clear manifestation by one on whose behalf an unauthorisedact has been done that <i>he treats the act as authorised and becomes a party to the transaction in question</i>â (my emphasis). <i>Halsburyâs Laws of Hong Kong</i> Vol.1(2) 2003 Reissue para.[15.025] stated that â[ratification] can be effected by words or conduct <i>unequivocally showing an intention to adopt the agentâs act</i> â¦â¦â (my emphasis). But my findings above plainly showed that Wong Sr did not by Wong Srâs Agreement or by payment of themonthly instalments thereunder to Ma (a) agree to make payments as contracting party to and/or principal debtor under the AllegedLoan Agreement or (b) adopt such agreement or the Alleged Loan as his own. In the circumstances, there is no basis to support anyratification.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Mr Wong relied on the following passage from <i>Halsburyâs Laws of Hong Kong</i> Vol.1(2) 2003 Reissue para.[15.025] :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦â¦ Voluntary acceptance of the benefit of the <i>agentâs act</i> constitutes ratification.

There was no evidence to establish that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had any authority to act as agent, but the deposit paid by the plaintiffs was paid into the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs bank account and the estate agent told the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant it was intended to be the deposit payable under the provisional agreement. On the following day, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant transferred such deposit sum from her account to the account of her elder sister. It was held that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs retention of the money and her transfer of such money to her sister evidenced implied ratification of the provisionalagreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  But the facts in <i>Leung Shuk Kam</i> were a far cry from the factual circumstances in the present case. In that case, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant kept and transferred the money as deposit under the provisional agreement to her sister, so such conduct ratified âtheactâ of the agent. Here, Wong Sr made clear to Ma he did not endorse the act of Wong Jr and he only made the offer to pay instalmentpayments in order to get rid of the nuisance caused by demands from Ma and/or debt collectors. There was no voluntary acceptanceof Wong Jrâs act.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Mr Wong next suggested that even if Wong Sr was unaware that Wong Jr borrowed the Alleged Loan on his behalf and/or Ma paid theproceeds of the Alleged Loan to Kou for the Charges pursuant to the Alleged Loan Agreement, âit was subsequently ratified by [WongSrâs] voluntary acceptance of the benefit of [Wong Jrâs] actâ in that he did not ask Kou to return the sum of HK$150,000.00to Ma and pay such sum to Kou himself for the Charges. I cannot accept such contention. There was no contractual obligation for WongSr to pay the Charges to Kou. The relevant contracting party for the Renovation was Wong Jr. Wong Sr at best accepted his sonâsfilial efforts to upgrade his living condition by renovating the Cockloft. But it was not voluntary acceptance of Wong Jrâs actof borrowing money from Ma to pay for the Charges, which was Wong Jrâs and not his obligation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Whilst I have no disagreement with the principles set out in <i>Republic of Peru v Peruvian Quano Company</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2036%20Ch%20D%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 36 Ch D 489</a> and <i>In re Mawcon Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20WLR%2078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 1 WLR 78</a>, in light of my findings above, Wong Srâs willingness to make payment to Ma up to a limit of HK$100,000.00 was not an adoptionof part of the Alleged Loan Agreement that operated as ratification of the whole.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Mr Wong submitted otherwise. He relied on two contentions. First, by residing in the Cockloft with his family (including the Wife,Daughter and Koo), Wong Sr âobtained the benefit of the [Renovation] when [Ma] made the payment in the amount of HK$150,000.00under the [Alleged Loan Agreement]â. Secondly, the Alleged Loan was obtained and applied for Wong Srâs benefit âto dischargehis obligation to pay for [the Charges], and [Wong Sr] accepted the benefit notwithstanding he had no knowledge of the sameâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  I can dispose of these arguments simply on my finding that Wong Sr was not contractually obliged to pay the Charges to Kou or torepay the Alleged Loan to Ma. I have also explained in paragraphs 28 and 50 above why Wong Srâs mere residence at the renovatedCockloft was not enough. Further, these arguments ran dangerously close to the alternative cause of action which I have disallowed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  In short, there was never âacting [by Wong Sr] in accordance with the terms of contract made by the agent [ie Wong Jr]â or anyunequivocal adoption by Wong Sr of the Alleged Loan Agreement or the Alleged Loan.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XVII.

Ma realised the same when hewent through the documents with his solicitors for the purpose of the present proceedings, which in my view explained why the DunningLetters and the SCT Claim in 2005 only claimed for HK$50,000.00 (see paragraphs 105-106 and 110 below). Wong Sr was also under theimpression he had paid HK$100,000.00 until he checked the documents recently.

I accept that the Disputed Faxes as well as the Junk Fax were received <i>via</i> the Fax Machine at the times and in the manner described in paragraph 93 above, which together with the contents of the DisputedFaxes sat well with the timing and amount of Wong Srâs actual payment of the first eight instalment payments to Ma. Plainly WongSr acted on the instructions in the Disputed Faxes. Since Ma failed to offer any satisfactory explanation for the accelerated paymentsand given his lack of credibility, I reject his claim that the Disputed Faxes and his signatures thereon were forgeries. Having studiedMaâs signatures on the Disputed Faxes, copy Cheque, Re-Amended Writ, Re-Re-Amended Statement of Claim, witness statement, and Noticeof Discontinuance of the SCT Claim, I am unable to agree that the signatures on the Disputed Faxes were distinctly different. Indeed,Ma confessed that other than his signature on the copy Cheque, Wong Sr would not have known how he signed his name.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  In any event, as I have found there was no Alleged Loan Agreement, I do not accept Mr Wongâs argument that Wong Srâs instalmentpayments were partial repayments under the Alleged Loan Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XVII.

He referred to <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2007</i> Vol.1 para.18/8/9 at p.308 which states that a claim or a defence raising duress âshould contain full particulars of the factsand circumstances relied upon as to where, when, by whom, over whom and in what way duress was exercisedâ (see also <i>Tudor Grange Holdings Ltd &amp; others v Citibank NA &amp; another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%203%20WLR%20750" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 3 WLR 750</a>, 765).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Paragraph 4 of Wong Srâs Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim pleaded <i>inter alia</i> that Dunning Letters were placed at the Cockloft and Wong Sr was disturbed and intimidated by the demands to pay HK$150,000.00. Ido not need to deal with Mr Wongâs pleading point because save for a few incidents (eg the debt collectors kicking the main doorand/or main gate of the Cockloft and the Paint Spray Incident) Wong Srâs evidence in relation to the activities of the debt collectorsprior to mid-2003 lacked particularity on the specific threatening, intimidating or disturbing words/conduct and on the gist of thewords used by the debt collectors over the telephone or on visits to the Cockloft for demanding payment. There was no evidence asto the specific threatening and/or intimidating contents of the Dunning Letters (other than demand for payment) prior to mid-2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  In the circumstances, although I accept the debt collectors made approaches and a nuisance of themselves to persuade payment,  otherthan kicking the main door and/or metal gate of the Cockloft and the Paint Spray Incident which might cause some concern, Wong Srâsevidence as to the gist of the acts and what was said was far from satisfactory to support the assertion of illegitimate pressureamounting to intimidation, exhortation, threat, bullying, harassment and ultimately duress.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  In <i>Pao On v Lau Yiu Long</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 614</a>, 635 Lord Scarman said as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Duress, whatever form it takes, is the coercion of the will so as to vitiate consent â¦â¦ In determining whether there was a coercionof the will such that there was no true consent, it is material to inquire whether the person alleged to have been coerced did ordid not protest; whether, at the time he was allegedly coerced into making the contract, he did or did not have an alternative courseopen to him such as an adequate legal remedy; whether he was independently advised; and <i>whether after entering the contract he took steps to avoid it</i>.â (my emphasis) </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  In <i>Universe Tankships of Monrovia v ITWF</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20AC%20366" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 AC 366</a>, 384, Lord Diplock said the rationale was that the partyâs consent was induced by illegitimate pressure with the consequence thatthe consent was treated in law as revocable. Lord Scarman, who dissented on an immaterial issue, said at p.400 that the classic caseof duress was not the lack of will to submit but the victimâs intentional submission arising from the realisation that there wasno practical choice open to him.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Having considered the totality of the evidence, I am not convinced it was Maâs wrongful or illegitimate threat/pressure leadingto an absence of practical choice that persuaded Wong Sr to enter into Wong Srâs Agreement and to pay the Paid Sum to Ma.

Clearly he did not succumb to Maâs pressure to make him pay HK$150,000.00. He even saidhe would not have agreed to pay if Ma insisted on payment of HK$150,000.00. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Wong Sr also made clear he had a choice whether to make payments under Wong Srâs Agreement and he would only pay if his financialsituation permitted. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">All along Wong Sr reported the debt collection activities in 2002-2003 (including the Paint Spray Incident) to the police and cooperatedin police investigation without any suggestion of fear of retribution. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The instalment payments under Wong Srâs Agreement were paid over a period of two years. Prior to the counterclaim herein, thereis no evidence that Wong Sr ever took any steps to disavow or dispute Wong Srâs Agreement or that he complained to the police aboutand/or took steps to set aside Wong Srâs Agreement even though he again reported to the police about debt collection activitiesin 2005 (see paragraph 105-108 below). In the circumstances, even if there had been any duress, Wong Sr had affirmed the agreement.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Accordingly, Wong Sr failed to satisfy me he entered into Wong Srâs Agreement and paid the Paid Sum under duress. I find he consciouslydid so because he wanted to put an end to the nuisance arising from Maâs demands and the debt collection activities, but his willwas not overborne or deflected.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XVIII. After 4th May 2005</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Wong Sr claimed that several months after 4<sup>th</sup> May 2005, Ma went back on his word under Wong Srâs Agreement and again engaged debt collectors (who targeted the Daughter thistime) to collect payment of HK$50,000.00. The Dunning Letters demanded the Daughter to pay HK$50,000.00 which were consistent withthe SCT Claim against <i>inter alia</i> the Daughter for HK$50,000.00. I have no hesitation in drawing the inference that the debt collectors acted on behalf of Ma. WongSr made various reports to the police which were still under investigation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  On 28<sup>th</sup> October 2005 debt collectors came to the Cockloft to demand the Daughter to pay HK$50,000.00. On 25<sup>th</sup> November 2005, debt collectors came to the Cockloft to demand for payment and to post up Dunning Letters. Wong Sr reported theseincidents to the police.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  On 29<sup>th</sup> December 2005, Koo opened the main door of the Cockloft but not the metal gate when the doorbell rang. She saw a stranger who saidMa asked him to demand the Daughter to make payment. The stranger banged on the metal gate four to five times after Koo closed thedoor. The lights at the Cockloft suddenly went out. Koo was frightened and Wong Sr later discovered the main electricity switch outsidethe Cockloft had been switched off. This incident was reported to the police.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In December 2005, the debt collectors (who claimed to be acting on Maâs instructions) visited the Cockloft to post up and/or leaveDunning Letters demanding Wong Jr to repay to Ma a sum of HK$300,000.00. Wong Srâs witness statement dated 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2006 stated that the debt collectors âèªªæ¯[Ma]åçµ¦[Wong]è²·è»ä¹ç¨â, which was confirmed by Ma. Since Wong Jr haddisappeared, Ma hoped to flush him out by chasing his family members. Ma said that as advised by the police he eventually issueda civil claim to recover the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  The above debt collection activities were irrelevant to the issue of duress vis-Ã -vis Wong Srâs Agreement and the payments thereunder.However, they showed that whilst Ma clearly knew by 2005 that Wong Jr had left Hong Kong and disappeared, he was not above usingdebt collectors to cause nuisance to those whom he admittedly knew did not owe him any money (eg the Daughter) in attempts to getpayment. I find Ma would go to any lengths to recover what he had paid to Kou and the propriety of his demands meant little to him.I find him wholly untrustworthy.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XIX. SCT Claim</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  Although Ma knew the Wife and Daughter did not owe him any money, he sued them in the SCT Claim for HK$50,000.00 being the outstandingbalance of the Alleged Loan. He claimed he did so because <i>inter alia</i> he did not know the full name of Wong Sr (whom he addressed all along as âé»ä¼¯â) until the first hearing on 11<sup>th</sup> January 2006. But that is no justification to sue the Wife and Daughter when even on his own case Mr Leung advised him the true borrowerwas Wong Sr. In the circumstances, my observations in paragraph 109 above also apply to the SCT Claim issued by Ma.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  Shortly thereafter Ma discontinued the SCT Claim and commenced the present proceedings. As seen from the above analysis, there wasalso no justification for him to sue any of the defendants in the present proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XX. Hearing on 19th June 2006</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Ma claimed that at a hearing on 19<sup>th</sup> June 2006 in the present proceedings Wong Sr admitted he borrowed the Alleged Loan and falsely alleged that Ma agreed not to demandrepayment of the outstanding balance. Wong Sr denied such allegation. There was no transcript of the hearing. During the trial MrWong agreed that Maâs allegation would not be relied on as admission on the part of Wong Sr.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>XXI. Conclusion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  In the circumstances, Ma failed to establish his claim which is hereby dismissed. Wong Sr also failed to establish that Wong SrâsAgreement was void or voidable as a result of duress. As he did not rely on any other grounds that might vitiate such agreement (eglack of consideration etc), his counterclaim is also dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  There is no reason why costs do not follow event. I grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that Ma do pay Wong Srâs costs of his claim (including all costs reserved, if any) in these proceedings whilst Wong Sr do pay Macosts of the counterclaim (including all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if not agreed. Both the claim and counterclaim werebelow HK$150,000.00 and the issues were not complicated.
