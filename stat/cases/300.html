class="heading">Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The facts are complicated.  The Statement of Claim runs to 163 pages (including Schedules).  For the purpose of these appeals, Itake the facts from the Statement of Claim, and will state them as briefly as possible.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The disputes between the parties arose out of a joint venture between the Plaintiff (East) and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (New Cotai) to develop a hotel, retail and entertainment complex on the Cotai Site, to be called "Macao Studio City" (MSC),with a total Gross Floor Area (GFA) of not less than 6,000,000 sq ft.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant (MacaoCo) is the grantee of the Cotai Site.  Under the grant, the permitted GFA is 119,335 sq m.  Thus, the developmentof MSC would require a modification of the grant.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  MacaoCo is owned by as 96% by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant (Cyber Neighbour) and 4% by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (Cyber One).  Cyber Neighbour is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyber One.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  By a Share Purchase Agreement dated 8 April 2006 (SPA), East sold 40% of Cyber One to New Cotai.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Clause 6.2.2 of the SPA provided:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"6.2.2 Upon the signing of this Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate and work together in good faith in connection with:</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">(i) seeking any Land Grant Modification including with respect to the negotiation of the terms and conditions thereof; and</p>			<p class="quote">(ii) the preparation and development of the Master Plan and any changes thereto."</p>		</blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Land grant modification is defined in the SPA and two successive applications for land grant modifications were envisaged.  However,the Plaintiff's case is that SPA was completed on the basis that MacaoCo would seek a single modification to increase the GFA from119,335 sq m to 560,000 sq m.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  No land grant modification has been obtained because, according to East, of a breach of Clause 6.2.2 by New Cotai, which has ledto: (1) New Cotai not paying East HK$689,065,200, a sum payable on the grant of modification (para 229 of Statement of Claim); and(2) a diminution of the enterprise value of the MSC Project in the sum of US$2.385 billion or HK$18.603 billion (para 241(1) of Statementof Claim).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  As a result, East has commenced HCA 2189/2009 (the Action) and HCMP 2218/2009 under s 168A of the Companies Ordinance (the Petition).</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Parts of Claims in the Action and the Petition have been struck out by Reyes J.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  This is East's appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Reyes J has summarised East's claims in the Action as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. The Plaintiff (EAST) sues the Defendants on a variety of causes of action, some personal, others derivative. The causes of action(as found in the Prayer to EASTâs Statement of Claim) may be summarised as follows:-</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">(1) By way of personal action against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (New Cotai), damages of $689 million for breach of clause 6.2.2 of a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) and for conspiracy.</p>			<p class="quote">(2) By way of personal action against the 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Defendants (collectively, the New Cotai Directors), damages of $689 million for inducing breaches of the SPA by New Cotai and forconspiracy.</p>			<p class="quote">(3) By way of a personal action against the 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> Defendants (respectively, Silver Point and Oaktree), damages of $689 million for inducing breaches of the SPA by New Cotai and forconspiracy.</p>			<p class="quote">(4) By way of derivative action on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants (collectively, the Joint Venture Companies) against New Cotai, damages or equitable compensation of $18.6 billion (US$2.385billion) for dishonest assistance and for conspiracy.</p>			<p class="quote">(5) By way of derivative action on behalf of the Joint Venture Companies against the New Cotai Directors, damages or equitable compensationof $18.6 billion for breach of fiduciary duty and for conspiracy.</p>			<p class="quote">(6) By way of derivative action on behalf of the Joint Venture Companies against Silver Point and Oaktree, damages or equitable compensationof $18.6 billion for dishonest assistance and for conspiracy."</p>		</blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  When dealing with the claim of inducing a breach of contract against D5 to D10, it may be necessary to distinguish between thosedirectors who are External Defendants from those who are not.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  East's claims in the Action, relevant to this appeal, are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) a claim against the New Cotai Directors for inducing a breach of Clause 6.2.2 by New Cotai;</p>        <p>(2) derivative actions brought by East on behalf of Cyber One, Cyber Neighbour and MacaoCo against New Cotai and the New Cotai Directorsin respect of the loss of enterprise value.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The learned judge went on to describe the proceedings before him:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"2. The 1<sup>st</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> Defendants (collectively, the Internal Defendants) were served in Hong Kong. The 6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> Defendants (collectively, the External Defendants) were served outside the jurisdiction.</p>        <p class="quote">3. There are currently 6 Summonses before me in these proceedings. The Summonses are identified in the conclusion of this Judgment.</p>        <p class="quote">4. As far as EASTâs writ action is concerned, I essentially have to determine the following matters:-</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">(1) Applications by the External Defendants to set aside service on them or, to the extent that service was valid, to strike out EASTâsclaims against them; and,</p>			<p class="quote">(2) Applications by the Internal Defendants to strike out substantial parts of EASTâs claims against them,</p>			<p class="quote">(3) An application by EAST to amend its Re-Amended Writ.</p>		</blockquote>        <p class="quote">5. In parallel with its claimed actions, EAST has brought a s. 168A Petition in relation to Cyber One (one of the Joint Venture Companies).By the Petition EAST seeks the following cumulative or alternative reliefs:-</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">(1) An Order that New Cotaiâs shares be cancelled and its capital reduced.</p>			<p class="quote">(2) An Order that New Cotai transfer its shareholding in EAST for a 'nil consideration, alternatively for a price to be determinedby the Court'.</p>			<p class="quote">(3) An Order that New Cotai and the relevant New Cotai Directors pay EAST damages and interest for the unfair prejudice caused toEAST and its shareholding in Cyber One.</p>			<p class="quote">(4) Such 'injunctive relief ... as may be necessary or appropriate to restrain the continuation of ... wrongful conduct and to protectthe interests of [Cyber Oneâs] members including EAST'.</p>			<p class="quote">(5) All necessary accounts and inquiries.</p>			<p class="quote">(6) Further or other relief.</p>		</blockquote>        <p class="quote">6. EAST made New Cotai and 5 of the New Cotai Directors (Mr. Umansky, Mr. Moross, Mr. Friedman, Mr. Baker and Mr. Goldberg) Respondentsto the Petition proceedings. The latter Respondents (collectively, the Relevant Respondents) are now applying to strike out partsof the Petition. Cyber One is also a Respondent to the Petition, but it has remained neutral throughout these proceedings.</p>        <p class="quote">7. The Defendants (whether External or Internal and whether or not Relevant Respondents) principally rely on 2 contentions in supportof their applications to set aside or strike out EASTâs actions and the Petition.</p>        <p class="quote">8.

He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In England, the Companies Act 2006 provides that a derivative claim 'may only be brought' pursuant to the statute, which thus entirelysupersedes the common law action. This is in accordance with the Law Commission's recommendations and is certainly more logical thanthe position that obtains in Hong Kong; but it is most unfortunate, for the statutory provisions are drafted in terms that plainlyexclude the multiple derivative action. Thus, such an action is not possible under the statute and cannot be developed at commonlaw. In spite of the precedents in other common law countries, the prevalence of groups trading through wholly owned subsidiaries(when the assets at risk of misappropriation are more likely to be situate in the trading subsidiaries than in the holding company),and the recommendations of the Company Law Review Steering Group, the Law Commission recommended that the multiple derivative actionshould not be allowed, and the Steering Group's recommendation that it should was not adopted.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">This is all very well if the wrongdoers have allegedly misappropriated assets belonging to the company itself. If they belong to asubsidiary, however, and there is no liquidation or administrative receivership, the only remedy is a multiple derivative action.This is possible in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong, but not in England. Had the facts alleged in <i>Waddington</i> come before an English Court, the case must have been dismissed in limine, and for the first time in more than 150 years an allegedinjustice would be without redress. The moral for would be fraudsters is simple; choose an English company, and be careful to defraudits subsidiary and not the company itself."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I mention this to show Lord Millett's view on the effect of a similar provision in the United Kingdom.

The learned judge understood Professor Godinho's evidence to be that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"94. â¦ Macao law (in common with the law of Hong Kong and that of many other states) has a principle whereby the corporate veilmay be ignored. The application of that principle in conjunction with Art. 248(1) (Prof. Godinho suggests) can have the result incertain situations of mimicking what happens under a common law multiple derivative action. Thus, where the corporate veil can bepierced under Macao law, a parent X may be treated as the same legal person as its subsidiary Y. In that instance, a shareholderof X would be able to sue wrongdoers of Y directly under Art. 248(1) since X and Y are together deemed to be 'the company' withinthe terms of that provision."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mr Yu submitted that on such basis, the learned judge ought to have concluded that multiple derivative action was permissible inMacao. He submitted that provided a multiple derivative action is permissible under the <i>lex incorporationis</i>, the juridical basis upon which it could be done should not matter. </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  Mr Yu relied on what Lord Millett said in <i>Waddington</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"65. The multiple derivative action has been recognised in many states of the United States, but the legal basis on which the actionis maintainable has varied from state to state and from time to time. Many of the grounds upon which the action has been rationalisedwould not be accepted in either England or Hong Kong. In some cases the subsidiary has been treated as a mere instrument, agent or<i>alter ego</i> of the parent company; in others the corporate structure has been described as a fiction or 'specious and illusory device' allowingthe court to pierce the corporate veil. â¦"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  But it is important to note that Reyes J went on to say.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"95. But, in reality, the shareholder does not sue wrongdoers of Y because Macao law recognises a direct right of suit in the shareholderunder a doctrine analogous to a common law multiple derivative action. The shareholder is only able to sue directly in the examplegiven because Macao law recognises the different doctrine of piercing the corporate veil.</p>        <p class="quote">96. Further, implicit in Prof. Godinhoâs argument is an acceptance that, but for recourse to some other doctrine (such as piercingthe corporate veil) whereby a parent and a subsidiary are treated as the same entity, Art. 248(1) does not authorise a direct actionby a shareholder of X against the wrongdoers of Y. There would be no need for Prof. Godinhoâs elaborate reasoning in relation topiercing the corporate veil, if on its own Art. 248(1) is capable of being construed as enabling multiple derivative actions. Inherentin Prof. Godinhoâs approach is a tacit acknowledgment of Mr. Riquitoâs position, namely, that on its face, Art. 248(1) plainlyonly permits shareholder suits analogous to single (not multiple) derivative actions."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In para 39 of Professor Godinho's affirmation, he said after discussing the concept of lifting the corporate veil under Macao law:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"39. Importantly, it is not necessary to show fault in order to disregard the corporate personality. A simple or objective breachof the purposes of the legal regulation is sufficient. (As I understand it, this means the principle is very different from the principleof 'lifting the corporate veil' in common law jurisdictions.)"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Professor Godinho then concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"45. Accordingly, it is my view that the Macau courts would apply the disregard of corporate personality principle to allow the initiationof liability proceedings by East Asia on behalf of [MacaoCo]. The disregard would operate to correct what would otherwise be an unjustifiedcurtailment of the rights of shareholders having 10% of the capital or more of what is effectively, a single, interlocking corporatestructure."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  With respect, I also have difficulties with Professor Godinho's analysis.  If, by lifting the corporate veil, MacaoCo would notbe treated as a separate entity from its holding company, one would have thought the action should be in the name of the holdingcompany and not MacaoCo.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The matter may be tested in this way.  Under English law the veil of incorporation might be lifted under certain circumstances. But if as a result of s 260 of the 2006 Companies Act a multiple derivative action is not available in England, could one bringa multiple derivative action by lifting the veil of incorporation?  I do not think so.  Despite Professor Godinho's conclusion inpara 45 of his affirmation quoted above, I cannot accept that the lifting of the veil of incorporation of MacaoCo could result inEast being able to issue proceedings in MacaoCo's name.</p>    <p class="heading">Reflective loss</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  This is relevant to the derivative claim brought by East in the name of Cyber One (a single derivative action) as well as on behalfof Cyber Neighbour (a multiple derivative action).  Though, in the case of Cyber Neighbour, in any event, a multiple derivative actionis not permissible. </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Reyes J said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"125. The loss claimed on behalf of Cyber Neighbour is plainly a claim for reflective loss.</p>        <p class="quote">126. EASTâs allegation is that a result of the New Cotai Directorsâ breaches of duty, Cyber One, Cyber Neighbour, and Macao Cohave suffered loss. Spelled out in pedantic detail, EASTâs case runs thus: Had the New Cotai Directors not acted in breach of theirduties, a land grant modification would long ago have been made in Macao Coâs favour and the MSC project would have enjoyed anenterprise value of at least $18.6 billion. Because there has been no land grant modification, Macao Co does not today enjoy suchenterprise value and its net asset value has been (and continues to be) diminished. Since Macao Co is worth less than it should be,Cyber Neighbourâs shareholding in Macao Co and (in consequence) Cyber Neighbour are worth less than they should be. Since CyberNeighbour is worth less than it should be, Cyber Oneâs shareholding in Macao Co and (in consequence) Cyber One are worth less thanthey should be.</p>        <p class="quote">127. Two features of EASTâs derivative claims may be noted.</p>        <p class="quote">128. First, EAST seeks to claim by way of derivative actions Macao Coâs loss as reflected through the shareholding chain from CyberNeighbour up to Cyber One. The derivative claim which EAST wishes to bring on behalf of Cyber Neighbour claims Cyber Neighbourâsloss as reflected from Macao Coâs loss. The derivative claim which EAST wishes to bring on behalf of Cyber One claims Cyber Oneâsloss as reflected from Cyber Neighbourâs loss which in turn is loss reflected from Macao Coâs loss.</p>        <p class="quote">129. Second, as far as its claim for lost enterprise value of $18.6 billion is concerned, EAST does not assert any parallel personalcause of action against the New Cotai Directors having as its measure of damages the lost enterprise value of $18.6 billion. Allof the personal claims which EAST asserts (whether in its Writ, Amended Writ, Re-Amended Writ and proposed Re-Re-Amended Writ) arefor $689 million (the quantum of the 2<sup>nd</sup> tranche payment said to be due from New Cotai). EAST does not plead a personal cause of action against the New Cotai directors whichclaims the reflective loss quantum of $18.6 billion as EASTâs own damages entitlement."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr Yu sought to overcome this by relying on the fact that where a company has suffered loss but has no cause of action to sue torecover that loss, the shareholder can sue, even though the loss is a diminution in the value of the shareholding: <i>Johnson v Gore Wood</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 1</a>, 35G (Lord Bingham).  He submitted that because the structure of the joint venture was that all the decisions were made at the levelof the shareholders of Cyber One, thus "there may be scope for the New Cotai parties to argue that, because certain of the conductwhich East alleges gives rise to the derivative claims took place at the Cyber One level and not at the MacauCo level, MacauCo doesnot have a valid cause of action in respect of such conduct".</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  But as the Learned Judge has pointed out, nowhere in its pleadings or affidavit evidence had East even hinted that MacaoCo was somehowunable to sue the New Cotai Directors for wrongs inflicted upon MacaoCo.  On the contrary, East's pleaded case is that Macao Co hasa cause of action against the wrongdoing of the New Cotai Directors.: Judgment Â§139.  Also the suggestion that MacaoCo might nothave a cause of action because all decisions were made on the Cyber One level, was rightly described by the learned judge as speculativeand contrary to the main thrust of East's case: Judgment Â§144.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Mr Yu submitted that the burden is on New Cotai to show that MacaoCo has a cause of action, and hence the rule against reflectiveloss is applicable.  Mr Yu relied on the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"83. â¦ As the <i>Prudential</i> is an exclusionary rule denying a claimant what otherwise would be his right to sue, the onus must be on the defendants to establishits applicability. Further, it would not be right to bar the claimant's action unless the defendants can establish not merely thatthe company has a claim to recover a loss reflected by the profit, but that such claim is available on the facts. â¦" â <i>Shaker v Al-Bedrawi</i> <i>and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20BCLC%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 BCLC 157 (Peter</a> Gibson LJ)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  He also submitted that before the New Cotai parties file a Defence to MacaoCo's claims, obviously one will not know whether theywill allege that no decision has been made on the MacaoCo level, and hence MacaoCo has no cause of action.  But it is certainly notinconceivable that such an argument would be raised.  See <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011</i> Â§18/19/4 p. 406. </p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  I do not believe this matter turns on the burden of proof.  If and when such a defence is raised, it may be that the matter canbe revisited.  But, as matter now stands, I agree with Reyes J that this is speculative.  Also I do not understand how the fact thatno decision had been made on the MacaoCo level could relieve its directors of their fiduciary duties.</p>    <p class="heading">Material non-disclosure</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The Judge set aside service of the proceedings on the External Defendants, namely, D6, D8 and D10 (Mr Moross, Mr Baker and Mr Vora)out of the jurisdiction because East was guilty of material non-disclosure in that it failed to provide the court with any evidencethat multiple derivative actions were recognised under Macao law and BVI law (Judgment Â§Â§175 and 176). The Judge also said thatEast should have pointed out that it was seeking to make claims for reflective loss and explained why such claims were arguably permissible(Judgment Â§180).</p>        <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  As Mr Strachan submitted the duty of disclosure extends to matters of law.
