(reading the judgment of the Court):</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p1" class="pseudopara" id="p1">1.</a> In <u>Birkett</u> v <u>James</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20AC%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) A.C. 297</a> it was held that an action for breach of contract would not be struck out for want of prosecution where the primary period of limitationhad not yet expired and the defendant would have a right to start a fresh action. That principle was applied in <u>Tolley</u> v <u>Morris</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20WLR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 1 W.L.R. 592</a> to an action in tort where, although the primary limitation period had expired, the plaintiff was under a disability and the applicableperiod of limitation had not yet expired. The question which we have to decide in the present case is whether the principle shouldbe extended to a case under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> where (1) two out of three dependants would have, by reason of a disability, an indefeasible right to bring a fresh action, and (2)the third dependant, who had no such right, could nevertheless seek a direction of the Court under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 30</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> that the relevant limitation provision should not apply to his claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Official Administrator sues on behalf of the estate of a deceased person and on behalf of his dependants on the ground of allegednegligent treatment in a Government hospital. The death occurred on 20th December 1971 and the writ was issued on 12th June 1972,well within the limitation period prescribed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>. The summons to strike out the action was dated 17th September 1980. It is common ground that at the present date one of the dependantsis still an infant, that another attained his majority less than three years ago, and that the third is now aged 27 years.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> We are told, rightly or wrongly, that at the hearing before the Registrar he stopped Counsel for the Plaintiff from arguing on theissue whether there had been inordinate and inexcusable delay and proceeded to dismiss the application on the ground that two ofthe dependants would have the right to bring a fresh action. The Plaintiff appealed to the Judge in Chambers.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Again, we are told that the Judge was disturbed to find that insufficient time had been allotted for the hearing of the appeal and,with the consent of Counsel for the parties, decided to hear argument on what I will call "the <u>Birkett</u> v <u>James</u> point" first: he would, if necessary, hear argument on the issue of delay at an adjourned hearing. The issue argued was put to himin this form:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Having regard to the provisions of section 4 of the Fatal Accident Ordinance and to the fact that for the purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> the Plaintiff in this action is the Official Administrator do the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> and the rationes decidendi of <u>Tolley</u> v <u>Morris</u> <i>[</i>1979<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20WLR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 W.L.R. 592</a> and <u>Birkett</u> v <u>James</u> <i>[</i>1978<i>]</i> A.C. 297 apply to this action so that, even if there were inordinate and/or inexcusable delay on the part of the Plaintiff in hisprosecution of the action, the Court would not accede to an application by the Defendant to dismiss the action for want of prosecution."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The Judge came to the conclusion that the principle in <u>Birkett</u> v <u>James</u> had no application unless all the claimants had an indefeasible right to bring a fresh action. As the eldest dependant had no suchright, he held that if sufficient delay was established the application to strike out should be granted. He clearly expected thatthe hearing of the appeal before him would continue upon the delay issue. However, the Plaintiff chose to appeal to this Court onthe <u>Birkett</u> v <u>James</u> point without waiting for the conclusion of the appeal before the Judge. On an application to dismiss the present appeal as incompetentthis Court (differently constituted) decided that the provisions of the Supreme Court Ordinance compelled us to proceed with theappeal. I reached that conclusion with some reluctance, for, although there may occasionally be instances where an interlocutoryappeal upon a point of law will serve a useful purpose, in the vast majority of cases it is better to wait until the whole proceedingshave been completed in the court below.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> One other procedural matter must be mentioned. The Judge's written reasons are dated 14th November 1980, which was the date of thehearing. Counsel assert that no decision was given on that date and that the reasons were not received until some day after 4th December1980. There is a copy letter before us which does suggest that a copy of the reasons for the decision was forwarded to one of theparties under cover of a letter dated 4th December 1980 and we are told that a similar communication was sent to the other side.We do not know whether those reasons were a reduction into writing of reasons given orally in Chambers on 14th November, or a statementof reasons prepared on 14th November after the hearing for a decision given in Chambers, or a statement prepared on a later dateof reasons for a decision which was given on 14th November or, as Counsel assert, reasons for a decision which had not been givenat all before the written reasons were sent to the parties by post. It is, fortunately, not necessary for us to decide on what datethe decision was given and I mention the matter only to remind Counsel that, where their recollection of what happened in the courtbelow substantially conflicts upon some material point with that of the judge as recorded by him, the judge should be invited tomake whatever comments he thinks fit before the matter is raised before this court. In the absence of such an invitation this courtwill proceed upon the basis of the written record.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> A foundation of the Defendant's case is <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, which is the section extending the primary limitation periods in cases where the claimant is under a disability. Mr. Barlow, forthe Defendant, conceded that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> applied to the claim under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a>, although he argued that the right of action which accrued under that Ordinance accrued to the nominal Plaintiff and not to the dependantson whose behalf he claims. It is thus common ground that section 22 applies, and also that it applies by virtue of section 28(5),although there was considerable discussion as to what that latter sub-section means. It reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"An action under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> shall be one to which section 22 applies, but otherwise sections 22 to 26, inclusive, and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part IV</a> shall not apply to the action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The first half of that sub-section is in the clearest terms, but the second half is in apparent conflict with it. The explanationis, I venture to think, a drafting error resulting from the application of the Limitation Act 1975 to Hong Kong. That Act amendedthe Limitation Act 1939 by adding the equivalent of our section 28. Section 28(5) of the 1939 Act reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"An action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1849 shall be one to which section 22 of this Act (persons under disability) applies, butotherwise Part II and Part III of this Act shall not apply to the action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Part II consists of sections 22 to 26 inclusive. However, our "Part II" is not coextensive and the draftsman had to specify the sectionswhich were not to apply. I hope I am not doing him an injustice when I suggest that he looked to see which of our sections had theirequivalent included in Part II of the English Act and then substituted "sections 22 to 26" where the Act has "Part II" without appreciatingthat the grammatical effect was to introduce a contradiction which the English wording avoided. If I am correct, the second halfof our section 28(5) should have read "but sections 23 to 26, inclusive, and Part IV shall not apply to the action", the "otherwise"being inappropriate. I refer to this because it may require the attention of the Legislature, but there can be no doubt that Mr.Barlow was right to concede that section 22 does apply.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Barlow was on less firm ground in so far as he suggested that the right of action under the Fatal Accidents Ordinance (as distinctfrom that under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance) accrued to the personal representative and not to the dependants.</p>    <p align="left">Section 4(1) of that Ordinance reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Every such action shall be for the benefit of the dependants of the person whose death has been so caused, and shall, except as hereinafterprovided, be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased person."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">However, provision is made in section 5 for a case where no personal representative does sue on behalf of the dependants:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="10%"></td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="75%" class="quote">"(1) If and so often as it happens, in any of the cases intended and provided for by this Ordinance, that there is no executor oradministrator of the person killed within the meaning of this Ordinance, or that, there being such executor or administrator, nosuch action as aforesaid has, within six months after the death of the person whose death has been so caused as aforesaid, been broughtby and in the name of his executor or administrator, then and in every such case such action may be brought by and in the name ornames of all or any of the persons (if more than one) for whose benefit such action would have been, if it had been brought by andin the name of such executor or administrator.</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="15%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="75%" class="quote">(2) Every such action shall be for the benefit of the same person, or persons, and shall be subject to the same regulations and procedure,as nearly as may be, as if it had been brought by and in the name of such executor or administrator."</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="15%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">I agree with the learned Judge that the effect is that "the Ordinance gives a right of action to certain dependants of a deceasedperson for the pecuniary loss they have suffered from the death of that person occasioned by a wrong doer". The personal representativeor representative dependant may be the nominal plaintiff, but each dependant has a separate and distinct right of action and eachis in a real sense a plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The underlying principle in <u>Birkett</u> v <u>James</u> and <u>Tolley</u> v <u>Morris</u> is that the Court will not make an order which will serve no useful purpose: if a plaintiff whose action was struck out for wantof prosecution could immediately bring a fresh action, the effect of the order to strike out would be merely to cause delay and expense.Once it is accepted that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> operates to give the two youngest dependants an indefeasible right to bring a fresh action if their action is struck out, they fallsquarely within that principle.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It is the eldest dependant who presents the difficulty. The contention on behalf of the Defendant is that there is no just reasonwhy the eldest dependant should benefit from the disability of the others. If he had been the sole dependant, any claim by him would,unless he could pray in aid <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 30</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, now have been statute barred, and, it is submitted, delay in pressing his claim in the present action should lead to an order forstriking out that claim: the fact that any "fresh claim" by him would have to be made by rejoining him in the present action ratherthan by a new action should not affect the position. It was not apparently suggested to the Judge that it might be possible to strikeout the claim of the third dependant without striking out the claims of the other two and he took the view that, if the eldest wasguilty of delay, the whole action should be struck out, thus (as it were) giving effect to the statute bar against him but leavingthe other dependants to start again, as they were entitled to do. Whilst appreciating the justice of that course as regards the eldestdependant, I think that each claim must be considered separately and that it would be open to the Court to strike out the claim ofone dependant without striking out that of the other. This is not a normal type of representative action, where several plaintiffshave the same interest: each dependant has a separate interest. That being so I do not think the claims of the two youngest dependantsought to be struck out.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> That leaves the question whether we ought to strike out the claim of the eldest son when we have regard to the Court's discretionunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 30.</a> Sub-section (1) of that section reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"If it appears to the court that it would be equitable to allow an action to proceed having regard to the degree to which -</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="14%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="70%" class="quote">the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27</a> or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">28</a> prejudice the plaintiff or any person whom he represents; and</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="16%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:right" width="14%" class="quote">(b)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="70%" class="quote">any decision of the court under this subsection would prejudice the defendant or any person whom he represents,</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="16%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">the court may direct that those provisions shall not apply to the action, or shall not apply to any specified cause of action to whichthe action relates."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">In view of the manner in which this case has come before us there is nothing to show that the eldest dependant may be inequitablyprejudiced by the application of the limitation provisions, but by the same token there is nothing to show that he would not. Inthe light of what was said in <u>Walkley</u> v <u>Precision Forgings Ltd</u>. (1979) 1W.L.R. 606 I find it very difficult to see how he could have been prejudiced, but that is a matter for the Judge. In thatcase a plaintiff, who was of full age, issued a writ for damages for personal injury. There was some delay in the prosecution ofthe action and, although no application to dismiss it for want of prosecution was in fact made, it was conceded that such an applicationwould probably have succeeded. After the primary period of limitation had expired, the plaintiff commenced a second action basedupon the same cause of action. There was an application to strike out the second writ and to dismiss the new action. After the hearingbefore the Judge in Chambers the plaintiff discontinued his first action. The House of Lords held that the new action ought to bedismissed under the Limitation Act 1939 and that the plaintiff, having started the first action within the primary limitation period,could not bring himself within the equivalent of our section 30: any application under that section would fail in limine. The majorityin the House thought that the only exception where it might be proper to give a direction under the section, where the plaintiffhad started an action within the primary, limitation period but had subsequently discontinued, would be a case where the discontinuancewas induced by some improper conduct on the part of the defendant. Mr. Jackson-Lipkin submits that that case does not apply unlessthe plaintiff is of full age when the action is brought. I accept that that decision might have been different if the plaintiff hadbeen under a disability throughout the period of the first action, but here the eldest dependant's disability ended more than 3 yearsago; if he is prejudiced by the striking out of the action that is the result of his own inaction.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> It seems to me that the principle as applied in <u>Tolley</u> v <u>Morris</u> may properly be extended so that any consideration of the factors which might, under section 30, justify the non-application of thelimitation provisions to a possible new claim should take place before a decision is reached upon the application to strike out:it would serve no useful purpose to strike out the eldest dependant's claim if he could then apply to have it restored. That viewis supported by what Lord Wilberforce said in <u>Walkley</u> v <u>Precision Forgings Ltd</u>. at p.610A:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The predominant interest in these matters (all the more when the plaintiff is, as here, legally aided) is to dispose of any issueunder the Limitation Act as expeditiously as possible."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He pointed out that the equivalent of our section 30 specifies no procedure and he thought that its provisions could properly be consideredupon a summons to strike out.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In the result I think the answer to the issue which is put to us can most conveniently be expressed in this way: "The rationes decidend;of <u>Tolley</u> v <u>Morris</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20WLR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 1 W.L.R. 592</a> and <u>Birkett</u> v <u>James</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20AC%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) A.C. 297</a> do apply to this action, but the claim of each dependant must be considered separately, and, if satisfied that there was inordinateand inexcusable delay on the part of the Plaintiff in the prosecution of the eldest dependant's claim, the Court would accede tothe application of the defendant to dismiss such claim for want of prosecution unless satisfied that, if his claim were dismissed,the eldest dependant should by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 30</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> have the right to renew that claim". It must not be forgotten that the action which it is sought to dismiss for want of prosecutionincludes not only the claims under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a> but also the claim on behalf of the estate. The principle in <u>Birkett</u> v <u>James</u> has no application to that claim.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">21st May 1981.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Jackson-Lipkin, Q.C. &amp; G.
