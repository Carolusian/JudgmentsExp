Having cause to believe that the defendant has manufactured and is marketingits own ranges of luggage that so closely resemble that of the plaintiff in the Streamline and Spark series that they amount to copiesthereof, it has by writ dated 7 September 2001 brought an action for injunctive relief, an enquiry as to damages or an account ofprofits and damages.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> By summons dated 27 September the plaintiff has applied for interim protection in the form of an injunction to restrain the defendantfrom manufacturing and marketing the offending items.

In support she refers to an affidavit filed by one Cheung Kin Man (Mr Cheung) whois the general manager of Samsonite Asia Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the plaintiff and its sales agent in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> I have to say at the outset that the plaintiff's claim under this head is a non-starter. Miss Wong is correct in stating that copyrightsubsists in artistic works which includes, by definition, graphic works. The proprietor of such works is entitled to exclusive rightsin them; another's unauthorized copying of the works is an infringement for which the remedy is an injunction, and damages.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> But in its pleadings the plaintiff has not pleaded breach of its copyright in any artistic works; indeed there is no reference tocopyright at all. Copyright and infringement thereof cannot be implied; it must be specifically pleaded. Furthermore the works thesubject of the alleged copyright have to be produced with evidence that they belong to the plaintiff. The evidence to which MissWong referred me is phrased this way:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The defendant uses the plaintiff's Streamline series of design for its products....</p>        <p class="quote">The defendant also uses the plaintiff's Spark pattern design for its products .... The defendant uses other of the plaintiff's product'sdistinctive features on its products ....</p>        <p class="quote">The defendant uses the plaintiff's decorative shapes on its products."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> This does not get close to establishing a right in copyright works let alone an infringement by another. As Miss Tam for the defendantsubmitted, copyright does not protect a commercial product; no copyright case can be mounted because two suitcases are similar.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">Design Registration</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Protection for a design in Hong Kong is afforded by the Registered Designs Ordinance (RDO) <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/522">Cap. 522</a> Laws of Hong Kong. Section 5gives the owner of a new design the right and opportunity to apply to register it with the Registrar of Designs. Sections 24, 25,26 and 27 set out the steps thereafter to be taken by the Registrar. Section 27 expressly removes from the Registrar the obligationsto satisfy himself as to the registrability of the design or whether it has been properly represented before registration.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> I set out below these sections verbatim:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">"Examination and Registration</p>        <p class="quote">24.

It may, of course, have been made in express words, but cases of express misrepresentation ofthis sort are rare. The more common case is, where the representation is implied in the use or imitation of a mark, trade name, orget-up with which the goods of another are associated in the minds of the public. In such cases the point to be decided is whether,having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the use by the defendant in connection with the goods of the mark, name, or get-upin question impliedly represents such goods to be the goods of the plaintiff, or the goods of the plaintiff of a particular classof quality, or, as it is sometimes put, whether the defendant's use of such mark, name or get-up is calculated to deceive."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> In the particular context of this case it is appropriate to examine the expression 'get up'.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> This is the subject of a passage in Christopher Wadlow's <em>The Law of Passing Off</em> second edition. He wrote at para. 6.49:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote"><em>"G. DISTINCTIVENESS OF GET-UP</em></p>        <p class="quote">Introduction</p>        <p class="quote">The term "get-up" is normally used in passing off to mean the whole visible external appearance of goods in the form in which theyare likely to be seen by the public before purchase. If the goods are sold in packages, then their get-up means the appearance ofthe pack taken as a whole. If they are sold or displayed unpackaged, then the get-up relied on can only be that inherent in the goodsthemselves. Intermediate cases exist where both the goods themselves and their packaging contribute to what the customer sees: forinstance where the goods are mounted on cards, or in transparent plastic, or are liquids in bottles. However, there can be few cases,if any, in which passing-off results from the adoption by the defendant of so-called "get-up" which is only apparent to the consumerafter purchase of the defendants' goods. There are also cases where the get-up said to be distinctive is that of advertisements,literature, premises or almost anything used in the conduct of the plaintiff's business.</p>        <p class="quote">Get-up is not only of importance when it is of itself distinctive of the plaintiff. Similarity in general appearance (even if theappearance does not legally qualify as get-up) may enable dishonest traders to substitute the defendant's product when asked forthat of the plaintiff, even if the plaintiff's get-up is not distinctive on its own. Whether the defendant is liable for this dependson intention and knowledge. Similarity or dissimilarity of get-up may also influence the result of a case based mainly on brand namesor other marks if the likelihood of deception is finely balanced, or if the similarities constitute a "badge of fraud" indicatingan intention to deceive.</p>        <p class="quote">The difficulty confronting the plaintiff in all actions for passing-off based on get-up is that it is unusual for one trader's goodsto be distinguished from those of his competitors exclusively, or even primarily, by their get-up. Normally a brand name or othermark is chosen and given prominence and it is this on which consumers are expected and encouraged to rely. To make out a case basedsolely on similarities of get-up the plaintiff must show that deception is likely notwithstanding the absence of his own brand nameon the defendant's goods and the likely presence there of the defendant's brand name and perhaps other distinguishing matter. Notsurprisingly, the cases in which passing-off has been found have predominantly been ones of deliberate deception."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> At 6.51 Mr Wadlow wrote:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Get-up is therefore only protected if and to the extent that it serves as the badge of a particular trader. Put the other way round,if the customer wants goods with a particular construction or appearance primarily because he believes such goods to be functional,practical or aesthetically pleasing then the appearance of the goods, or their get-up if it may be so called, is not being reliedon to identify them as coming from a particular trade source. If so, it is hard to say that offering goods indistinguishable fromthose of the plaintiff involves any misrepresentation at all. It does not even matter if the plaintiff's goods are unique and thecustomer happens to believe or assume that all such goods came from a common source, provided his choice is made without relianceon that belief. At most, any misrepresentation (or misconception on the part of the customer) is an irrelevant one because it doesnot damage the plaintiff: the customer would not have bought the plaintiff's goods in preference to those of the defendant even ifhe had known of the difference."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The copying of an article without more is not passing off.

Anyone is entitled, subject to some monopoly or statutory right preventing him, to copy andsell any article on the market, and false representation and passing off only arise when a defendant does something further whichsuggests that the article which he is selling is that of the plaintiff. This he may do by a direct representation to that effectsuch as by the use of the plaintiffs' name or mark, or by an indirect representation such as by imitation of get-up by enclosingthe article in a distinctive package which is similar to that used by the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In <strong>Wilson Development Co. v.

The wide range of luggage of similar design and function available to the consumer public in Hong Kongdictates against the defendant being guilty of passing off its product as the plaintiff's. The egg shaped badge is repeated on manyother brands. Similarly the big wheel, the retractable handle, the trim and so on, more or less as the case may be. This is not conclusive;in theory more than one manufacturer could be taking advantage of another's reputation. But when there are so many products similarlygot up it is hard to find that passing off has been established.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> As to confusion, or rather the singular lack of it, the affidavit of M. Pecceu is most unhelpful to the plaintiff's cause. Firstas an employee of the plaintiff he is hardly in the category of a disinterested customer. Secondly he was not confused; he readilyidentified which case was the plaintiff's and which the defendant's. No doubt the logos and labels were the same as those on theexamples produced to me; the logos respectively of the plaintiff and defendant and the labels likewise.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Whatever the shopkeeper may have said is neither here nor there; clearly the man posing as the customer was under no illusion.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Is the defendant trying to tell a lie, pretending its suitcase is a Samsonite? The answer is obviously: 'No'.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> In my view the tort of passing off cannot be made out.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading">The 'Serious Question' issue revisited - conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Dealing with the three heads of copyright, design registration and passing off I am unable to find established that there is a seriousquestion to be tried in respect of any of the three. The result is that the plaintiff's claim for an injunction and other relatedrelief fails and is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Costs, nisi at first instance will follow the event and are to the defendant taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(D M B Gill)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Ms C H Wong, of Messrs Weir &amp; Associates, for the plaintiff</p>        <p>Ms W Tam, instructed by Messrs Benny Kong &amp; Co., for the defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2001/397.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
