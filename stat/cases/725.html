(âDragon Pearlâ) is the purchaser and Leung Wan Kee Shipyard Limited (âLeung Wan Keeâ)is the builder/seller of a ship (âthe Vesselâ) under a shipbuilding contract made partly in Chinese and partly in English dated2 July 2008 (âthe Agreementâ).  A dispute arose between the parties such that building of the Vessel did not proceed to completion. Dragon Pearl took out an action under HCA 889/2010 for delivery up of the Vessel and damages for wrongful detention (âthe DP Actionâ). Leung Wan Kee took out another action under HCA 1288 of 2010 for damages for breach of the Agreement and trespass or conversion(âthe LWK Actionâ) .</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  There are 4 summonses before me containing 6 applications:</p>    <p>   <i>Under the DP Action</i></p>    <blockquote>        <p>A.  Dragon Pearlâs application for summary judgment for delivery up of the Vessel and an order, insofar as it is necessary, forpayment into Court of a sum sufficient to discharge any lien which Leung Wan Kee may have (âthe delivery applicationâ);</p>        <p>B.  Alternatively, Dragon Pearl seeks an interim injunction restraining Leung Wan Kee from detaining the Vessel or otherwise interferingwith or acting inconsistently with Dragon Pearlâs right of ownership and possession of the Vessel (âthe injunction applicationâ).</p>        <p><i>Under the LWK Action</i></p>        <p>C.  Dragon Pearlâs application for striking out parts of the statement of claim insofar as they contain assertions that propertyrights in the Vessel has not passed to Dragon Pearl (âthe striking out applicationâ);</p>        <p>D.  Leung Wan Keeâs application for part judgment under Order 14 for the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> instalments of the purchase price (âthe partial judgment applicationâ);</p>        <p>E.

Dragon Pearl asks that this questionbe answered under Order 14A, rules 1 and 2 although no separate summons has been issued.  It is a question of construction of theAgreement.  The facts relied on to answer that issue will be those entirely undisputed. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  If a question of construction will finally determine whether an important issue is suitable for determination under O.14A and whereit is a dominant feature of the case a court ought to proceed to so determine such issue.  Respondents are not entitled to contendthat they should be allowed to hunt around for evidence or something that might turn up on discovery which could be relied upon toexplain or modify the meaning of the relevant document.  If there were material circumstances of which the court should take accountin construing the document, they must be taken to have been known, and could only be such as were known, to the parties when theagreement was made.  In the absence of such evidence, the court should not refrain from dealing with the application.  See <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure</i> <i>2011, paragraph 14A/2/4.</i>  I consider it appropriate to approach under Order 14A in the circumstances of this case and resolve the question of passing of propertyfirst.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE PASSING OF PROPERTY IN THE VESSEL</i></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Property in goods passes at such time the parties intend it to pass.   The Vessel in question was not in existence at the time ofthe Agreement and thus come under the description of âunascertained or future goodsâ in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26" class="autolink_findacts">Sale of Goods Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26">Cap. 26</a> (âSOGOâ).  Under that section,</p>    <blockquote>       <p class="quote">â20. Unless a different intention appears, the following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the timeat which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer-</p>â¦<br />        <br />        <p class="quote"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/26/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 5.</a> (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description, and ina deliverable state, are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer, or by thebuyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be express or implied,and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee (whether namedby the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to haveunconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In ascertaining the intention of the parties, I bear in mind some general principles:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) The intention of the parties as to when the property should pass is to be ascertained at the time of the contract, in the presentcase, a written one. The exercise involves ascertaining the meaning which the document would convey to reasonable person having allthe background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the timeof the contract: <i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v. West Bromwich Building Society</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20896" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 896</a>, at pages 912H â 913B, per Lord Hoffman.</p>        <p>(ii) The previous negotiations of the parties and their declarations of subjective intention are not admissible to prove their intentionat the time of the contract: <i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v. West Bromwich Building Society,</i> above.  Likewise the conduct of the parties subsequent to the contract will not be considered.</p>        <p>(iii) In the absence of an express term, the property is usually vested in the seller until delivery to the buyer. The burden of proofis thus on the buyer to point to circumstances showing that the property is vested in him: per Lord President Dunedin of Scotlandin <i>Sir James Laing &amp; Sons Ltd. v. Barclay, Curle &amp; Co. Ltd.,</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1908%5d%20AC%2035" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1908] AC 35</a>, at page 39; adopted by the House of Lords on appeal, at pages 43-44. </p>        <p>(iv) It may be a useful guide to look at other decisions, but, after all, the question is what the parties said and intended: <i>Sir James Laing case,</i> per Lord Loreburn LC, at page 43<i>.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Mr. Yin, counsel for Dragon Pearl, relies heavily on the <i>obiter dictum<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"><b>[1]</b></a></i> in <i>Seath v. Moore</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281886%29%2011%20HL%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1886) 11 H.L. 350</a>, 380 for the proposition that if a contract for the building of a ship provides for (i) payment by instalments and (ii) buildingunder the superintendence of the buyer, property passes to the buyer at each stage upon payment of the instalment.  Lord Watson states,</p>    <p class="auto-style1">âThe English decisions to which I have referred appear to me to establish the principle that, where it appears to be the intention,or in other words the agreement, of the parties to a contract for building of a ship, that at a particular stage of its construction,the vessel, so far as then finished, shall be appropriated to the contract of sale, the property of the vessel as soon as it hasreached that stage of completion will pass to the purchaser, and subsequent additions made to the chattel thus vested in the purchaserwill, accessione, become his property. It also appears to me to be the result of these decisions that such an intention or agreementought (in the absence of any circumstances pointing to a different conclusion) to be inferred from a provision in the contract tothe effect that an instalment of the price shall be paid at a particular stage, coupled with the fact that the instalment has beenduly paid, and that until the vessel reached that stage the execution of the work was regularly inspected by the purchaser, or someoneon his behalf.â</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  I note, however, that <i>Seath v. Moore</i> is distinguishable from the present case because the contracts there were not between a shipbuilder and purchaser of a ship but betweena shipbuilder and a sub-contractor responsible for supplying and installing machinery on the ship.  The contracts therein containan express transfer of property clause as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âUpon a payment being made on account of any such contract, the portions of the subject thereof, so far as constructed, and allmaterials laid down for the purpose of constructing the same, shall become, and be held as being the absolute property of the saidTB Seath and Company (i.e. the shipbuilder), subject only to [the sub-contractorâs] lien for payment of the price on any balancethereof that may remain due to us.â (p.355)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The 2 principles in this case must therefore be considered in the light of these features.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The logic of the <i>Seath v. Moore principles</i> was spelt out in the earlier judgment in <i>Clarke v. Spence  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281836%29%204%20A%20%26%20E%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1836) 4 Ad.&amp;E 448</a>, 467-471,</i></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt seems to be clear that, as, by the contract, the vessel was to be built under a superintendent appointed by the purchaser, thebuilder could not compel the purchaser to accept any vessel not constructed of materials approved by the superintendent; and on theother hand, that the purchaser could not refuse any vessel which had been so approved. It follows that, as soon as any materialshave been approved by the superintendent and used in the progress of the work, the fabric consisting of such materials is appropriatedto the purchaser; otherwise the superintendent might be called upon, when one vessel had been nearly constructed, to begin his workde novo, and superintend the building of a second: and, in this point of view, the appointment of a superintendent, by the contract,appears to be of considerable importance. â¦</p>        <p class="quote">Granting therefore that, under such a contract as this, the parts of the vessel, as they are added to the fabric, are appropriatedto the purchaser by way of contract, so that neither could he refuse them when the vessel should be completed, nor the builder compelhim to accept any other, yet it does not necessarily follow that such appropriation vests the property in the purchaser until thewhole thing contracted for is in existence, that is, until the completion of the vessel. But, in the passage under discussion, thepayment under the contract is relied on as the most material point, the appropriation being effected, as it is said, by that payment:and accordingly, in <i>Atkinson v. Bell  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=8%20B%20%26%20C%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(8 B.&amp;C. 282)</a>,</i> Mr. Justice Bayley, in alluding to <i>Woods v. Russell (5 B.&amp;Ald.942),</i> says, that as by the contract given portions of the price were to be paid according to the progress of the work, by the payment ofthose portions of the price the ship was irrevocably appropriated to the person paying the money. That was a purchase of the specificarticles of which the ship was made. â¦</p>        <p class="quote">â¦ The passage above cited â¦ is founded on the notion that provision for the payment regulated by particular stages of the workis made in the contract, with a view to give the purchaser the security of certain portions of the work for the money he is to pay,and is equivalent to an express provision that on payment of the first instalment the general property in so much of the vessel asis then constructed shall vest in the purchaser. If this notion be correct, the payment is no doubt material to the vesting of theproperty, and the effect of such payment is, that there is not only an appropriation of so much of the vessel as is then constructed,but also a vesting of the general property in so much in the purchaser, subject to the right of the builder to retain it in orderto complete it, and earn the rest of the price.  The rights of the parties will then be in the same state as if so much of the vesselas is then constructed had originally belonged to the purchaser, and had been delivered by him to the builder to be added to andfinished; and it will follow that every plank and article subsequently added will, as added, become the property of the purchaseras general owner.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The House of Lords in a subsequent case held that the  principles in <i>Seath v. Moore</i> might be marks pointing to the property passing, but they were not conclusive.  The House declined to treat those principles as raisinga presumption but instead treated that case as a decision based on the evidence and the words of the contract that the ship had becomethe property of someone. See <i>Sir James Laing &amp; Sons Ltd. v. Barclay, Curle &amp; Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1908%5d%20AC%2035" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1908] AC 35</a><i>,</i> per Earl of Halsbury, at page 44<i>.</i></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In the <i>Sir James Laing case,</i> the vessels were to be built by the English shipbuilders with their materials according to certain specifications and under the superintendenceof the Italian purchaser.  Payment was to be by 7 instalments.  The agreement expressly provided that the vessels would not be consideredas delivered to and finally accepted by the purchasers until they had passed the official trial trip and had been approved by theItalian emigration authorities and all the conditions of the contract had been fulfilled (at page 37).  On completion of each ofthe steamers the builders shall, in exchange for the purchase money due and for a bank guarantee for the final instalment, hand overto the purchasers the âusual certificatesâ.  The steamers shall be at the risk of the builders who shall keep them insured againstfire and other risks.  The Lord President Dunedin in Scotland held,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI think the onus, so to speak, rests upon the person who wishes to show that the ship belongs not to the builder to whom it wouldwhat I call naturally belong, but to someone else. â¦ But the whole matter has been really altered by the Sale of Goods Act (56&amp;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">57 Vict. c.71)</a>, and now it is quite clear that by the law of Scotland, if people choose so to contract, they can pass the property of a thing whichis being sold without delivery. That being so, it seems to me clear, and I think it should be clearly laid down, that if people wantthese consequences to happen they must really say so. There is not the slightest difficulty in so framing a contract, if it is wished,as between a shipbuilder and the person who is buying the ship, that the property in a gradually constructed ship shall be held topass at certain stages; but if so, I think it must be clearly said.â (at page 39)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This judgment was upheld by the House of Lords who was of the view that the contract was for a completed ship; the risk lay upon thebuilders until delivery and there was no intention to make delivery or to part with the property until the vessel was completed (atpage 43).</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In <i>Reid v. Macbeth &amp; Gray</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1904%5d%20AC%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1904] AC 223</a>, although the contract contained the terms of payment by instalments and superintendence by the buyer, an express provision statedthat the vessel, as she is constructed shall immediately as the sale proceeds become the property of the purchaser but the buildersshall have a lien for their unpaid purchase money.  This was stated, <i>obiter,</i> to be a contract for the sale of a complete ship.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS</i></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  There is no express provision governing ownership of the Vessel.  Payment of the purchase price is by 7 instalments in similar termsto those in <i>Seath v. Moore. </i> Four instalments have already been paid.  Timely payment is not a pre-condition for Leung Wan Keeâs performance because there canbe compensation from Dragon Pearl by way of penalty under clause 11.4.  The Agreement also provides for construction of the Vesselunder the superintendence of Dragon Pearlâs surveyor, who is given the power to make regular inspection of the Vessel and acceptor reject the work in progress.  There has been appropriation of building materials by the seller and assent by the buyer.  Primafacie, <i>Seath v. Moore</i> applies so that with payment of every instalment, whatever has been completed will be appropriated to Dragon Pearl.  Dragon Pearlaccepts that whatever defects had occurred up to the 4<sup>th</sup> instalment would only result in a claim for breach of warranty and not rejection of the Vessel.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On the other hand, the contract is more than just for sale of materials and appropriating them to the Vessel.  (In fact, some buildingmaterials and fittings were supplied by Dragon Pearl.)   The Agreement clearly provides for the design and custom building of a vesselin the Mainland with delivery as a completed vessel in Hong Kong on CIF terms.  CIF term is clearly a reservation by the seller ofa right of disposal. </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe appropriation must be unconditional, that is to say, the party appropriating must intend that the property shall pass by theappropriation, if assented to by the other party, and not upon the occurrence of some further event, e.g. payment or tender of theprice.  By s.[21(1) of SOGO], the seller may, by the terms of the contract or appropriation, reserve the right of disposal of thegoods until certain conditions are fulfilled; he may be deemed to have done so in the circumstances set out in s.[21(2) and (3)]. So, for example, in the case of the usual c.i.f. contract, the seller reserves the right of disposal by retaining the documentsagainst payment or securing of the price by the buyer, and âthe notice of appropriation under an ordinary c.i.f. contract is notintended to pass, and does not pass, the property.â <i>Benjaminâs Sale of Goods, 8<sup>th</sup> ed, 2010, para. 5-029, 5-133.</i></p>        <p class="quote">A conditional appropriation may be inferred from the circumstances of the contract.  Even though the goods may have been so far appropriatedthat the parties are agreed that those goods alone are to be delivered, yet the appropriation may be conditional on some final actbeing done by the seller before the property is to pass.  In <i>Carlos Federspiel &amp; Co SA v. Charles Twigg &amp; Co Ltd,</i> Pearson J. said:</p>        <p class="quote">âUsually but not necessarily, the appropriating act is the last act to be performed by the seller. For instance, if delivery isto be taken at the sellerâs premises and the seller has appropriated the goods when he has made the goods ready and identifiedthem and placed them in position to be taken by the buyer and has so informed the buyer, and if the buyer agrees to come and takethem, that is the assent to the appropriation. But if there is a further act, an important and decisive act, to be done by the seller,then there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that probably the property does not pass until the final act is done.â</p>        <p class="quote">â¦ There is little doubt that, where the goods were previously unascertained, but have been appropriated to the contract, the passingof property would likewise be conditional on the performance of such an obligation by the seller.â <i>Benjaminâs Sale of Goods, 8<sup>th</sup> ed, 2010, para. 5-071.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The preliminary sea trial is to be done in the Mainland with the final sea trial in Hong Kong waters by the Marine Department. The 6<sup>th</sup> instalment of the price is payable only upon delivery in Hong Kong and delivery of documents in respect of the Vessel.  There isin my view reservation of a right of disposal by Leung Wan Kee until after sea trials and all the approvals are to be obtained.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  There is also a provision for risk to remain with Leung Wan Kee who must take out insurance.  Under section 22 of SOGO,</p>    <p class="quote">âUnless otherwise agreed, the goods remain at the sellerâs risk until the property therein is transferred to the buyer, but whenthe property therein is transferred to the buyer the goods are at the buyerâs risk, whether delivery has been made or not â¦"</p>    <p>That express provision for risk and duty to insure is an indication that property and risk remains with Leung Wan Kee. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Further, the Agreement does contemplate the question of ownership but does not provide the answer.  Clause 11.6 provides that duringthe building process, if Leung Wan Kee encounters financial problems, industrial action or other problems so that it cannot performthe Agreement, both parties can engage a qualified arbitrator to assess the value of the Vessel in accordance with the contract price,and <i>retrieve the ownership of the Vessel. </i> It is not clear under this clause who the person having the ownership is and who can retrieve it.  If the parties had intended itto be Dragon Pearl, they would have, at the time of drafting the Agreement, disapplied the ordinary rule of ownership being withthe seller.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Considering all circumstances, the facts of this case are more in line with the <i>Sir James Laing case. </i> I find that as a matter of construction of the Agreement, the property in the Vessel remains with Leung Wan Kee until completionand delivery of the Vessel to Dragon Pearl.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>REVESTING OF OWNERSHIP</i></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Assuming I am wrong and property has passed to Dragon Pearl, Mr. Suen has an alternative submission that there is an implied termto the effect that in the event of the buyerâs repudiation, property in the Vessel would revest in Leung Wan Kee. </p>    <blockquote>      <p class="quote">âThe cases on the sale of goods give little guidance on the consequences which the sellerâs termination of the contract, followingthe buyerâs repudiation or breach, has upon the sellerâs right to resell or his power to pass a good title in the goods to thesecond buyer. Where a contract for the sale of land is validly terminated by the vendor on account of the purchaserâs repudiationor default in completion, the vendor is entitled to deal with the property as owner and to resell. He may retain the whole of theproceeds of the resale (even when he sells at a higher price) and either: (a) claim from the original purchaser any difference betweenthe original price and that under the resale, after giving credit for any deposit paid; or (b) forfeit the deposit. These principlesare derived from the decided cases, and do not depend on any express terms in the contract. Indeed, the power of resale derived fromthe restoration of the rights of ownership is independent of a power of resale expressly reserved in the contract of sale in theevent of the purchaserâs default; even if the contract contains such an express power, the vendor may terminate the contract andresell as owner.</p>      <p class="quote">A New Zealand case holds that exactly the same principles apply to the sellerâs termination of a contract for the sale of goods:that at common law (and quite apart from the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act) the sellerâs acceptance of the buyerâs repudiationrevests the property in the seller so that he can resell as owner. â¦ Where the seller resells under his common law rights as ownerof the goods following his termination of the original contract, he can keep the whole proceeds of the resale and either forfeitthe deposit paid by the buyer, or sue for damages for any net deficiency after giving credit for the deposit paid.</p>      <p class="quote">        If these principles from the cases on contracts for the sale of land can be carried over to contracts for the sale of goods,the seller who justifiably terminates the contract on the ground of the original buyerâs repudiation or breach is entitled to resellwhether or not the property in the goods had passed to the original buyer.â</p>    </blockquote><p> <i>Benjaminâs Sale of Goods, 8<sup>th</sup> ed, 2010, para. 15-112 to 113.</i></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The analogy to sale of land may not be appropriate since upon such sale, the legal title is not transferred to the buyer until completion. However, in the usual breach of contract case, common law and SOGO give him a right to re-sell, enabling him to validly pass titleto the new buyer under section 50(2) SOGO.

A lien extends to the price but not damages.</p>    <p class="quote">âThe extent of the lien is limited to the price: the seller is not entitled to exercise his lien so as to claim from the buyer hisexpenses for detaining the goods until the price is paid, because during the period of the lien the seller is detaining the goodsfor his own benefit.

At the same time, the fees for additionaland variation works (âthe feesâ) are also payable.  It is indisputable that the time for payment of the 6<sup>th</sup> instalment has not yet arrived.  Even Leung Wan Kee says that it has deliberately withheld application to the Marine Department forfinal inspection for fear that once inspection was completed and a license was granted in favour of Dragon Pearl, the latter wouldsimply take possession of the Vessel without settling the outstanding payment. Even though Leung Wan Kee was allegedly ready, willingand able to deliver the Vessel, the primary obligation of Dragon Pearl to perform the contract by paying the 6<sup>th</sup> instalment was transformed into a secondary obligation to pay damages for breach of contract: <i>Photo Production v.

This is because the lien will be lost once Leung Wan Kee delivers possession to the owner: <i>Trustee of the Property of F. Lord (a bankrupt) v.

The correspondence showed that when delivery of theVessel was demanded of Leung Wan Kee, there was never any claim to a lien.  In particular, in a letter dated 27 May 2010, Leung WanKeeâs solicitors asserted a right to resell the Vessel which was equivalent to asserting that it was Leung Wan Keeâs property,without any mention of a lien. Leung Wan Kee has by its conduct, so Mr. Yin submits, made clear to Dragon Pearl that it would nothave released the Vessel upon tender of the correct amount and consequently any right which Leung Wan Kee may have to assert a lienhas since been lost. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I do not think the law requires the unpaid seller to use the word âlienâ expressly provided his meaning is clear.  In the correspondence,especially the letter dated 27 May 2010, Leung Wan Kee made it clear that without having received the 5<sup>th</sup> instalment, it would not arrange any handover of the Vessel.  That was clear assertion of a lien.  It went on to assert that it acceptedrepudiation of the Agreement and claimed damages of  about $9.45 million. The claimant under a lien does not lose it by demandingfor too large a sum or by basing it partly on the wrong cause: <i>Albermarle Supply Co. v.

The owner must then in the absence of express agreement tender an amount covering the lien reallyexisting. If he does not, unless excused, he has no answer to a claim of lien. He may be excused from tendering (1) if he has noknowledge or means of knowledge of the right amount; (2) if the person claiming the lien for a wrong cause or amount makes it clearthat he will not release the goods unless his full claim is satisfied, and that claim is wrongful. The fact that the claim is madefor more than the right amount does not matter unless the claimant gives no particulars from which the right amount can be calculated,or makes it clear that he insists on the full amount of the right claimed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Further, Leung Wan Keeâs threat of re-selling the Vessel was its alternative remedy under SOGO.

The police found the Vessel with crew members of Dragon Pearl on board.

In purported defence and counterclaim, Dragon Pearl alleges thatthere were defects in the production and delay in delivery of the Vessel under the Agreement, causing it to suffer loss of profitand reputation and goodwill. Although the DP Action referred to the Agreement, Dragon Pearl did not seek damages along these lines. Even so, I do not think it should be barred from raising a defence and counterclaim in the LWK Action.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Insofar as defective production is concerned, long before the litigation started, Dragon Pearl has already asserted that Leung WanKeeâs production was not complete or up to standard and refused to accept some of the work and materials covered by the 5<sup>th</sup> instalment. There was also the question of whether variation works arose out of Leung Wan Keeâs fault.  The letter before actiondated 28 April 2010 set out some of the defects.  In addition, a list of defects has been exhibited.  I accept that there are triableissues on the question of defects.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The costs of making good those defects are claimed to be $4,000,000, supported by a one-page document from the company managingthe Vessel on Dragon Pearlâs behalf.  There is no breakdown for this sum.   On the other hand, Leung Wan Kee asserts that at mostthe costs for remedial works should be in the sum of $30,000.  I disregard Dragon Pearlâs estimated sum for want of particulars.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  However, the loss arising out of defective production is not limited to making good those defects.  During the period for remedialwork, Dragon Pearl may be entitled to e.g. rent a substitute vessel to discharge the functions of the Vessel. Dragon Pearl has provideddocuments to show the daily rental cost and estimated loss of profits.  I find the quantum to be triable and may well exceed theclaim of Leung Wan Kee.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Insofar as delay in delivery is concerned, there is a dispute as to whether or not Leung Wan Kee had been guilty of delay.  LeungWan Kee claims that any delay was consented to by Dragon Pearl.  Further, the maximum loss recoverable is prescribed under clause11.5 which provides that starting from the 31<sup>st</sup> day after the due date for delivery (i.e. 4.8.2009) Leung Wan Kee has to deduct $5,000 from the contract price as penalty for eachdayâs delay in delivery.  The maximum deduction will be $600,000.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Complaints of delay were as early as in mid-2009.  According to Dragon Pearl, it was even before the 4<sup>th</sup> instalment was paid. Although a fire at the Xingjiang shipyard was said to have caused a few monthsâ delay, it occurred after theoriginal completion date under the Agreement.  Notwithstanding the âconsentâ to postpone the completion date, there remains alive issue as to whether or not Leung Wan Kee was responsible for the delay.  This is clearly triable.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  As for the damages arising out of delay, arguably the quantum is limited to $600,000 pursuant to clause 11.5.  However, any lossarising out of defective production is not so limited. </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Given that Dragon Pearl has a defence and counterclaim for damages which might extinguish Leung Wan Keeâs claim and which ariseout of the same subject matter of Leung Wan Keeâs claim under the Agreement,   Dragon Pearl is entitled to unconditional leaveto defend.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Although Leung Wan Kee was aware of the potential defence of Dragon Pearl, Dragon Pearl has never purported to quantify it beforeaction.  Dragon Pearl did not even claim for damages in the DP Action.  This might well have led Leung Wan Kee into thinking it hasa greater chance than it should have in the present application.  I consider it proper to order costs in the cause of the LWK Action.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE INTERIM PAYMENT APPLICATION</i></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Under Order 29 rule 11(c), Leung Wan Kee has to show that if the action proceeded to trial, it would obtain judgment for substantialdamages against Dragon Pearl.  From the analysis under the Partial Judgment Application, Leung Wan Kee is unable to show that, takinginto account the potential defence and counterclaim, the debt/damages it can recover will at least represent the amount of the 5<sup>th</sup> and/or 6<sup>th</sup> instalment.  The burden under Order 29, rule 11(c) is not discharged.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE CONSOLIDATION APPLICATION</i></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  It would have been correct as a matter of principle for the 2 actions to be consolidated and tried together given that the causesof action arose out of closely connected facts.  However, given my ruling under O.14A, if the DP Action is not pursued, there isno point in ordering consolidation.   Dragon Pearl can simply put in a defence and counterclaim to LWK Action.  I leave it to theparties to work out a set of directions within 28 days after considering this Decision.  Costs will be reserved.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>CONCLUSION</i></p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Under Order 14A, I rule that the property in the Vessel remains with Leung Wan Kee as a matter of construction of the Agreement. It possesses a common law lien, a statutory lien of an unpaid seller and a statutory right to sell. The lien is limited to the 5<sup>th</sup> instalment of the purchase price but not damages.  The fact that Leung Wan Kee has not used the word âlienâ when it first assertedits right in correspondence and that it had claimed for a larger amount thereunder do not deprive it of the lien. </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In respect of each application, I order as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)   Re the delivery application and injunction application:  Dragon Pearlâs summons is dismissed, with an order <i>nisi</i> that costs be to Leung Wan Kee with certificate for counsel.</p>        <p>(b)   Re the striking out application: the summons is dismissed, with an order <i>nisi</i> that costs be to Leung Wan Kee with certificate for counsel.</p>        <p>(c)   Re the partial judgment application: there be unconditional leave to Dragon Pearl to defend.
