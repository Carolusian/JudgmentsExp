The 1st defendant,a world wide shipping line in Japan received the goods from San Yuan on the 8th September 1979 at the port of Keelung for shipmenton their vessel the "Futami Maru" to the Sudan. The goods were shipped under two clean bills of lading issued by the 1st defendantin favour of the 1st plaintiff.

The Owners of the Vessel "Shin Shien" and another</u><sup>(2)</sup>, the question whether a foreign jurisdiction clause covers an action framed solely in tort was raised before Cons J., as he thenwas. The foreign jurisdiction clause contained in the bill of lading in that action was phrased in identical terms to clause 3 inthe bills of lading in this case. Although it was unnecessary for the purpose of his judgment to decide the point Cons J. formedthe view that the jurisdiction clause was not wide enough to cover an action in tort. Nevertheless he did so with reluctance forhe did not feel that such a decision accorded with common sense. He cited with approval the comments of Cairns L.J. in <u>The Makefjell</u><sup>(3)</sup> where he said at page 33:-</p>    <table border="0" width="88%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="88%" valign="top">'To a business man it would be absurd to suppose that if one cause of action was pleaded it should be triable in Norway accordingto Norwegian law, whereas if another cause of action was pleaded it might be triable anywhere where one of the owners's ships mightbe arrested and possibly according to a different system of law; and that if cargo owners wished to pursue both causes of actionthey could pursue them in two different Courts and according to two different legal codes. Giving a common-sense meaning to the wordsof the clause, I am satisfied that they apply to the claim in tort as well as to the claim in contract.'</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In <u>Kalimantan Timbers Co. v. Mighty Dragon Shipping Co. S.A.</u><sup>(4)</sup> the Court of Appeal held that the immunity conferred by Article III r.6 of the Hague Rules providing that the carrier shall be dischargedfrom all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date whenthe goods should have been delivered is not restricted to damages for breach of contract, but includes an action in tort.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr. Waung in support of his argument cited <u>Monro v. Bognor Urban District Council</u><sup>(5)</sup> where the plaintiff after doing certain work under a contract refused to continue contending that he had been induced to enter intothe contract by fraudulent misrepresentations. The defendant's application for a stay in order to refer the dispute to arbitrationunder the arbitration clause in the contract was refused as the dispute was not a dispute "upon or in relation to or in connectionwith the contract" within the meaning of the arbitration clause. Mr. Waung also referred me to <u>London Sack &amp; Bag Co. Ltd. v. Dixon &amp; Lugton Ltd.</u><sup>(6)</sup>, <u>The Elizabeth H</u><sup>(7)</sup>, <u>Printing Machinery Company Limited v. Liontype and Machinery Limited</u><sup>(8)</sup> and <u>Turnock v. Sartoris</u><sup>(9)</sup> where a stay in each case was refused upon an application to refer the dispute to arbitration. It was submitted that when a doubtarose whether a jurisdiction clause covered a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation no stay should be granted.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> These authorities depended upon the construction of the particular contracts as to whether a clear agreement has been made to arbitrateor whether the subject matter in dispute was covered by the arbitration clause. There is a fundamental distinction between a jurisdictionclause and an arbitration clause. I do not therefore consider that these cases support the plaintiffs' proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The claim by the plaintiffs in the instant case is not framed solely in tort, but partly in tort and partly in contract. Essentiallythe claim in tort is based upon the bills of lading whether it is in negligence or fraudulent misrepresentation. Although it wassubmitted that if part of the claim falls within the jurisdiction clause and part outside, no stay should be granted, I do not agree.<u>The Eschersheim</u><sup>(10)</sup> clearly shows that it is a matter of discretion.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Multiplicity of Proceedings</u></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> There is no doubt that it is undesirable to have separate proceedings, <u>The Pine Hill</u><sup>(11)</sup>, <u>Taunton-Collins v. Cromie and others</u><sup>(12)</sup>. In some cases it was held to be the decisive factor, <u>The Eschersheim</u><sup>(10)</sup>. Mr. Ribeiro for the 1st defendant accepts this proposition, but submits that in looking at the substance of the claims the evidencerelative to the 1st defendant will be different to that to be adduced against the 2nd defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The case of the 2nd defendant is that there was material non disclosure in that the issue of a letter of indemnity in exchange fora clean bill of lading is regarded as a fraudulent practice by all Maritime Courts. The evidence on this matter will not be relevantto the cargo claim. The issues to be determined are quite different and do not overlap. It is pertinent to observe as was suggestedby Mr. Ribeiro whether it was necessary to sue the 2nd defendant at this stage. The plaintiffs could conceivably have awaited theresult of the proceedings against the 1st Defendant before suing the 2nd defendant. Accordingly I am of the opinion that there isno substance to the plaintiffs' contention on this point.</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="heading"><u>Time Bar</u></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> It is not in dispute that this action is time barred in Japan.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Brandon J. considered the question of a time bar in the <u>Adolf Warski</u> <sup>(13)</sup> where he said at page 112:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="89%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" height="294" valign="top"></td>            <td width="88%" height="294" valign="top">                'There are, as it seems to me, three possible views about this.

The second view, at the other end of the scale, is that since the grant of a stay would,in effect, defeat the plaintiffs' claims altogether, the existence of the time-bar in Poland should be treated as a factor againsta stay. The third view, which is intermediate between the first and second, is that, since the advantage to the plaintiffs of escapingthe time-bar if a stay is refused and the advantage to the defendants of being able to rely on the time-bar if a stay is granted,are about equal in weight, the existence of a time-bar should be treated as a neutral factor and disregarded.'                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" height="21" valign="top"></td>            <td width="88%" height="21" valign="top">                Later at page 113 he said:-                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" height="191" valign="top"></td>            <td width="88%" height="191" valign="top">'There are, as it seems to me, two conflicting policy considerations in relation to this matter.

There would be an injustice to a plaintiff, who hassuffered a legal wrong and has started proceedings, if he is precluded altogether from pursuing his remedy. The fact that the plaintiffwill have no remedy in the foreign court seems to me to be a powerful factor against a stay.

However,on the 12th October 1981 the summons was transferred to the Commercial Judge and came before me on the 11th December 1981 after thetime limit had expired. The plaintiffs allowed this to happen through their own default. The 1st defendants are not willing to waivethe time bar. Mr. Waung said that by issuing a protective writ in Japan unnecessary expense would have been incurred. He furthercontended that such a step was not warranted having regard to the standing of the plaintiffs by comparison with the defendants withtheir substantial assets. Nevertheless in the event that I am disposed to grant a stay Mr. Waung invites me to make it subject toa condition that the 1st defendant waives its rights under the time bar.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Proceedings in the instant case were instituted before the time limit in Japan expired. In all the circumstances I do not considerthat the actions of the plaintiffs were deliberately designed to force the Court's hand nor do I think that their conduct was unreasonable.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> A subsidiary argument raised for the plaintiffs was that no defence had been filed by the 1st defendant. By so doing the 1st defendantwould be submitting to the jurisdiction of the Court. I am satisfied that there is no such requirement. In any event the circumstancesin issue are before the Court.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Conclusions</u></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> By bringing this action the plaintiffs are prima facie in breach of their contract to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of theCourt in Japan.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In <u>The Cap Blanco</u><sup>(16)</sup> Sir Samuel Evans at page 136 said:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="90%">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="89%">'In dealing with commercial documents of this kind, effect must be given, if the terms of the contract permit it, to the obvious intentionand agreement of the parties'.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The goods were manufactured in Taiwan from where they were shipped to the Sudan. The 2nd defendants allege that the goods were alreadydamaged before they were loaded onto the ship. The evidence on the cause of damage would be given by those persons in Taiwan responsiblefor the packing and transportation of the goods to the port, stevedores and the officers and crew of the ship who were concernedwith loading.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> Other evidence with regard to the condition of the goods may be required from witnesses in the Sudan where the survey was conducted.Mr. Nakagawa, the Assistant General Manager of N.Y.K. Line (H.K.) Limited stated in his affirmation that his company is the portagent for the 1st defendant's vessel. No one in Hong Kong has personal Knowledge of the transaction with the result that all instructionswill have to be obtained from the 1st defendant in Japan.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> For the plaintiffs it was submitted that on the disputed facts Taiwan has a closer connection to Hong Kong than to Japan. However,the only connection with Hong Kong is that the 1st plaintiff's registered office is here. No factual evidence is available in HongKong. Mr. Ribeiro even suggested that the 1st plaintiff may have no right to sue as the title to the goods could have passed to the2nd plaintiffs. However, I think that this is a matter to be determined by the trial judge. On the other hand the 1st defendant'sprincipal place of business is in Japan whilst the bulk of the evidence is more closely connected with Japan. A trial in Japan wouldbe more convenient, and is likely to be less expensive than in Hong Kong. Another factor pointing to a trial in Japan is the factthat the governing law of the contract is Japanese.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> No question of security arises because the 1st defendant is possessed of substantial assets and no difficulty is likely to be encounteredby the plaintiffs in enforcing any judgment they may obtain. There is no likelihood that the plaintiffs would not receive a fairtrial in Japan.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> I found no merit in the plaintiffs' suggestion that a successful judgment in Japan would create exchange control problems.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> I have therefore come to the conclusion that the plaintiffs have not discharged the burden of proof to show strong grounds why astay should not be granted.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> However, I do not consider that it would be just to deprive the plaintiffs of their right of action by virtue of the time bar. Thedelay has been minimal and will not cause undue hardship or prejudice to the 1st defendant. Accordingly in the exercise of my discretionI shall order a stay conditional upon the 1st defendant undertaking to waive the time bar in Japan if it is lawful to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> In the event that it is not permissible the plaintiffs are at liberty to apply for the stay to be removed.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> By agreement no order as to costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p>(1)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20P%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) P. 94</a></p>    <p>(2) A.J. 1979 Folio No. 9</p>    <p>(3)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 2 Ll.L.R. 29</a></p>    <p>(4)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20HKLR%20272" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) H.K.L.R. 272</a></p>    <p>(5)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281915%29%203%20KB%20167" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1915) 3 K.B. 167</a></p>    <p>(6)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%202%20All%20ER%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 2 All E.R. 763</a></p>    <p>(7)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 1 Ll.L.R. 172</a></p>    <p>(8)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281912%29%201%20Ch%20566" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1912) 1 Ch. 566</a></p>    <p>(9) (1889) Ch.
