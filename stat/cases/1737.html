A mandatory injunction that the defendant, his servants, agents, tenants or otherwise do forthwith carry out repair work to thewater pipe(s) or drainage system of the defendant's Premises;</p>        <p align="justify">2. An injunction restraining the defendant whether by himself, his servants, agents, tenants or otherwise from allowing the waterpipe(s) or drainage system of the defendant's Premises to fall into disrepair in contravention of the DMC; and</p>        <p align="justify">3. Damages.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On 14th July 1994, Deputy Judge Woolley entered judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant for, inter alia, the aforesaidinjunctions and damages to be assessed.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> After the plaintiffs obtained the said judgment, the water leakage stopped some time in August 1994. The plaintiffs therefore appointeda decorator to make good the ceiling plaster and paint of the plaintiffs' Premises at the cost of $13,500.00.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> However, in August 1995, the water leakage started again and affected the same areas of the plaintiffs' Premises as in 1993 to 1994.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiffs therefore applied to the Court for an order to commit the defendant to prison for contempt of Court. The applicationwas heard before Chan J. (as he then was) on 27th March 1996, but was adjourned sine die for the defendant to carry out repair work.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The water leakage ceased in about May 1996. The plaintiffs therefore engaged another contractor to repair the ceiling of the plaintiffs'Premises again at the cost of $16,000.00.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The assessment of damages was heard before me on 6th April 2001.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiffs' Claims</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The plaintiffs' claims are for the costs of repair for the 2 occasions of water leakage in the sums of $13,500.00 and $16,000.00respectively.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiffs also claim for the costs of the surveyors in investigating into the cause of the water leakage and for preparing 2reports in the total sum of $18,000.00</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The plaintiffs had claimed damages in the sum of $42,000.00 for disturbance, annoyance and inconvenience as their enjoyment of theplaintiffs' Premises had been seriously affected. However, at the request of the defendant's wife, the plaintiffs waived this claimat the hearing of the assessment. It is therefore not necessary for me to assess this item of the claims.</p>    <p class="heading">Evidence for the plaintiffs</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The 2nd named plaintiff gave evidence at the hearing of the assessment. She testified the extent of the damage caused by water leakageon the first occasion by referring to the photographs produced by her and marked exhibits "P4(1) - (14)". She also testified theextent of the damage caused by water leakage on the 2nd occasion by referring to the photographs produced by her and marked exhibits"P5(1) - (4)".</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> An invoice (exhibit "P2") and a receipt (exhibit "P3") both dated 17th December 1994 and issued by Oi Mei Don Decoration Design Co.("OMD") were produced. They confirmed that the plaintiffs had spent $13,500.00 to repair the ceilings of the living room, toiletand bathroom of the plaintiffs' Premises as a result of the first water leakage. She testified that she had in first obtained anotherquotation dated 9th July 1994 (exhibit "P1") from Mee Ah Design &amp; Decoration Co. ("Mee Ah") for the repair works. The repaircost quoted by Mee Ah was in the sum of $37,000.00. She found it too expensive and hence engaged OMD to do the repair work instead.She also testified that OMD took about 2 weeks to do the repair work.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> For the second water leakage, the 2nd named plaintiff testified that the plaintiffs spent $16,000.00 to repair the plaintiffs' Premises.She produced an invoice dated 5th June 1996 (exhibit "P8") and two receipts dated 5th June 1996 and 16th June 1996 respectively (exhibits"P9(1) - (2)") from Fu Sing Decoration &amp; Light Co. ("Fu Sing") to confirm the repair work done and the amount spent. She alsotestified that Fu Sing took about 8 to 10 days to do the repair work on this occasion.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Two survey reports prepared by Citybuild Surveyors Limited ("Citybuild") dated 7th April 1994 and 15th January 1996 respectively(exhibits "P6" &amp; "P7") were produced to confirm that on these two occasions of water leakage, the causes were the same. Bothreports concluded that with deficiency in the fresh water piping material and/or bad workmanship, water was seeping out from theconcealed water piping in the defendant's Premises and penetrated through the concrete floor slab to the plaintiffs' Premises. Thereports also confirmed that the extent of the water leakage on the two occasions were quite large.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> A letter dated 31st March 1994, an invoice dated 13th April 1994, an official receipt dated 20th April 1994, a debit-note dated 15thJanuary 1996 and an official receipt dated 19th January 1996 (exhibits "P10" to "P14" respectively) all issued by Citybuild wereproduced. They confirmed that the plaintiffs had to pay Citybuild a total sum of $18,000.00 being Citybuild's professional fees forthe 2 surveys and reports.</p>    <p class="heading">Evidence for the defendant</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The defendant' wife, Madam Hau Chu Lan, was representing the defendant, and she gave evidence for the defendant. She also calleda witness, Mr. Wong Yan Chor from Chun Fung Decoration Design Co. ("Chun Fung") to give evidence.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Madam Hau testified that the defendant's Premises had water leakage problem too and the defendant spent about $20,000.00 to do repairwork for the defendant's Premises. She was of the view that the costs of repair incurred by the plaintiffs were too expensive becausethe damage in the plaintiffs' Premises was less serious than the damage in the defendant's Premises.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> She also testified that the defendant later on spent about $200,000.00 to renovate the whole of the defendant's Premises includingthe change of water pipes. Photographs of the defendant's Premises were produced (exhibit "D1(1) - (7)") to show the extent of therenovation. An invoice from Chun Fung dated 18th August 1996 (exhibit "D2") was also produced to confirm that the defendant spent$210,100.00 on the renovation.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> On the other hand, Mr. Wong from Chun Fung testified that the problem of water leakage in Plover Cove Garden was common. He had donerepair work due to water leakage for 4 to 5 flats in the same development. He found that the prices in the 2 invoices, exhibits "P2"and "P8", were too expensive. He was of the view that the reasonable price for the repair work referred to in exhibits "P2" and "P8"should be $1,800.00 and $6,500 respectively.</p>    <p class="heading">Assessment</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The measure of damages for nuisance is the same as that for tort generally. In <strong>Grosvenor Hotel Co. v. Hamilton</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1894%5d%202%20QB%20836" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1894] 2 Q.B. 836</a> at 840, Lindley L.J. said this:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The damages are whatever loss results to the injured party as a natural consequence of the wrongful act of the defendant."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Having considered all the evidence before me, I find that the damage done to the plaintiffs' Premises on both occasions were causedby water leakage from the defendant's Premises, and that the plaintiffs had to spent $13,000.00 and $16,000.00 on the 2 occasionsto do the repair work.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> I find that the sums of $13,000.00 and $16,000.00 were reasonable sums incurred for the repair work. The defendant himself had incurredabout $20,000.00 to do repair work for the defendant's Premises. Thus, the sums of $13,000.00 and $16,000.00 incurred by the plaintiffscan in no way be regarded as expensive. I do not accept the evidence given by Mr Wong. His estimates of $1,800.00 and $6,500.00 werefar too low and do not seem to be realistic at all, particularly in view of the fact that the repair work lasted for about 2 weekson the first occasion and 8 to 10 days on the second occasion. In giving his estimates, he was just looking at the two invoices,exhibits "P2" and "P8". He did not inspect the plaintiffs' Premises at all and would not know the exact extent of the damage doneto the plaintiffs' Premises. I therefore do not find that his estimates could be relied upon at all.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I also find that the plaintiffs had incurred the sum of $18,000.00 for the 2 surveys and reports and the sum is reasonable in thecircumstances.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Since the costs of repair and the fees for the surveys and reports were losses suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the defendant'sbreach of the DMC, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover these expenses from the defendant.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In the circumstances, I assess the plaintiffs' loss and damages in the total sum of $47,500.00 as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <div align="left">            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="50%" valign="top">1.
