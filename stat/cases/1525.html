I have examined the exhibits to thoseaffidavits.  I have considered the skeleton submissions filed and supplemented, as they were this morning orally.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The principles to be applied when considering the grant or refusal of an application for an interlocutory injunction were enunciatedby the House of Lords in <i>American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 396.</a>  They do not need to be rehearsed in this decision beyond stating that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)     the plaintiff must show that there is a serious question to be tried and, if it succeeds,</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)     the court must consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing interlocutory relief.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> When considering whether the balance of convenience favours the granting or refusal of interlocutory relief, the court should considerwhether if the plaintiff succeeds he would be adequately compensated by damages for the loss sustained between the application andthe trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> If damages would not provide an adequate remedy, the court should then go on to consider whether if the plaintiff fails, the defendantwould be adequately compensated under the plaintiffâs undertaking in damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> I now turn to the facts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiff company is part of a United Kingdom-based group retailing home improvement products.  In affidavits filed in supportof its applications, the plaintiff asserts that it is the largest international decoration and building material retail group inEurope and the third largest in the world.  It operates over 700 stores in Europe and Asia.  One of its main retail brands is âB&amp;Qâand under this brand, the plaintiff sells a wide variety of goods, including do it yourself products, building materials, home improvementand gardening supplies.  It is apparent from the plaintiffâs affidavit that the brand âB&amp;Qâ is integral to its worldwideoperations.  This is clearly reflected in its advertising programs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff has, in recent years, expanded its operations into China.  By the end of December 2006, they had 58 stores in 25 cities. By any account, the plaintiffâs business in China is extensive.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The plaintiff is the owner in Hong Kong of a number of registered trademarks in the style of âB&amp;Qâ both in English and inChinese characters and in various combinations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In November 2006, the plaintiff became aware that the defendant was trading in Hong Kong, under the style âP&amp;Qâ and was usingas part of its name, the same Chinese characters as are contained in the plaintiffâs registered trademarks.  Further investigationrevealed that the defendant was in the business of selling products and services for home improvement, including kitchens, bathrooms,flooring, tiles and decorating materials.  That is to say essentially the same type of products that the plaintiff sold worldwideand in China and intended to sell in Hong Kong [the plaintiff deposes to the fact that they intend to open its first store in HongKong in July 2007].  The plaintiff further alleges that the defendant has deliberately adopted as part of its advertising the distinctivecolour and layout used by the plaintiff, which it says, has come to be associated with the plaintiffâs reputation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> Essentially, the plaintiffâs case is and will be that the defendant has deliberately set out to trade on the goodwill of the plaintiff,and in the course of so doing has infringed the plaintiffâs registered trademarks.  That part of the plaintiffâs cause of actionis based on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559">Cap. 559</a>, which prohibits the use of identical and confusingly similar marks, in respect of identical or similar goods.  On theface of it, the defendant appears to have set out replicate the distinctive features of the plaintiffâs registered trademarks albeitthat it used âPâ instead of âQâ in its own name.  The similarity between the two cannot properly be described as co-incidental. I am satisfied, on the material before me, that there are serious issues to be tried under this limb of the plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The plaintiffâs second complaint is that the defendant is passing itself off as having a connection to the plaintiff when it hasnot, and by implication that the goods sold by the defendant are attributable to the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The essential ingredients of the common law tort of passing off are set out in <i>Reckitt and Coleman Products Ltd v. Borden Inc and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20WLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 WLR 491.</a>  They can be summarised as :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(1)     that the plaintiff has acquired a reputation or goodwill in his product or service;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(2)     that the defendant misrepresents whether intentionally or not that the product or service offered by him were the plaintiffâs;and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left">(3)     that causes damage to the plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> I am satisfied that under this limb of the plaintiffâs claim there are serious issues to be tried.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> I must next address the question whether the plaintiff could be compensated by damages rather than by an injunction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> I accept, as the plaintiffâs counsel submits, that damages would not, in the circumstances of the instant case, be an adequateremedy.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The plaintiff asserts, and I accept, that the good name and reputation of the plaintiff cannot be properly protected by an awardof damages after a trial and that the balance of convenience requires that it be granted injunctions to be put in place immediately.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> In addition to the usual injunctions, the plaintiff asks for the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â3.
