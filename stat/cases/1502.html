INTRODUCTION</i></p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a> The plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant are Hong Kong companies.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is a Singaporean company.  They all carry on the business of, <i>inter alia</i>, manufacturing and sale of leather goods.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On 19 July 2006, the plaintiff commenced the present action, suing the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for trade mark infringement.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Upon its application, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was joined as a party on 12 December 2005.  The Defence and Counterclaim was then filed on 20 December 2006.  The plaintifffiled the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim on 27 January 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> On 25 January 2007, Mr Shipp, counsel for the plaintiff, wrote to Mr Szeto, junior counsel for the defendants and the pleader ofthe Defence and Counterclaim, as a matter of courtesy and under paragraph 5 of Practice Direction 19.1, making certain comments onMr Szetoâs pleadings.  Mr Szeto however did not respond to Mr Shippâs letter.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> By summons dated 1 February 2007, the plaintiff applied to (1) strike out the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs defence and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs counterclaim and (2) enter judgment against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as <i>per</i> the schedule annexed to the summons on the ground that the pleading does not disclose a reasonable cause of defence or action, asthe case may be.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>B.  THE PARTIESâ PLEADED CASE</i></p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The pleadings are summarised below.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>B.1  The Statement of Claim</i></p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In the statement of claim, the plaintiff pleaded that it is the registered proprietor of the trade mark âCondottiâ under registrationnumber 19883577 in Class 18 of the Register in respect of âarticles made from leather or imitations of leather not included inother classesâ (âthe Trade Markâ) as of 6 October 1987.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had infringed the Trade Mark by using in the course of business signs identical to the Trade Mark in relation to articlesmade from leather or imitations or leather without the plaintiffâs consent.  The plaintiff relied on an advertisement placed bythe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in a publication entitled <i>Hong Kong Leather Goods &amp; Bags, Vol.1, 2006</i> published by the Hong Kong Development Council.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiff claimed for an injunction, delivery up, damages and consequential relief.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>B.2  Defence and Counterclaim</i></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In about 1974, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant originated and/or invented the trademark âCondottiâ (âthe Markâ) for, in particular, its leather products business. Thus the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is and was at all material times the only true and rightful proprietor of the Mark.  Since 1974, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has been engaged in the business of selling and manufacturing leather products in particular leather products bearing theMark and has been conducting its business under and by reference to the Mark in Singapore and Hong Kong and has developed its businessof selling and manufacturing leather products bearing to mark in other countries.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has since gained and maintained the reputation in the leather products business by the selling and manufacturing high qualityproducts bearing the Mark in but not limited to the aforesaid countries.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has at all material times acquired a substantial reputation and goodwill in those countries under or by reference to theMarks which indicates to the leather industry and markets the business and products of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant exclusively.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had first applied for and was granted registrations of the Mark in countries including Singapore since 1980.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is and was at all material times the true and rightful proprietor of the Mark and is and was entitled to be so registered. It is therefore denied that the plaintiff was and is ever the true and rightful proprietor of the Mark and it was and is never entitledto be so registered.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The defendants went on to plead that the plaintiff had infringed the Mark thus.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> In about 1986, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant started to retain the plaintiff as one of its manufacturers of leather products bearing the Mark and authorized the plaintiffto manufacture leather products bearing the Mark.  Before that, the plaintiff had no connection with or entitlement to the Mark.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> At about the same time, a Hau Chung Fung of the plaintiff misrepresented to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that the plaintiff would need to register itself as the proprietor of the Mark in Hong Kong so as to enable the plaintiffto be the manufacturer of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in Hong Kong.  Relying on the misrepresentation, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant gave consent to the plaintiff and authorized it to be registered as the proprietor of the Trade Mark in Hong Kong for thesaid purpose.  The plaintiff is thus holding the registration of the Trade Mark in Hong Kong on trust for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In about early 2004, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant ceased to authorize the plaintiff as its manufacturer.  The plaintiff has since ceased to have any right to use and/ordeal with the Trade Mark and/or maintain itself as the registered proprietor of the Trade Mark in Hong Kong or elsewhere.  The plaintiffhas since wrongfully continued to use and/or deal with the Trade Mark and to cause and/or maintain the said registration in HongKong.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The defendants also attacked the registration of the Mark by the plaintiff without the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs consent in other countries.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Further, the defendants pleaded that the plaintiff had wrongfully effected or promoted sales of leather products bearing the Markin Hong Kong or in the aforesaid countries.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs defence is that on or about 10 January 2003, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant appointed it as one of its manufacturers of leather products bearing the Mark.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has since been rightfully authorized by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to act as its agent to advertise, promote and market the Mark.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> In the Counterclaim, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant first repeated the matters pleaded in the Defence.  It then went on to allege that by reason of those matters and by maintainingthe registration of the Trade Mark, the plaintiff has passed off its produces and business as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  It further alleged that by maintaining the registration of the Trade Mark, the plaintiff has equipped itself with andis holding instrument(s) of fraud.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant further pleaded that the plaintiff is liable to assign its registrations in Hong Kong and other countries to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Finally, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant claimed for injunctions, an order for assignment of the said registrations of the Trade Mark or alternatively an orderthat the registration of the trade mark in Hong Kong be invalidated<a>[1]</a> and consequential relief.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>B.3  Reply and Defence to Counterclaim</i></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> On the partiesâ relationship, the plaintiff only admitted that it had sold and supplied leather goods to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> On the word âCondottiâ, the plaintiff pleaded that it is of Italian in origin and Via Dei Condotti is one of the most famousstreets in Rome.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant could not have originated or invented the Mark as alleged.  The plaintiff denied that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the only true proprietor of the Mark.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The plaintiff further denied that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has since 1974 engaged in the business of selling and manufacturing leather products bearing the Mark in Hong Kong or thatit has any reputation in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> On the counterclaim, the plaintiff pleaded that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs alleged case of passing off and its case in general together with its case for consequential relief has not been properlypleaded and is unintelligible.  It reserved the right to plead further thereto if and when the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant pleads its case properly.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>C.    DISCUSSION</i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>C.1  The validity of the registration of the Trade Mark</i></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The defendants sought to dispute the validity of the registration of the Trade Mark.  They have, however, failed to follow the requisiteprocedure.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Sections 52 and 53 of Trade Mark Ordinance (âTMOâ) set out the grounds upon which the registration of a trade mark may be revokedor declared invalid.  An application for the revocation or a declaration of invalidity may be made to the Registrar of Trade Marksor the court : sections 52(1) and 53(1).  When the application is made to the Registrar, the application shall be accompanied bya statement of the grounds upon which the application is made : see rule 36(2) for revocation on grounds of non-use; rule 40(2) forrevocation on grounds other than non-use and rule 46(2) for declaration of invalidity of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/559A" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Rules</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> If any proceedings concerning the trade mark is pending before the court, the application for revocation or declaration of invaliditymust be made to the court : <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/559A/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 77(1)(a).</a>  The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/559A" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Rules</a> however does not contain any rules on the procedure to be adopted for such applications.  One needs to turn to Order 100 of the Rulesof the High Court, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap.4</a>.  Order 100, rule 3 deals with, among other things, the proceedings where validity of the registration ofa trade mark is disputed.  Sub rule 3(2) provides that a party in such proceedings who in his pleading (whether a defence or counterclaim)disputes the validity of the registration of a registered trade mark must serve with his pleading particulars of the objections tothe validity of the registration on which he relies in support of the allegation of invalidity.  It should be noted that rule 3 hasnot been revised to cater for the changes introduced by TMO, which came into force on 4 April 2003.  But I see no reason why in itspresent form, rule 3 is not applicable to the present proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Here, the defendants have failed to serve the particulars of objection together with the Defence and Counterclaim.  They have, asrightly pointed out by Mr Shipp, failed to comply with Order 100, rule 3.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Turning to the substance of the plea, Mr Shipp first submitted that the concept of misrepresentation in tort is alien to trade marklaw, which is essentially governed by statute.  In my view, the allegation of misrepresentation explained the reason why the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant allowed the plaintiff to register the Trade Mark in Hong Kong.  It is the key matter that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant relied on in disputing the validity of the registration of the Trade Mark.  Such a plea is plainly legitimate.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Mr Shipp next complained that the basis upon which the registration of the Trade Mark is alleged to have wrongfully remained on theRegister is not properly identified. </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Countering Mr Shippâs argument, Mr Chan, SC, for the defendants, submitted that by reason of the matters pleaded, the registrationof the Trade Mark in Hong Kong should be revoked or invalidated : sections 114(b), 5(b); 12(1) to (5); 52(2)(c); 53(3), 53(5) andSchedule 1 of TMO.  In particular, the allegations are clearly facts proving âbad faithâ under section 11(5)(b) and thus the2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is entitled to invalidation under section 53(3).  When it is pointed out that the Defence and Counterclaim made no referenceto any of the above provisions of TMO at all, Mr Chan submitted that it is not necessary to do so because it is sufficient to pleadthe material facts without stating the legal consequences of which those facts permit : <i>In re Vandervellâs Trusts (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20Ch%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 Ch. 269</a>, <i>per</i> Lord Denning at pp.321G-322B.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> I fully accept the proposition that it is sufficient for a pleader to state the material facts without setting out the legal results. However, as noted, in an application to dispute the validity of the registration of a trade mark, the applicant has to serve theparticulars of objection in support of his allegation of invalidity.  The particulars of objection must include the grounds uponwhich he seeks to dispute validity as stipulated in the relevant provisions of TMO.  (See <i>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacobâs Precedents of Pleadings</i>, Forms 68-Q16 68-Q17 at pp.1054 and 1055.)  So contrary to Mr Chanâs submission, the grounds as set out in the various sectionsthat he referred to and developed in his submissions, especially the ground of bad faith, must be pleaded.  It is wrong to suggest,as Mr Chan in effect did, that the grounds can be left to be formulated at trial on the pretext that they are legal results.  Theplaintiff must be informed with precision and sufficient particularity of the grounds upon which the validity of the registrationTrade Mark is disputed at the pleading stage.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>C2.  Passing Off</i></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I now turn to the plea of passing off.  The main thrust of Mr Shippâs argument is that it is not permissible to claim passing offagainst the plaintiff who is the registered owner of the Trade Mark.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Section 10(3) of TMO provides that nothing in TMO affects the law relating to passing off.  In <i>Kerlyâs Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</i>, 14<sup>th</sup> edn, the learned editors said at para.19-005 at p.641 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe express words in the second part of s.2(2) [of the Trade Marks Act 1994, which is the English equivalent of section 10(3) ofTMO] preserving the law of passing off from being altered by the 1994 Act, mean that it is no defence to an action for passing offthat the defendant is registered as proprietor of the mark which he is using; but, where this is the case it is usual for the claimantat the same time to apply to have the registration revoked.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Although the Defence and Counterclaim is susceptible to criticisms, it is exactly what the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has done : claiming for passing off and at the same time disputing the validity of the registration of the Trade Mark. I accordingly reject Mr Shippâs submission.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>C3.  Specific relief</i></p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> What remains is counselâs discussion on the relief prayed for in the Counterclaim, which is principally on Prayer (2).  It canbe disposed of briefly. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Prayer (2) asks for an order to assign the Trade Mark as well as those foreign registrations by the plaintiff.  Mr Shipp submittedthat no assignment can be ordered in respect of the foreign trade marks because they are governed by foreign law.  However, I acceptMr Chanâs submission that it is certainly arguable that the court may order on the pleaded case, if proved, the assignments ofTrade Mark and those trade marks registered in other jurisdictions by the plaintiff to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant : <i>Leadwell CNC Machines Mfg Corp. v</i><i>. Global Crown International Ltd</i>, HCA853/2005, unreported, Yam J, 23 November 2005.  Mr Shippâs submission is rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Prayer (2) further seeks an order that the registration of the Trade Mark be invalidated.  The correct form of prayer according tosection 53 of TMO is a declaration that the registration of the Trade Mark be invalid.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>D.  CONCLUSION</i></p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> As I have demonstrated, there are deficiencies in the Defence and Counterclaim.  Before I proceed to dispose of the present application,I would like to hear the parties on the form of order that the court should make.  I will therefore direct the parties to submitwithin 14 days from the handing down of this Decision further written submission in that regard and on costs.  I will then decidethe matter on paper.
