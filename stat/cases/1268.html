He was paid a basic salaryof $8,000 a month.  He was required to work 11 hours a day with 1 day off in a week and 7 days paid leave a year. (See p. 5 to 6of the Documents Bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Undisputed Facts</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Mr. Ip passed the probation period of 3 months and in January 2005 the Defendant appraised his performance to be satisfactory scoring10.5 out of 20.  The purpose of the staff appraisal report was to assess the performance of each staff during the year for the purposeof bonus payment at year end.  After the staff appraisal report, Mr. Ip duly received a share of the bonus. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On the morning of 18 May 2005, Mr. Ip injured his right wrist.  He went to consult Dr. Lau Hon Chung for treatment. Dr. Lau certifiedMr. Ip to be suffering from right wrist injury and recommended 5 days sick leave from 18 May 2005 to 22 May 2005.  Mr. Ip immediatelyinformed the Defendantâs management staff his condition by telephone.  Later that day, he submitted the medical certificate tothe Defendant and applied for 5 days sick leave (p. 17 of the Documents Bundle).  The sick leave application was duly approved bythe Defendantâs restaurant manager Mr. Wong Wing Yip and general manager Mr Stanley Tse (DW1 &amp; 2).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 22 May 2005, Mr. Ip went to Dr. Lau for a follow-up consultation.  After examining him, Dr. Lau recommended a further 4 daysof sick leave from 23 May to 26 May 2005 (p. 19 of the Documents Bundle).  Mr. Ip then informed the Defendant of the same.  He submittedhis sick leave certificate on the next day, 23 May 2005, to the Defendant and applied for 4 further days of sick leave. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Mr. Ip returned to work on 27 May 2005.  At the end of the day at about 9.45p.m., he was told by the Defendantâs management staffthat his employment would be terminated from 28 May 2005.  He was given 7 daysâ wages in lieu of notice. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Mr. Ip claimed he was discriminated by the Defendant because of his right wrist injury.

It claimed the employment wasterminated because Mr. Ipâs performance was not satisfactory in spite of repeated oral warnings given to Mr. Ip between Januaryand April 2005.  The Defendant claimed that Mr. Ip had failed during rush hours to clear up the tables though customers were waitingat the reception, that he was found playing video games and making phone calls in the toilet during busy periods, failing to servecustomers promptly, chatting to customers during busy periods and refusing to take up duties and leaving them to his colleagues. The Defendant further claimed that Mr. Ip had fully recovered from his injury on 27 May 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Issues</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In order to determine if Mr. Ip was dismissed because of his disability contrary to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/487" class="autolink_findacts">Disability Discrimination Ordinance</a>, the following issues have to be considered:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table width="85%" border="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>                <td width="90%">Whether Mr. Ipâs performance was satisfactory before his dismissal on 27 May 2005, and whether Mr. Ip was guilty of the misconductalleged by the Defendant;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%"> </td>                <td width="90%"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top">(2)</td>                <td width="90%">Whether Mr. Ip had fully recovered from his wrist injury when he returned to work on 27 May 2005;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%"> </td>                <td width="90%"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="6%" valign="top">(3)</td>                <td width="90%">Whether Mr. Ip was dismissed due to his disability contrary to the Ordinance.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The Law</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/487/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6:</a>-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">âDiscrimination against persons with disability, etc.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">A person discriminates against another person in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this ordinance if-</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) on the ground of that other personâs disability he treats him less favourably than he treats or would treat a person withouta disabilityâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/487/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 11</a> provides that it is unlawful to discriminate a person because of his disability:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(2) It is unlawful for the employer, in the case of a person with a disability employed by him at an establishment in Hong Kong,to discriminate against that person;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(c) by dismissing that person, or subjecting him to any other detriment.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/487/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 72</a> provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â72.

The appraisal report of 8 January 2005 showed that his performance met the requirements laid down by the Defendant.  Furthermore,there was no written warning during his employment from the Defendant or any record in writing kept by the Defendant showing thePlaintiff had performance problems. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Wong Wing Yip, manager of the Restaurant, admitted he did not witness Mr. Ip using the mobile phone or playing video games inthe toilet during busy periods at the Restaurant.  He was told by another staff member of such behaviour involving Mr. Ip.  Mr. TseTak Kiu, the General Manger of the Defendantâs Restaurant, admitted he too did not personally see Mr. Ip using the mobile phoneor playing video games in the toilet during busy hours.  The complaint had come from another member of staff Mr. Wong Chong Kongwho alerted him to it.  Furthermore, the Defendant received no verbal or written complaints from customers.  According to Mr. WongWing Yip, another complaint he received was from colleagues of Mr. Ip of his slow performance.  He recalled the complaint was madebefore the performance appraisal in January and the complaint was not made to him but to Mr. Wong Chong Kong only.  Mr. Wong WingYip admitted that Mr. Wong Chong Kong was the only person who reported Mr. Ipâs alleged playing video games and making phone callsin the toilet.  He claimed Mr. Ip was warned in March 2005 against such behaviour, but he had improved after the warning.  However,at a later date, Mr. Wong Chong Kong informed him that Mr. Ip had relapsed.  He admitted that he did not check this out himself norhad he ever caught Mr. Ip in the act. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr. Wong Chong Kong did not give evidence at the hearing, Mr. Tse, the General Manager and the Manager Mr. Wong Wing Yip were theonly witnesses called.  Whether Mr. Ip was playing video games and making telephone calls in the toilet during the Restaurantâsbusy hours have not been substantiated by the person who complained to Mr. Wong Wing Yip and Mr. Tse.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr. Wong Wing Yip alleged in Court that on 15 May 2005 when the Restaurant was busy Mr. Ip was nowhere to be found.  This evidencenever appeared in either Mr. Wong Wing Yip or Mr. Tse Tak Kiuâs witness statements, neither was it put to Mr. Ip in cross-examination. There was apparently no warning given or reference to his absence from the Restaurant without permission from the Defendant at anytime.  Mr. Wong Wing Yip claimed for the first time at the hearing that because of Mr. Ipâs absence without leave on 15 May 2005,he and the management of the Defendant decided to dismiss Mr. Ip when he returned from his sick leave.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  If the reason for the dismissal of Mr. Ip on 27 May was his absence without leave on 15 May prior to his sick leave, it is unreasonablethat it was not raised in any of the Defendantâs witness statements or in the Defence.  As this was not even put to Mr. Ip at cross-examinationand the only person who had raised it for the first time was Mr. Wong Wing Yip during cross-examination, it is unsuitable to placeany weight on this piece of evidence from Mr. Wong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  As to the allegation that Mr. Ip was making phone calls and playing video games in the toilet during the Restaurantâs busy periods,Mr. Ip denied he had done so.  He claimed the toilet cubicles were small and smelly, and it is impossible for him to have stayedin the toilet cubicles making phone calls and playing video games.  The evidence at trial disclosed that there were 3 staff toiletsshared by all male and female staff including kitchen staff and waiters at the Restaurant.  Furthermore, accusations of such behaviourcame solely from Mr. Wong Chong Kong who was not called to give evidence at the hearing.  Mr. Wong Wing Yip admitted that the 3 femalewaitresses at the Restaurant had never laid any complaints against Mr. Ip.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  More importantly, Mr. Ip was given an above average staff performance appraisal in January 2005.  Had Mr. Ip been guilty of playingvideo games and making phone calls while the Restaurant was busy, leaving his other colleagues to wait on guests in spite of oralwarnings, one would expect the Defendant to have written to Mr. Ip and warned him of the consequence of such behaviour.  Unfortunately,there were no written warnings.  Mr. Ip denied he was guilty of such conduct or that he had ever received any oral warnings beforehis dismissal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Having seen and heard the witnesses at the hearing, I find Mr. Ip to be an honest witness.  I accept he was never warned eitherorally or in writing of any misconduct or failure to perform his duties during busy periods at the Restaurant.  The Defendant hasfailed to successfully show Mr. Ipâs performance was unsatisfactory before 18 May 2005.  I am not satisfied the Defendant had provedMr. Ip was guilty of the misconduct alleged. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Issue 2: Whether Mr. Ip had fully recovered from his wrist injury when he returned to work on 27 May 2005</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr. Ip claimed that when he returned to work on 27 May 2005, he was wearing a wrist brace.  He worked a full day that day and at9.45 p.m. when most of the guests have finished their meals, he was called into the office and told his contract was terminated withimmediate effect.  Mr. Ip claimed he had received no prior warnings.  He also claimed that he had informed both the supervisor Mr.Lau and the manager Mr. Wong Wing Yip when he reported for duty on 27 May 2005 that he was advised by the doctor to avoid carryingheavy load and that he would split up the food delivery work on account of his injured wrist which had only recovered 80%.  He alsoclaimed that the wrist brace worn by him was clearly visible because it was connected to the thumb, yet, he was never told he shouldremove it at work.  Mr. Ip further claimed that when he was told his contract was terminated on 27 May, he immediately asked Mr.Wong Wing Yip the reason for his dismissal, but Mr. Wong failed to give him an answer.  He asked again whether it was because hiswork performance or whether it was the injury to his wrist.  Again, he received no answer from Mr. Wong.  He claimed he had a goodworking relationship with his colleagues and he became depressed after he was dismissed from the job by the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr. Wong Wing Yip denied Mr. Ip had told him on 27 May 2005 his wrist was only 80% healed.  He claimed that on the day Mr. Ip reportedto work, Mr. Ip told him he had completely recovered. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  It is Mr. Ipâs claim that when he returned for his follow-up consultation with Dr. Lau Hon Chung on 22 May 2005, he was informedby the doctor that his employer had called the doctorâs clinic to find out about his wrist injury.  Mr. Wong Wing Yip denied hedid any such thing.  Mr. Ip further claimed that when he returned with his sick leave certificate in the afternoon of 18 May 2005,Mr. Wong Wing Yip was obviously dismayed and told him the Restaurant was short of staff and had asked him if he really needed totake such a long sick leave. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I have been shown the two sick leave certificates from Dr. Lau Hon Chung (pages 16 and 18).  The 1<sup>st</sup> document certified Mr. Ip was suffering from right wrist injury and 5 days sick leave from 18 to 22 May was recommended.  The secondcertificate issued on 22 May recommended Mr. Ip to take 4 days sick leave from 23 to 26 May 2005.  As there are no evidence to thecontrary to show Mr. Ip was feigning his wrist injury or that he was malingering, I accept Mr. Ip was suffering from a right wristinjury that rendered him unsuitable to return to work for 9 days in May 2005.  A person suffering from a wrist injury that required9 days sick leave is not expected to have a complete recovery after 9 days, it is understandable for Mr. Ip to have informed hisemployer that he could not carry heavy loads until his wrist is fully recovered.  I accept that was what happened on 27 May 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Issue 3: Whether Mr. Ip was dismissed for his disability contrary to the Ordinance</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Mr. Wong denied he saw Mr. Ip on 18 May when Mr. Ip returned to submit his sick leave certificate.  He claimed he was too busy workingin his office and that he had approved Mr. Ipâs sick leave certificate without meeting Mr. Ip or talking to him.  According toMr. Ip, he went to Mr. Wongâs office and explained the nature of his injury to him before submitting his sick leave certificate. P. 17 of the bundle is a copy of Mr. Ipâs sick leave application record, Mr. Wong Wing Yip admitted he had filled in this formand written in the reason for sick leave as âcrush injury to the right wrist (injury at home)â he signed and dated it on 18 May2005.  Mr. Ip had also signed it on the same day.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  If Mr. Wong had filled in the date, the name and his job title on this form with particulars on the sick leave certificate includingthe reason for the injury and signed on the form where Mr. Ipâs own signature also appeared, he must have reviewed the applicationand the evidence in support of the application before he signed.  He admitted that his only concern at the time was that it was notan industrial accident.  Mr. Ip denied that he had ever told Mr. Wong he was injured at home and he had no idea why Mr. Wong putthat statement in.  The reason why Mr. Wong included that statement in the form was probably because he wanted to make sure Mr. Ipwas not claiming he had an industrial accident at the Restaurant which Mr. Wong admitted was his primary concern at the time.  Itis highly likely that his secondary concern was the staffing at the Restaurant.  It is, therefore possible that he had asked Mr.Ip if he needed to take so many days of sick leave because the Restaurant was short of staff.  No doubt, Mr. Ipâs 9 daysâ sickleave must have caused the Restaurant a staffing problem at a time when it was already short of staff.  From the staff recruitmentrecord produced, the Defendant did hire not only a replacement staff for Mr. Ip but also additional staff to work at the Restaurantduring the relevant period.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  When Mr. Ip returned to work on 27 May 2005, the Defendant found he had not fully recovered from his wrist injury.  He informedMr. Wong that he would not be able to carry heavy load and needed to slow down his work because his right wrist had not fully recovered. It must be obvious to the Defendant then that Mr. Ip would not be working in his full capacity and that it would take some timebefore he could return to full working capacity.  I am satisfied that was the reason why the Defendant decided to terminate Mr. Ipâsemployment.  The dismissal was an infringement of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/487/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 11</a> of the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In the case of <i>Secretary</i> <i>for Justice &amp; Others v.

I am satisfiedthat but for his right wrist injury, Mr. Ip would not have been dismissed on 27 May 2005.  After he returned to work and informedhis employer that his right wrist had not fully recovered and that he was seen wearing a wrist brace, the Defendant decided Mr. Ipâscontract should be terminated.  According to the Defendantâs witness, a waiter is not allowed to wear a wrist brace during workfor hygienic reason.  If Mr. Ipâs wrist required the protection of a wrist band, then it would not be suitable for him to carryon waiting at tables.  The Defendant would have to put him on other duties.  I am satisfied that it was for this reason the Defendantdecided if Mr. Ip could not return to work as a waiter he should be dismissed.  If the Defendant had decided to dismiss him on 15May 2005 because he was absent without leave, it would not have waited until the evening of 27 May 2005 and he would have been toldthe reason for his dismissal at the time.  Even though the Defendant may not realise the act was against the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/487" class="autolink_findacts">Disability Discrimination Ordinance</a>; or that by dismissing Mr. Ip because he could not carry out the normal duties of a waiter due to his injury, the act constituteddiscrimination on the ground of disability, there was an infringement of the Ordinance.  I find the Defendant liable under the Ordinancefor direct discrimination against the Plaintiff.     </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  As the Plaintiff is no longer persuing the claim under indirect discrimination, the issue is no longer relevant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Damages for injury to feelings</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  It was Mr. Ipâs evidence that he asked Mr. Wong Wing Yip on the night of the dismissal the reason for his dismissal.  He wantedto know if the Defendant was not satisfied with his performance or was it because of his wrist injury.  Mr. Wong refused to givehim an answer.  Mr. Ip claimed he felt it was unfair for the Defendant to dismiss him because he had been discharging his dutiesfaithfully and he valued his job and the company of his colleagues.  He also felt he was humiliated by the dismissal; as a result,he was distressed and depressed.  Because his right wrist injury had not fully recovered, in spite of efforts in looking for employmenttwo weeks after the dismissal, he could not find a job.  He also claimed that because of the unhappy experience with the Defendant,he decided not to work as a waiter again.  In September 2005, he returned to his former profession, working as a security guard.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The Court of Appeal in <i>Yuen Wai Han v.

That feeling ofindignation at the tortfeasorâs conduct should not be allowed to inflate the award.  Smith J. further held that the awards shouldnot be too low for it would diminish the respect for the policy of the anti-discrimination legislation nor should it be excessive.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In my assessment of the damages for injury to feelings, I remind myself of the criteria set out in Smith Jâs judgment and thejudgement of Mummery LJ.  Mr. Ip was an employee of the Defendant for approximately 10 months.  He was aged 22Â½ at the time of hisdismissal and he had prior experience working as a waiter at the Aviation Club.  After that, he had worked as a security guard inthe airport for a couple of years.  Against this background, Mr. Ipâs employment with the Defendant cannot be considered as a longone.  Furthermore, even though he had worked as a security guard a few months after he was dismissed, he has now returned to fulltime study.  I hope this experience, albeit unpleasant, has not turned him off completely in persuing a career in the hospitalityindustry.  It is to his credit that he decided to return to full time study and that he is exploring opportunities in different fields.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On the other hand, Mr. Ip felt justifiably aggrieved and his feelings injured.  His dismissal was unexpected and unfair.  Aftertaking 9 days of sick leave he had returned to work in spite of his right wrist not having completely healed, yet his contract wasterminated by the Defendant and he was not even given an explanation for his dismissal.  Taking these matters into account and alsotaking into account the monthly income of Mr. Ip at the time, I assess the appropriate compensation is $50,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Loss of income</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The Plaintiff claimed a loss of income of $44,544.53 for the period between 28 May and 31 December 2005.  Mr. Ip would have continuedto work until the completion of his contract on 31 December 2005 but for his dismissal on 27 May 2005.  I accept that he should becompensated for the period that he was not allowed to carry on with his contract until the end of the contract period.  The lossof income between 28 May 2005 and 31 December 2005 was $57,032.  As Mr. Ip was able to seek employment in the security field in thelatter part of 2005 and his total income during the relevant period was $10,620.80, his loss is the deduction of that sum plus the7 daysâ wages in lieu of notice at $1,866.67.
