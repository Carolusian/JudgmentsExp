The judge heard an application that theamendments to the statements of claim in both actions made on 12 January 2006, the seventh day of the trial, be disallowed.  At theconclusion of the hearing of this appeal, the appeal was dismissed with costs.  This court reserved the question of the basis oftaxation of the costs.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In view of the fact the trial of these actions is part heard, this judgment will kept to a minimum.  These actions are brought bya widow, one action in her own right and the other as administratrix of the estate of her late husband who was killed by an assailant. Reference will be made to the pleadings in the action by the widow in her personal capacity as nothing turns on any difference betweenthe 2 actions.  The cause of action is framed both in contract and in tort.  It suffices to quote the following paragraphs from thestatement of claim in the first action namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â3. In or about April 1999:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) A crew of the Defendant (hereinafter referred to as âthe ATV crewâ) conducted an interview of another Chinese herbalist bythe name of Tang Kin Kwong (hereinafter referred to as âTangâ) who had claimed to be able to cure cancer with tree roots at Tangâsclinic shop which was situated a few doors away from the Deceasedâs Clinic.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) Immediately after the said interview of Tang, the ATV crew came to the Deceasedâs Clinic requesting an interview of the Deceasedand seeking his comment about Tangâs claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c) The Deceased declined to be interviewed and declined to make any comment on Tangâs said claim and emphasized to the ATV crewthat he â<i>did not want any trouble</i>â, meaning that he did not intend to make any or any adverse comment on Tangâs claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d) In the premises, the Deceased had represented to the ATV crew that he was concerned about any adverse consequences in making anyor any adverse comment on Tangâs claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(e) The ATV crew despite the Deceasedâs refusal to be interviewed did not leave the Clinic; the ATV crew continued to ask the Deceasedto be interviewed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(f) One of members of the ATV crew offered and repeatedly assured the Deceased that his image would not appear in the programme duringthe broadcast and that the Deceased would not be harmed in any way (âthe Assuranceâ).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(g) The Assurance was made by the said member of the ATV crew for and on behalf of the Defendant and in the course of his employmentwith the Defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(h) In reliance upon and under the belief in the Assurance, the Deceased agreed to be interviewed by the ATV crew and commented thatTangâs claim was not believable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In paragraph 5 it was alleged that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFurther or alternatively, by giving the Assurance to the Deceased through its servant/agent, the Defendant owed a duty of careto the Defendant to take reasonable steps to keep his identity in confidence when broadcasting the interview of the deceased.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In contrast paragraph 9 of the statement of claim was as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe aforesaid attack perpetrated by Tang on the Deceased and the Plaintiff was caused by the breach of the agreement and/or negligenceof the Defendant through its servant and/or agent in failing to keep the Deceasedâs identity confidential during the broadcastof the interview of the Deceased, knowing that failing which the Deceased as well as the family would be exposed to risk of violence,hostility and physical harm from Tang.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) Wrongfully showing the face and broadcasting the comment made by the Deceased in the programme.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii) Revealing the name of the Deceased in the programme.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iii) Failing to cover, conceal, disguise the image and voice of the Deceased.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iv) Failing to heed the Deceasedâs warning that the broadcast of the programme without concealing his identity would jeopardizehis familyâs safety.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(v) Alternatively, failing to heed any risk of vengeance upon the Deceased, the Plaintiff and their family.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(vi) Failing to give any or any sufficient consideration to the safety of the Deceased, the Plaintiff and their family.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Shortly prior to the adjournment of the trial the plaintiff applied to amend the statement of claim by inserting under the particularsof negligence the following paragraph 9 (vii):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHaving regard to the condition of Tang as exhibited in the programme, the Defendant should have taken effective steps to avoidany harm or risk of harm to anyone appearing in the programme, in particular, Tang and the Deceased.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The defendant objected to this amendment because it was said that it raised a new cause of action.  It objected to it on 12 January. It was said that the amendment raised the new cause of action in negligence which had not been pleaded before and that in doingso the plaintiff was seeking to introduce a new cause of action beyond the limitation period.  The judge overruled that objection. He then went on to say that he could not see any prejudice or injustice to the defendant if the amendments were allowed which couldnot be compensated for in costs.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Despite the provision by the plaintiff of further and better particulars this application was then taken out before the judge bysummons dated 24 March 2006.  The judge then considered the matter fully and he said amongst other things:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â27. Therefore there can be no doubt that the plaintiff had pleaded and relied on negligence as well as breach of contract in hisoriginal claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">28. The act or omission complained of by the plaintiff was the failure of the defendant to cover up the identity of the deceased whenthe defendant aired the interview with the deceased commenting on Tangâs practice and claim of being able to cure cancer with treeroots on its programme âTo See Better Todayâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">29. That still remains to be the act or omission complained of by the plaintiff even with the proposed amendments.  Therefore nothinghas changed in so far as the act of negligence goes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">30. The effect of the proposed amendment merely serve to allow the plaintiff to say why, based on the contents of the interview ofTang by the defendant, the defendant ought to have the knowledge that if it failed to keep the deceased identity confidential duringthe broadcast of the interview with the deceased, the deceased and his family would be exposed to risk of violence, hostility andphysical harm from Tang, a matter which had already been pleaded in paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">31. I therefore do not accept the submission of the defendant that the effect of the proposed amendments is to add (or substitute)a new cause of action which had hitherto not been relied on by the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The judge then also considered the question as to whether there would be prejudice caused by the late amendment and having consideredthe matter he again said that there could be little or no prejudice to the defendant which could not be cured by consequential ordersallowing for further evidence from the defendant, both expert and factual, should that such be necessary.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  As regards the main point argued on the appeal, that this was a new cause of action, I consider that the judge was clearly right. The plea of negligence in paragraph 9 of the statement of claim was clearly broad.  When paragraph (v) of the particulars of negligenceis compared with paragraph (iv) it can be seen that the plaintiff was not confining herself simply to reliance on the warning whichthe deceased was said to have given; still less was she confining herself to reliance upon the Assurance.  The plea of negligenceand the particulars, especially at (v) and (vi) were broad and in the alternative to (iv).</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal Mr Lee SC applied for an order for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis.  Theapplication was made on the broad principle that it would be an âappropriateâ order to be made having regard to the fact thatthe defendant has raised the arguments on two occasions in the court below and has pursued an appeal at an interlocutory stage whilstthe action is in progress.  In the present circumstances I consider that on balance costs should be taxed on a party and party basis. In so saying, it should also be said that this court deprecates the bringing of appeals on matters which are essentially case managementmatters.  In this case the position is even worse because the appeal was proceeded with whilst the trial was in progress in circumstanceswhere it was unnecessary to do so.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Barma J:</b></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Anthony Rogers)<br />            <span>Vice-President</span></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"><span>(Aarif Barma)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</span></td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Martin Lee SC &amp; Mr YL Cheung, instructed by Messrs Ho, Tse, Wai &amp; Partners, for the Plaintiff/Respondent</p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Mohan Bharwaney, instructed by Messrs F.
