The Plaintiff served anotice of severance dated 14th November 2000 (registered at the Lands Registry on 16th November 2000) on the Defendant in respectof the Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiff claimed that he is the beneficial owner of a half share of the Flat. He alleged that the Defendant rented out the Flatwithout his knowledge and consent and excluded him from possession and use of the Flat in his right as joint tenant. The Plaintiffalso claims against the Defendant for damages for conversion of his furniture and personal belongings left at the Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In her defence, the Defendant claimed that she is the sole beneficial owner of the Flat which was purchased in the parties' jointnames without any intention of passing title to the Plaintiff. The Defendant denied conversion of the Plaintiff's possessions.</p>    <p class="heading">Witness statements</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> At the commencement of the trial, Mrs Dora Chan ("Mrs Chan"), counsel for the Plaintiff, referred to para 38/2A/13 of <em>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2002</em> Volume 1 at page 578 and applied to strike out paragraphs 2 to 20 of the Defendant's supplemental statement dated 18th September2002 as they were irrelevant to the issues of the case. She accepted that if the said paragraphs were struck out, the Plaintiff's2nd supplemental statement dated 10th October 2002 should be struck out as well. Mr Louie Chan ("Mr Chan"), counsel for the Defendant,took no issue on the legal principles but submitted that the subject paragraphs were relevant to the matter of credibility of witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Relevance of an issue or an averment of fact depends on its substance and content in light of the subject matter of the action, noton whether it is stated or denied in any witness statement. Having considered the contents of the said paragraphs, some of whichdeal with specific incidents relating to members of the Chan family dating from 1964 to 1982, I came to the view that they were notmaterial or relevant for the resolution of the subject matter of this case. Whatever marginal relevance they may possibly have onthe credibility of witnesses is not apparent and has not been demonstrated. I therefore ordered paragraphs 2 to 20 of the Defendant'ssupplemental statement and the whole of the Plaintiff's 2nd supplemental statement be struck out but making it clear that the partiesmay lead evidence or cross-examine on the relationship between members of the Chan family and the history of the family's accommodationin so far as they were relevant to the subject matter of the dispute.</p>    <p class="heading">Chan Wing Hong and Chan Mei Ha</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Whilst not disputing their relevance at this stage, Mrs Chan objected to the admissibility of the witness statements of Chan WingHong and Chan Mei Ha as they would not attend court to give evidence. Even though Mrs Chan accepted that the current evidential regimedoes not debar the admissibility of hearsay evidence merely because it is hearsay, she submitted that the Plaintiff would be unfairlyprejudiced by her inability to cross-examine them. Mr Chan submitted that there were health reasons for Chan Wing Hong, a Canadianresident, to remain in Canada and for his wife, Chan Mei Ha, to stay there to look after him.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Having considered the parties' submissions, I am satisfied that the hearsay nature of these witness statements does not debar theiradmissibility but their weight is a separate issue and needs to be considered in light of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 49</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap.8</a> and the totality of the evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Application for re-amendment of the Amended Statement of Claim</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Plaintiff applied by summons filed on 10th March 2003 to re-amend the Amended Statement of Claim by adding a prayer of relieffor an order for sale of the Flat and that the Plaintiff be entitled to half of the sale proceeds after deducting the necessary expensesincurred in the sale. Mrs Chan relied on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 2</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352" class="autolink_findacts">Partition Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/352">Cap.352</a>. However, before closing submissions were made, Mrs Chan applied for leave to withdraw the said summons, to which Mr Chanhad no objection. Mrs Chan also accepted that the Defendant was entitled to costs of the said summons in any event. I therefore grantedleave to the Plaintiff to withdraw the said summons and ordered that the costs of the said summons be paid by the Plaintiff to theDefendant (to be taxed if not agreed) and that half an hour of the trial hearing be apportioned for such costs to assist the taxingmaster.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> Mrs Chan orally applied to re-amend paragraph 10 and paragraphs (3) and (4) of the prayer of reliefs in the Amended Statement ofClaim to replace the date of "1st March 1996" referred therein by "1st April 1995". Mr Chan had no objection and I granted leaveto the Plaintiff to so re-amend and ordered that the Re-Amended Statement of Claim be filed and served within three days of the dateof the order.</p>    <p class="heading">Supplemental statement of Chan Wing Hong</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> On the third day of trial, after the Plaintiff (being the only witness for the Plaintiff) finished giving evidence, Mrs Chan appliedto strike out paragraphs 2 to 8, 10, 11 and 14 of the supplemental statement of Chan Wing Hong dated 18th September 2002 on the groundthat they are irrelevant to the issues of the present case. Mrs Chan admitted oversight in failing to so apply when she made a similarapplication regarding the Defendant's supplemental statement on the first day of trial. Mr Chan objected and reiterated that theparagraphs are relevant to the credibility of witnesses, but eventually he accepted and agreed for paragraphs 2 to 7 to be struckout. However, he submitted that if the court was minded to accede to the Plaintiff's application, then paragraphs 3, 4 and 12 andthe last 2 sentences of paragraph 5 of the Plaintiff's supplemental witness statement dated 18th July 2002 ought to be struck outas well.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Having considered the parties' submissions, the need to exclude immaterial or irrelevant matters and to fairly resolve matters attrial, and Mr Chan's agreement to strike out paragraphs 2 to 7 of the supplemental statement of Chan Wing Hong, and bearing in mindthat the Plaintiff has already given evidence, I ordered that only paragraphs 2 to 8 of the supplemental statement of Chan Wing Hongbe struck out. Mrs Chan applied to recall the Plaintiff to give evidence on the matters raised in the remaining paragraphs not struckout. Mr Chan objected. The Plaintiff has had ample opportunity (if so wished) to deal with these matters and I therefore rejectedMrs Chan's application.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> I also refused Mr Chan's application to strike out the various paragraphs of the Plaintiff's supplemental statement. The Plaintiffhas in his evidence adopted and confirmed the contents therein and no sufficient reason was shown for striking out the same.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> I again made clear to the parties that they were entitled to lead evidence or cross-examine (if they so wish) on the relationshipbetween members of the Chan family and the history of the family's accommodation in so far as they were relevant to the subject matterof this action. Indeed, it is apparent from the evidence of the Plaintiff and the Defendant (who were the only witnesses) that theseissues have been canvassed in viva voce evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Document bundles</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The parties have helpfully prepared a bundle of documents ("AB") which was agreed as to admissibility and authenticity. The Plaintiffhas submitted a Plaintiff's bundle of documents ("PB") which Mr Chan confirmed was also agreed as to admissibility and authenticity.</p>    <p class="heading">Background and relationship of the parties</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> This unfortunate litigation is a sad chapter for the Chan family, with the positions of the father and at least some of the childrenpolarised and intractable. I shall attempt to give some brief non-controversial background before coming to the heart of the dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The Plaintiff and his late wife have six children, one son and five daughters :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) Chan Wing Hong, the eldest and only son, born in 1955;</p>        <p>(b) the Defendant, the eldest daughter born in 1957; and</p>        <p>(c) Chan Yee Fun, Chan Yee Wah, Chan Yee Lai and Chan Yee Man, the other daughters.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The Plaintiff worked in the piece goods industry until his emigration to Canada in 1995. Throughout the years, he worked variouslyas a garment factory operator, a salesman and a wholesaler. The Defendant has been a teacher for 13 years before emigrating to Canadain 1995 where she studied for two years and has worked there since 1997. Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant are now Canadian citizens.The Defendant is presently living in Canada. The Plaintiff now lives at the Flat in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> There was considerable evidence in this trial as to the character of the Plaintiff and his relationship with his children. The Plaintiffasserted that he had no vice habits, that he supported his family financially as best as he could, and that he, since his wife passedaway in 1974, adjusted his working hours and work place to enable him to look after the children. The Defendant denied the aboveand painted a different picture of an uncaring father, who left his children's growing up to the care of the eldest son, an auntand their own resilience, but despite the same, the children remained and remain filial, having his interest at heart. She also gaveevidence that she had previously been subject to an incident of physical violence from the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> I do not intend to deal with this evidence in any detail or, indeed, at all. Suffice to say that there was an estrangement betweenthe Plaintiff and Defendant so that there were very few words left between them. The Plaintiff confirmed that since the 1980s, theyseldom talked. Indeed, the Defendant admitted in cross-examination that the Plaintiff had a temper and so did she, and they becamevery distant from each other in the 1980s.</p>    <p class="heading">Family housing history</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The Chan family leased a public housing unit in Block 3, Shek Yam Estate, Kwai Chung, New Territories (the "Old Flat") from the HongKong Housing Authority (the "HA") since the late 1960s. The Plaintiff's case was that he sometimes stayed at the Old Flat and sometimeshe stayed away because he had to work late or entertain. From 1974 to 1978, as his work place was close to the Old Flat, he wouldreturn home to sleep. Later, whilst working as a piece goods wholesaler, he had accommodation at his workplace. He gave money tothe Defendant to pay for the rent. The Defendant's evidence was that the family moved into the Old Flat in 1969 but the Plaintiffdid not do so until 1974 or 1975. All along he seldom returned home. Since 1982 she paid the rent and utilities expenses of the OldFlat.</p>    <p class="heading">First emigration to Canada</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The Plaintiff, Chan Yee Wah, Chan Yee Lai and Chan Yee Man emigrated to Canada in 1982 under Chan Wing Hong's sponsorship as he livedthere. The Plaintiff returned to Hong Kong after about a year. He did not like living in Canada as he could not travel around andhe had language problems. On the other hand, the Defendant said that the Plaintiff's return to Hong Kong was unexpected. He insistedon returning and, indeed, took monies set aside for the education fees of Chan Yee Lai to purchase an air ticket. Chan Yee Fun wentto Canada in 1984. After 1984, only the Plaintiff and the Defendant remained in Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading">The purchase of the Flat</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> It is common ground that in or about 1989 the HA under the Home Loan Purchase Scheme (the "HLPS") was offering interest-free loansto tenants and occupants of public housing units to encourage them to purchase private properties and move away from the public sector.There is no dispute that the Plaintiff did surrender the Old Flat to the HA and under the HLPS, an interest-free loan of HK$110,000.00(the "HA Loan") was applied for and granted.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The Defendant looked for a suitable property and eventually chose the Flat. The provisional agreement for sale and purchase dated26th October 1989 (AB19) was signed by the Defendant as purchaser at the purchase price of HK$813,000.00. The formal agreement forsale and purchase dated 8th November 1989 (AB20-32) was signed by the Plaintiff and the Defendant as purchaser. The Defendant paidthe deposits, and the HA Loan of HK$110,000.00 and a mortgage loan of HK$600,000.00 from Hang Seng Finance Limited were used to paythe balance of the purchase price. The assignment of the Flat dated 24th November 1989 (AB38-44) was in favour of the Plaintiff andthe Defendant as joint tenants.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> A crucial issue in this action is what was the understanding between the parties as to the purchase of the Flat. The Plaintiff'scase was that in 1989 he was about 67 years old working as a salesman of piece goods with no pension or savings. He intended to continuewith cheap and affordable public housing. If he continued to live at the Old Flat, he would (and it was not disputed by the Defendant)be relocated to another albeit smaller public housing flat upon the eventual redevelopment of Shek Yam Estate. The Defendant toldhim she wished to purchase a private flat but she did not have enough money. Although he did not know her income or financial status,he believed that she needed the HA Loan. At first he refused to give up the Old Flat. However, the Defendant repeatedly pressed himto surrender the Old Flat for the interest-free HA Loan and eventually persuaded him by promising that she would pay for the purchaseprice, including the mortgage repayments, and other expenses and outgoings, and that he would be a beneficial owner of a half shareof the new flat. The Defendant brought him to see the Flat after paying the initial deposit and he let her make the decision.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The Defendant' gave various reasons for moving out of the Old Flat. First, as only the Plaintiff and the Defendant lived at the OldFlat which was for a family of eight, the HA's policy would require them to surrender the Old Flat for a smaller one. She did notwant to pay double rent for the Old Flat as a result of her income exceeding the "rich family" threshold once she started working.Secondly, Shek Yam Estate was due for redevelopment. Although no notification was yet received for Block 3, residents of Block 5had moved away by 1989.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The Defendant had always wanted to purchase a private property for better privacy and better living environment, and it was a goodinvestment. She had a stable job with a steady income, HK$180,000.00 to HK$200,000.00 savings to cover the deposit, decoration expensesand solicitor's costs, and an expectation of a 90% mortgage on the new flat, so there was no difficulty for her to purchase the Flat.The Defendant said that although she could purchase the Flat even without the HA Loan, she was encouraged by the HLPS and wantedto apply for an interest-free loan.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The Defendant said that as the Plaintiff was getting old, she wanted him to move into the new flat with her and return home moreoften, so that she could look after him. She wanted to have a better relationship with the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> With the 1997 political uncertainty, the Defendant could have the option to sell the Flat in 1994 to 1995 although she had no intentionto sell at the time of purchase. Further, in the Defendant's witness statement dated 15th May 2002 (which was adopted by her in thecourse of her evidence), it was further stated that, if she remained single, the purchase could be a hedge against inflation; ifshe married in future, she need not be dependent on her spouse.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The Defendant said that in early 1989 when she first invited the Plaintiff to live with her after she purchased the new flat, thePlaintiff ignored her. She later asked for his assistance in applying for the interest-free loan under the HLPS. As the Plaintiffsigned the application form, he must have consented to leave public housing.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The Defendant said that after she signed the provisional agreement for sale and purchase, she brought the Plaintiff to view the Flat.If he did not like it, she would not go ahead with the purchase and would let the initial deposit (said to be about a few thousanddollars) be forfeited. As it turned out, he liked the Flat. When she invited the Plaintiff to live with her at the Flat, the Plaintiffsaid he would only do so if his name were added as owner. It did not seem important at that time and as she wanted the Plaintiffto live with her, she agreed to the proposal. She had no objection to the Plaintiff having the Flat if she predeceased him. She wouldpay the purchase price, including the mortgage repayments, of the Flat. The Defendant then informed the solicitors that the purchaserswould be the Plaintiff and herself to be held under a "longer life tenancy". She denied that the Plaintiff was to be given a beneficialshare in the Flat.</p>    <p class="heading">Moving into the Flat</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The parties moved into the Flat in late 1989, but the Defendant said that the Plaintiff continued his practice of rarely returninghome. There is no dispute that the Defendant paid the mortgage loan instalments from 1989 to 1998 as well as the outgoings in respectof the Flat, such as management fees, government rent and rates. The Defendant said that at that time she had no financial difficulties,but she could no longer save money.</p>    <p class="heading">Sale of the Flat?</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> It is the Plaintiff's case that in or about 1994, without his consent or any forewarning, several people came to view the Flat. Hetold the viewers that the Flat was not for sale. After this incident, the relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant worsened.The Defendant's case was that she wanted to sell the Flat because upon her imminent emigration (more of this later), she would haveno job and would be unable to afford the mortgage repayments of the Flat. She placed the Flat with estate agents for sale or lettingbut was not aware that the Plaintiff sent away viewers of the Flat. The Plaintiff withheld his consent for any sale and the Defendantacceded to his wishes.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Prior to her emigration, the Defendant withdrew her provident fund benefits for anticipated payment of the mortgage repayments andmiscellaneous expenses of the Flat. The Defendant said that she could not allow the Flat to remain vacant as she needed the rentalincome from the Flat to support the mortgage repayments. Without the rental income, the provident fund she had set aside for themortgage repayments would only last till 1997.</p>    <p class="heading">Second emigration to Canada</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> There is no dispute that the Plaintiff and the Defendant emigrated to Canada in early 1995. However, there was conflicting evidenceas to how the emigration came about. The Plaintiff's case was that he renewed his emigration to enable the Defendant (who did notsatisfy the emigration requirements on her own) to emigrate to Canada and he himself did not wish to stay and live there. The Defendant,on the other hand, said that her application for emigration under Chan Yee Lai's sponsorship would have been processed much morequickly had it not been necessary for the Plaintiff to explain away his failure to reside in Canada in 1982 to acquire citizenship.His convenient excuse was that he had to return to Hong Kong to look after the Defendant then.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> It is also common ground between the parties that the Plaintiff's children promised that each of them (except the Defendant who hadno job upon emigration) would give him CAD200.00 per month, totalling CAD1,000.00, as his living expenses. In fact, the Defendantsaid the Plaintiff insisted on setting this as a term for his emigration. His children (except the Defendant) complied with thispromise after the Plaintiff emigrated in 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The immigration application was eventually approved and the parties landed as migrants in Canada on 19th July 1994. The Plaintiffreturned to Hong Kong in about 10 days and the Defendant returned by the end of August. There is conflicting evidence as to whenthey left Hong Kong. The Plaintiff's case was that they left for Canada together in or about January 1995. He intended to returnto Hong Kong in about a year as the Canadian authorities required him to stay at least a year initially. The Defendant's evidencewas that the Plaintiff left in January 1995 but she left in mid-February 1995. Nothing material turns on the proper date(s) of departurefrom Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading">The leasing of the Flat</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The Plaintiff gave evidence that he heard from his children's friend(s) that a month after they landed in Canada, the Defendant returnedto Hong Kong to rent out the Flat. As the Defendant did not tell him about the letting, he neither asked nor objected. He only hadconfirmation when he came back to Hong Kong in March 1996. The Defendant denied she returned to Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The Defendant gave evidence that she studied between 1995 and 1997 relying on a loan from the Canadian authorities. Without any incomebut being still obliged to make mortgage repayments for the Flat, she had to let out the Flat and she did. It is not disputed thatthe Defendant rented out the Flat from 1st April 1995 at the monthly rent of HK$7,000.00 for a term of two years till the end ofMarch 1996. The tenant only stayed for 10 months. The Plaintiff was well aware that she had no permanent job and could not affordto make the said payments, and that the Flat had been let.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's return to Hong Kong in 1996</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The Plaintiff returned to Hong Kong in or about March 1996 and discovered that the Flat was locked and let without his consent. Hestayed at the home of Chan Yee Lai and her husband Wang Tin Yu. He asked Chan Yee Lai for the keys to the Flat and to evict the tenantbut Chan Yee Lai said the Flat was already leased. He left Hong Kong on 11th August 1996 as he could not remain outside Canada beyond6 months due to immigration requirements.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The Defendant said that the Plaintiff could choose to stay in Hong Kong (either with Chan Yee Lai or Chan Yee Man) or Canada. Indeed,whilst he was in Hong Kong from March to August 1996, when Chan Yee Lai and her family had to return to Canada, she arranged to rentan apartment in the Homantin District for the Plaintiff to stay. This was denied by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">1996 in Canada</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The Plaintiff said that whilst at Chan Yee Fun's house in Canada, he was pressed by Chan Wing Hong (in the presence of the Defendant)to sign some form of authorisation believed to be for the sale of the Flat. The Defendant did not mention any financial difficulties.He refused because they said he had no share in the Flat and did not say how the sale proceeds would be dealt with.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> It is not disputed that after the first tenant left, the Defendant leased out the Flat again through an estate agent but that tenantfailed to pay any rent. She said that in or about August 1996, Chan Wing Hong came to Hong Kong to evict the tenant and returnedto Canada in September 1996. The Plaintiff, Chan Wing Hong and the Defendant met up in October and the Defendant informed the Plaintiffof the eviction of the tenant. She told him that as her provident fund would only last till 1997, she had to sell the Flat due toher financial difficulties. The Plaintiff said "Even if you die, it is your business only, not mine." As he refused to sell the Flat,she decided to let out the Flat as a temporary measure.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's return to Hong Kong in 1997</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The Plaintiff said that when he returned to Hong Kong in March 1997, he was only able to stay with Chan Yee Lai for a short whilesince her mother-in-law was visiting. He approached solicitors during this visit. The solicitors checked that the Flat had not beensold and advised him that his consent would be required for any sale. He then instructed his solicitors to send a letter to the Defendant.By letter dated 17th March 1997 to the Defendant (AB197-198), the Plaintiff's solicitors stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Flat was held by the parties as joint tenants and that should they decide to sell, the Defendant would have to pay to thePlaintiff half of the costs of the original purchase and decoration of the Flat, half of the rental income received and half of thenet sale proceeds whilst the Plaintiff would have to pay the Defendant half of the mortgage repayments made.</p>    <p class="heading">1998 in Canada</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> It is common ground that the Plaintiff was persuaded by Chan Yee Lai and Wang Tin Yu to sign an authorisation (the "Authorisation"- PB34-35) to facilitate the redemption of the mortgage of the Flat as the mortgage interest was too high although the Defendantdenied that she was present. The Plaintiff said that after signing, he consulted his own solicitors on the Authorisation and theyadvised against it. Later Chan Yee Lai called him and told him off, so he sent the original Authorisation back to her and Wang TinYu in Hong Kong by express delivery.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The Defendant said that at that time her income was just enough for her living expenses and she had to repay her study loan. Shehad no residence of her own. Due to her financial difficulties (as her provident fund was almost depleted) and as the Plaintiff refusedto sell the Flat, she had no alternative but to borrow monies from Chan Yee Wah, Chan Yee Lai and Chan Wing Hong to redeem the mortgageloans of the Flat in September 1998. She has since repaid Chan Wing Hong with interest but she has to repay her sisters too.</p>    <p class="heading">1999 to 2001</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> The Plaintiff acquired Canadian citizenship on 31st March 1999 and returned to Hong Kong on 2nd April 1999. He said that when ChanYee Lai discovered that he wanted to pursue his rights in relation to the Flat, she refused to put him up. As he had no place tolive, he went to Mainland China for a while. A friend took pity on him and allowed to stay at a warehouse in Tai Nam Street, Shamshuipo.He left Hong Kong on 30th May 1999 to deal with his documentation in Canada and returned to Hong Kong on 14th February 2000. Thenhe left for Canada on 7th February 2001 and returned on 23rd February 2001 after uplifting his monies from his Canadian bank account.He has remained in Hong Kong since. He stayed at the Tai Nam Street warehouse until he returned to the Flat in August 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> A notice of severance dated 14th November 2000 (PB37-38) in respect of the Flat was served on the Defendant (sent to Chan Wing Hong'saddress) some time in February 2001 under cover of a letter from the Plaintiff's solicitors dated 13th January 2001 (AB206). TheDefendant said that she took no action then as things were happening, including Chan Wing Hong suffering a stroke on 1st March 2001.However, she did send e-mail messages to the court when she was informed by her sister of newspaper reporting of the present proceedingstaken out by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The Defendant also said that whilst the Plaintiff was in Canada, he informed Chan Mei Ha that he only made a claim for a half shareof the Flat after the mortgage loans had been paid off and that it was foolish for the Defendant's siblings to help the Defendantpay off the mortgage loans.</p>    <p class="heading">Eviction of the tenant by the Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The documents reveal a tenancy agreement dated 23rd June 1999 (AB95-98) in respect of the Flat between Lee Li Na as tenant and ChanYee Lai on behalf of the Plaintiff and the Defendant as landlord for a term of 2 years from 1st July 1999 to 30th June 2001 at amonthly rent of HK$7,200.00. The monthly rent was reduced to HK$6,500.00 from 1st October 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> In March 2001, the Plaintiff commenced legal action to recover possession of the Flat and obtained a court order to that effect inApril 2001 (AB166-168). The tenant returned the keys to the Defendant in June 2001 (see paragraph 36 of the Defendant's witness statementdated 15th May 2002). The Defendant asked Chan Yee Man to offer the Plaintiff the keys, which he refused to accept, saying that itmust be done through solicitors. The Defendant, through a letter from her solicitors dated 3rd August 2001 (AB212-213), offered tolet the Plaintiff have the keys to the Flat on the basis that he would not change the locks or deal with the Flat without the Defendant'sconsent, that he would confirm that vacant possession was delivered up by the tenant in May 2001 and that the Defendant waived claimsagainst the Plaintiff for loss upon the Plaintiff entering the Flat with keys. The Plaintiff's solicitors advised him not to acceptthe conditions. Physical possession was recovered in August 2001 through the bailiff and he has been living there since.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's financial support</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Chan Yee Lai and Chan Yee Man contribute to the Plaintiff's present living expenses. The Defendant pays the management fees, ratesand government rent of the Flat. The Plaintiff also receives a monthly sum of HK$705.00 being the government's "fruit money". Bya letter dated 4th September 2001 from his solicitors to the Defendant's solicitors (AB216), the Plaintiff stated that he intendedto lease one room of the Flat and render half of the net profits (that is, less the necessary expenses) to the Defendant. By a replyletter dated 20th September 2001 (AB220), the Defendant's solicitors informed the Plaintiff's solicitors that the Defendant's rejectedthe proposal.</p>    <p class="heading">The Plaintiff's furniture and personal belongings</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The Plaintiff said that in 1989 the Defendant helped him move his furniture from the Old Flat to the Flat. He could not give a fulllist except to say that such furniture has been particularised in paragraph 15(1) of the Amended Statement of Claim. However, hedid refer in his evidence to such items as lights, air-conditioner, refrigerator, burner stove, oval dining table and chairs, a biground table top, colour television set, washing machine, fan, radio, kitchenware and crockery. When it was pointed out to him undercross-examination that the developer gave four air-conditioners for the Flat (as evidenced in the provisional and formal agreementsfor sale and purchase - AB19 and AB20-32) and that the burner stove could not be used at the Flat which used town gas, he said thatthe Defendant arranged the removal of the furniture to the Flat and if she had thrown any item away, it was without his approval.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The Defendant said that only four items, namely, a pendant light, a teak ornamental cabinet, an oval dining table with four chairsand two beds, were moved to the Flat in 1989. She denied that the air-conditioner was brought to the Flat. Her sister bought thecolour television set and she purchased the refrigerator. The burner stove was left at the Old Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The Plaintiff went further to say that when he left for Canada, he left his furniture and personal belongings at the Flat, includinghis address books, diaries, clothes, shoes and accounting ledgers of his previous business. He only brought with him one suitcaseto Canada and the Defendant brought two suitcases. He denied any knowledge of packing up for emigration.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> When he was shown the copy photographs taken at the basement of Chan Wing Hong's house (AB2-3), he denied that the items depictedtherein were his. However, in his supplemental witness statement dated 18th July 2002, he said that he could recognise the objectsin the photographs were part of his belongings. Further, he said that when he returned to Hong Kong in March 1996, Chan Yee Lai toldhim she had thrown away his furniture. He had no money to replace his possessions.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> On the other hand, the Defendant said that those household goods which could be used in Canada were packed up and shipped by containerand the remaining ones were either given away or not removed being fixtures. There was some discrepancy in her evidence as to whetherthe packing was done during Christmas or in October 1994. In any event, she said that the Plaintiff should be aware of and consentedto the packing done at the Flat. Further, the Plaintiff had his own cabinet for putting his personal belongings and the Plaintiffhandled them himself. On arrival in Canada, the items were kept at the basement of Chan Wing Hong's house. The Plaintiff should knowof this because he lived at Chan Wing Hong's home for some time. Up till now, the items are still there because the Defendant didnot have a place of her own yet.</p>    <p class="heading">Credibility of witnesses</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Two witnesses testified : the Plaintiff and the Defendant. I find the Plaintiff to be a truthful and reliable witness. Although therewere minor inaccuracies in his testimony, he was not shaken in cross-examination and he was adamant in the truth of his version.I consider that the minor inaccuracies, particularly on dates and time, were the result of his old age and the lapse of time betweenthe relevant incidents and the trial. The only matters over which I have some reservations as to whether the Plaintiff's evidenceought to be wholly accepted were whether he was as caring and helpful to his family as he portrayed and whether the disposal of hispossessions were as he testified. However, these aspects did not adversely affect my finding that he was otherwise an honest andreliable witness in respect of other material parts of his evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> I do not find the Defendant to be a truthful or reliable witness. I do not propose to set out all the reasons for such finding butthe main reasons were :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) I do not accept the Defendant's explanation that the Flat was purchased in the joint names of the Plaintiff and the Defendantbecause she wanted the Plaintiff to live with her and to return home more often. Since 1984 the Defendant lived with the Plaintiffand was unable throughout the years to alter his habit of rarely returning home. No apparent reason was given as to why the Plaintiffwould be more likely to change his habit with the purchase of the Flat. In fact, after moving into the Flat, the Plaintiff stillcontinued with his habit of not returning home some of the time. The Defendant's reason of wishing the Plaintiff to live with herand for him to return home more often is implausible.</p>        <p>Whatever reasons she might have in purchasing the Flat, the Defendant was keen to have the financial subsidy of the interest-freeHA Loan and I find that it was for such advantage that she persuaded the Plaintiff to give up the Old Flat. It is difficult to understandfrom the evidence that the Plaintiff would agree to surrender public housing protection for no apparent personal benefit except forthe already available opportunity to live with the Defendant. I rather consider it more likely that he would surrender the Old Flatand give up eligibility for public housing only if he would be given a half share beneficial interest in the Flat and the Defendantpaid all the associated costs of the purchase, expenses and outgoings.</p>        <p>Leaving aside any benefit, the Plaintiff in fact suffered detriment as both he and the Defendant as the approved purchaser of theFlat entered into a mortgage dated 24th November 1989 (PB2-31) with Hang Seng Finance Limited (covering both the HA Loan and theloan from Hang Seng Finance Limited) which provided, <em>inter alia</em>, that the obligation of the Plaintiff and the Defendant to repay the loans was joint and several.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>The Defendant's suggestion of a "longer life tenancy" if she predeceased the Plaintiff is even more implausible. I find that he becamea joint owner of the Flat because he was to have a half share of the beneficial interest in it.</p>        <p>Mr Chan submitted that the Plaintiff's version is inconsistent with his solicitors' letter to the Defendant dated 17th March 1997(AB 197-198) and the Statement of Claim. I do not find the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim inconsistent with the Plaintiff's caseand, in any event, Mr Chan confirmed that he was not taking a pleading point. As regards the letter of 17th March 1997, what camethrough from the letter is a clear insistence on the joint tenancy. Whilst it could have been more precise, it must be rememberedthe Plaintiff was an old man and it was his first approach to solicitors in relation to this matter. The letter was sent a few daysafter his arrival in Hong Kong on 10th March 1997 and the tenor of the letter was much more a description of the legal position ofjoint tenants rather than a detailed statement by the Plaintiff of the factual background. I do not hold his solicitors' letter againstthe Plaintiff.</p>        <p>Mr Chan also suggested that there was no or only past consideration for the oral agreement between the parties allegedly made in autumn1989 as the application for the HA Loan was made in June. I do not hold the confusion of dates and time against the Plaintiff givenhis old age and the fact that this incident happened more than 10 years ago. The Plaintiff was adamant, however, over the event andhe was not shaken on this.</p>        <p>Mr Chan also submitted that, alternatively, had the agreement been reached before the signing of the application form for the HA Loan,the Plaintiff would also have signed the application form (as applicant) and the provisional agreement for sale and purchase (aspurchaser). I am of the view that this does not necessarily follow. There is no dispute that the Defendant financed the purchaseand selected the Flat, and that in the formal agreement for sale and purchase, the assignment, the loan agreement with the HA andthe mortgage, both parties were named as the purchaser of the Flat.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>Mr Chan further submitted that had there been an oral agreement, the Defendant paying for the purchase of the Flat would for her ownprotection have discussed other scenarios, eg the possibility of the deal falling through with the deposit returned. Mr Chan acceptedthat it is not necessary for all scenarios to be contemplated before an agreement can be upheld. I find that the lack of such discussionis plausible as neither party at that stage contemplated any difficulty or any termination of the purchase or ownership of the Flat.</p>        <p>In view of the above, on the balance of probabilities, I accept the Plaintiff's version that he surrendered the Old Flat on the Defendant'spromise that he would have a half share beneficial interest in the Flat and that she would pay the purchase price, and all expensesand outgoings of the Flat;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) I do not accept the Defendant's assertion that the Plaintiff consented to or acquiesced in the leasing of the Flat.</p>        <p>The Defendant's case was that the Plaintiff, who must have known of the letting of the Flat from discussions at family gatherings,had not raised any objection. The Plaintiff denied this and, on the balance of probabilities, I find the Plaintiff's version morebelievable. Given the Plaintiff's known uncooperative attitude and known opposition to a sale of the Flat in 1994, and given theDefendant's keen interest to sell or lease the Flat to solve her financial problems, I find it more likely than not that the Defendantwent ahead with the leasing of the Flat on her own without consultation with or consent of the Plaintiff.</p>        <p>I do not hold against the Plaintiff that he heard rumours of a letting of the Flat. There was no or no sufficient conduct on his partto suggest acquiescence. After all, it must be remembered (and the Defendant knew) that at that time the Plaintiff was an old mandependent on his children for his accommodation and his living expenses in Canada far away from Hong Kong, clearly unable to dealwith his interests in the Flat and, more importantly, mistrustful and not on fair talking terms with the Defendant. There is no challengeto the Plaintiff's evidence that when he next returned to Hong Kong in March 1996, he promptly verified that the Flat was let andraised objection with Chan Yee Lai who was in Hong Kong.</p>        <p>Mr Chan submitted that the Plaintiff wrongfully refused to sell the Flat when the Defendant was burdened with the mortgage repaymentsand had no income to support the same. Whilst I accept that the Plaintiff's attitude might not help the Defendant, I cannot see anybasis for saying that his refusal in exercise of his right as joint owner is wrongful.</p>        <p>Mr Chan further submitted that as the parties emigrated to Canada, it would be reasonable to rent out the Flat and that should thePlaintiff return to Hong Kong, it would be sufficient if his children provided him with alternative accommodation. I agree with MrsChan that filial piety, although most commendable, cannot be substituted for the Plaintiff's exercise of his rights as joint ownervis-Ã -vis the Flat.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>In view of the above, on the balance of probabilities, I accept the Plaintiff's version;</p>        <p>(c) As stated above, I have reservations over the Plaintiff's attitude towards his family. However, I am prepared to accept that hisperception of his relationship with his family may well be his own subjective feeling. I find that the Plaintiff had always beenmistrustful of the Defendant, and he has been careful in dealings with her. An example is that he insisted on seeking the adviceof his solicitors on the Authorisation. It is also not disputed that the Plaintiff often set "terms" before agreeing to proposalsfrom the children. An example of this is his extraction of the promise that his children should contribute to his living expensesbefore he agreed to his second emigration to Canada. With a person of such cautious and mistrustful character, and given the poorrelationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, it is inherently improbable that he would have agreed or allowed the Flat tobe leased without setting his own terms or that he would have acquiesced to the same as suggested by the Defendant.</p>        <p>Given that the Plaintiff had objected to the letting of the Flat to Chan Yee Lai in March 1996 and given his solicitors' letter dated17th March 1997 to the Defendant, I do not find it believable that he would have authorised Chan Yee Lai to enter into the tenancyagreement with Lee Li Na dated 23rd June 1999 (AB95-98) on his behalf (as well as on behalf of the Defendant) as landlord as apparentfrom the face of the tenancy agreement. I find that it was the Defendant who arranged this without the Plaintiff's consent.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Chan Wing Hong and Chan Mei Ha gave witness statements and Chan Yee Lai wrote a letter dated 16th September 2002 to the Defendant'ssolicitors (AB192-193). None of them attended court to give evidence. I cannot place any weight on their statements. I have consideredthe factors set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8/s49.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 49</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/8">Cap.8</a>. In a family dispute where, regrettably, lines are drawn and strong sentiments are engaged, caution must be exercised beforerelying on any statements from family members without their credibility tested by cross-examination.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> On the disposal of the Plaintiff's furniture and personal belongings, I have already indicated my reservations on his evidence. AlthoughI do not find him untruthful or dishonest, he was forgetful and confused on this. For example, it was not clear from the Plaintiff'sevidence whether he was referring to his possessions at the Old Flat or those when he moved into the Flat or those when he left forCanada. That is not unexpected given his age, the lapse of time and the details required on this subject matter. Indeed, Mrs Chanstated in her written closing submissions that "P's claim on quantum of loss was wrongly based on what he had at Sham Yam [Shek Yam].It is clear that P's concept on this was erroneous but not deliberate." But I remind myself that the Plaintiff has the burden topersuade me that the Defendant converted his furniture and personal belongings. I find that he has not discharged such burden.</p>    <p class="heading">Findings of fact</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Based on the testimony which I accepted and the documents referred to in the trial, I came to the view that the material facts ofthis case were :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) The Flat was purchased by the Plaintiff and Defendant in their names under a joint tenancy. The Plaintiff surrendered the OldFlat and his eligibility for public housing for the HA Loan (which would be applied as part of the purchase price of the Flat) inreturn for a half share beneficial interest in the Flat and for the Defendant's agreement to pay all the purchase price (includingmortgage repayments), expenses and outgoings.</p>        <p>(b) Pursuant thereto, the Defendant paid the mortgage repayments, government rent, rates and outgoings in respect of the Flat.</p>        <p>(c) The Plaintiff refused to sell the Flat. From the time shortly before emigration to Canada in early 1995 and thereafter, the Defendantwas anxious to sell the Flat or at least rent it out to enable her to meet the mortgage repayments. She knew that she would haveno income in the near future and her provident fund benefits would be depleted by 1997.</p>        <p>(d) The Plaintiff did not agree to or acquiesce in the leasing of the Flat. The leasing of the Flat in April 1995 was arranged bythe Defendant without prior notification to or consent of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff objected to the leasing of the Flat in March1996 when he returned to Hong Kong. The subsequent leasing of the Flat in 1996 and 1999 to other tenants by the Defendant were alsowithout the consent or acquiescence of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff was prevented by the Defendant from entering or using the Flatsince 1st April 1995 (whether the Flat was let or pending letting or left vacant) until June 2001 when the Defendant offered to givethe keys of the Flat to the Plaintiff through Chan Yee Man.</p>        <p>(e) In 1997, the Plaintiff signed the Authorisation and the Defendant redeemed the mortgage of the Flat in 1998 with the help of loansfrom her siblings.</p>        <p>(f) The joint ownership of the Flat by the parties was severed by a notice of severance dated 14th November 2000 which was servedon the Defendant some time in February 2001.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(g) The Defendant did not convert the Plaintiff's furniture or personal belongings as alleged.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Plaintiff's claim for rent and mesne profits</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Mrs Chan submitted that the Plaintiff is entitled to claim half share of the profits (that is, rent) and compensation (for the periodwhen the Flat was not let or rent was not paid) less renovation expenses incurred by the Defendant (which are agreed between theparties as HK$49,331.00) for the period from 1st April 1995 to 1st August 2001. Mr Chan submitted that if I find the Plaintiff abeneficial owner of the Flat together with the Plaintiff (which I did), the Plaintiff shall be entitled to his proportionate shareof the actual rental receipts less renovation expenses incurred by the Plaintiff, the mortgage repayments and outgoings (that is,management fees, rates and government rent) of the Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> The issues are whether (i) the Plaintiff as joint owner is entitled to any compensation for use and occupation of the Flat, (ii)the Plaintiff is entitled to compensation over and above the actual rental receipts, and (ii) deductions ought to be made for themortgage repayments and outgoings.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> The following passage from <em>Snell's Equity</em> 30th ed para 44-09 at pp.707-8, although not referred to by either Mrs Chan or Mr Chan, was cited with approval by Woo J in <strong>Tang Yin Ling v Wong Sai</strong> HCMP2527/1992 (unreported), 22nd July 1994 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where land is held by several co-tenants they are all, as between themselves, entitled to possession of the whole.

Conversely, if the occupier has expended money in improvements or repairs, the court will inquireinto the amount of the increased value as a result of such expenditure and give him credit for it. The increased value is a chargeon the land to be paid out of the proceeds before division, but liability for an occupation rent is personal to the occupying co-ownerand is not chargeable on the purchaser or mortgagee of his share."

"Thenature of the payment is that of some sort of compensation to be paid by a trustee, for they are trustees for each other ..., toa beneficiary (for they are both beneficiaries) for an exclusive enjoyment of the trust property attributable to such an action,namely, that of ouster, on the part of the paying party as is inconsistent with the discharge in due order of the trust."

There is no dispute that the Flat was let by the Defendant since 1st April1995 and the Plaintiff <em>could not</em> <em>have</em> enjoyed the right to occupy. Even when the Flat was not let, the Plaintiff had no access to the Flat and, even on the Defendant'scase, he was only offered alternative accommodation whilst he was in Hong Kong. I therefore find that the Defendant excluded thePlaintiff from use and occupation of the Flat irrespective of whether the Flat was let or not. As the parties were joint owners havingunity of possession, I find that such exclusion was unjustified and compensation must be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.However, the Defendant's evidence (which is not disputed) was that she had through Chan Yee Man made an offer of keys to the Plaintiffin June 2001. I therefore find that after June 2001, the Plaintiff has not been ousted from possession of the Flat.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> The only evidence of help to assess the compensation is the amount of rent payable by the various tenants of the Flat. The tenancyagreement dated 31st March 1995 (AB77-79) was a one-year tenancy from 1st April 1995 to end of March 1996 at the monthly rent ofHK$7,000.00 but the tenant only stayed for 10 months. The second tenancy agreement dated 9th May 1996 (AB83) provided for two-yearterm at the monthly rent of HK$7,000.00 but no rent had been paid. The third tenancy agreement dated 23rd June 1999 (AB95-98) alsoprovided for a two-year term from 1st July 1999 to 30th June 2001 at a monthly rent of HK$7,200.00, which was reduced to HK$6,500.00from 1st October 2000. The third tenant ceased paying rent after March 2001.

This goes againstnot only the joint tenancy arrangement between the parties where the Plaintiff would have his half share beneficial interest (withall rights flowing therefrom) but also the Defendant's promise to pay the mortgage repayments. The Defendant in her evidence acceptedher responsibility for the mortgage repayments and outgoings and, indeed, she paid all the mortgage repayments and outgoings. I donot find it appropriate to deduct from the compensation the mortgage repayments and outgoings.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Plaintiff's claim for damages for conversion</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> I have found that the Plaintiff has not proved on the balance of probabilities that the Defendant has converted the Plaintiff's furnitureand personal belongings. Even if I am wrong, I am not satisfied that the Plaintiff is entitled to substantial damages, namely, thevalue of the goods and chattels converted.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> The burden is on the Plaintiff as claimant to adduce evidence in support of his claim for damages, including the value of the goodsand chattels at the time of conversion (see <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> 18th ed para 14-100 at p.72). The Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence on the value of the various items of furniture and personalbelongings. Mrs Chan agreed that these items were the Plaintiff's own belongings and he could have, had he wished, given evidenceon the same. The conversion, if any, occurred in 1995, the action was commenced in 2001 and the particulars of damages claimed werefurnished as early as May 2001. Even if the Plaintiff proved conversion, he was not entitled to anything more than nominal damages.The Plaintiff did not ask for an assessment at a future date and had that request been made, it would be refused as the court shouldnot allow the Plaintiff a second chance to perfect his case to the prejudice of the Defendant (see <strong>Born Chief Company trading as Beijing Restaurant v Tsai, George and Tsai, Mary</strong> CACV229/1995 (unreported), 10th April 1996). Since there is not an iota of evidence on the value of the said furniture and personalbelongings, I need not consider Mrs Chan's submission that where the wrongdoer refused to produce the converted goods, it was tobe presumed against him to be of the greatest value that goods of that type could be.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Plaintiff's claim for legal costs</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> The Plaintiff claims for legal costs in respect of proceedings for the eviction of the last tenant of the Flat by the Plaintiff in2001. Mr Chan submitted that as the tenancy is a lawful tenancy created by the Defendant, the Plaintiff had no right to evict thetenant. I have found that the Defendant did not have the Plaintiff's authority to enter into or arrange this tenancy. However, noevidence was adduced by the Plaintiff on the quantum of legal costs incurred. There is no direction for split trial on liabilityand quantum. It was the Plaintiff's burden to adduce evidence to prove such damages and I therefore find that the Plaintiff has failedto discharge this burden. Mrs Chan submitted but without supporting evidence that legal costs must have been incurred and that thesame has not been taxed.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Under this head of claim, I am only prepared to award nominal damages of HK$1.00. I find that the Plaintiff had been unreasonablein refusing to take the keys offered by the Defendant through Chan Yee Man and later through the Defendant's solicitors in August2001. To explain such refusal on the ground that he was concerned for his personal safety is without merit. Legal costs (if any)incurred after such offers should not lie at the Defendant's door.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Defendant's claim for declaration of sole ownership of the Flat</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> Mr Chan submitted that as the Defendant paid the entire the purchase price of the Flat with no contribution from the Plaintiff, thePlaintiff held his half share in trust for the Defendant. He cited <strong>Yuen Tam-wan v Ho Chan Yuet-lan and anor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20HKLR%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] HKLR 280</a> and <strong>Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset and anor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20All%20ER%201111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 All ER 1111</a> in support.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> Both Mr Chan and Mrs Chan are in agreement as to the legal principles. In <strong>Yuen Tam-wan</strong>'s case, Litton V-P said at pp.285-6 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" In the absence of relevant findings of facts by the trial judge, and the application of the law to such findings, we in this courtare driven to approaching this case from first principles. In cases of this kind there are broadly speaking two categories of cases: (1) Those cases, perhaps rare, where there was some agreement, arrangement, understanding between the spouses that the proprietaryinterest in property should be shared in a particular way; and (2) those cases, perhaps more common, where there is no evidence tosupport a finding of an agreement or arrangement, and the court is driven to infer the common intention from conduct. See <em>Lord Bridge in Lloyds Bank Plc v. Rosset</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 AC 107</a> at 132E to 133F ......"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In <strong>Yuen Tam-wan</strong>'s case, there was no finding of fact as to any agreement or arrangement between the parties and the court had to infer the commonintention of the parties from their conduct, namely, a part of the purchase price was provided by appellant's mother and the mortgagerepayments were discharged by the appellant. It was on this basis that the court came to the conclusion that the 2nd respondent heldhis half share in trust for the appellant from the time of acquisition.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> In <strong>Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset and anor</strong>, Lord Bridge said at pp.1118-1119 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" The first and fundamental question which must always be resolved is whether, independently of any inference to be drawn from theconduct of the parties in the course of sharing the house as their home and managing their joint affairs, there has at any time priorto the acquisition, or exceptionally at some later date, been any agreement, arrangement or understanding reached between them thatthe property is to be shared beneficially. The finding of an agreement or arrangement to share in this sense can only, I think, bebased on evidence of express discussions between the partners, however imperfectly remembered and however imprecise their terms mayhave been. Once a finding to this effect is made it will only be necessary for the partner asserting a claim to a beneficial interestagainst the partner entitled to the legal estate to show that he or she has acted to his or her detriment or significantly alteredhis or her position in reliance on the agreement in order to give rise to a constructive trust or proprietary estoppel.</p>        <p class="quote">In sharp contrast with this situation is the very different one where there is no evidence to support a finding of an agreement orarrangement to share, however reasonable it might have been for the parties to reach such an arrangement if they had applied theirminds to the question, and where the court must rely entirely on the conduct of the parties both as the basis from which to infera common intention to share the property beneficially and as the conduct relied on to give rise to a constructive trust. In thissituation direct contributions to the purchase price by the partner who is not the legal owner, whether initially or by payment ofmortgage instalments, will readily justify the inference necessary to the creation of a constructive trust. But, as I read the authorities,it is at least extremely doubtful whether anything less will do."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> I am of the view that there is evidence before me and I have found that there was an agreement, arrangement or understanding reachedbetween the parties that the Flat was to be shared beneficially and the Plaintiff had altered his position by surrendering the OldFlat and his eligibility to public housing. In light of my findings above, the Defendant's claim for a declaration that she is thesole beneficial owner of the Flat is dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Defendant's claim for declaration that the Plaintiff is not interested in the Flat</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Mr Chan informed the court that the Defendant no longer wished to pursue the claim for a declaration that the Plaintiff is and wasat no time interested in the Flat and shall no longer assert any claim in rem in respect thereof. However, no application was madeto withdraw the claim. In light of my findings above, this claim is dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Defendant's alternative claim for repayment of share of mortgage repayments and expenses by the Plaintiff</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Paragraph (3) of the prayer for relief in the Amended Counterclaim asked the Plaintiff to repay his share of the mortgage loan repaymentsand miscellaneous expenses in accordance with the percentage interest deemed by the court. It is common ground, and the Defendantconfirmed in her evidence, that the Defendant was responsible for the purchase price including the mortgage repayments and the outgoings.I see no reason to alter the arrangement reached between the parties on which the Plaintiff relied and the Defendant has performed.This claim is therefore dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) Defendant's claim for the de-registration of the notice of severance</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Paragraph (4) of the prayer of relief in the Amended Counterclaim sought an order to vacate the registration of the notice of severanceof the joint tenancy of the Flat. Since I have already decided in the Plaintiff's favour on the matter of the joint tenancy, thePlaintiff was entitled to serve the notice of severance on the Defendant (which service was admitted by the Defendant) and registerthe same with the Lands Registry. This claim is dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">(8) Defendant's claim for damages for wrongful eviction of the tenant</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> The Defendant claims for loss of rental and damages for the Plaintiff's wrongful eviction of the tenant from the Flat in 2001. MrChan submitted that since the parties are both legal owners of the Flat, the Plaintiff could have no remedy against the tenant wherethe Defendant, a legal co-owner, granted a tenancy to the tenant. Hence, the Plaintiff is liable for loss and damages arising fromsuch wrongful eviction.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> I have found that the Defendant acted wrongfully in preventing the Plaintiff from exercising his rights of use and occupation ofthe Flat by unilaterally leasing out the Flat. To allow the Defendant to maintain this claim will be tantamount to allowing the Defendantto rely on her own wrong to seek damages from the Plaintiff. That cannot be right. It would be inequitable and unjust and the courtwill not lend itself to support such claim. In the circumstances, this claim is also dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs order nisi</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> There is no apparent reason why a costs order <em>nisi</em> should not be made. The Plaintiff has succeeded to a large extent in relation to his claim. However, he failed to establish thatthe Defendant converted his furniture and personal belongings and he only recovered nominal damages in respect of his claim for legalcosts for eviction of the tenant. I therefore apportion the trial time spent in relation to the successful issues to assist the taxingmaster and make an order <em>nisi</em> that the Defendant do pay the Plaintiff the costs of the counterclaim and 80% of the costs of the Plaintiff's claim, to be taxedif not agreed, with certificate for counsel, and the Plaintiff's own costs to be taxed in accordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(Marlene Ng)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Deputy District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mrs Dora Chan instructed by Shamson Zeall &amp; Co for the Plaintiff.</p>        <p>Mr Louie Chan instructed by Erwin Young, Chu &amp; Law for the Defendant.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2002/122.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
