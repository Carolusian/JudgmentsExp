In around early 1990s, the defendant and other persons setup a company in Hong Kong known as P.D. Development Ltd (âPDDâ) for the purpose of development and sale of an estate in Dongguanknown as Yeung Ming Shan Garden (âthe Gardenâ). This was done through a <i>guakao arrangement</i> (æé ), i.e. an arrangement whereby a foreign investor (including one from Hong Kong) could only acquire rights in land througha Mainland real property company (æé å¬å¸) which had those landed rights.  æ±èå¸åè¡æ¿å°ç¢å¬å¸ (âthe Property Companyâ)was the guakao company with whom PDD entered into a joint venture agreement. æ±èå¸åè¡èµ¤å²­ç®¡çå (âthe Mainland Authorityâ)was the land owner of the region in which the Garden was situated, with whom PDD entered into an agreement to develop the Garden.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Before long, PDD found itself in financial difficulty.   The defendant thus agreed to let Ms Chow take over the investment fromPDD and the plaintiff was formed to such end.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  By a series of agreements in 1991 (âthe 1991 agreementsâ) between:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) PDD, the Mainland Authority and the Property Company;  </p>        <p>(ii) PDD and the plaintiff; and</p>        <p>(iii) the plaintiff, the Mainland Authority and the Property Company,</p>    </blockquote>    <p>the plaintiff became the sole investor and developer of the Garden.  The Property Company would give the land use rights to the plaintiffwho would provide all the capital for the development.  The plaintiff would market the Garden in the name of the Property Companywith PDD appointed as the sales agent.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In about 1995, a dispute amongst shareholders of PDD arose.  Proceedings were launched in the Mainland court to challenge the takeoverby the plaintiff. It resulted in a judgment dated 26 March 1997 (âthe 1997 Judgmentâ) which held that the 1991 agreements wereinvalid.  The rights and interests in the Garden remain vested in the Property Company.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Despite the litigation, the development and sale of the Garden continued and revenue was generated.  Since about 1996, the defendanthad been employed as the general manager of the plaintiff. His duty was restricted to the sales of the Garden and the making of paymentto the Property Company for the application for certificates of ownership and other documents and tax.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The plaintiff alleged that in around 2006, some owners of the Garden complained that they had not received their certificates ofownership or other documents despite payment a long time ago.  It began to suspect the defendant of misappropriating the money fromthe sales revenue.  It pressed the defendant for an account but to no avail.  The plaintiff took away all the books of account andrecords of the Garden from the management and sales office of the Garden (âthe Officeâ) on 20 March 2007.  The defendant wasdismissed on 19 April.  On 11 May, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Mainland (âthe 2007 Actionâ), suing the defendantin trespass to the Office and other torts.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 12 July 2007, the 2007 Action was heard with judgment reserved. About 2 weeks later, the plaintiff commenced the present actionin Hong Kong against the defendant for repayment of loan monies.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The defendant filed his acknowledgement of service on 3 August 2007. The plaintiff served the 2-page statement of claim on 22 August2007.  The same asserted that the defendant had <i>borrowed</i> from the plaintiff sums totalling HK$8,430,000 which he refused to repay.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The defendant, then acting in person, filed an affirmation exhibiting the 1997 judgment instead of filing a defence.  The plaintiffapplied for default judgment and the same was entered on 3 October 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  A month later, on 8 November 2007, the Mainland court handed down its judgment (âthe 2007 Judgmentâ).  The judgment held thatthe plaintiff had no rights in the Garden and lacked locus standi to pursue the claim in trespass and its claim was thus dismissed. The time for the plaintiff to appeal has long expired.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The plaintiff did not enforce the default judgment for 2 years. Upon being served with a statutory demand in May 2009,  the defendantapplied to set aside the default judgment.  Upon granting the application, the learned Master directed the plaintiff to amend thestatement of claim to reflect its proper case.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  By its amendment on 23 March 2010, the plaintiff pleaded that it was the âcontractual developerâ of the Garden.  The defendant,being its employee or agent in the Garden, appropriated monies for the purpose of applying for certificates of ownership and paymentof tax for the owners of the Garden units but such purpose was not fulfilled.  Despite demand, the defendant failed to account tothe plaintiff. (This claim will be referred to as âthe misappropriation claimâ.)  The plaintiff prayed for return of RMB 7 millionodd, damages for conversion and breach of duty, accounts and enquiry.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  A month later, the defendant took out the present application.  In his affirmation in support, the defendant admitted withdrawingmoney from the sale proceeds and management fees to defray various costs, including those for tax and certificates of ownership. The defendant claimed that since the plaintiff did not have rights in the Garden, it was not in a position to question how the defendantwithdrew and applied the money. </p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE APPLICATION TO STRIKE OUT</i></p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The defendant bases his application on the ground of res judicata, i.e. that the issues or claims herein have or could and shouldhave been raised and adjudicated upon in the actions in which the 1997 and 2007 Judgments were issued.  The defendant also relieson the ground that the plaintiffâs action is frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  To see whether this application is sustainable, one needs to understand the 2 Mainland Judgments and the amended statement of claim.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE 1997 JUDGMENT</i></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The claim was by various shareholders of PDD (âclaimantsâ) against other shareholders (including the defendant in this case)and the plaintiff in this case.  The Property Company was the third party.    The claimants alleged that the defendant and othershareholders abused their position by transferring all rights of PDD in the Garden to the plaintiff.  The claimants asked for: (i)confirmation that they and PDD were investors and developers of the Garden, and that they had purchased the lawful right to use theland and ownership of the Garden;  (ii) an order that the plaintiff  do stop misrepresenting itself as the investor and developerof the Garden; (iii) audit of PDDâs accounts; (iv) an order for restitution of profits and agency fees of PDD misappropriated bythe defendant shareholders.  In the course of the proceedings, the claimants amended its claim to seek confirmation that PDD hadthe only lawful operating rights over the Garden.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The judgment dated 26 March 1997 (âthe 1997 Judgmentâ) held that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) PDD did not comply with the law on land development and so its agreements with the Property Company and the Mainland Authority as to use of land and land transactions thereunder were null and void.</p>        <p>(ii) PDDâs transfer to the plaintiff was null and void as it was done without notice to PDDâs shareholders and the plaintiff wasnot even incorporated then. </p>        <p>(iii) Because of (ii), the agreements between the plaintiff, the Property Company and the Mainland Authority for the investment anddevelopment of the Garden were also null and void. </p>        <p>(iv) All rights and debts of the Garden would be shared and borne by the shareholders of PDD and the Property Company.  The subsequentrights to operate and manage the Garden shall be vested in the Property Company. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The 1997 Judgment effectively ruled that rights and interests in the Garden belonged to the Property Company and not the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE 2007 JUDGMENT</i></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The plaintiff in the present case was the claimant in the 2007 Action. The present defendant, one Leung Shu Ming and PDD were thedefendants there and the Property Company was the third party.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The claim of the plaintiff was, amongst others, that the defendants trespassed the management office of the Garden, on 2/F northsuite and carried out decoration.  The plaintiff sought an order that the defendants do immediately cease its trespass, withdrawits security force and reinstate the north suite of the office and pay damages. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The defence in that action was that the suit premises were not developed by the plaintiff but by the defendant and PDD, a matterwhich had been confirmed by the 1997 Judgment.  The plaintiff did not enjoy the rights of development. Further, the suit premiseshad been purchased by Leung Shu Ming.  PDD was formed subsequently and had nothing to do with the dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The Mainland court held that the plaintiff had first to prove that it was the rightful owner of the suit premises.  The court examinedthe 1997 Judgment and held that because the court had held that the 1991 agreement  signed between the plaintiff and the PropertyCompany had been declared void, the court would not accept that agreement produced by the plaintiff as evidence.  The court furtherheld:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âèååå¨æ¬æ¡ä¸­ä¸¦ç¡æäº¤ç¸éè­æè­æå¶å°é½æå±±è±åææè³,æå°é½æå±±è±åæç¶çãç®¡çãé·å®ç­æ¬å©ï¼ä¹æªæäº¤ç¸éè­æè­æå¶å°æ¡æ¶é½æå±±è±åç®¡çèå¯«å­æ¨äºæ¨åé¢çæ¿å±ä¾æ³äº«æä½æãä½¿ç¨ãæ¶çãèåç­æ¬å©ï¼ååä¸»å¼µèªå·±ä¿æ¡æ¶æ¿å±çæ¬å©äººï¼è­æä¸è¶³ï¼æ¬é¢ä¸äºç¢ºèªãææ­¤ï¼ç±æ¼ååä¸è½è­æèªå·±èæ¬æ¡ç­è­°ä¹äºå¯¦å­å¨ç´æ¥å©å®³éä¿ï¼å¶èµ·è¨´ä¸ç¬¦åãä¸­è¯äººæ°å±ååæ°äºè¨´è¨æ³ãç¬¬ä¸ç¾é¶å«æ¢è¦å®çèµ·è¨´æ¢ä»¶ï¼æä¾æ³æç¶äºä»¥é§åãâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The claim in trespass was thus dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff could not prove that it had the locus standi and directinterest in the dispute.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>THE PLAINTIFFâS CASE</i></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In paragraph 1 of the amended statement of claim, the plaintiff pleaded that it was the âcontractual developerâ of the Garden.  What that meant was not clear on the face of the pleading. </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The amended statement of claim went on to plead that the defendant was the employee, servant or agent of the plaintiff in the Garden. In the course of the development between January 2000 and November 2006, the plaintiff entrusted the defendant with money for variouspurposes, including paying the Dongguan Government for obtaining certificates of ownership for the individual units in the Garden.In breach of his duty, the defendant failed to so apply the money or give an account to the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Subsequent to the issue of the present summons, the defendant has asked the plaintiff for further and better particulars in July2010 (i) as to the source and nature of the money entrusted to the defendant; and (ii) âwhether the money was (or represented)the sale proceeds of (or monies otherwise generated by) the units of [the Garden], of which the right of use of land and right ofsale of commodity housing belonged to [the Property Company], as received by the defendant from the respective purchasers thereof.â</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The plaintiff flatly refused to provide the further and better particulars on the ground that the answers were for preparation ofthe defence only.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  It was only in the affirmations of Ms Chow that she clarified her case. The plaintiff claimed that as a result of her continuedinvestment and development of the Garden and cooperation with the Property Company, she had acquired some rights and interests (âtheundefined interestsâ).  She never expressly defined those rights and interests except in the legal opinion of her Mainland lawyer. I will come back to that later on.  </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Despite the 2 Judgments, the Property Company had, confirmed the validity of its agreement with the plaintiff in 1991.  By a documentdated 28 November 2007 (âthe Written Confirmationâ), the Property Company confirmed, amongst others, that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) The Property Company and the plaintiff had signed a contract dated 31 December 1991 regarding cooperation in developing and investingin the Garden.</p>        <p>(ii) The above cooperative relationship had never ceased nor been affected by any litigation or dispute.</p>        <p>(iii) The plaintiff was the only developer of the Garden.</p>        <p>(iv) Apart from the plaintiff, no other company or person had any right to sell or deal with the units in the Garden.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  By an authorization letter dated 20 December 2007 (âthe Authorization Letterâ), the Property Company appointed Ms Chow of theplaintiff as the person in charge of the Garden to deal with its daily matters.  The validity period was for one year from 20 December2007 to 19 December 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The plaintiff signed sale and purchase agreements as âagentâ for the Property Company.  It also received proceeds of sale frompurchasers.  It said it was entitled to do so because of its agreement with the Property Company. </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The plaintiff, however, did not explain how it âentrustedâ the monies to the defendant.  The defendant, on the other hand, statedthat the Office would receive all sale proceeds and monies for application for certificates and taxes and pooled them together. The defendant would withdraw money therefrom.  The money never passed through the plaintiffâs hands. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The plaintiff accepted the advice of its then legal advisers in the Mainland that it was not easy to overturn the 1997 and 2007Judgments and decided not to appeal against either of them.  The plaintiff claimed that neither Judgment dealt with the issue ofwhether it had the undefined interests.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>RES JUDICATA?</i></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The general statement of principle can be found in the case of <i>Ray Chen v.

I begin with a statement of the general principles:</p>        <p class="quote">(1) <i>Res judicata</i> in its narrow sense simply means that a party will not be permitted to relitigate in subsequent proceedings issues which have alreadybeen adjudicated upon in previous proceedings by a court of competent jurisdiction. This form of abuse of process is often knownas <i>res judicata</i> proper or <i>res judicata</i> in its classic or narrow sense.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) <i>Res judicata</i> in its so-called wider sense is the principle that âthe court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward the wholecase, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respectof matters which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in context, but which was not brought forward, only becausethey have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case.â: see <i>Henderson v. Henderson</i> (supra), at 115 per Sir James Wigram VC.  In <i>Yat Tung Investment Company Limited v, Dao Heng Bank Limited</i> (supra), Lord Kilbrandon said at 590A-B, âBut there is a wider sense in which the doctrine may be appealed to, so that it becomesan abuse of process to raise in subsequent proceedings <i> </i>matters which could and therefore should have been litigated in earlier proceedings.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In <i>Harvest Good Development Limited v.

He conceded that paragraph 1 of the amendedstatement of claim was irrelevant.  It was only necessary to prove that the defendant was an employee and that he had misappropriatedthe money entrusted to him. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  If Mr Chongâs submission is correct, the present cause of action had never been adjudicated upon because:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) The 1997 Judgment concerned land interest, development and investment rights of the plaintiff whereas the misappropriation claimwas based on breach of employeeâs duty.   Further, the alleged misappropriation took place between January 2000 and November 2006which all took place after the 1997 Judgment.</p>        <p>(ii) The 2007 Judgment concerned trespass which required proof of interest in land.  It was different in nature from the misappropriationclaim.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  However, that was not the end of the story.  The defendant argued that the misappropriation claim could or should have been raisedand adjudicated upon in the 2007 Action.  The plaintiff explained that the documents were voluminous and she had not yet been ableto work out the accounts properly to sue in misappropriation by the time it commenced the 2007 Action.  It was also the plaintiffâsbelief that the misappropriation claim did not involve land use rights of the Property Company anyway. </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  To start with, one should ascertain the cause of action in the 2007 Action.  The phrase âcause of actionâ has been defined tomean âsimply a factual situation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the Court a remedy against another person.âper Diplock LJ in <i>Letang v.

The plaintiff also expressly pleaded that up to March 2007, it had in hand statistical data that the defendanthad misappropriated huge sums of sale proceeds to the extent of RMB 7 million odd and had not returned to the plaintiff; it intendedto launch a claim in the High Court of Hong Kong. The plaintiff went on to plead the facts as to how the defendant and one LeungShu Ming in collusion forcibly trespassed the office on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of the north suite without consent of the plaintiff, denied the plaintiff access and set up security guards. The defendanteven posted up notices to state that it was he who terminated Ms Chowâs directorship, thereby defaming Ms Chow.  The defendanteven engaged decorators to renovate the office in the north suite, directly altering the premises in which the plaintiff enjoyedrights.  The plaintiff pleaded that it <i>guakao</i> the Property Company to develop the Garden, so all unsold units there should lawfully belong to the plaintiff.

Even if the exact amount misappropriated was not clear, the plaintiff could stillhave included the misappropriation claim in the 2007 Action and seek to amend the amount when the exact figure was known.  (The PRCCourt had power to allow amendment to a plaintiffâs claim as can be seen from the 1997 Action.)</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Moreover, the relief prayed for in the 2007 Action was more than just trespass.  It included damages for defamation (nothing todo with land) and economic loss.  There was nothing to bar the joinder of the misappropriation claim.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  In my view, the plaintiff could and should have included the misappropriation claim in the 2007 Action.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The plaintiff tries to impress upon this Court that the misappropriation claim was different in nature from the 2007 Action.  Itrelies on the undefined interests occurring after the 1997 Judgment.  If the plaintiff is to commence a new action for the misappropriationclaim in the Mainland, basing on the 2 Judgments, no court in the Mainland will have jurisdiction to entertain it.  According tothe plaintiffâs Mainland lawyer:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">è²´å¸å¦ä»¥æ±èé½æå±±è±åä¹ç¼å±ååæè³èèº«ä»½å¨å¤§é¸æ³é¢èµ·è¨´å®¹ä¸­èï¼å¼·èª¿è²´å¸ä½çºæ±èé½æå±±è±åä¹ç¼å±ååæè³èçèº«ä»½ï¼å¤§é¸æ³é¢çºæ¥ææ¡ä»¶äºå¯¦ä¹éè¦ï¼ä¸è¬ææ³ä¸æå°æ±èé½æå±±è±åä¹æ¬çé²è¡èª¿æ¥ãåºæ¼1995å¹´å2007å¹´æ¡ä»¶æèªå®ä¹äºå¯¦ï¼æ±èé½æå±±è±åä¹æ¬çå±¬æ±èå¸åè¡æ¿å°ç¢å¬å¸ææãå¤§é¸æ³é¢æ¥µæå¯è½æè¦æ±è¿½å æ±èå¸åè¡æ¿å°ç¢å¬å¸ä½çºæ¡ä»¶ä¹å±ååååå è¨´è¨ï¼å¦æ±èå¸åè¡æ¿å°ç¢å¬å¸ä¸äºéåï¼è²´å¸å°æå¯è½å æ¡ä»¶ä¸»é«ä¸ç¬¦èè¢«é§åèµ·è¨´ã</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The plaintiff had invited the Property Company to join as plaintiff in the 2007 Action but the invitation was declined.

The plaintiff is likely tolose in the new Mainland action. </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  This begs the question of why the PRC courts have no jurisdiction and will dismiss the new claim.

That Article deals with the position betweencontracting parties, i.e. the plaintiff and the Property Company (and maybe the Mainland Authority) when a contract is nullified. It does not say how the plaintiff can go from there to make an employee liable.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Be that as it may, it can be seen from the legal opinion that the plaintiff cannot avoid relying on the facts pleaded in the 2007Action to establish the undefined interests. </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The undefined interests were not really new interests.  In the 2007 Action, the plaintiff pleaded that åååå¾åå°å¾ï¼å³ä¾ç´é²è¡äº<b><u>æè³</u></b>éç¼å»ºè¨­.

The former merely confirmed an existing stateof affairs before its date â the same state of affairs asserted before the Mainland Court.  The latter stated the plaintiff tobe the agent of the Property Company but if that were so, why would it not be the disclosed principal who should sue the defendant?</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The so called lack of jurisdiction was really a comment that the matter was res judicata in the Mainland.  There was no merit inthe new claim.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  If the plaintiff were to proceed in Hong Kong, parties are agreed that PRC law will apply.  Thus, the same result as the 2007 Judgmentwill be reached.  The plea of âcontractual developerâ was actually relevant.  The plaintiff cannot avoid going into the historyto show how that status was created and hence the undefined rights accrued.

China Pui Ching Education Foundation Ltd,</i> CACV 262 of 2005.  Such connecting facts include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as availability of witnesses),but also other facts such as the law governing the relevant transaction and the place where the parties respectively reside or carryon business. </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Where jurisdiction in Hong Kong has been founded as of right (as in this case, against the defendant who is a Hong Kong resident),the burden of proof is on the defendant: <i>The Peng Yan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%201%20HKLRD%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] 1 HKLRD 144.</a></p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The factors connecting the claim to Hong Kong are: that the plaintiff is a Hong Kong entity; that the main witnesses Ms Chow andthe defendant are Hong Kong residents. </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  It is not clear whether or not the employment contract was made in HK or the Mainland.  It is irrelevant anyway because the subjectmatter of the dispute is not the validity of the employment contract or the terms therein but the breach of duty of the employee.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The plaintiff suggests that because 400 units were sold in Hong Kong, that constituted a connecting factor to Hong Kong.  I disagreebecause  no dispute arose out of those sales and purchases. </p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The factors connecting the claim to the Mainland range from applicable law to witnesses and the substance of the claim. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The plaintiff conceded, correctly in my view, that the applicable law is that of the Mainland. </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The likely witnesses either reside in the Mainland (the 2 accounting clerks) or spend a lot of time there (Ms Chow and the defendant). </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  On the evidence, the defendant was specifically employed by the plaintiff for the sales of the Garden.  The Mainland Authority andthe Property Company from which the plaintiff allegedly derived rights and interests in the Garden are in the Mainland. The partiesâtransactions and dispute over rights took place in the Mainland.  The entrustment of the cash to and receipt thereof by the defendantallegedly took place at the Garden.   The monies were to be applied for obtaining certificates of ownership and paying tax in theMainland. Books of account used to be kept by the clerks at the Office.  Cash not properly applied by the defendant should be returnedto the plaintiff in the Mainland. The alleged breach of duty was therefore committed in the Mainland.   (This is different from theduty of the plaintiff to keep proper accounts as a Hong Kong company in order to fulfill its responsibility to shareholders and theInland Revenue Department.)  If the money is not accounted for, the loss is suffered in the Mainland.   </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  One head of claim is conversion, which is a tort that applies to chattels as opposed to money.  No chattels are involved and soit is not necessary to consider where the conversion occurred.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The connecting factors are overwhelmingly with the Mainland.  Accordingly, Hong Kong is not the appropriate forum from the pointof view of the trial.  The Dongguan Peopleâs Court is clearly and distinctly more appropriate than Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Stage (II)  Deprivation of  juridical advantage</i></p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  A juridical advantage may be a significant cause of action, a substantive remedy or a procedure available in one jurisdiction andnot the other.  A juridical advantage may be that there is realistically no fair trial abroad if the local proceedings were stayed.
