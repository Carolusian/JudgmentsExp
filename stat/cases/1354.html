The plaintiff appeared in person.  At the conclusion of the appealhearing judgment was reserved which we now give.</p>    <p class="heading">Background facts</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiff used to be a Census and Survey Officer (âCSOâ) working in the Census &amp; Statistics Department.  He was firstappointed as an Assistant CSO in 1979 and was promoted to the rank of CSO on 1 January 1985.  He applied for early retirement inJanuary 2004 and retired in November 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Between May and July 2003, appraisal reports for the years 1989 to 1993 (inclusive) were made available to the plaintiff upon hisapplication.  In April 2004, the appraisal reports for 1985 and 1998 were also made available.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiff issued proceedings on 17 November 2004 in HCA 2619/2004 (âthe 2004 actionâ) claiming that the defendant and hisagents had breached the conditions of his employment contract by failing to assess his performance in âa fair, orderly and transparentmanner, leading the [p]laintiff to be deprived of his chance of promotionâ.  Paragraph 5 of the statement of claim in the 2004action reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â5.    The Plaintiff claims damages against the Defendant for :-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)    all the financial (and including the consequential) losses and mental suffering that the Plaintiff had incurred at the materialtimes <b>since 1995</b> as a result of; the Promotion Board being misled by the Defendant who had placed before them the unauthorized and/or improperly amendedappraisal reports of the Plaintiff to his disadvantages without his knowledge for their consideration of the Plaintiffâs promotion,hence depriving the Plaintiffâs chances of being recommended for promotion in 1995 and onwards; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b)    the psychiatric injury that he had suffered as a result of his knowledge of the unauthorized and/or improper amendments inhis appraisal reports (<i>sic</i>) to his disadvantages without his knowledge since 1988 to 1995 or onwards till he retired in November 2004 and thereafter.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 10 March 2006, Master Lung struck out the 2004 action and refused the plaintiffâs application to be allowed to plead maliceagainst his superior officers, malice having been specifically disclaimed in the skeleton submissions of the plaintiffâs counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The plaintiff appealed the masterâs decision.  The matter came before Burrell J on 7 June 2006.  During the hearing, the plaintiffwithdrew his appeal.  According to the judgeâs notes, the plaintiff withdrew the appeal</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âin order to consider recommencing his action with âsubstantialâ amendments to the original statement of claim, such amendmentsto include allegation of malice (if so advised).  Plaintiff reserves the right to include existing allegation from the present statementof claim in the new statement of claim if so advised.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 18 April 2007, the plaintiff brought a fresh action (being the present action) against the defendant claiming that the defendanthad (1) breached the employment contract between the plaintiff and the defendant; (2) breached âstatutory duties and/or officialdutiesâ it owed the plaintiff; (3) acted negligently concerning the appraisal and promotion of the plaintiff; and (4) made adversealterations or additions to his appraisal reports with âmaliceâ.  The statement of claim was amended on 18 May 2007.  In essence,the plaintiffâs complaints concern the loss of a fair opportunity to be promoted through the manner in which his appraisal reportsand related assessments had been handled.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In so far as the allegation of âmaliceâ is concerned, that is to be found in paragraph 75 (d) of the amended statement of claimwhich reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(d)  Further or alternatively, the aforesaid adverse alternations (<i>sic</i>) or additions made to the 1985 to 1993 Appraisal Reports as pleaded hereinabove were made at the material times by the Defendantor its officers or its servants or its agents with malice, calculated to deprive a proper chance of appraisal and promotion for thePlaintiff, as an adverse response and/or revenge for the Plaintiffâs complaints, particulars of which have been stated in paragraph7 above.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Master Yu struck out the amended statement of claim in February 2008 on the ground that it did not disclose any reasonable causeof action.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The appeal from the Master Yuâs order came before A Cheung J on 10 June 2008.  At that hearing, counsel for the plaintiff appliedto amend the amended statement of claim that had been struck out by the master by the inclusion of âparagraph 75Aâ which wasset out only in the plaintiffâs skeleton submissions.  That paragraph sought to plead a cause of action based on misfeasance inpublic office.  The judge dealt first with this matter and disallowed the application to amend.  As appear from paragraphs 4-6 ofhis judgment, he did so essentially because the pleading was wholly deficient, having regard to the constituent elements of the tortof public misfeasance considered in detail by Ribeiro JA (as he then was) in <i>Tang Nin Mun v Secretary for Justice</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20HKLRD%20324" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 HKLRD 324.</a></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  There is no appeal to this court from that refusal as is clear from the plaintiffâs notice of appeal and supplemental notice ofappeal.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The judge then went on to deal with the substantive appeal against Master Yuâs order striking out the amended statement of claim. He noted the concession made by the plaintiffâs counsel that, at all material times, the employer of the plaintiff was the thenHong Kong Government and, subsequently, the Government of the Hong Kong SAR rather than the defendant to the present action, namely,the Commissioner Census and Statistics.  He dismissed the appeal on the basis that there could be no valid complaint for breach ofcontract of employment against the Commissioner.</p>    <p class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  As a matter of record, I should state that at the appeal hearing this court dealt, first, with the plaintiffâs application (whichwas opposed) for leave to file and serve his third affidavit sworn on 14 April 2009.  It would appear that the third affidavit wasintended, <i>inter alia</i>, to cure what was perceived to be the defects in the amended statement of claim.  However, no draft of any proposed amendments tothe amended statement of claim was exhibited or placed before the court.  The plaintiffâs application was refused.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In passing, it is to be noted that in the plaintiffâs written submissions, the plaintiff requested that two additional defendantsbe made parties to the present action, namely, the Secretary for Justice and the Chairman of the Public Service Commission but thecourt was not provided with any draft of the proposed amendments to justify the proposed joinder.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  It will have become apparent from the outline of the 2004 action and the present action and the claims made in the two actions (leavingaside the allegation of âmaliceâ in the present action which is dealt with below) that at the heart of those actions are theplaintiffâs allegations that his appraisal reports had been amended without his knowledge or consent and that such amendments/alterationscould not have been made without fault on the part of the Government, either through breaching the employment contract with the plaintiffor acting negligently.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The appraisal reports upon which those allegations are based are none other than those that had been made available to the plaintiffseveral months prior to the commencement of the 2004 action.  The plaintiffâs allegations had been fully ventilated before MasterLung in the 2004 action and addressed in the reasons he gave for striking out the 2004 action in March 2006.  Plainly, that decisionhas become final, having regard to the fact that the appeal was withdrawn almost 3 years ago.  Any further appeal would require leavewhich, in the circumstances, would not be granted.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  It is an abuse of process for a party to initiate legal proceedings for the purpose of mounting a collateral attack upon a finaldecision against him which has been made by another court of competent jurisdiction in previous proceedings in which he had a fullopportunity of contesting the decision in the court by which it was made.  See <i>Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 529</a> (at 541B-C).  Where those circumstances arise, the court has a duty (not a discretion) to exercise what Lord Diplock considered wasa âsalutaryâ power (<i>ibid</i> at 536D).  He explained (at 536C-D) that it is</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although notinconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigationbefore it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking peopleâ¦.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The rationale that lead to the recognition of this duty on the part of the court appears in the judgment of Rogers VP in <i>Tsang Chin Keung v Employees Compensation Assistance Fund Board</i> (No. 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKC%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKC 499</a> at 511B-D:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe first is the general abuse which would come from raising the same issues in a subsequent proceedings simply by changing theform of the action.  This was recognised for example by Lord Halsbury LC in <i>Reichel v Magrath</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20AC%20665" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 14 App Cas 665</a> at 668.  The recognition stemmed, perhaps, from a need to have finality and certainty in the outcome of litigation.  Akin to thathave been the various attempts to demonstrate that a conviction has been wrongful by bringing ancillary litigation, whether it beagainst police officers, lawyers or otherwise, the effect of which is to demonstrate the wrongfulness of the conviction.  The otheraspect is one of unfairness to a party who is entitled to rely on a previous decision and is put to disadvantage by having to contestthe new litigation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In my view, in substance, claims (1) to (3) of the present action (see Â§ 7 above) repeat the claims made in the 2004 action.  Suchchanges as have been made are purely as to form.  It constitutes a collateral attack on a final decision and, as such, is an abuseof process within <i>Hunter</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The only ânewâ matter in the present action is the bald allegation of âmaliceâ in paragraph 75 (d) of the amended statementof claim.  But the ânewâ matter did not arise from any new information obtained by the plaintiff after the date of the 2004 action. Rather, the basis of the âmaliceâ allegation is none other than the appraisal reports made available to the plaintiff monthsprior to the 2000 an action.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In <i>Yat Tung Investment Co. Ltd.</i> <i>v Dao Heng Bank Ltd &amp; Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%2d1976%29%20HKC%20194" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973-1976) HKC 194</a> at 200I-201E, it is stated as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ it becomes an abuse of process to raise in subsequent proceedings matters which could and therefore should have been litigatedin earlier proceedings.  The locus classicus of that aspect of res judicata is the judgment of Wigram VC in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%203%20Hare%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a>, 115, where the judge says:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">    â¦ where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, thecourt requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances)permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as partof the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident,omitted part of their case.  The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court wasactually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subjectof litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">The shutting out of a âsubject of litigationâ â a power which no court should exercise but after a scrupulous examination ofall the circumstances â is limited to cases where reasonable diligence would have caused a matter to be earlier raised; moreover,although negligence, inadvertence or even accident will not suffice to excuse, nevertheless âspecial circumstancesâ are reservedin case justice should be found to require the non-application of the rule.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I consider that the circumstances of the present case are such as to fall squarely within the <i>Yat Tung</i> principle.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  For all those reasons, I consider that this appeal falls to be dismissed.
