The plaintiff is suing on behalf of the deceasedâs estate foran account of rent collected by the defendant.  The defendant counterclaims a declaration that the deceased held the half share ofthe Property as trustee for him, and denies that the deceasedâs estate is entitled to any rent.</p>    <p class="heading">Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The deceased was the younger brother of the defendant.  They were partners in the family partnership of Kong Hing Plastic Factory(âthe Factoryâ). </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> In 1973, the partnership was incorporated as Kong Hing Plastic Factory Limited (âthe Companyâ).   The shareholders were: thedefendant (1,200 shares); the deceased and the two younger brothers (500 shares each); Madam Cheung Po Ling, the defendantâs wife(400 shares).  The deceased and the defendant are the two permanent directors of the Company.  The defendant is the Chairman of theCompany, and the deceased became a full time employee of the Company in 1984. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> On 20 February 1967, the deceased and the defendant entered into an agreement for the purchase of the Property.  The purchase pricewas $107,996.00.  The construction of the Property was then still uncompleted.  Prior to completion, certain part payments as depositand instalments were made.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> On 14 March 1968, the sale and purchase was completed.  On the same date, the deceased and the defendant executed a mortgage in favourof the Hang Seng Bank Limited to secure the loan and interest of $60,553.  The loan was repayable by 19 equal instalments of $3,187.00. On 16 October 1969, the Property was reassigned to the deceased and the defendant upon repayment.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Ever since completion, the Property was let to the Factory, and then the Company for the use as office and/or factory.  The registeredoffice of the Company was and is situated at the Property.  The accounts of the Company showed that between 1987 and 1992, a monthlyrent of $15,000 was paid by the Company in respect of the Property.  It is not in dispute that between 1987 and 1989, the deceasedreceived sums out of the Rent Account of the Company.  The entries do not always show $7,500 per month, but the defendant admittedthat a personal subsidy of $7,500 per month was paid by him to the deceased, which unbeknown to him at the time was booked to theRent Account.  The payment stopped after 11 November 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The deceased left the employment of the Company some time after November 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> On 1 April 1993, the deceased through his solicitors wrote to the Company demanding payment of the arrears of rent in respect ofthe Property (being the half payable to the deceased) from 1 November 1991 to 31 March 1993 in the sum of $127,500 ($7,500 x 17).</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiffâ<i>s case</i></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiffâs pleaded case can be summarised as follows:</p>    <blockquote>		<table border="0" width="95%">			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				(1)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				The plaintiff is beneficially entitled to half share of the 				Property as tenant-in-common.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				(2)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				Since completion of the purchase in about March 1968, the 				Property was let by the deceased and the defendant to the 			Factory and later to the Company.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				(3)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				From October 1988 to 1991, the rent paid by the Company was 				$15,000 per month, i.e. $7,500 each to the deceased and the				defendant for their respective half share of the Property.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				(4)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				After 11 November 1991 and continuing, the Company has been 				paying the deceasedâs rent to the defendant receiving as the				deceasedâs agent for the use of the deceased (âthe Collected 				Rentsâ).</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote"> </td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				(5)</td>				<td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left" class="quote">				Since 1993 and from time to time, rent was revised.</td>			</tr>		</table>	</blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> It is common ground that the Companyâs audited accounts show that rent was paid in respect of the Property up to the end of 1998.

He used his personal cheque to pay the deposit of $15,979,and he retained a photocopy of the receipt.  He also retained the original sales and purchase agreement.  The original assignmentis kept by the mortgagee bank upon the re-mortgage in 1980, and it was not returned because the bank required the signature of thedeceased. </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> The defendant said the deceased had no money for the purchase.  The deceased only returned from Taiwan in late 1964, not 1963.  In1967, the deceased earned $500 to $600 per month.  Due to over-spending, the deceased often had to borrow money from him.  The defendantsaid he never told PW3 that the Property was purchased by the deceased and himself jointly. </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> The defendant said he might have asked the deceased to pay the mortgage instalments, but he gave the deceased the money and the deceasedalways gave him back the receipts.  The mortgage instalment receipts were later stolen by the deceased.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> At the time of the purchase, the defendant was not yet married.  Originally, he intended to purchase the Property under his solename.  But a friend told him that in case he were to die unexpectedly, his assets would be frozen pending payment of estate dutyand/or grant of probate.  If he added a name of someone he could trust as the owner, the Property would not be frozen, and his familycould use the rent in the meantime, or mortgage the Property to borrow money.  He asked to âborrowâ the deceasedâs name.  Thedeceased said no problem and promised to transfer the Property back to him at any time.  He only intended the arrangement to be interim,and he would ask the deceased to transfer the half share back to him after he got married and gained confidence in his wife.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> In 1982 after his son was born, the deceased offered to transfer the half share of the Property back to him.  The defendant saidthere was no urgency.   Secondly, the Tong family would not give valuable property to a woman, and his mother might object to givingproperty to a daughter in law.  In 1992, he asked the deceased to give him back his half share of the Property but the deceased madeexcuses for not doing so.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The defendant said his letter to the CIR in 1983 stating the deceased and him jointly owned the Property was untrue.  At that timeboth the deceased and him faced CIR enquiries.  The deceased had already replied and stated the position of ownership as per theLand Registry record.  The deceased drafted the letter for him along the same line.  He never read the letter because the deceasedsaid it was alright.  He did not care whether the letter stated the true position.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The defendant admitted that he had paid a personal subsidy of $7,500 per month to the deceased.  In 1987 or 1988, the deceased askedfor a pay rise.  At the relevant time, the deceasedâs monthly salary was $10,000.   The defendant said the Company would not doso, but he could personally give the deceased $7,500 per month.  It was purely co-incidental that monthly rent he received from theCompany was $15,000 and the monthly subsidy was $7,500.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> At the time his wife was responsible for keeping the accounts for the Company.  He told his wife to pay $7,500 per month to the deceased. He did not know that his wife had paid it out of the Companyâs Rent Account.  He did not know about the payment vouchers of theCompany at the time.  He only knew about them after the present litigation.  The initials on the payment vouchers purportedly showinghe had approved the payment of rent were not made by him.  He had authorized his wife to initial on his behalf generally. </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The defendant said the Company ran a special system of cash expenditure.  In order to increase the cash flow of the Company, he wouldnot normally withdraw the rent due to him unless he needed money.  Whenever purchases in cash were needed, the sum would be bookedto the Rent Account and charged against his unwithdrawn rental income.  For example, if the staff member needed to make purchaseof $10,000, he would pay the staff $10,000.  After the purchase, he would give the receipt of $10,000 to the Company and the Companywould pay him back $10,000 from the Rent Account.  He expected the $7,500 might have been booked to the Rent Account in this manner. It would explain why the payment vouchers retained by the deceased stated ârentâ.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In late 1991, the defendant stopped the subsidy of $7,500.  The subsidy was subject to the conditions that the deceased had to workdiligently and to make a moulding machine work.  The deceased failed to do so.  After that, his mother told him that the deceasedtook away the mortgage instalment receipts placed in two boxes in her motherâs room. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Mr. But Hoi Hung (DW3), an employee of the Company, produced a Cash Advance Book purportedly to prove the above system.  Mr. Butcould only tell of cash advances to him in making purchases, he did not know about the accounting system and in particular the useof the Rent Account.  The Cash Advance Book covered the period from 1995 to 1997.  The defendantâs wife emigrated to Canada in1994 and she ceased to keep the books of the Company.  From then on, the system of cash advance was handled by the defendant himself.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The Defence originally pleaded that the Company ceased renting the Property in 1993.  After discovery of the Companyâs auditedaccounts disclosing the payment of rent until 1998, the Defence was amended.  The defendant said the Company ceased production inHong Kong in 1993.  He told his wife to move out of the Property and not to pay rent anymore.  His understanding was no rent waspaid since 1993, and he only realized at the end of 1998 that his wife made a mistake in continuing to pay rent.   He told his wifeto stop paying rent after 1998.  He signed the audited accounts without looking at the description in the Supporting Analysis forrent.  The accounts for 1999 were drawn up but not audited.  There were no further accounts done.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Since 1993, the Property could not be used or rented out because of concrete spalling. He asked his staff to repair it but they nevergot round to do it.  It was basically left idle since 1993, and was used to store some useless items and fixtures for convenience,and the staff might have used the toilet.  There was no urgency to let it out.  Since the Company still occupied Block B &amp; C,the Property was kept as the registered office merely for correspondence.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The defendant explained that the production referred to in the minutes of the EGM in 2000 was not the business directly operatedby the Company, but business of Wo Hing in the Mainland.  Woo Hing is a factory owned by the defendant and his wife.  It is not asubsidiary of the Company.  It is a sub-contractor of the Company.</p>      <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The defendantâs wife Cheung Po Ling (DW3) handled the accounts of the Company before she emigrated to Canada in 1994.  She hadno formal training in book keeping.  She treated the Rent Account as the defendantâs personal Auto Teller Machine.  Therefore,when the defendant asked her to pay the deceased $7,500 subsidy per month, she subconsciously charged it to the Rent Account.  Shenever encountered a situation where the Rent Account was insufficient for cash purchases because she would see to it not being so. In 1992, the accountant said it was messy to charge cash purchases to the Rent Account and suggested that a Petty Cash Account beused.  Since 1992, the Rent Account was only used for rent and not cash purchases.</p>     <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Madam Cheung said she put the defendant's initial on the payment vouchers because the auditors said the payment vouchers shouldbe approved by someone.  She said that she feared no consequence of putting otherâs initial because the defendant would never checkon her.  Although she had emigrated in 1994, she would come back to supervise the drawing up of the annual accounts.  She told thebook keeper to book rent of $15,000 per month.  Even in 1998 where she did not return to Hong Kong, she told the book keeper to dothe same for the 1997 accounts.  The payment voucher dated 9 November 1989 stating âRent â KM Tong Rent for 3/F âDâ (Mayto September)  $37,500â was not prepared by her although so stated.  The deceased prepared it for her when he came up to receivepayment of subsidy.</p>       <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Madam Cheung said after 1993, the Company only used the Property as the office, and the warehouse was move to neighbouring premisesof Block B &amp; C.  Finally in 1999, even the office was moved to Block B.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Madam Cheung said the rent for 1996 and 1997 should be $180,000 (i.e. $15,000 per month) instead of $216,000 (i.e. $18,000 per month)as in 1994, 1995 and 1998, because there were periodic fluctuations in the rental market.</p>   <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Mr. William Lee Cheuk Yin (DW2) is the manager of Messrs. M.B. Lee &amp; Co.   Mr. Lee was in charge of the Companyâs audit from1974 to its cessation of business in 1998.  In relation to the Audit Confirmation dated 24 July 1992 asking the deceased to confirmthat the Company owed the him rent for the Property in the sum of $15,000, he presumed that his staff would send audit confirmationsto both owners based on the record of owners in the Land Registry.  There should be no enquiry as to who actually received the rentas the auditor of the Company was only concerned with payment of rent, not with the receipt.  On the other hand, he never heard fromanyone that the rent payment to the deceased was not real.  As to the letter to the Commission for Canada, he drafted it based oninformation supplied by the deceased.</p><p class="heading">Beneficial ownership of the Property</p>  <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The burden of proof of provision of the entire purchase price rests with the defendant, whereas the burden of proof relating to thereceipt of rent rests with the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr. Yin for the defendant pointed out that the defendant is the only witness with personal knowledge of the purchase.  The plaintiffâsevidence is either hearsay, or documentary hearsay.  Mr. Yin submitted that the plaintiff should not reap a forensic advantage byreason of the deceased not being available for cross-examination.</p> <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Mr. Yin submitted that it is common ground that at the time of the purchase the deceased did not have other business or investment,and the Factory never distributed profits to the partners.  The defendant simply could not have afforded to purchase the Property.  Mr. Lee Yuet Man did not know whether the deceased was paying the mortgage instalments for the Property or else.  Miss Tong KwokWai had an axe to grind against the defendant because they had quarrelled over other investments, and at any rate, she was dismissedfrom the Company by the defendant allegedly for poor performance.</p>  <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr. Yin submitted that the documentary evidence are inconclusive.  The Audit Confirmation was issued on the basis of the ownerâsrecord of the Land Registry.  The letter to the Commission of Canada was written on the instructions supplied by the deceased. </p>  <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The tax record was inconsistent with the date of occupation of the Property.   The assignment was dated 14 March 1968, which meantthe occupation of the Property should commence from mid-March 1968.  Hence, the assessable profits from Properties for the yearsof assessment 1967/68 and 1968/69 could not possibly have been the same $6,410.  Even the deceased stated in his memo that rentingonly commenced in September 1968.  It either means the assessable profits from properties for 1967/68 were mis-stated, or they relatedto other properties.  Further, the assessments were retrospectively raised in 1973 and the rental income could have been mis-stated.</p> <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The mortgage instalment receipts could not prove the source of fund.  In any case, the deceased only had some mortgage instalmentreceipts and 1 downpayment receipt, but not other payment record.  The deceased had 10 receipts out of 19 instalments in total. That is not consistent with paying half of the instalments.  Except for the one payment voucher dated 9 November 1989, the othersnever stated the payment to the deceased was rent.  And that one was but an aberration.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mr. Yin submitted that although the defendant produced only one copy of the downpayment receipt of $15,979, it is not surprisingsince the purchase was 40 years ago and the documents could have been lost.</p>   <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Granted that the plaintiffâs witnesses and the documentary evidence referred to above are hearsay in nature, I consider that onedocument stands apart from them, that is the letter by the defendant to the CIR stating that he was owner of only half share of theProperty.  It might have been drafted by someone else, but it was signed by the defendant.  It is an admission against interest.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr. Chan for the plaintiff submitted even if the Court were to accept that the letter did not state the truth, it would mean thedefendant was defrauding the CIR, and the original intention to avoid the Property being frozen was also improper.  Hence, the defendantis not entitled to rely on any resulting trust in his favour by reason of illegality.</p> <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Mr. Yin submitted that the defendantâs intention to save the Property from being frozen pending payment of estate duty is notnecessarily illegal, and the letter to the CIR stating he owned only half of the Property was not part of any underlying transactionat the time of the creation of the trust.  Hence, the defendant did not have to rely on any facts disclosing any illegality to provethe resulting trust.</p>  <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  In <i>Tinsley v.

The purpose of that arrangementwas to assist in the perpetration of frauds on the Department of Social Security.  A quarrel between the parties led to the plaintiffmoving out, leaving the defendant in occupation.  The plaintiff claimed possession asserting sole ownership of the property.  Thedefendant counterclaimed a declaration that the property was held by the plaintiff on trust for the parties in equal shares and foran order for sale. The House of Lords (by a majority) held that a claimant to an interest in property, whether based on a legal orequitable title, was entitled to recover if he was not forced to plead or rely on an illegality, even although it transpired thatthe title on which he relied was acquired in the course of carrying through an illegal transaction; that in the circumstances, byshowing that she had contributed to the purchase price of the property and that there was a common understanding between the partiesthat they owned the property equally, the defendant had established a resulting trust; that there was no necessity to prove the reasonfor conveyance into the sole name of the plaintiff, which was irrelevant to the defendantâs claim, and that since there was noevidence to rebut the presumption of a resulting trust the defendant was entitled to succeed on her counterclaim.  Lord Browne-Wilkinsonstated at 371 F-H that :</p>          <p class="quote">âWhere the presumption of resulting trust applies, the plaintiff does not have to rely on the illegality.  If he proves that theproperty is vested in the defendant alone but the plaintiff provided part of the purchase money, or voluntarily transferred the propertyto the defendant, the plaintiff establishes his claim under a resulting trust unless either the contrary presumption of advancementdisplaces the presumption of resulting trust.  Therefore, in cases where the presumption of advancement does not apply, a plaintiffcan establish his equitable interest in the property without relying in any way on the underlying illegal transaction.â</p>      <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> In <i>Tribe v.

Tribe</i> ought to be applied in the present case, in view of the defendant further perpetrating the fraud against the CIR in his letter dated3 October 1983.  I am afraid I shall not delve into this interesting topic as I reject the defendantâs evidence that his letterto the CIR did not state the true position, just as I reject his evidence on the provision of the entire purchase price of the Property.</p> <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The defendantâs allegation that by adding the deceased name as a joint owner would save the Property from being frozen pendingthe payment of estate duty is ludicrous.  He agreed that his friend who gave him this advice did not know any law, and he did notknow whether the Property would be frozen if there were two owners, or whether it would also be frozen if the deceased were to diefirst, yet he never sought the advice conveniently available from the solicitor who acted for him in the purchase of the Property. His explanation that the solicitor only knew how to collect money is simply incredible. </p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The defendant said the deceased had no money for the purchase because he was a spendthrift and often had to borrow money from him. If so, why would he trust the deceased to make him a trustee of the Property?  Further, he told the CIR that he had borrowed $80,000from the deceased to purchase another property.  True that related to a later period in 1983, but it was contrary to the pictureof the deceasedâs spendthrift and impecuniosities the defendant was trying to paint.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The defendant said he was in no hurry to get the half share back from the defendant in 1982 because he feared his mother might objectto his wife holding valuable property of the family.  Yet, he had given his wife 400 shares in the Company in 1974, and he had purchasedanother property jointly with her in 1979.  He said the deceased stole the mortgage instalment receipts inside two boxes which heldtitle documents, yet somehow he still retained the sale and purchase agreement and a photocopy deposit receipt.</p> <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  As to receipt of rent by the deceased before November 1991, Mr. Yin submitted that the payment vouchers were not rental receipts. Mr. William Li of the auditors said that the function of the payment voucher was only to record how an item of expenditure is tobe classified in the Companyâs books.  The fact that the deceased had also signed on the payment vouchers only made it a receipt,not necessarily rental receipt.  The single payment voucher dated 9 November 1989 which referred to payment of rent of the Propertyto the deceased was but an aberration.</p> <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mr. Yin also pointed out that the payment vouchers were not always in amount of $7,500 or multiples or factors of $7,500, and mightnot relate to the payment of half of the rent.  Be that as it may, the defendant did not deny that $7,500 were paid to the deceasedmonthly.  The only dispute was whether it was rent or a personal subsidy.  On this point, I totally reject the evidence of the defendantand his wife.</p>  <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The defendant and Madam Cheungâs evidence of the use of Rent Account for cash purchases by the staff before 1993 was contrivedand convoluted.  I cannot imagine the amount of cash purchases of the Company would be artificially limited by the amount of unwithdrawnrent at any time.  It is even more incredible that after her emigration to Canada, Madam Cheung told the clerk to continue to bookrent for the Property between 1993 and 1998 without the knowledge of the defendant,</p>   <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The defendant said according to his understanding at the time, there was no payment of rent since 1993.  Then as far as the defendantwas concerned, cash purchases could not be charged against the Rent Account any more.  When being asked what account would be usedinstead, the defendant could only say that no account was necessary. </p> <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  On the other hand, given the defendantâs understanding that no rent was charged and the practice of charging cash purchases againstthe Rent Account had ceased in 1994, the Rent Account would have been saddled with undistributed rent (as rent was actually charged). When being asked where the rent from 1993 to 1998 had gone while there was no withdrawal nor contra entries against the Rent Account,again, the defendant could only say his wife would know.</p> <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Madam Cheung said she put the defendantâs initials on the payment vouchers in order to satisfy the auditorâs query that theywere not properly approved.  What is the credibility of one who could do such a thing?  I find that she is simply trying to shieldthe defendant from the fact that he actually knew and approved of the payment of $7,500 to the deceased out of the Companyâs RentAccount.  I reject her evidence on this point and find to the contrary.</p>   <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  I find that the payment voucher dated 9 November 1989 was an accurate record of what it stated : âRent â KM Tong Rent for 3/FâDâ (May to September) $37,500â.  Although this was the only voucher which connected the deceased to payment of rent of theProperty, I am satisfied that the other vouchers were in the same vein.  I find that the deceased did receive half of the rent paidby the Company for the Property up to October 1991.  The payment of rent to the deceased by the Company was with the knowledge andapproval of the defendant.</p>   <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  All in all, I disbelieve the defendant and his wife.  They are using each other as excuses for lies they each told.  I reject thedefendantâs evidence that he had provided all the purchase money of the Property and that there was a common intention that thedeceased would hold the half share in trust for him.  I find that the deceased was a beneficial owner of the half share of the Property,and he received $7,500 as rent from the Property before 11 November 1991.</p>    <p class="heading">Payment of rent by the Company after November 1991</p>  <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The first issue was whether there was one joint letting after November 1991. </p> <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Mr. Chan referred to Woodfallâs Law of Landlord and Tenant (Release 21) at 2.102 that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âEach tenant in common could at common law make a lease in respect of his own share alone, the interest of each being separate anddistinct, and if tenants in common all joined in one lease it operated as a lease by each of his respective share, and a confirmationby each as to the shares of the others.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p>He contended that all along, the letting to the Company was a joint letting by the deceased and the defendant. </p>  <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr. Yin submitted that even if the deceased did receive rent of $7,500 per month from the Company before November 1991, it did notnecessarily mean that there was a joint letting by the deceased and the defendant either before or as from November 1991.</p>   <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Mr. Yin referred to <i>Jacobs v. Seward</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281872%29%205%20HL%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1872) 5 L.R.H.L. 464</a> as an illustration that tenants in common could lease their respective share of the land without reference or even knowledge of eachother.  By reason of the unity of possession of the tenancy in common, the lessee is entitled to occupy the entire property.  Asa general proposition, I agree.  But the position must be viewed against the circumstances of the case.</p>   <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> The Property was let to the Factory ever since it was first occupied.  The deceased and the defendant were partners of the Factory. Then it was let to the Company, and they were the two permanent directors of the Company.  Since 1984, the deceased also workedfor the Company at the Property.  At the relevant time, the rent paid by the Company was $15,000 per month.  I have already foundthe deceased received the rent of $7,500 per month.  The only reasonable inference is that there was one joint letting and the deceasedreceived half of the rent.</p>   <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  The defendantâs only evidence of any change in the letting was that the Company had ceased renting the Property since 1993.  This is contrary to the audited accounts of the Company.  The effect of Madam Cheungâs evidence was that she just continued tobook the same (and revised) rent from 1993 to 1998 without the defendantâs knowledge.   I reject their evidence.  I find that theCompany was paying rent for the Property from November 1991 to the end of 1998 at the least. </p> <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  The next issue is whether the rent paid by the Company from November 1991 to 1998 covered the half share of the Property of thedeceased.  Notwithstanding that the deceased no longer worked for the Company, his shareholding and permanent directorship of theCompany remained unchanged.  There is no documentary evidence of the Company as to any change of letting.  The only reasonable inferenceis that the previous joint letting arrangement continued save that the deceased was not paid his half share of the rent after 11November 1991.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Mr. Yin referred to the letter of the solicitors for the deceased dated 1 April 1993, giving notice to the Company that the halfof the rentals of the Property payable to the deceased would be increased from $7,500 to $12,000 per month with effect from 1 May1993.  Mr. Yin submitted that this indicated there were separate instead of joint letting.  In the light of all the evidence, I donot find those letters casting any doubt on my conclusion on joint letting.</p> <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> The next issue is the amount of rent for 1996 and 1997.  Madam Cheung said it was $180,000 (i.e. $15,000 per month) as in 1991 and1992, as opposed to $216,000 (i.e. $18,000 per month) for 1994, 1995 and 1998.   She said that was due to fluctuations in the rentalmarket.  I reject the evidence of Madam Cheung and infer that the rent for 1996 and 1997 was $18,000 per month.</p> <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  The next issue is whether the Company was paying rent for the Property from 1999 onwards.  The defendant said the production ofthe Company stopped in 1993, and since then, the Property was only of limited use: as the registered office for the Company, storagefor unused items and unremoved shelves, and toilet for the staff.  The minutes of the EGM held on 3 January 2000 stated that thebusiness had slowed down, but not stopped.  The defendant explained that the business referred to was Woo Hing, not the Company.  It was not so stated in the minutes.  In any case, Woo Hing belonged to the defendant and Madam Cheung.  The deceased and the othershareholders had no interest in it.  I reject the evidence of the defendant that the Companyâs production ceased in 1993. </p> <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The registered office of the Company is still at the Property.  I find that that Company is still occupying the Property now, atleast to the same limited extent as in 1993 to 1998 as alleged by the defendant himself.</p>   <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Although there were no written tenancy agreement, the use of the Property was stated in writing in the Companyâs audited accountsup to 1998.  If there were any change in the position thereafter, the matter should be stated in the 1999 accounts.  The defendanthad access to the unaudited accounts for 1999.  He could have produced the accounts to rebut the payment of rent if that was thecase.  As for the subsequent years, as the Company is still in existence, there ought to be some accounts, at least for the shareholders. Since the defendant chose not to disclose the 1999 unaudited accounts or any other accounting documents, an adverse inference ismore readily drawn against him.  Hence, I infer that the Company is still paying the same rent as in 1998.</p>    <p class="heading">Finding of facts</p>   <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> On the accepted evidence, I find that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)          The deceased was a beneficial owner of the half share of the Property;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)          There was a joint letting of the Property to the Company prior to November 1991 whereby the deceased received half shareof the rent;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)          After November 1991, the joint letting continued;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)          The Company was and is in continued occupation of the Property since 11 November 1991;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)          The Company was and is continuing to pay rent for the Property since 11 November 1991;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)          The rent for 1996 and 1997 were $18,000 per month;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7)          The rent from 1999 onwards is $18,000 per month;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(8)          The deceasedâs half share of the rent since 11 November 1991 was received by the defendant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Equitable Accounting</p>   <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  The position of joint tenant or tenant in common at common law is stated in Sir Edward Cokeâs commentary On Littleton (1823) at172a and 200b, as cited in <i>Henderson v.

This statute was repealed by the Law of Property (Amendment) Act 1924, section 10.  The statutewas originally applied in Hong Kong by section 3 of the Supreme Court Ordinance 1844.  However, it was repealed in 1966 by non-adoptionunder the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/88" class="autolink_findacts">Application of English Law Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/88">Cap. 88</a>). </p>  <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Mr. Chan submitted that even without the Statute of Anne, there has always been a duty to account as between co-owners in equity. He relied on <i>Strelly v.

On appeal, Turner LJ said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt was clear from the case decided before the statute of Anne, and from <i>Turner v. Morgan</i>, which had been decided subsequently, that a tenant in common always had a remedy in this court against his co-tenant by a bill foraccount.  The only question was on what principle the account should be taken, which question was not now before the Court.â</p>    </blockquote> <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Mr. Yin submitted that the remedy of accounting is an ancillary jurisdiction in equity.  It is either ordered in aid of an equitableright, e.g. an account given by a trustee to a <i>cestui que trust</i>, or ordered in aid of a legal right, e.g. the duty to account by an agent to the principal.  He referred to Snellâs Equity (13<sup>th</sup> ed., 2000) at 44-09 on accounting between co-owners:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(a) <i>Background.</i>  Where land is held by several co-tenants they are all, as between themselves, entitled to possession of the whole.  Hence thereis no remedy in trespass again an occupying co-owner unless he has ousted or excluded the other or others.  There is no exclusionif one merely stays away, allowing the other to occupy a house or take all the profits whether by way of rents, crops or minerals. Where one ousts the other or others, he will be liable for an occupation rent.  Where there is no ouster there is no such liabilityin the absence of any contract to pay rent or other assumption of liability.  If a co-tenant was dissatisfied with the situation,his remedy was to apply to the court for an order compelling partition.  From 1868 the court was empowered, in the alternative, toorder a sale of the jointly-owned land.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) <i>Accounting</i>.  A statute of 1705 gave a joint tenant or tenant in common at law a right to an account against the other co-owners where they hadtaken more than their fair share of the rents and profits of the land.  Courts of equity would direct similar inquiries especiallyin the case of beneficiaries under trusts.  More significantly, in partition actions in which court of equity had exclusive jurisdiction,the court would inquire into the position between the co-owners so as to adjust accounts between them consequent on making an orderfor partition or sale.  If it were found that one party was in occupation to the exclusion of the other, the court would direct aninquiry as to the occupation rent to be paid unless it were shown that the party not in occupation could have enjoyed the right tooccupy but chose not to do so voluntarily.  Conversely, if the occupier has expended money in improvements or repairs, the courtwill inquire into the amount of the increased value as a result of such expenditure and give him credit for it.  The increase valueis a charge on the land to be paid out of the proceeds before division, but liability for an occupation rent is personal to the occupyingco-owner and is not chargeable on the purchaser or mortgagee of his share.  The 1925 legislation abolished partition actions andimposed a trust for sale on all form of co-ownership.

Lord Hershell said at p. 186 that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDodson was an owner of this property â the owner of an undivided moiety, it is true, but each owner of an undivided moiety isnone the less truly an owner â and Dodson in collecting those rents and profits collected them in the right which he possessedas a co-owner of the property.  He did not need agency or the appointment of agent to justify him in collecting those rents.  Ifnothing had ever passed between the two co-owners which constituted an authority from the one to act for the other, his right tocollect those rents would not have been one jot or one tittle less than it was.  No doubt an arrangement was come to that these rentswhen collected were to be paid into a bank upon which both the co-owners were to draw, but that was an arrangement that might havebeen put an end to at any time.  It was merely an arrangement which was come to by voluntary agreement between the two co-owners.

(Section 66Gempowers the court to order statutory trusts for sale or partition of property held in co-ownership.)  The plaintiff sought to makethe defendant accountable for an occupation fee, and the defendant sought an allowance in her favour for the expenditure incurredby her.  This raises the question of what rights one co-owner has against another, particularly when one has been in occupation andthe other has not.  Meagher JA (with whom Mahoney JA agreed) summarized the position as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1. Since both joint tenants and tenants in common have joint possession of the land in which they have the estate, it was a settledrule of law that the possession of any one of them was the possession of the other of them, so as (for example) to prevent the statutesof limitation from affecting them; nor did the bare receipt of all the rents and profits by one operate as an ouster of the other:<i>Ford v Grey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281703%29%201%20Salk%20285" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1703) 1 Salk 285</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=91%20ER%20253" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">91 ER 253</a>; 6 Mod 44;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=87%20ER%20807" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">87 ER 807.</a></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2. It follows that, where one co-owner is in occupation and the other not, but there has been no actual ouster or exclusion by theformer of the latter, the law treats the latter simply as someone who has chosen not to exercise his legal right to occupy the land.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">3.

Apart from Statute, in equity the plight of a co-owner not in occupation was little better.  There did not seem to be any actionwhich would render a co-owner in occupation liable to refund any rents received, much less liable for an occupation fee.

So much for rents actually received.  Turning to the liability of a co-owner in occupation to pay an occupation fee, the positionat law is fairly clear.  He was not liable unless he excluded his co-owner, in which case he rendered himself liable in ejectmentand for mesne profits, or if he constituted himself a bailiff, in which event he would be liable in an action of account, like anyother bailiff: <i>In re Tolman's Estate</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%2023%20Tas%20LR%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 23 Tas LR 29</a> at 31; <i>Rees v Rees</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1931%5d%20SASR%2078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1931] SASR 78</a> at 80-81.  Indeed, the whole bias of the law against making a co-owner in occupation liable to account is precisely based on therationale that if such a liability were to exist a co-owner could, by abstaining from entering into occupation, turn his co-ownerinto an involuntary bailiff.  As far as equity is concerned, an occupation fee will be exacted in at least two circumstances: first,in a partition suit (or related litigation): if there has been an exclusion, the tenant in occupation will be charged with an occupationfee: see, for example, <i>Pascoe v Swan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281859%29%2027%20Beav%20508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1859) 27 Beav 508</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=54%20ER%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">54 ER 201:</a> this is an example of equity following the law; and secondly, if the owner in occupation claims an allowance in respect of improvementseffected by him, equity will permit such an allowance only on terms that he is accountable for an occupation fee this is an exampleof he who comes to equity having to do equity: see <i>Teasdale v Sanderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281864%29%2033%20Beav%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1864) 33 Beav 534</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=55%20ER%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">55 ER 476.â</a></p>    </blockquote>  <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  In paragraphs 9 to 14, Meagher JA dealt with the principles relating to the claim of an allowance for improvement and its variationand the set-ff against an occupation fee, and his Lordship continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â15.

This provision is unnecessary.â  The Commissioners were distinguishedlawyers: Mr justice Manning then a judge of this Court and Mr Hector Scott, for long Deputy Crown Solicitor and deeply learned witha reputation for caution and deep research.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In my opinion where one co-owner in any way, either by express agreement or impliedly from conduct, undertook the task of collectingrents on behalf of co-owners and distributing them he was, in Lord Cokeâs expression, a bailiff or in more modern language he actedon behalf of the co-owners and was at all times liable to an action at law for a share, and the effect of the Statute of Anne inthat case was no more than procedural, even though it had a substantive effect in some cases.  In my opinion its repeal has no continuingeffect on procedure, because since 1972 there no longer is any procedure in this Court which could be recognized as an action foraccount at Common Law.  The effect of its repeal on rights of substance, of which Meagher JA spoke so deprecatingly at paragraph8, is not an effect which relates to the rights of the present parties.  Neither the Statue of Anne nor its repeal had any effecton equitable claims.â</p>    </blockquote> <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  It is noted that in none of the cases cited by Mr. Chan that the claim for accounting was based simply on the incidence of co-ownership. In <i>Ryan v. Dries</i>, the court was concerned with the quantification of an interest held on resulting trust.  In <i>Hitchins v. Hitchins,</i> the co-owners were in partnership and one managed fund for the other co-owners.  As Bryson J said, the co-owner who in some way undertookthe responsibility was accountable as fiduciary.  The duty to account seems to be grounded on a supposed consent.</p> <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> In <i>Leake v. Cordeaux,</i> an undivided moiety of the estate at Bilsby, Lincolnshire was held by John Taylor, and another undivided moiety was held on trustfor sale for his sister Frances Taylor.  John Taylor was in occupation of the estate and cultivated it for his own benefit.  Theestate was sold by Cordeaux, the trustee by succession.  John Taylor made a claim against the estate of Frances Taylor for moneyexpanded by him for the benefit of the estate.  The plaintiff took out letters of administration <i>de bonis non</i> of the estate of Frances Taylor, and instituted the suit against Cordeaux to pay over the purchase money, so that it might be ascertainedwhat was due to John Taylor for improvement, and that he might be charged with an occupation rent.  Hence, the account was takenwhen the relationship between the tenants in common came to an end, and the position was akin to partition.</p> <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  With due deference to Meagher JA, I adopt his analysis on the duty to account between co-owners for rent received in <i>Forgeard v. Shanahan</i>.  Upon the repeal of the Statute of Anne, a co-owner out of occupation has remedies at law in two situations: damages for occupationrent for ouster, or an account if the other co-owner has rendered himself liable as agent or bailiff.  Agency and ouster aside, theduty to account will arise in partition actions, administration actions, in other cases where there is a fund in court, or wherethe court makes an order for sale as an alternative to partition, or as suggested by Hodgson JA in <i>Ryan v. Dries</i>, an account for a share of rent where one party claims an interest in property by reason of a resulting trust or constructive trust,and the court is asked to quantify that interest.</p>  <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  <i>Strelly v. Winson</i> seems to be in opposite to the mainstream of the authorities.  The statement in <i>Strelly v. Winson</i> that âso where one tenant in common receives all the profits, he shall account in this court as bailiff to the otherâ seems tohave loomed larger than its fact that the part owners of a ship were partners of the venture of the ship. </p> <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Hence, I find that there is no duty to account for rent received by one co-owner arising simply by reason of the incidence of co-ownership.</p> <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  Be that as it may, Mr. Chan submitted that on the facts of this case, an agency should be implied upon the defendant.  I shall considerthis point.</p>    <p class="heading">Agency</p>  <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency (17<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2001) at 2-030 stated that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAgreement between principal and agent may be implied in a case where one party conducted himself towards another in such a waythat it is reasonable for that other to infer from that conduct consent to the agency relationship.â</p>    </blockquote> <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> Mr. Yin submitted that there was no agency between the deceased and the defendant before November 1991 as the Company paid the rentto the deceased directly.  Thereafter, the defendant could not have been an agent as he never consented to it.  On the contrary,he denied that the deceased was either a beneficial owner, or had ever received any rent from the Company.  How then could he betaken to have collected rent on behalf of the deceased?  Further, the deceased wrote to the Company demanding the payment of thearrears of rent, and purportedly to increase the rent for his half share.  These acts were inconsistent with any agency.</p>   <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Mr. Chan submitted there was a joint letting by the deceased and defendant after November 1991 (as actually found by me).  Hence,the Company continued to be liable to pay rent to the deceased.  As from November 1991 to 1998, the Companyâs audited accountsrecorded full payment of the rent on the Property without provision for any arrears due to the deceased.  Hence, as far as the Companywas concerned, the debt to the deceased had been fully discharged.  As a matter of fact, all the rent was received by the defendantsince November 1991.  As the Chairman and majority shareholder and controlling mind of the Company, the defendant must be taken tobe <i>ad idem</i> in knowledge with the Company.  The Company could not have recorded in the accounts that it had made full payment of the rent onthe Property if the defendant had not collected the rent on behalf of the deceased and giving discharge to the Company on behalfof the deceased.  Hence, the deceased cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate, and must be held to have collected the rent asan agent of the deceased.</p>   <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Mr. Yin submitted that even assuming that the deceased accepted the instruction from the Company to pay the deceased, it only madethe defendant an agent of the Company, but not an agent of the deceased.</p>  <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  I agree with the submission of Mr. Chan.  As I have found against the defendant on the resulting trust and personal subsidy of $7,500,the truth is the defendant knew from the beginning that the deceased was a beneficial owner of the half share and the deceased hadbeen receiving half of the rent before November 1991.  He cannot be allowed to gainsay the position otherwise.  Insofar as the defendantwas trying to do so, it must have been his lame excuse to hold on to the rent payable to the deceased.  This evidence must be rejectedas contrary to the truth. </p>  <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  The defendant did not merely accepted the instruction from the Company to pay the deceased.  It had given discharge to the Companyon behalf of the deceased, such that the Company could report in the audited accounts that the rent on the Property was fully paid. Hence, the defendant must be taken to be an agent of the deceased.</p>   <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> Granted that the deceased did write to the Company demanding the arrears and increase of rent.  However, there is nothing inconsistentgiven that he must have regarded the defendant as controlling the Company.</p>   <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Hence, I find that the defendant has been an agent of the deceased in collecting the rent since 11 November 1991.   The defendantis liable to account to the deceased.  However, this is not the end of the matter, because the deceasedâs claim is subject to alimitation period of six years, unless the claim is proprietary as opposed to merely personal in nature.</p>    <p class="heading">Constructive trust</p>   <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  Mr. Chan submitted that the defendant was a constructive trustee in collecting the rent as agent for the deceased.                 </p>  <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  Bowstead &amp; Reynolds <i>ob. cit.</i> at 6-040 deals with when an agent holds for principal as trustee:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>When agent holds for principal as trustee.</b>  The analogy with trust would suggest first, that when an agent holds title to money or other property for his principal, he alwaysdoes so (in situations where the principal does not himself own it) as trustee.  This would often be impractical and has never beenthe rule.  It is perfectly possible for property so held, especially money, to be the agentâs own, and mixed with his own assetssubject only to a duty to transfer or account for it to his principal.  Equally however he may certainly hold as trustee.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Sometimes the answer turns on the contract between principal and agent.  It is clear in this context and in general that the existenceof a contractual relationship of debtor and creditor between the parties does not prevent the existence of a simultaneous trust relationship,or a fiduciary relationship of a less onerous nature involving nevertheless that certain money or property is held on trust.  Thusit may be provided expressly between principal and agent that money received is so held.  At other times the intention to createa trust may be inferred; the matter turns on the objective interpretation, according to general principles, of the intentions ofthe parties.  It is sometimes said that there is a prima facie duty on an agent to keep the principalâs money and property separate;but it may be that even this is overstatedâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>   <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  Insofar as Mr. Chan is relying on a constructive trust to avoid the application of the statue of limitation, it is necessary todistinguish between constructive trust in the true or institutional sense and âconstructive trustâ in the remedial sense.  Aclaim based on the former is proprietary in nature and is not barred by the lapse of time.

The first covers those cases already mentioned, where the defendant, though not expresslyappointed as trustee, has assumed the duties of a trustee by a lawful transaction which was independent of and preceded the breachof trust and is not impeached by the plaintiff.

In the first class of case, however, the constructive trustee really is a trustee.  He does not receive thetrust property in his own right but by a transaction by which both parties intend to create a trust from the outset and which isnot impugned by the plaintiff.

It arises when the defendant is implicated in a fraud.  Equity has always given relief againstfraud by making any person sufficiently implicated in the fraud accountable in equity.  In such a case he is traditionally thoughI think unfortunately described as a constructive trustee and said to be âliable to account as constructive trusteeâ.  Such aperson is not in fact a trustee at all, even though he may be liable to account as if he were.  He never assumes the position ofa trustee, and if he receives the trust property at all it is adversely to the plaintiff by an unlawful transaction which is impugnedby the plaintiff.  In such a case the expressions âconstructive trustâ and âconstructive trusteeâ are misleading, for thereis no trust and usually no possibility of a proprietary remedy; they are ânothing more than a formula for equitable reliefâ:<i>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock (No 3</i>)[1968]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20All%20ER%201073" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 All ER 1073</a> at 1097,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20WLR%201555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 WLR 1555</a> at 1582 per Ungoed-Thomas J.â â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe importance of the distinction between the two categories of constructive trust lies in the application of the statutes of limitation.
