Costs were awarded to the Respondents. The application to Stone J was made under section 85 in Part XII of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap.1</a> (âIGCOâ).  It was only the third time that such an application has been made in Hong Kong.  The Applicant, So Wing Keung,is an investigator with the ICAC.  In this judgment, I shall simply refer to the Applicant as the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> In order to understand the issues arising in this appeal, it is desirable first to set out the factual background.  I take this largelyfrom the judgment of Hartmann J, but would add some observations of my own.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The story begins on 9 July 2004 when a number of persons were arrested by the ICAC for suspected corruption offences under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201" class="autolink_findacts">Prevention of Bribery Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/201">Cap.201</a> (âPOBOâ).  One of the arrested persons agreed to assist the ICAC.  This person was then put into a witness protectionprogramme.  Like the Judge, I shall hereinafter refer to this person simply as the Participant.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The reason for a person like the Participant to be put into a programme is obvious : - he is in the most vulnerable and dangerousof positions.  It is not an exaggeration to say that persons protected under the witness protection programme face not just the possibility(and often the probability) of imminent danger to their well-being and life, but this may continue perhaps for the rest of theirlife.  This should not be lost sight of.  The witness protection programme is governed by statute, namely the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564">Cap.564</a> (âWPOâ).  The following provisions of this Ordinance are of note : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 3</a> establishes the witness protection programme under which the approving authority âarranges for or provides protection and otherassistance for witnesses <u>whose personal safety or well-being may be at risk</u> as a result of being witnesses.â  (emphasis added).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     In deciding whether or not a person (referred to in the Ordinance as a participant) is to be included in the witness protectionprogramme, the approving authority must take into account the perceived danger to the witness : - see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(3).</a>  In other words, all participants in the witness protection programme share at least one characteristic : a perceived danger to theirwell-being.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     As part of the programme, the participant may have to assume a new identity : - see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8(2).</a>  Specific provisions exist as to how the legal rights and obligations of a participant who has assumed a new identity are to be dealtwith : - see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9.</a></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     Heavy penalties (understandably and necessarily) exist against any person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse,discloses information (a) about the identity or location of a person who is or has been a participant or who has been consideredfor inclusion in the witness protection programme or (b) that compromises the security of such a person : - see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17(1).</a>  A contravention of this section attracts a maximum imprisonment of 10 years.  Conviction can only be on indictment.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> As can be seen from the provisions of WPO set out above and as the Judge said, it âis paramount therefore that the identity ofa person in [the witness protection programme] is not allowed to pass into the public domainâ.  Sadly, this is precisely what hashappened in the present case and the instruments by which this was achieved were several newspapers, among them the 1st Respondent. By their actions (on which I shall presently elaborate), the Participantâs name was disclosed to the world at large and thus thispersonâs well-being could thereby well have been put in jeopardy.  This apart, and speaking generally, the publication of the nameof a participant causes the risk of undermining proceedings in train, as well as a danger of debilitating the future efficacy ofwitness protection schemes.  As Mr Gerard McCoy, SC (for the Applicant) asked rhetorically : how could such a thing have happened?</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The Participant was placed in a witness protection programme on 13 July 2004.  That evening, lawyers acting on the instructions ofpeople purporting to have spoken to the Participant, sought access to the Participant.  When this was denied, on the following day,an application for a writ of habeas corpus was made to the Court of First Instance seeking the Participantâs release from ICACcustody.  This application was heard by Hartmann J on 16 July 2004.  He dismissed the application âbeing satisfied that the Participantwas not in any form of custody nor was [the Participant] being in any way held against [the Participantâs] willâ.  A questionmark thus arose in relation to the motives of those persons who had purportedly instigated the habeas corpus proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Details of the habeas corpus proceedings (which at one stage involved the Court of Appeal) were reported in the press, this notwithstandingthat many of the relevant hearings were either in Chambers or in camera.  As far as the 1st Respondent was concerned, newspaper reportssurfaced on each of 14, 15 and 16 July 2004.  We have had the relevant reports in the Sing Tao Daily included in the appeal bundlebefore us.  Apart from identifying the relevant company which was at the centre of the investigation by the ICAC, the Participantwas specifically named.  Her full name was given.  Not only that, the Participantâs age, position within the company, area of residenceand even the name of her friend were disclosed, as was the fact that the Participant was in a witness protection programme.  Theirony of these disclosures is that the article in the 16 July 2004 edition actually referred to the bar against disclosure of thename of a person in the witness protection programme.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The Court of Appeal, to which one aspect in the habeas corpus proceedings was referred, was so concerned about the press coverageto which I have referred that it convened a hearing to convey its concern and to hear counsel.  Having heard counsel, the Court requestedthe Secretary for Justice to look into the matter and consider what appropriate action was merited.  The next day, further reportsappeared in the press which repeated the fact that the Participant was in the witness protection programme.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The result of this were the investigations of the ICAC that form the immediate background to the search warrants issued by StoneJ.  Two suggested arrestable offences were involved.  Hartmann J identified the offences and also said as follows : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â16.        First, the ICAC was concerned that certain persons may have contravened <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564" class="autolink_findacts">Witness Protection Ordinance</a> by revealing the identity of the participant. The clearest evidence of this lay in the published stories themselves. But the ICACconsidered it necessary to ascertain not only which journalists had played a role in the publication of the news stories and theirdegree of involvement but who had disclosed forbidden information to those journalists.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">17.         Second, the ICAC was concerned that certain persons may have pursued the <em>habeas corpus</em> application not for the <em>bona fide</em> purpose of seeking the release of the participant from what they believed to be her unlawful detention but instead for the sinisterpurpose of intimidating the participant and thereby dissuading her from acting as a prosecution witness. If that was shown to havehappened, it would constitute a conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice, one aspect of that conspiracy being the leakingof information concerning the identity of the participant to the press.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">18.         I pause at this juncture to record that the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> was described more than two centuries ago as 'that noble badge of liberty which every subject ... wears'. Many say that it is oneof the greatest creations of the common law, a shield from unlawful executive detention that is strapped to the arm of every subjectfrom the most humble to the most grand. In my judgment, it cannot be disputed that it must overwhelmingly be in the public interestto prevent its perversion for criminal ends. Certainly, it was an issue which caused Stone J the deepest concern.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">19.         Having said that, it is to be emphasised that, when the application for the issue of the search warrants was made, counselfor the ICAC assured Stone J that no suggestion was being made that the newspapers themselves had in any way knowingly been complicitin a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice of the kind I have described. The verbatim transcript of the hearing makes thatplain. It was conceded by counsel that, if there had been such a conspiracy, the press itself had been unwittingly used.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The following points arising from these passages are of note : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The two suggested offences identified by the Judge  - which I shall call the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> offence and the conspiracy to pervert the course of justice â are connected to one another.  Aspects of the conspiracy to pervertthe course of justice offence included the leaking of information concerning the Participant to the press, the motives for this andthe persons responsible for it.  These were precisely those aspects which the Judge regarded as being what the ICAC considered necessaryto ascertain in relation to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> offence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     Both the Judge and Stone J regarded as extremely serious the possible use of habeas corpus proceedings (and, I might add,of the press) for criminal ends.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     The concession by counsel for the ICAC at the hearing before Stone J that the newspapers were not complicit in the conspiracyto pervert the course of justice offence, meant only that they were not suspected of âknowinglyâ being complicit.  In other words,they had been âunwittingly [to the newspapers, that is] usedâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> With the above background, I now turn to the obtaining of the search warrants by the ICAC from Stone J and the subsequent hearingbefore Hartmann J.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The relevant statutory provisions</b></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> For the sake of convenience, I now set out some statutory provisions and Rules of the High Court that will have to be consideredin this appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> <u><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap.1</a> (âIGCOâ)</u></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>82.

We have read the transcript of the proceedings (although this has not been madeavailable to the parties).  With respect to Stone J, he conducted an extremely thorough examination of the ICACâs application,frequently asking very searching questions and demonstrating the need to tread very carefully given the nature of the applicationbefore him (search warrants to search journalistsâ premises and seize journalistic material).  Hartmann J described the hearingbefore Stone J as being ârobust and lengthyâ, âlong and arduousâ.  In the end, he issued the search warrants despite beingâdrawn reluctantlyâ to this determination, but would not allow the ICAC immediate access to any materials that might be seizedthereunder.  He ordered that any seized materials be sealed in compliance with section 85(6) IGCO.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> I should mention that the basis for the ICACâs application for the search warrants was contained in an affirmation of the Applicant,who, as identified above, was an investigator with the ICAC.  This affirmation, running to some 13 pages and 36 paragraphs, was describedby Hartmann J as âcertainly no standard format documentâ and âpainstaking in its detailâ.  It was not in the agreed bundleused in the present appeal since, according to the Applicant, public interest immunity attached to it.  For reasons that I will elaborateon below, this Court has read the affirmation for itself  even though the parties could not refer to it (and in the Respondentsâcase, they had not even seen it).</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> On 24 July 2004, the two search warrants were executed by the ICAC on the relevant premises and various materials were seized and,following Stone Jâs direction to this effect, sealed.  We have been told that execution followed a refusal voluntarily to handover the material.  It was subsequent to this search and seizure that the Respondents moved to set aside the search warrants.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The hearing before Hartmann J and the judgment below</b></p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> By a summons dated 27 July 2004, within three days of the seizure, the Respondents applied under RHC O.32 r.6, O.118 r.5 and theCourtâs inherent jurisdiction to set aside the search warrants and for the return of the journalistic materials seized by the ICAC. The grounds for setting aside were that the requirements under section 85(3) and/or (5) had not been met.  The grounds in supportof the application for the return of the seized materials (under section 87 IGCO) were that (a) it was unnecessary for the ICAC tohave proceeded under section 85 IGCO (when a less intrusive way was open to them, namely an application under section 84); and (b)the seized materials were neither valuable nor relevant to the investigation of arrestable offences and in the circumstances, itwas not in the public interest that they should be permitted to be used by the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The hearing of the application took place before Hartmann J on 2 and 4 August 2004.  In his judgment handed down on 10 August 2004,he set aside the search warrants under O.32 r.6.  In the light of this, he considered it unnecessary to make a decision in relationto the application for the return of the materials under section 87 IGCO.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The Judge arrived at this decision essentially for the following reasons : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     He held that he had the necessary jurisdiction under O.32 r.6 to hear and determine the summons to set aside Stone Jâs issueof the search warrants.  The Judge was of the view that the decision of Stone J to issue the warrants was an âorderâ in civilproceedings to which O.32 r.6 applied.  In adopting this reasoning, Hartmann J rejected the ICACâs contention that as the issueof search warrants was a âcriminal proceeding inherent to the criminal investigative processâ, that order had no application. The Judge was of the view that notwithstanding the fact that proceedings governed by O.118 were criminal proceedings, the Rulesof the High Court (including therefore O.1 r.6) applied to such proceedings by reason of O.1 r.2(3).  He derived support in his viewfrom the obiter remarks of Keith JA in <i>Apple Daily Ltd. v Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20HKLRD%20647" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 HKLRD 647</a>, at 657A-658H.  Neither of the other members of the court (Chan CJHC and Nazareth VP) dealt with this point.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     Having assumed jurisdiction, the Judge then examined the material before him to determine whether the requirements of section85 IGCO had been met.  He had before him the affirmation that had been used by the ICAC before Stone J even though, by reason ofpublic interest immunity, it could not be revealed to the Respondents.  He also looked at the transcript of the hearing before StoneJ although the parties before him did not.  The Judge reached the conclusion that on the materials before him, the ICAC had not madeout a sufficient case for search warrants to be issued under section 85 IGCO.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     In arriving at the conclusion that the ICAC had not made out a case under section 85, the Judge referred to the requirementsof that provision and also to various legal principles.  He suggested 7 legal principles governing section 85 applications : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â65.  In so far as they apply to <em>ex parte</em> applications for the issue of warrants to search for and seize 'excluded' or 'special procedure' material, the English authoritiesestablish the principles which I set out below. As I have indicated earlier in this judgment, I am of the view that these principlesapply equally to applications made to our courts for the issue of search warrants pursuant to s.85 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> of the Ordinance. The principles may be summarised as follows :</p>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(i)      An application for a search warrant constitutes a serious intrusion upon the freedom of the press. The responsibility forensuring that the procedure is not abused lies with the courts and it is of cardinal importance that judges should be scrupulousin discharging that responsibility. See <em>R v. Maidstone Crown Court, ex parte Waitt</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20Crim%20LR%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] Crim LR 384.</a></p>            </blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(ii)     The issue of a search warrant constitutes the exercise of a draconian power and it is therefore for the judge to satisfyhimself that there are reasonable grounds for believing the various matters set out in the supporting affidavit. The fact that aninvestigating officer, who has been investigating the matter, states in the affidavit that he considers that there are reasonablegrounds is not enough. The judge must himself be satisfied. See <em>R v. Southampton Crown Court, ex parte J and P</em> (unreported) CO/1421/1992-Lexis Transcript, page 17, citing with approval the observations of Parker LJ in <em>R v.

All the circumstances of the individual application must be taken into account,including, for example, the seriousness of the matter being investigated, the evidence already available to the police to found aprosecution based on it, and the extent to which the solicitor has already been put on notice of interest on his affairs such asmight have caused him to hide or destroy or otherwise interfere with incriminating documents.â</p>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">(v)     The risk that journalistic material may be hidden or destroyed must be a 'real risk', which is the phrase I prefer, or, asthe court accepted in <em>R v. Leeds Crown Court, ex parte Switlaski</em> (unreported) CO/1322/89-Lexis Transcript, should amount to a 'substantial probability'. A judge should not issue a warrant unlessmaterial is placed before him demonstrating that in the particular case, if notice is given, there is a real risk, as opposed toa mere possibility, that the journalistic material will be hidden or destroyed. See, for example, <em>R v. Central Criminal Court, ex parte Propend Finance Property Ltd &amp; Another</em> [1996] 2 Cr.App.R.26 at 30 :</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <p class="quote">â... the Commonwealth of Australia is prepared to consent to an order of <em>certiorari</em> quashing the issue of the warrants, and no party now before the court contends that they were rightly issued. The principal reasonwhy this is accepted, and the only aspect of the grounds into which we need travel at all, is that this was not a proper case foran order to be made <em>ex parte.</em> That is because, in essence, there was no material placed before the learned judge which was capable of demonstrating that therewas any risk that, if served with an <em>inter partes</em> notice, either the solicitors or the accountants would have so misbehaved as to destroy all the documents ... In effect, Judge GoddardQ.C. had nothing but the assertion of a long-standing association between the clients and the firms as a basis upon which to issuean <em>ex parte</em> order.

This was held by Hartmann J to be a failure to make fulland frank disclosure, although not a deliberate one.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     On the facts, the Judge took the view that it had simply not been demonstrated by the ICAC that there was a real risk of theRespondents destroying the journalistic materials sought in the investigation.

In order to resolve this question, it is necessaryto determine whether the proceedings before Hartmann J were civil, failing which whether <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(3)</a> of the HCO can confer jurisdiction.  (<b>Issue 1 </b><b>: The jurisdiction of this Court to hear the appeal</b>).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     Mr Philip Dykes, SC (for the Respondents) also submitted that the present appeal was in any event academic and therefore shouldnot be entertained for that reason as well.  The basis for this submission was that all the materials that were seized during thesearches made by the ICAC under the search warrants have now been made available to them.  Accordingly, Mr Dykes submitted, thereis nothing to be gained whichever way the present appeal was decided.  (<b>Issue 2 : Is the appeal academic?</b>)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     On the assumption that the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to hear the present appeal and that it was not academic to doso, Mr McCoy argued that Hartmann J was wrong, both in law and fact, to decide the matter as he did.

This was also how both parties treated itwhen the Notice of Appeal and Respondentsâ Notice was served.  However, the day before the hearing began on 8 September 2004, MrDykes served a skeleton submission in which the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the present appeal was questioned.</p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Mr Dykesâ arguments were basically as follows : -    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13(2)</a> HCO sets out the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear appeals in civil matters.  As <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(2)(a)</a> states, the civil jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is to hear appeals from any judgment or order of the Court of First Instancein any âcivil cause or matterâ.  In order to determine whether or not a judgment or order of the Court of First Instance wasmade in a civil cause or matter, one had to look at the nature and substance of the matter underlying the particular judgment ororder under appeal.  Reliance was here placed on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Attorney General v Alick Au Shui-yuen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20HKLR%2088" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 HKLR 88</a> and that of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Bonalumi v Secretary of State for the Home Department and another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%201%20All%20ER%20797" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 1 All ER 797.</a>  Accordingly, if the nature and substance of the matter underlying the decision sought to be appealed from, was criminal rather thancivil, then it was to the criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal that one had to look in order to found jurisdiction.  Thecriminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is of course set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(3)</a> of the HCO.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     The application made by the ICAC for search warrants under section 85 of the IGCO were essentially criminal proceedings. So were the proceedings before Hartmann J in which the Respondents sought to set aside the issue of the search warrants.  Both proceedingsconcerned the investigation into alleged crimes and were therefore quite clearly criminal in nature.  Mr Dykes referred to <i>George Tan Soon-gin v His Honour Judge Cameron and Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20HKLR%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 HKLR 149 (Court</a> of Appeal) and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20AC%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 AC 205 (Judicial</a> Committee of the Privy Council), where it was held that an application for judicial review made in the context of underlying criminalproceedings could not give rise to any appeal to the Court of Appeal since it was not a civil cause or matter.  He also referredto the decision of the Canadian Supreme Court in <i>Knox Contracting Ltd v The Queen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2058%20CCC%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 58 CCC 65</a>, in which it was held that proceedings for the issue of a search warrant were criminal in nature.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     If he were correct in this analysis so far, Mr Dykes submitted that the Court of Appeal simply had no jurisdiction in thepresent case to entertain the appeal, and that remained the case even if the Judge below himself assumed a jurisdiction which hedid not possess.  Nothing in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(3)</a> gave the Court the necessary jurisdiction and, as the Court of Appeal was a creature of statute whose jurisdiction was clearly setout in the HCO, the absence of an express jurisdiction was fatal.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Mr McCoy countered these arguments in the following way : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     Generally, where the Court of First Instance has acted without jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal had an inherent jurisdictionto set aside the judgment or decision below.  This inherent jurisdiction existed by reason of the Court of Appeal being a superiorcourt of record <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 13(1)</a> HCO).  It had jurisdiction by reason also of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(3)(e)</a> HCO.  Mr McCoy relied on <i>R v Stuchiner</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20HKC%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 HKC 271</a> as an example where this inherent jurisdiction was utilized by the Court of Appeal.  There, Litton VP referred to this court as beingâa superior court of unlimited jurisdictionâ : - see 274F.  <i>Killenny Ltd &amp; Ors v Attorney General</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20HKC%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 HKC 30</a> was also cited to us as an example where the Court of Appeal set aside the order of the court below by reason of an absence of jurisdiction.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     Next, in order to support his contention that the present appeal arose from a decision of the Court of First Instance in acivil cause or matter, Mr McCoy approached the matter from the opposite end.  He tried to persuade us that as the present proceedingswere <u>not</u> criminal proceedings, they must therefore have involved a civil cause or matter.  Here he relied on various speeches in the decisionof the House of Lords in <i>R (McCann and others) v Crown Court at Manchester and another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20AC%20787" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 AC 787.</a>  It was argued that in order for criminal proceedings to exist, there had first to be a formal accusation of a breach of criminallaw (in other words, an information laid or a charge preferred) with the consequence that, if the breach was proved and the proceedingsprosecuted to their conclusion, penal consequences would result : - see the speeches of Lord Steyn at 808 (paragraph 22), Lord Hopeof Craighead at 816-7 (paragraph 54), Lord Hutton at 828-830 (paragraph 93-95).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     Applying this test, Mr McCoy accordingly submitted that the section 85 application for a search warrant involved civil, notcriminal, proceedings.  There was at that stage no formal accusation of a breach of the criminal law (in other words, no chargeswere laid) and the conclusion of the section 85 proceedings did not (and could not) result in the conviction of anyone or the impositionof penal consequences.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     Reference was also made to the obiter observations of Keith JA in <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i> at 658C where he said : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âBut as a matter of principle, I would be surprised if an application for a warrant, whose purpose was to render lawful acts whichwould otherwise amount to <i>civil</i> wrongs, i.e. trespass to land and detinue, would be regarded as an application made in <i>criminal</i> proceedings, simply because the execution of the warrant might result in the discovery of materials which might be used in a criminalprosecution.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>These observations were made to reinforce the view that O.32 r.6 was an available procedure to set aside the search warrant.  Thisaspect will of course be dealt with under Issue 3.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> In my view, this Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the present appeal : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear both civil and criminal appeals is circumscribed by the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/564/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13</a> HCO.  There is no inherent jurisdiction to hear appeals outside of what is prescribed by statute.  This is by no means a startlingproposition.  In <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i>, Silke VP said at 177, âWe are a creature of Statute and we are bound within the confines of the appropriate legislationâ.  Inthe same case in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Lord Mustill, delivering the opinion of the Board, said at 217A-B,âThe Court of Appeal in Hong Kong has both a civil and a criminal jurisdiction, each defined and limited by section 3 of the SupremeCourt Ordinance [now the HCO]â.  This reflects the position in England as well.  We were referred by Mr Dykes to the decision ofthe House of Lords in <i>In re Racal Communications Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20AC%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] AC 374.</a>  Further, in one of the authorities provided to us by Mr McCoy, <i>Taylor and another v Lawrence and another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%20QB%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] QB 528</a>, it was said by Lord Woolf (presiding in that case in a Court of Appeal comprising five judges including the Master of the Rolls)at 538 (paragraph 16) : </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âAccordingly, it is accepted that the Court of Appeal does not have any inherent jurisdiction in respect of appeals from the countycourt but only that which is given by statute.  However, the use of the word âinherentâ in this context means no more than thatthe Court of Appealâs jurisdiction depends on statute and it has no originating jurisdiction.  The position is very much the samein relation to other appeals to the Court of Appeal.  Its jurisdiction is to be determined solely by reference to the relevant statutoryprovisions.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     Notwithstanding the above, does an inherent jurisdiction exist nevertheless giving the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hearappeals in situations not referred to in section 13?  It is not necessary to enter into a discussion of what is meant generally bythe term âinherent jurisdictionâ.  For an erudite discussion of this concept, see the well known article âThe Inherent Jurisdictionof the Courtâ by I H Jacob  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20Current%20Legal%20Problems%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) Current Legal Problems 23.</a>  It is necessary, however, to recognize the limits of the inherent jurisdiction when the jurisdiction of the court is defined bystatute.  Here, there is no room for a court to exercise any jurisdiction to hear a case when its jurisdiction has already been definedby statute.  In other words, where a statutory provision delineates the jurisdiction of a court, that court cannot assume a jurisdictionthat is outside the statutory scheme.  The cases referred to in the previous paragraph (and we are bound by some of them) seem exactlyto confirm this point.  Obviously, the Court will have the full armoury of powers <u>within</u> that jurisdiction to do what is necessary, whether such powers derive from statute or its inherent jurisdiction, but it cannot exercisea jurisdiction it does not have.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     As to Mr McCoyâs point that the Court of Appeal, as a superior court of record, must have an inherent jurisdiction to overturna lower courtâs order or decision if that has been reached without jurisdiction, I do not see any distinction between such a situationand that where it is said that the court below has erred, whether on fact or law.  Quite simply, whether or not the Court of Appealcan hear an appeal from a lower court depends on the wording of the statute that defines its jurisdiction.  As will presently beseen, it has unfortunate consequences in the present case where the Judge has, in my view, himself acted in excess of jurisdiction.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     Although in <i>Stuchiner</i>, Litton VP referred to this Court as a âsuperior court of unlimited jurisdictionâ, it is clear, when that statement is read incontext, that all the Vice-President was saying was that the Court of Appeal had an inherent jurisdiction to do everything necessary<u>within the jurisdiction it already had</u>, even though the statutory rules were silent on the courtâs powers.  As for <i>Killenny</i>, that case is upon analysis no more than an example where the Court of Appeal set aside the decision below which was reached withoutjurisdiction.  There was never any question that the Court of Appeal itself did not possess the requisite jurisdiction to hear theappeal.  It obviously did, since it arose in a civil cause or matter.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     The value of <i>Killenny</i>, rather, is more for the trite proposition that where a court or tribunal does not have the necessary jurisdiction, the parties cannotconsent to jurisdiction being granted.  Nor can it be conferred either by the operation of doctrines such as estoppel or waiver whichmight otherwise prevent a party from asserting his legal rights.  In the present case, it is notable that both sides were contentto treat the present appeal as a civil one and the jurisdiction point was one that was raised late in the day.  I mention this notas a criticism of the Respondents (quite the contrary, as this point is an important one that had to be resolved) but merely to emphasizethe point on jurisdiction discussed so far.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)     The critical question is whether the present appeal is from a judgment or order of the Court of First Instance in a civilcause or matter : - cf section 13(2)(a).  The criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is not engaged, for the subject matterof the present appeal does not fall within any of the provisions of section 13(3)(a) to (d).  Mr McCoy argued that the appeal couldcome within section 13(3)(e) (âany other jurisdiction conferred on it by lawâ) but I think Mr Dykes is correct when he says thatthis relates only to appeals where an express provision to this effect exists in a statute.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7)     The question whether or not an appeal arises from a judgment or order in a civil cause or matter, was expressly dealt within <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i> by both the Court of Appeal and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  The applicable principles from that case can be statedas follows : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     In order to see whether an appeal comes from a judgment or order in a civil cause or matter, one must have regard to the <u>nature</u> of the cause or matter in which the appeal is brought : - see the opinion of Lord Mustill at 221B.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)     The term âcause or matterâ is a reference to the proceedings underlying the particular judgment or order sought to beappealed : - see here <i>Amand v Home Secretary and Minister of Defence of Royal Netherlands Government</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1943%5d%20AC%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1943] AC 147</a> at 159-60 per Lord Wright.  Silke VP in the Court of Appeal in <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i> (in a passage cited with approval by the Privy Council) used the term ârootâ in posing the question whether or not proceedingswere criminal or civil : - see 177.  Thus, in <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i>, where the matter sought to be appealed was a decision of the District Court on an application to stay the prosecution of criminalcharges, it was held that the relevant cause or matter were the underlying criminal proceedings (being the trial of the accused inthat case on various charges).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     Where the nature of a cause or matter is criminal rather than civil, it does not lose this characteristic merely because atone stage or another, techniques are employed which closely resemble those used in civil matters : - see <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i> at 221B-C.  For example, in <i>Alick Au Shui-yuen</i>, the immediate judgment or order sought to be appealed was a decision in judicial review proceedings, although the underlying causeor matter were criminal proceedings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(8)     The above statement of the principles arising from <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i> do not, however, answer the fundamental question, crucial in the present case, as to how one is to determine whether the ânatureâof a cause or matter is civil or criminal.  On one view, the nature of a cause or matter (the underlying proceedings) can <u>only</u> be criminal where (borrowing the words of Lord Wright in <i>Amand</i> at 162) it is one âwhich, if carried to its conclusion, might result in the conviction of the person charged and in a sentenceof some punishmentâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(9)     This view is said to find support from the case of <i>McCann</i> which was heavily relied on by Mr McCoy.  In that case, the House of Lords had to determine whether the making of what were commonlyknown as anti-social behaviour orders under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 were civil or criminal proceedings.  Such orders, madeby magistrates, prohibited persons who have acted in an anti-social way from doing certain things (for example, from entering certainareas of a city).  Anti-social behaviour could include criminal activities but, importantly, not necessarily so.  In addition, themaking of such an order did not involve any criminal sanctions, although the breach of such an order, could.  Instead, what was involvedin the making of such orders was essentially the granting of the civil remedy of an injunction against the anti-social person : -see 806 at paragraph 18.  The House of Lords accordingly held that the making of anti-social orders involved civil, not criminal,proceedings.  It is pertinent to note that the House of Lords had to consider this question in the context of the following provisions: -</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)     First, Article 6 of the European Convention which stipulated a number of requirements for persons charged with criminal offences(such as the presumption of innocence and the right to a public hearing within a reasonable time).</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b)     Secondly, the Civil Evidence Act 1995 and the Magistrates Courts (Hearsay Evidence in Civil Proceedings) Rules 1999 concerningthe use of hearsay evidence.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c)     Thirdly, section 1(1) of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 providing for appeals from the High Court to the House ofLords âin any criminal cause or matterâ.  In arriving at its conclusions, the House of Lords made statements as to what wouldconstitute criminal proceedings or a âcriminal cause or matterâ.  I have already referred to the relevant passages in paragraph30(2) above.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(10)   Attractive though this view (expressed in paragraph (8) above) is, I regret I do not agree with it.  Nor do I think that itwas the intention of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i> to restrict the inquiry as to the nature of the relevant cause or matter in this narrow way.  While no doubt the presence of underlyingcriminal proceedings where the relevant accused faces the possibility of a conviction on a criminal charge and of being punishedfor it, will certainly mean that the âcause or matterâ is criminal and not civil, this I believe merely to be an example (albeita classic one) and not exhaustive.  Further, in my view, the House of Lords in <i>McCann</i>, in those passages already referred to, was not seeking to lay down an exhaustive definition of criminal proceedings or a criminalcause or matter.  These statements were made in the particular context before the House of Lords.  It was expressly recognized thatthe term âcriminal cause or matter â may bear a different meaning when interpreted in the context of the existence of appellatejurisdiction : see the speech of Lord Steyn at 807 (paragraph 21).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(11)   In ascertaining the nature of the underlying cause or matter in which the judgment or order under appeal is brought, one must,I believe, adopt a flexible approach with some degree of commonsense.  The analysis should involve looking at the object and purposeof the relevant cause or matter.  A cause or matter that has as its object or purpose the possible conviction of a person on a criminalcharge is an <i>a fortiori</i> situation where the nature is without doubt criminal, but this is not the only situation.  Where, for example, an order was soughtfor the production of various documents which constituted âspecial procedure materialâ under the terms of the Police and CriminalEvidence Act 1984 (âPACEâ) in order to assist a criminal investigation (these being proceedings similar to those under section84 IGCO), it was held by the English Court of Appeal that these proceedings were a criminal cause or matter for the purpose of section18(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (which barred appeals to the Court of Appeal in relation to any judgment of the High Courtin a âcriminal cause or matterâ) : - see <i>Carr and Others v Atkins</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20QB%20963" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 QB 963.</a>  This was so even where criminal proceedings had not yet begun : - see 968C-E per Lord Donaldson of Lymington.  In the same case,Stephen Brown LJ agreed with the judgment of the Master of the Rolls and added at 971C :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âThe criminal investigation is, in my judgment, the basis of the application in the instant case.  This is undoubtedly, in my view,a criminal cause or matter, and to hold otherwise would render the administration of this Act [PACE] well nigh impracticableâ.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>I pause here to note that <i>Carr and Others v Atkins</i> was one of the authorities referred to by Lord Mustill (without any disapproval) in <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i> : - see 218H-219A.  This lends support to the proposition that the analysis of the nature of a cause or matter was not intended bythe House of Lords to be too narrow in scope.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(12)   In the present case, the judgment or order on appeal before us is that of Hartmann J where he set aside the search warrantsthat had been issued by Stone J under section 85 of IGCO.  The relevant cause or matter here were therefore the underlying section85 proceedings.  Admittedly, there has been no formal accusation of any breach of criminal law and the consequences for the Respondentsof the section 85 application, when carried out to its conclusion, was not their (or indeed, anyone elseâs) conviction.  The onlyconsequence of that application as far as the Respondents are concerned was that search warrants were issued allowing the ICAC tosearch their premises.  No criminal charge may ever be brought.  Yet, as a matter of reality and commonsense, the whole point ofa section 85 application is to further investigations into criminal offences.  There is no other purpose.  Here, it is to be notedthat a section 85 (or for that matter a section 84) application can only be made where there are reasonable grounds for believingthat an arrestable offence has been committed : - see sections 84(3)(a)(i) and 85(3)(a)(i) IGCO.  This is a requisite condition tobe fulfilled.  In <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i> when the matter was before the Appeal Committee of the Court of Final Appeal (where the application for leave was eventually refused),it was stressed in the judgment of Litton NPJ that the search and seizure powers of section 85 had to be seen against section 10C(1)(c)of ICACO which empowered the ICAC to seize and detain material only if there was reason to believe that such material was itselfor contained evidence of an offence under section 10 of that Ordinance.  Moreover, search warrants in general are only issued infurtherance of a criminal investigation.  This has to be contrasted with the position in <i>McCann</i> where the relevant underlying proceedings were the making of anti-social orders which did not <u>necessarily</u> (although it could) involve the investigation of criminal offences or the making of any finding that such offences had been committed. This was evidently an important factor which enabled the House of Lords to reach the view that such orders were civil orders (andconstitutes, in my view, the main distinguishing feature of that case from the present) : - see 808-9 (paragraphs 22-27), 817 (paragraph54), 822-3 (paragraphs 71-72), 829 (paragraph 94).  Accordingly, for these reasons, I am of the view that section 85 proceedingsare criminal in nature and do not constitute a civil cause or matter.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(13)   Statute also strongly supports this conclusion.  During the course of argument, Stock JA referred to the provisions of RHCO.1 r.2(3) which expressly refers to O.118 as applying to criminal proceedings.  Given that O.118 deals solely with applicationsunder Part XII of IGCO for the search and seizure of journalistic material, it follows that applications made under sections 84 and85 IGCO are necessarily criminal proceedings.  In my view, there is no answer to this argument.  Mr McCoy tried to draw a distinctionbetween applications made under section 85 before charges have been laid and such applications being made after charges have beenmade (and therefore criminal proceedings commenced).  However, Part XII of IGCO does not make this distinction.  Further, even ifit were possible for a section 85 application to be made once charges have been laid, an absurdity arises on the ICACâs argumentshere : - it would logically follow that while applications under section 85 made prior to charges being laid would be regarded ascivil proceedings and therefore any decision can be appealed to the Court of Appeal, this radically changes once charges have beenlaid, when such applications under section 85 would presumably be transformed into criminal proceedings with the result that no appealwould be available to the Court of Appeal.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(14)   I accept in the conclusion reached above as to the nature of a section 85 application that this is directly contrary to theobiter views of Keith JA in <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i> at 658 that a section 85 application could not be regarded as having been made in criminal proceedings.  However, we have had thebenefit of extensive argument on this point, unlike in <i>Apple Daily</i> <i>Ltd</i> where no one seems to have raised any question of the Court of Appealâs jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  If the same questionhad been raised and the Court there provided with the assistance that we have, it is doubtful whether the appeal would have beenentertained in that case either.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(15)   Lastly in this context, I would just deal with one minor point that was raised by me during argument, namely, the possibilitywhether jurisdiction could be conferred on this Court by reason of RHC O.1 r.2(3) making the RHC (and therefore O.59) applicableto proceedings under O.118.  On closer analysis, this point is untenable.  O.59 is applicable only where there is jurisdiction tolodge an appeal in the first place (see O.59 r.1).  It does not itself provide any basis for founding jurisdiction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Accordingly, since the proceedings underlying Hartmann Jâs decision were not a civil cause or matter, this Court has no jurisdictionto hear the present appeal.  The only means of appeal would be an appeal to the Court of Final Appeal : - see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 31(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484" class="autolink_findacts">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484">Cap.484</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> This point of jurisdiction having been resolved against the ICAC, the appeal must inevitably be dismissed.  In <i>George Tan Soon-gin</i>, the Court of Appeal, after having decided that it had no jurisdiction nevertheless continued to state its views on the subject matterof the appeal before it.  This caused the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to remark that âany observations concerning themerits of an appeal which should not be before the court must necessarily be extra-judicialâ : - see 221E-F.  Though mindful ofthis, I think it must be accepted that my conclusions on jurisdiction could be wrong.  Therefore, out of completeness and as theother issues I have identified above have been fully argued, I think it worthwhile to state my views on them.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Issue 2 : Is the appeal academic?</b></p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> It is true that the ICAC have now been given access to the seized materials.  However, the present appeal is far from academic, evenas between the parties.  An order for costs in the court below was made against the ICAC and the reversal of this forms a part ofthe Notice of Appeal.  No concession having been made by the Respondents as to costs, it seems to me that, on the assumption theCourt has jurisdiction, this question can only be resolved in the present case by determining the merits of the appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> More important, considering that the outcome and determination of the present appeal involves the examination of provisions thatsingularly affect one of the basic freedoms enshrined in the Basic Law (Article 27 : the freedom of the press), the case is of considerablepublic importance and interest.  Moreover, a number of other newspapers in respect of whom search warrants were also issued, findthemselves in a similar position as the Respondents in the present case and are awaiting the outcome of the present appeal.  In thesecircumstances, there is a very strong case that is made out in the public interest to hear the present appeal : - see here <i>Chit Fai Motors Co Ltd v Commission for Transport</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20HKC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 HKC 465</a>, at 472-3 (paragraph 20(3)) referring to <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p Salem</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20AC%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 AC 450</a>, at 457.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Issue 3 : Jurisdiction to set aside under O.32 r.6 or the inherent jurisdiction</b></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> It is first necessary to outline the statutory scheme under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> of IGCO.

The provisions contained in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> are unique in the sense that while production orders and search warrants are frequently made or issued by the courts in many variedsituations, the search and seizure of journalistic material has been singled out for special consideration.  The reason is perhapsnot difficult to discern : when a fundamental freedom such as the freedom of the press is involved, it was obviously felt necessaryand desirable to set out clearly any qualification or derogation of that freedom.  Journalistic material forms the backbone of thefreedom of the press.  As a general rule, such material must be given the greatest possible protection from seizure or public exposure;otherwise the press may become inhibited in informing the public of matters it is entitled to know.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     However, the protection of journalistic material is of course not absolute either, for sometimes it may be in the public interestthat journalistic material should be seized or exposed.  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> aims to set out the requisite criteria to govern the search and seizure of journalistic material.  There has been no suggestion inthe present appeal that the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> are in any way unconstitutional.  It must therefore be assumed in these circumstances that, for present purposes at least and asfar as these Respondents are concerned, they are within acceptable bounds.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     The first requirement that has to be fulfilled before any search or seizure can take place is that access to journalisticmaterial under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> is restricted only to those persons who are authorized by statute to carry out searches in the first place.  Thus, the police orthe ICAC are able to make the necessary application to court for access to journalistic material.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     Only two means to search and seize journalistic material are provided for under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> : an application under section 84 or one under section 85.  Both can only be made in the context of arrestable (and therefore serious)offences.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     In the case of an application under section 84, the following features are present : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)     The application is made either to a judge of the District Court or of the Court of First Instance.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b)     The Applicant must demonstrate those requirements stipulated in section 84(3).  Of particular note here is the requirementin section 84(3)(c) that other methods of obtaining the material have been tried and failed or that such methods have not been triedbecause they were unlikely to succeed or would be likely seriously to prejudice the investigation.</p>            <p>(c)     Of note also is the public interest the Court must take into account not only under section 84(3)(d) (which is somewhat limited)but also under section 89(2).  These provisions require a court to have a broad view of the public interest in considering whethersuch orders should be made.</p>            <p>(d)     The application is to be made inter partes.  O.118 r.3 states that such applications must be made by way of originating summonsand that there must be a supporting affidavit.  This exemplifies one of the singular features of an application made under this section,namely, that the Respondent has full notice well in advance of just what is sought.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(e)     An order under section 84, once made, requires the journalist or newspaper respondent to produce the journalistic materialsought or to allow the applicant to take it away not later than 7 days from the date of the order or such longer period as may bepermitted by the Court.  In other words, access is not immediate.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(6)     By way of total contrast, a section 85 application has the following features : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)     The application is for a search warrant, not an order to produce as in section 84.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b)     It is made ex parte (see O.118 r.5) to a judge of the District Court or of the Court of First Instance.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c)     It is intended to be acted upon immediately (as indeed are all search warrants).</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(d)     Accordingly, given these characteristics just referred to, the conditions that have to be fulfilled in obtaining a searchwarrant are more stringent than in the case of a production order.  Not only have the conditions set out in section 84(3)(a), (c)and (d)(i) to be fulfilled and also the requirement that before an application under this section is made, there must be approvalfrom a superior officer, the Applicant must fulfil each of the further conditions stipulated in section 85(5).  For present purposes,the important condition is that contained in section 85(5)(c), being that it must be shown that a section 84 application could nothave been made by reason that such an application âmay seriously prejudice the investigationâ.  It should be observed that thisprovision, dealing specifically with the question whether a section 84 application could instead have been made, qualifies the requirementin section 84(3)(c).  It is curious that the term in section 85(5)(c) is âmay seriously prejudice the investigationâ whereasin section 84(3)(c)(ii) the term used is âwould be likely to seriously prejudice the investigationâ.  There may be little differencein practice between the two terms (and certainly in the present case, it makes no difference - see Issue 4 below) but on a plainreading it does suggest that somehow the requirement in section 85(5)(c) is less stringent than that in section 84(3)(c)(ii).</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(e)     Once a search warrant is issued and a search and seizure take place, the Applicant is not entitled to immediate access tothe journalistic material, such material having to be sealed for 3 days pending any application under section 87 of IGCO, unlessthe judge is satisfied that there may be serious prejudice to the investigation if immediate access is denied : - see sections 85(6)and (7).</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(7)     Applications under both section 84 and section 85 require the Court to consider the public interest : section 89(2).  Evenwhere the various stipulated requirements are satisfied, the Court retains a discretion whether or not to grant the application (notethe word âmayâ in section 84(2) and section 85(3)).  In exercising this discretion, the judge must bear in mind the public interest.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(8)     In the context of section 85 applications, section 87 requires careful examination.  It enables a person from whom journalisticmaterial has been seized under a section 85 search warrant to apply to Court for the return for such material.  Although the headingto this subsection refers to âProcedure in relation to sealed materialâ, it applies to all seized journalistic material, sealedor not.  In my view, this provision assumes great importance in the present case in the following respects : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a)     First, it emphasizes the fact that an application under section 85 is made ex parte.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b)     Secondly, while in the normal case, ex parte decisions of the Court are revisited either on the return day (for example, ona summons day) or when the person affected by it applies to set it aside or have it quashed, in the case of a search warrant issuedunder section 85, the procedure for an inter partes hearing is expressly provided for in section 87 itself.  It is difficult to seewhy a specific procedure for an inter partes hearing following the grant of a search warrant under section 85 should be set out inprimary legislation unless it was intended that this was to be the only means by which the ex parte decision could be revisited. While a section 85 search warrant allows search and seizure of journalistic material, a section 87 application is for the returnof that material.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(9)     At a section 87 hearing, the Court has to consider whether it would be in the public interest that the seized material shouldbe made use of for the purpose of the relevant investigation.  This, together with the obligation on the Court to look at the publicinterest in a broad way under section 89(2), permits the Court to look at all the circumstances of the case.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Hartmann J assumed there existed jurisdiction to entertain the Respondentsâ application to set aside the search warrants.  He didso under O.32 r.6.  The Respondents also prayed in aid of the Courtâs inherent jurisdiction.  With respect, I regret not beingable to agree with these approaches : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     It will be clear from the earlier analysis of the statutory scheme under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part XII</a> of the IGCO that a complete, self contained code has been devised to deal with the search and seizure of journalistic material. Detailed provisions exist in IGCO and in O.118 as to the two types of applications which relate to this, covering not only the substantiverequirements which have to be satisfied, but also the procedures governing such applications.  Insofar as section 85 proceedingsare concerned, there is, I believe, no room for the application of O.32 r.6 (or the Courtâs inherent jurisdiction) when there existexpress provisions (contained in section 87) to allow the person affected by a section 85 search warrant to be heard.  It must notbe forgotten that the purpose of a section 85 search warrant is to search for and seize journalistic material.  Section 87 allowsthe affected person effectively to set this aside by obtaining the return of the seized material.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     I of course readily accept that in normal ex parte situations in civil proceedings, the party affected should have a rightto be heard if that party wishes, particularly as ex parte orders are essentially provisional in nature : - see <i>WEA Records Ltd v Visions Channel 4 Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20WLR%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 WLR 721</a>, at 727 D-E.  O.32 r.6 is the statutory embodiment of this right.  Equally, the fact that an ex parte order has been performed providesno reason to prevent the affected person from seeking to overturn its grant.  For example Anton Piller orders may often already havebeen executed before a party seeks to set it aside.  However, a search warrant is quite different in nature.  It is not part of anyongoing process, or part of any lis between two or more parties.  In procedures for the issue and execution of such warrants, occupiershave no right to be told at the stage of the application or before the warrant is executed of the grounds upon which the applicationhas been made or the grounds upon which the warrant has been issued : - see <i>R v IRC ex parte Rossminster</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20952" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 952</a>, 999.  Normally, once a judge has issued a warrant and it has been executed he is then <i>functus officio</i>.  It follows that but for section 87, there would be no right to entertain any application whether it be by way of Order 32, r 6or by any other mechanism, to review the order (if it be an order) by which the warrant had been issued.  So much is clear, if authoritybe needed, from the decision in <i>R v Liverpool Crown Court and another ex parte Wimpey plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20Crim%20LR%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] Crim LR 635</a>, a case in which similar provisions under PACE were examined, and from the full judgment (unreported) of which I take the followingpassages :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â        Mr Leveson on behalf of the Crown submits that the procedure within Schedule 1 is a self-contained procedure which hasa beginning, a middle and an end.  The beginning is an application to the circuit judge; the middle is the hearing of that application,and the end is the order made by the circuit judge.  Although therefore Mr Scrivener in a sense rightly refers to this proceedingas an interlocutory proceeding in the sense that it is a proceeding which is ancillary to a projected criminal trial and is not theoutcome of that trial, Mr Leveson submits that it is, being a self-contained procedure, one which leads within itself to a finalorder, that is to say, the final order made by the judge for the warrant to issue.  It is not open to the parties to come back tothe judge, submits Mr Leveson, to re-open that final order in order to hear further evidence and consider what, if any, alterationhe ought to make.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">         There is a principle which it is important to bear in mind, that proceedings ought to have finality, and, if it were opento parties to challenge an order made by a circuit judge in these circumstances, challenges would almost certainly be made in nearlyevery case and the circuit judge would be faced with a review of his order, conflicting evidence, and having to decide on that evidencematters which might pre-empt the trial of the case in some respects.  Mr Leveson submits that it is not appropriate that there shouldbe a review of that kind.  This does not leave an aggrieved party without a remedy.  The party has the remedy of applying for judicialreview.  That, Mr Leveson submits, is the proper approach.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â¦..</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">         Speaking for myself, I can see the anxiety that is reflected by the submissions made by Mr Scrivener as to what might happenif a judge was persuaded to make an order which was erroneous in some important respect.  He gave, as an example, what would happenif the judge were persuaded in error to make an order in respect of premises which were not in fact the premises that the policereally wanted to examine but they had got the address wrong.  I would have thought that that was an unlikely situation but one thatcould be met on a pragmatic basis, and in any event it could be a matter to be brought before the Divisional Court as swiftly asit could before a circuit judge in most instances.</p>            <p class="quote">         As a matter of principle, it seems to me that this situation provided for in Schedule 1 of the 1984 Act is unlike that whichis to be encountered generally in the jurisdiction of the Crown Court and certainly unlike that to be encountered in the jurisdictionof the High Court on its civil side.  Looking at the scheme of Schedule 1 and the statutory purpose, I have reached the conclusionthat it would not be right for the circuit judge nor would he have any power to entertain an application inter partes to review theorder that he had made ex parte pursuant to paragraph 12 of Schedule 1.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         I should add in relation to PACE that there is no equivalent provision to section 87.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     Of course, in a section 87 application, the Court does not just look at the question whether the issuing of the search warrantswas justified in the first place because it has, as required by section 87(2), to consider whether it would be in the public interestthat the seized material should be made use of for the purpose of a criminal investigation.  This may at times involve a carefulbalancing exercise, with the public interest as the paramount consideration.  For example, the public interest may demand that notwithstandingthe fact that an ex parte order was improperly obtained, the Court may nonetheless consider it appropriate to allow the seized materialto be used, particularly when it is, say, crucial for the detection or prevention of a crime.  On other occasions, the balance maytilt the other way.  Because of the approach that a court is required to adopt under section 87(2), this provides yet another reasonto support the proposition that section 87 provides the only means by which an affected person can challenge the section 85 decision. Otherwise, the Court may find itself in the near impossible situation of having to apply different principles in relation to whatin essence is the same inter partes application.  The present case provides a ready example.  An application under section 87 mustbe made within three days of the seizure (unless extended by the Court).  An application under O.32 r.6 on the other hand, is notso restricted in terms of time.  The fact that in the present case the Respondents made both applications within the 3-day limitis beside the point.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)             In <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i>, Keith JA was of the view that an application to set aside under O.32 r.6 was available to an affected person : - see 657-8.  Thisview was necessarily obiter as the matter was eventually resolved by the Court of Appeal on the facts.  The basis for it seems tohave been two-fold : - first, that it was thought the obtaining of a search warrant under section 85 involved civil proceedings;secondly, Keith JA was particularly concerned that an affected person should have the right to set aside an ex parte order wherethere existed, for example, material non-disclosure or misrepresentation.  As to the first basis, for the reasons set out above inrelation to the question of the jurisdiction of this Court, I am of the view that section 85 proceedings are criminal in nature. As for the second basis, while I instinctively share Keith JAâs concern over any inability of an affected person to be heard inrelation to an ex parte order that has been made against him, this is not a concern in the present case since, for the reasons earlierdiscussed, the remedy made available to a person affected by a section 85 search warrant is to be found in section 87.  Curiously,but significantly, this provision was not referred to by Keith JA in <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i>.  This is quite apart from the point made in paragraph (2) above that a search warrant differs in nature to an ex parte order madein court proceedings.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)             In the present case, in holding that there was jurisdiction to hear the setting aside application under O.32 r.6,the Judge did not examine the importance of section 87 to see how it fitted into the statutory scheme.  Reliance was instead placedon O.1 r.2(3), the dicta of Keith JA in <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i> and a decision of Lugar-Mawson J in <i>X v The Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption</i>, unreported, HCCM 49/2003, 20 October 2003, Court of First Instance.  It is correct that O.1 r.2(3) makes applicable the Rules ofthe High Court to proceedings under Part XII of IGCO, but this must be with the obvious qualification that the Rules are appliedonly insofar as they are applicable.  There are many Rules in the RHC that are simply inapplicable to Part XII proceedings.  Forthe reasons earlier given, O.32 r.6 is one of them.  As for <i>X v Commissioner for the Independent Commission Against Corruption</i>, this case, apart from merely following the dicta of Keith JA in <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i>, concerned O.119 (which deals with applications made under Part III of the POBO).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)             Finally, I ought to mention that none of the foregoing discussion affects the right of a person to claim damages forthe tort of the malicious procurement of a search warrant:- see <i>Brian Gibbs v John Mitchell Rea</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20AC%20786" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] AC 786.</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Before us, interesting arguments were raised by Mr McCoy as to whether a decision to issue a search warrant under section 85 couldconstitute an âorderâ for the purpose of O.32 r.6, and whether it was a judicial act in the first place (in Australia there existsa line of cases suggesting that the issue of a search warrant by a court was merely an administrative act open to judicial review: - see <i>Love v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 307).</a>  I have some doubts as to the soundness of these points.  As to the first, although admittedly the language of section 84 refersto orders of the Court being made and this is absent in section 85, yet section 89(2) uses the terms âorderâ when referring toPart XII proceedings.  It is in any event difficult to see the real difference between a section 84 decision and one under section85 as a matter of substance when both deal with the search and seizure of journalistic material.  As for the second point, whateverthe position in Australia, it is difficult to see how section 84 or section 85 applications can be seen to involve merely administrativeacts, especially given the judicial nature of the procedures involved.  In any event, these points are perhaps peripheral to themain point which is the availability of section 87 as a real (indeed the only) means of setting aside the effects of a section 85search warrant after it has been granted.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> The Judge being wrong to have assumed jurisdiction under O.32 r.6, he ought therefore to have heard only the Respondentsâ applicationunder section 87 of IGCO.  However, as paragraph 72 of his judgment makes clear, he did not deal with this application.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> I now proceed to consider the merits, this being on the assumption that the Judge was correct to assume jurisdiction as he did.</p>    <p><b>Issue 4 :   Was there justification to issue the search warrant in the present case?</b></p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I have already in paragraph 36 above set out the relevant statutory scheme in relation to the issue of search warrants under section85 IGCO.  To this scheme, the Judge superimposed 7 principles which he said could be derived from the English cases.  These principleshave already been set out in paragraph 24(3) above.  Counsel for the ICAC was criticized for not having drawn Stone Jâs attentionto these cases.  Hartmann J was of the view that had the judgeâs attention been drawn to these cases, the outcome would have beenquite different.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> I will presently be embarking on an analysis of these suggested principles and then deal with the question whether on the facts thesearch warrants ought to have been granted in the first place.  In this latter exercise, I do so on the basis that this Court isin at least as good a position as Hartmann J to look at the facts.  There is, moreover, no question of having to disturb a judicialdiscretion here because Hartmann J treated the hearing as a setting aside application under O.32 r.6.  Had he (as I have held heought to have done) conducted a hearing based on section 87, the question of a judicial discretion might well have arisen on appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Before going into the 7 suggested principles, I would like to make some general points : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     First, the Judge said in paragraph 46 of his judgment that the scheme contained in Part XII of IGCO had to be viewed âthroughthe prismâ of Article 27 of the Basic Law guaranteeing the freedom of the press.  This is apt to confuse.  If all that was meantwas that Part XII deals with the permissible limits to the freedom of the press, then I would have no quarrel with this as a proposition. If, however, what was meant was that in approaching Part XII applications, there should be a bias in favour of this basic freedomand to regard that as some sort of paramount consideration, I would disagree.  As I have earlier said, Part XII at the same timeemphasizes the freedom of the press as well as fixes the limits to it.  Part XII itself contains important safeguards to protectthe basic freedom, safeguards which journalists alone enjoy in Hong Kong.  And, it should perhaps be noted, these safeguards (inthe form of those stringent requirements referred to earlier) are more extensive in Hong Kong than in legislation such as PACE. There are, however, limits to it.  If there is any paramount consideration at all, it is the public interest which is mentioned inat least 3 provisions : - sections 84(3)(d), 87(2) and the catch-all section 89(2).  As far as section 84(3)(d)(i), imported by section85(3)(a)(i) is concerned, the public interest to which the Judge is at that stage to have regard is expressly limited to the mattersthere stipulated and is not an open ended public interest condition.

The public interest referred to in sections 87(2) and 89(2) are of course much wider.  The public interest requires the Courtto consider all aspects of any given case, with no bias or predisposition towards any particular factor.  Often, a balancing exercisebetween competing interests is involved.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     The balancing exercise that Part XII focuses on is the freedom of the press seen against the need effectively to investigateand deal with crime.

It requires that careful consideration be given not only to whether a warrant should issue but also to the conditionswhich might properly be imposed upon any search of media premises.</p>            <p class="quote">           Whether the search of a media office can be considered reasonable will depend on a number of factors including the natureof the objects to be seized, the manner in which the search is to be conducted and the degree of urgency of the search.  It is ofparticular importance that the justice of the peace consider the effects of the search and seizure on the ability of the particularmedia organization in question to fulfil its function as a news gatherer and news disseminator.  If a search will impede the mediafrom fulfilling these functions and the impediments cannot reasonably be controlled through the imposition of conditions on the executionof the search warrant, then a warrant should only be issued where a compelling state interest is demonstrated.  This might be accomplishedby satisfying the two factors set out by Nemetz, C.J.B.C. in <i>Pacific Press</i>: namely, that there is no alternative source of information available or, if there is, that reasonable steps have been taken to obtainthe information from that source.  Alternatively, the search might be justified on the grounds of the gravity of the offence underinvestigation and the urgent need to obtain the evidence expected to be revealed by the search.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">           The balancing of interests is always a difficult and delicate task.  In this case, for example, the throwing of Molotovcocktails at a building not only damaged the property but constituted a potential threat to the lives and safety of others.  Theinvestigation of a serious and violent crime was of importance to the state.  Further, in light of the ongoing demonstrations, someurgency in conducting the search must be recognized.  On the other hand, the objects sought to be seized were the product of theresearch and investigation of a media organization.  It was important that the continuing work of the media should not be undulyimpeded.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">           The factors to be weighed with regard to issuing a warrant to search any premises will vary with the circumstances presented. This is as true of searches of media offices as of any other premises.  It seems to me, however, that where the media have fulfilledtheir role by gathering the news and publishing it, there would seem to be less to be said for refusing to make that material availableto the police.  At that point, the media have given to the public, by way of picture or print, evidence of the commission of a crime. The media, like any good citizen, should not be unduly opposed to disclosing to the police the evidence they have gathered withregard to that crime.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     Secondly, it is important to emphasize that neither Part XII nor any other legislation enables the ICAC to exercise any sortof arbitrary power to effect search and seizure of journalistic material.  A search warrant must first be obtained from a judge,who may only grant it upon certain identified, stringent requirements being fulfilled as well as it being in the public interestto issue one.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)     Thirdly, while there is normally no objection in setting out general principles the way the Judge has done in the presentcase, care must be taken not to detract or divert attention from what are the statutory requirements for a section 85 application. As Bingham LJ said in <i>R v Crown Court at Lewes, ex parte Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2093%20Cr%20App%20R%2060" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 93 Cr App R 60</a>, at 65-66 (in a passage cited with approval by the House of Lords in <i>R v Southwark Crown Court ex parte Bowles</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20AC%20641" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] AC 641</a>, at 648) : -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â  The Police and Criminal Evidence Act governs a field in which there are two very obvious public interests.  There is, first ofall, a public interest in the effective investigation and prosecution of crime.  Secondly, there is a public interest in protectingthe personal and property rights of citizens against infringement and invasion.  There is an obvious tension between these two publicinterests because crime could be most effectively investigated and prosecuted if the personal and property rights of citizens couldbe freely overridden and total protection of the personal and property rights of citizens would make investigation and prosecutionof many crimes impossible or virtually so.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">           The 1984 Act seeks to effect a carefully judged balance between these interests and that is why it is a detailed and complexAct.  <i>If the scheme intended by Parliament is to be implemented, it is important that the provisions laid down in the Act should be fullyand fairly enforced.  It would be quite wrong to approach the Act with any preconception as to how these provisions should be operatedsave in so far as such preconception is derived from the legislation itself.</i></p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">           It is, in my judgment, clear that the courts must try to avoid any interpretation which would distort the parliamentaryscheme and so upset the intended balance.  In the present field, the primary duty to give effect to the parliamentary scheme restson circuit judges.  It seems plain that they are required to exercise those powers with great care and caution.  I would prefer tothe observation of Lloyd L.J. in <i>Maidstone Crown Court, ex p. Waitt</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20CrimLR%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] Crim.L.R. 384</a> where he said:</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">âThe special procedure under section 9 and Schedule 1 is a serious inroad upon the liberty of the subject.  The responsibility forensuring that the procedure is not abused lies with circuit judges.  It is of cardinal importance that circuit judges should be scrupulousin discharging that responsibility.ââ (emphasis added)</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7)     Fourthly, the Judge obviously felt that the ICAC had failed in its duty to make full and frank disclosure by its failure todraw Stone Jâs attention to certain English authorities.  It is not clear whether this was by itself enough to set aside the searchwarrants but it can, I think, fairly be assumed that it must have been a factor that influenced Hartmann J.  I should perhaps makeit clear that normally in ex parte applications the duty to make full and frank disclosure applies to facts rather than law.  Thatsaid, the overall duty on the party applying for an ex parte order is to present the case fully and fairly to the judge hearing thematter, whether relating to fact or law.  By âfully and fairlyâ I do not mean that an advocate is expected to deal with everylittle nuance in an application but he must highlight to the Judge the weaknesses in particular in his case, whether in fact or inlaw.  I have found useful in this discussion the remarks of Robert Walker LJ in <i>Memory Corporation Plc and Another v Sidhu (No.2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20WLR%201443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 WLR 1443</a>, at 1454C-1455G.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> With these general remarks in mind, I now proceed to deal with the 7 principles that the Judge suggested and then applied to thefacts of the case.  As stated above, he was firmly of the view that had Stone J applied these principles, the search warrants appliedfor by the ICAC would not have been granted.  I deal with each in turn : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     <u>Principle 1</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         As long as one bears in mind the statutory scheme, the individual requirements contained in Part XII and the considerationof the public interest discussed above, this principle, as a general statement of the obvious, is unobjectionable.  I have no doubtthat Stone J would have had it in mind and from the transcript of the proceedings before him, it is clear that he did.  Stone J hadalso before him the case of <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i>, where at 673J-4, Chan CJHC makes precisely the same point.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     <u>Principle 2</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         This is also a statement of the obvious and of what is required by section 85.  Again, there can be little doubt that StoneJ had this principle in mind.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     <u>Principle 3</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         This principle as stated is liable to mislead.  It seems to suggest that before a section 85 search warrant is sought, asection 84 application ought first be made first or that in most cases, this is the preferred method.  Yet, the legislation itselfmakes no such suggestion or assumption.  Admittedly, it must be shown as a condition of obtaining section 85 relief that the makingof an application under section 84 may seriously prejudice the investigation, but this is the only requirement.  I might perhapsadd here that a factor which may justify a search warrant being issued under section 85 is the fact that the newspaper or journalistis itself or himself the subject of a criminal investigation : - cf <i>R v Leeds Crown Court ex parte Switalski</i>, unreported, 21 December 1990, QBD.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     <u>Principle 4</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         The principle here stated is, with respect, self-evident with emphasis to be placed on the word ânecessarilyâ.  The factthat a journalist is himself or herself a suspect may well suggest that the appropriate route should be a warrant : - see sentimentsto that effect in <i>R v Lewes Crown Court, ex parte Nigel Weller &amp; Co</i>, 12 May 1999, unreported; <i>Attorney General of Quebec v Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</i> 67 ccc (3d) 517, 534.  The important point to remember here however is that there must be flexibility in the way that the Court treatsany particular factor.  Sometimes, it may be a matter of little consequence that the newspaper or journalist is being investigatedfor a crime but on other occasions, it may be decisive.  It simply depends on the relevant circumstances.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     <u>Principle 5</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         It is not helpful for phrases such as âreal riskâ or âsubstantial probabilityâ to apply to what needs to be shownin an affidavit in relation to the destruction or concealment of the journalistic material sought.  Section 85(5)(c) only requiresthat it be shown that a section 84 application âmay seriously prejudice the investigationâ.  In my view, a judge will be perfectlyable to test the evidence before him against these words without the need for additional words which, if anything, may confuse. In any event <i>Switalski</i> cited by the Judge is not support for the proposition the Judge there advances.  The phrase âsubstantial probabilityâ was usedby counsel as descriptive of the likelihood of loss or destruction of material, a suggestion of fact - not of a test in law â withwhich Neill LJ agreed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)     <u>Principle 6</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         While this may reflect good practice, I have difficulties in seeing how in the present case this factor could have influencedStone J one way or the other.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7)     <u>Principle 7</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>         This has already been discussed in paragraph (5) above.  However, again I have difficulties in seeing how this factor couldhave influenced Stone J into making a different decision even if he was somehow unaware of it (which I cannot accept).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> In my view therefore, either these principles were obvious ones having regard to the decision of this Court in <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i>, the express provisions of Part XII of IGCO and as a matter of judicial commonsense, or they require to be qualified.  I should alsomake it clear that I am of the view that counsel before Stone J could not be said to have failed in his duties to the Court in anyway and I take this opportunity to underline this fact.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Nowhere in the judgment does the Judge explain just how the application of these principles would have persuaded Stone J to refuseissuing the search warrants.  Perhaps the Judge thought that by doing so, he might have had to reveal the contents of the affirmationthat was used to support the section 85 application before Stone J.  I know not the reason but would only wish to say that I wouldbe surprised in the extreme if Stone J did not have the relevant principles in mind when approaching the application before him. The length and content of the hearing amply demonstrates this.  The Judge acknowledged also that Stone J was âwell aware of theimportance of interposing himself between the legitimate desires of the ICAC to pursue its investigation and societyâs equallylegitimate requirement to ensure the freedom of the pressâ.  That said, in any event, this Court will now have to look at the factsto see whether the search warrants were properly granted.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> As indicated earlier, this Court has had sight of the affirmation used to support the ICACâs application for the search warrantsunder section 85.  So did Hartmann J.  This affirmation was not made available to the Respondents in the court below by reason ofpublic interest immunity.  In <i>Apple Daily Ltd</i>, the Court of Appeal held that public interest immunity attached to the whole of the affidavit used to support an application fora search warrant under section 85 and they were therefore privileged from disclosure : - see 659E-664C.  This Court is bound by thatdecision on this aspect, forming as it does part of the ratio decidendi of the case.  Mr Dykes cited to us various authorities tosuggest that if public interest immunity attached at all, this could not be automatically applied to the whole document.  It wasnecessary, he contended, to go through each part of the supporting affidavit to see whether public interest immunity attached.  Thesesubmissions, interesting and important though they are, will have to await the decision of the Court of Final Appeal.  I might perhapsadd that even if Mr Dykes were right in his submissions, having read the affirmation in support of the section 85 application, Ithink it is abundantly clear that public interest immunity should attach to the whole of it in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> I have already in paragraphs 3 to 9 above set out the factual background to the application for the search warrants by the ICAC. They reveal, I emphasize, an extremely troubling scenario whereby the well-being or life of the Participant in a witness protectionprogramme may have been put at risk and the integrity of the programme potentially undermined.  At the very least, the Participantâsfurther co-operation in the criminal investigation could have been compromised.  I cannot imagine that any responsible person couldregard this situation as anything other than a serious one.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The critical question on the facts is : was it justified for search warrants to have been issued?  In my judgment, it clearly was: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     Hartmann J was of the view that the only condition that merited consideration was the requirement in section 85(5)(c) thatthe making of a section 84 application âmay seriously prejudiceâ the ICACâs investigation.  He must therefore have acceptedimplicitly that the other conditions were satisfied.  I agree with the Judgeâs analysis in this respect.  Subject to one aspectto which I shall return, Mr Dykes appeared also to be content in this regard.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     Having read the affirmation in support of the ICACâs application, I find myself in no doubt whatsoever that had the ICACmade a section 84 application, this may have (if not would have) seriously prejudiced their investigations.  Although it is not appropriateto reveal the contents of the affirmation, I can, however, highlight some of the factual aspects of the case already dealt with inparagraphs 3 to 9 above.  One aspect of the suspected conspiracy to pervert the course of justice offence was the possibility thatthe leaking of information concerning the Participant to the press may have been for motives which may not be innocent or inadvertent. The leaking of information to the press had the effect, desired or not, of revealing the identity of the Participant, thus potentiallyputting the well-being of this person at risk and possibly â one knows not â of undermining her willingness to continue withsuch co-operation as she may wish to render.  The 1st Respondent, like some other newspapers, published in great detail the identityof the Participant.  If there has been a conspiracy, then it would follow that these newspapers were vehicles for it and became themselvesthe target of investigations in relation to section 17 of the WPO.  I have earlier referred to the concession by counsel for theICAC in the hearing before Stone J that the newspapers have not âknowinglyâ been complicit in the alleged conspiracy.  At mostthey had been âunwittinglyâ used.  There is no reason to think otherwise on the evidence before this Court but the fact remainsthat the press has been used in a potentially most damaging way to the Participant as part of a suspected conspiracy to pervert thecourse of justice.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     Hartmann J regarded it determinative of the application the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that there was a realrisk of the Respondents destroying or concealing the journalistic material, if they had been pre-warned of the ICACâs wish to seethat material.  He failed âutterlyâ to see how this was or could be demonstrated on the facts.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)     With respect to the Judge, I think he has taken too narrow a view of the matter.  Those factual aspects I have just set outwere before the Judge and they revealed as I have said a very disturbing state of affairs not to mention the possibility of veryserious criminal offences having been committed.  Given the link between the newspaper (and their journalists) and those personswho supplied the information about the Participant to them, the Judge ought to have gone on to consider the very real possibilitythat had a section 84 application been made or the newspaper had otherwise been informed of the ICACâs wish to investigate thesuspected perpetrators of the alleged conspiracy, those very people would or might well then have been alerted by the newspapersor journalists, perhaps quite innocently, to the fact that the authorities were onto them.  It may here be observed that once a section84 application is made, there is nothing in the relevant statutory provisions to prevent a journalist from revealing this fact orthe information used to support it to colleagues, friends, his readers or to the sources themselves.  Further, and importantly, byreason of the requirement to serve on the other party the supporting evidence when making a section 84 application (see O.118 r.3),the Respondents would also have been alerted to the state of the investigation with all its details, with the added risk that thisinformation might find its way to the suspected perpetrators of the alleged conspiracy.  This aspect is clear from the affirmationin support.  It refers (as indeed counsel referred in the hearing before Hartmann J) to âthe sensitivity of the matterâ and theneed to preserve âthe confidentiality of the investigationâ.  These were the aspects, I believe, that must have ultimately persuadedStone J to have issued the search warrants.  Whilst I agree with the Judge that it is not to be assumed that a journalist will seekto thwart an investigation, it has to be recognized that an investigation may be thwarted even unintentionally and further that thelegislature has itself assumed, by the very act of legislating as it has, that the efficacy of an investigation may be put at riskby service of papers on a journalist.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)     Both Stone J and Hartmann J were sensitive to the aspect of the freedom of the press in this case and rightly so.  Fundamentalrights are to be broadly construed and respected.  However, on occasion, the enjoyment of such rights must be balanced against therights and interests of other persons or society as a whole.  The present case involves just such a balancing exercise.  The freedomof the press in the present case must be seen against the fact that serious crimes may well have been committed, one in which theRespondents (one of course has to assume innocently at this stage) have been caught up; the other in respect of which there is primafacie evidence against the Respondents themselves (the section 17 offence).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> I mentioned in paragraph 49(1) above one reservation that the Respondents had in relation to the question whether the ICAC had fulfilledthe necessary requirements to obtain a search warrant under section 85.  It is this and it relates to locus standi.  In order fora section 85 application to be mounted, the Applicant must have the necessary locus standi to do so, meaning that he must by virtueof some other enactment have the power to search and seize anyway : - see sections 83, 85(1) and (4) of IGCO.  The number of possibleApplicants is therefore restricted.  The ICAC and the police are covered, as are the Immigration Department and the Customs and ExciseDepartment.  In the present case, one must therefore look at the extent of the powers of search and seizure of the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> Here, Mr Dykes referred to the power of arrest contained in section 10 of ICACO and made the point that since that provision didnot allow the ICAC to make an arrest in relation to offences under section 17 of the WPO, it had therefore to follow from this thatthere was no power to search and seize in relation to such an offence.  Accordingly, the ICAC had no locus standi to apply for asearch warrant under section 85 in relation to the section 17 offence.  Reference was made to sections 10(1), (2), (5) of ICACO. While the offence of perverting the course of justice was expressly named in section 10(5) as an offence for which an arrest couldbe made by the ICAC if it arose in the course of an investigation into a suspected offence under the POBO, a section 17 offence wasnot.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> In my view, the ICAC did have the necessary locus standi to apply for the search warrants in the present case : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)     It is clear from the affirmation made in support of the section 85 application that in the course of the ICACâs investigationsinto a suspected offence under POBO, other offences were disclosed (these being the conspiracy to pervert the course of justice anda section 17 offence) : - cf section 10(2) of ICACO.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)     The Respondents were suspects in relation to the section 17 offence though not for the conspiracy offence.  The section 17offence, though not one that is named in section 10(5) of POBO, is however suspected to be connected to the offence under POBO underinvestigation : - cf section 10(2)(a).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)     Accordingly, the section 17 offence was one which by reason by section 10(2)(a) (which is an alternative to what is set outin section 10(2)(b)), the ICAC could effect an arrest and therefore exercise powers of search and seizure.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> By reason of the conclusion reached by me on Issue 1, this Court has no jurisdiction to hear the present appeal and this appeal musttherefore be dismissed.  However, it will be clear from my views on the other issues that had this Court possessed the necessaryjurisdiction, the appeal would have been allowed with costs.  This would have been on the basis that first, the Judge had no jurisdictionunder O.32 r.6 to deal with a setting aside application and secondly, in any event, the issuing of the search warrants by Stone Jwas entirely justified (and nothing material emerged thereafter to dictate a different result).  I wish further to state that I amsatisfied that the ICAC acted entirely lawfully in seeking the search warrants in this case.  They did no more and no less than theywere entitled by law to do.  Had we had jurisdiction, we would simply have set aside the Order of Hartmann J dated 10 August 2004. There would have been no point remitting the section 87 application to be heard given the fact that the relevant journalistic materialhave now been made available to the ICAC.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The appeal is dismissed, but this is as a result of my conclusion on this Courtâs jurisdiction, not because of my views on themerits.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> As for costs, while it is true that the appeal is dismissed, the point on jurisdiction was raised late in the day and, given my conclusionon the other issues in the appeal, I would for my part make an order nisi as to costs that each side is to bear its own costs.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to counsel on both sides for their valuable and helpful submissions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Stuart-Moore V-P :</b></p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Stock JA :</b></p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> I agree with the judgment of the Chief Judge and there is nothing I wish to add.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Geoffrey Ma)<br />                Chief Judge CJHC</p>            </td>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Michael Stuart-Moore)<br />                Vice-President</p>            </td>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(Frank Stock)<br />                Justice of Appeal</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Gerard McCoy, SC, Mr Kevin P Zervos, SC, DDPP(Ag) and Mr Ned Lai Ka Yee, instructed by the Department of Justice for the Applicant/Appellant</p>        <p>Mr Philip Dykes, SC and Mr Victor Dawes instructed by Messrs Wilkinson &amp; Grist for the 1st and 2nd Respondents/Respondents</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2004/291.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
