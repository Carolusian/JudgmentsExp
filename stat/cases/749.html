Background</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> At 11 am on 1 August 1994 the concrete canopy outside that part of Albert House fronting Sai On Street in Aberdeen collapsed. Sevenpersons were injured. One person was killed. The 7 injured persons and the estate of the person killed (collectively, "the ActionPlaintiffs") sued the Owners, Housing Management Agency Limited ("HMAL"), Ho Wing Hang ("Ho"), New Best Restaurant Limited (in liquidation)("New Best"), Aberdeen and Wong as respectively the 1st to 8th Defendants (collectively, "the Action Defendants") in the Action.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The Judgment held that the Action Defendants were jointly and severally liable to each of the Action Plaintiffs. Suffiad J furtherstated (at 50N-51M):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As already indicated, the most culpable of the defendants in this case are without doubt [Ho] and [New Best]. For the purposes ofapportioning liability as between the different defendants, I will treat both the 3rd and 4th defendants as one. There are two reasonsfor this. The 3rd defendant is the director and decision-maker of the 4th defendant. Furthermore, there is no contribution notice<em>inter se</em> between the two of them.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">On the other end of the spectrum, [Wong] is probably the least culpable, judgment having been entered in default against him, he beingthe contractor engaged by [New Best] to demolish the fish tank on the day of the accident.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In between these two spectrum are [the Owners], [HMAL] and [Aberdeen]. There is little, if any, to separate [the Owners], [HMAL] and[Aberdeen] from each other in so far as apportionment of liability is concerned. Each had a duty to maintain this canopy. All ofthem were in complete breach of their own respective duty to maintain the canopy. Without any clear indication as to which of thesethree is more to blame for the collapse of the canopy, I propose to apportion their liability equally.</p>        <p class="quote">In all the circumstances of this case, I shall apportion liability as between the defendants as follows. [Ho] and [New Best] willtogether be 50% to blame. Each of [the Owners], [HMAL] and [Aberdeen] will be 15% to blame. [Wong] will be 5% to blame. Needlessto say, this apportionment only affects the defendants as between themselves. This apportionment does not affect the plaintiffs inany way."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Following the Judgment, the damages due from the Action Defendants to the Action Plaintiffs were assessed. Final awards were adjudgedon 17 September 2001. A total sum of $33,257,886.25 plus interest and costs was assessed to be payable.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The Action Plaintiffs mainly pursued Aberdeen for the sums awarded. In early October 2000 Aberdeen gave a total of $1,566,666.68to the Action Plaintiffs by way of interim payment. In December 2001 the Action Plaintiffs garnisheed $940,000 of rent due from tenantsof properties owned by Aberdeen. On 31 August 2002 Aberdeen's solicitors forwarded to the Action Plaintiffs' solicitors a chequefor $30,222,275.78. That amount represented the balance of the sums due under the Judgment as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="545">            <tr>                <td width="299">Outstanding balance of damages</td>                <td width="236" align="right">$30,073,083.17</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="299">Interest</td>                <td width="236" align="right">$137,692.61</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="299">Charging order application</td>                <td width="236" align="right">$11,500.00</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="299"></td>                <td width="236" align="right">----------------</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="299"></td>                <td width="236" align="right">$30,222,275.78</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="299"></td>                <td width="236" align="right">===========</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>Aberdeen accordingly paid a total of $32,728,942.46 to the Action Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Aberdeen having paid more to the Action Plaintiffs than its 15% share of liability, it issued a generally indorsed Writ on 15 September2003 seeking contribution from the Owners and Wong.

Being jointly and severally liable with the other Action Defendants,Aberdeen had no choice but to accede to the Action Plaintiffs' demands for payment of outstanding damages. Since it paid more thanthat portion of the Actions Plaintiffs' damages representing its 15% share of liability, Aberdeen must now be entitled under CLCO<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 3(1)</a> to claim reimbursement for the excess paid from the Owners, Wong and the other Action Defendants in accordance with the apportionmentof liability determined by Suffiad J.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The difficulty arises because HMAL, New Best and Ho have become insolvent. Although none of these 3 have paid their full share ofthe Action Plaintiffs' damages, Aberdeen cannot recover any contribution from them to cover their proportionate share of the excesspaid by Aberdeen. Does this mean that Aberdeen must shoulder the burden of the share of damages which ought to have been paid byHMAL, New Best and Ho? It would be an odd result if Aberdeen could have no recourse against the remaining Action Defendants (namely,Wong and the Owners) to bear proportionately the share of damages payable by HMAL, New Best and Ho.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> There is no direct authority on the effect of a contributor's insolvency on other contributors. But research by Mr Chain, Mr Chan'sjunior counsel, has come up with the following passage in the late Professor Glanville Williams' <em>Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence: A Study of Concurrent Fault in Great Britain, Ireland and the Common-Law Dominions</em> (1951) (at Â§48 (pp. 170-2)):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"The incidence of risk of insolvency</em></p>        <p class="quote">Before leaving this branch of the subject a few words must be said on the problem of insolvent defendants. The present article willbe concerned with the risk of insolvency, and the next with proof in bankruptcy for contribution.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) <em>Two tortfeasors only</em></p>        <p class="quote">....</p>        <p class="quote">(2) <em>Three of more tortfeasors</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The previous paragraph was addressed to the case of two tortfeasors, and there it is clear that as between D1 and the innocent plaintiffthe risk of D2's default must be borne entirely by D1. The matter wears a different complexion where there are three or more tortfeasors.Suppose that P sues D1, who brings in D2 and D3 as third parties. P obtains judgment against D1, and D1 in turn claims contributionagainst D2 and D3. If it is known that D3 is insolvent, the share of contribution payable by D2 will be increased so as to distributethe loss resulting from D3's insolvency equally between D1 and D2. Suppose, however, that D3's insolvency was not known at the timeof D1's judgment against his companions for contribution, but is discovered only when the judgment against D3 for contribution comesto be executed. On such facts, unless special provision is made, the loss resulting from D3's insolvency is borne exclusively byD1, yet there is no reason why D1 should bear the whole of it and D2 none of it. D2 is as guilty as D1, and it is mere chance thatP happened to sue D1 and not D2. The principle of the Tortfeasors Act is that it should not be left to the plaintiff to determinethe incidence of loss between joint tortfeasors. On the facts here imagined this object is frustrated.</p>        <p class="quote">The matter can, however, be set right very simply by an appropriate wording of the judgments for contribution. D1 can be given contingentjudgment against D3 and D3 severally for contribution of one-third of the sum that he has to pay P, and he may be given in additiona contingent judgment for one-half of the sum payable by the other defendant in the event of default by him. The first of these judgmentsmay be called (for the sake of giving it a distinctive name) the primary judgment for contribution, and the second judgment may becalled the secondary judgment for contribution. [Footnote: Both these judgments are normally contingent on the party in whose favourthey are given having paid at least part of the damages...] The result of the scheme is that if D3 becomes insolvent, or is untraceable,D1 will recover against D2 (1) one-third of the judgment debt under the primary judgment for contribution and (2) one-sixth of thejudgment debt under the secondary judgment. In this way, justice can be done between the solvent defendants. It will be necessaryto provide that the secondary judgment can be made absolute only on application to the court, and the applicant will have to provethat the execution of his primary judgment is not reasonably possible.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">An alternative mode of securing the same result would be for the court to order the unsuccessful parties to bring into court the amountfound due from them and then to order payment out of this fund of the appropriate amounts. Any deficiency in the fund owing to theinsolvency of one of the contributors could then be distributed among the various recipients.</p>        <p class="quote">In the dearth of authority, the present conclusions must be regarded as framed merely in the optative mood. But if the court is sominded, support for distributing the loss caused by the insolvency of one of three or more tortfeasors can probably be found in theTortfeasors Act, which provides in s. 6(2), that the amount of contribution recoverable shall be such as may be found by the courtto be 'just and equitable.' Where the various defendants are found guilty in unequal proportions, the risk of insolvency should naturallybe shared in the same proportions."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The thrust of Professor Williams' analysis is that solvent defendants should bear the burden of an insolvent defendant's contributionin proportion to the solvent defendants' respective shares of liability. In its paper "Law of Contract: Report on Contribution" (LawCom. No. 79) dated 9 March 1977, the English Law Commission commented as follows on Professor Williams' suggestion:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"14. In <em>Whitham v Bullock</em> [[1939]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20KB%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 KB, 81</a>, 85] the Court of Appeal approved the following description of the court's role in contribution proceedings between persons equallyliable at law to the same demand:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'If, as between several persons or properties all equally liable at law to the same demand, it would be equitable that the burdenshould fall in a certain way, the Court will so far as possible, having regard to the solvency of the different parties, see that,if that burden is placed inequitably by the exercise of the legal right, its incidence should be afterwards readjusted. [Footnote:This passage was taken from <em>Rowlatt on Principal and Surety</em> (3rd ed., 1936), p. 173.]'</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">15. The rules for dividing the loss up into shares are fully considered by Professor Glanville Williams QC in his book <em>Joint Obligations</em> [(1949), chapter 9]. The general rule is that, unless there has been an agreement to the contrary, the amount of the loss is dividedup by the number of solvent persons liable and each bears an equal share. However, where two or more persons underwrite a liabilityin unequal shares or up to differing limits, as is not uncommon with contracts of guarantee or of insurance, the right of contributionis not equal but is proportionate to the liability of each. We suggested in our working paper that the rules worked reasonably well,at least so far as joint liability for debts was concerned, and this provisional conclusion received the general, although not unanimous,support of those who sent us comments...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> The distribution of the burden of insolvent defendants among the solvent ones as proposed by Professor Williams not only makes goodcommonsense, but is also just and equitable in the circumstances. A division of the damages payable by insolvent defendants alongthe lines suggested, removes the unfairness inherent in one defendant, here Aberdeen, having to bear all or the bulk of damages forwhich other defendants are liable, simply because those other defendants happen to be insolvent. The insolvency of those other defendantsis a fortuitous event. Without special reason, it would be wrong in principle to visit the consequences of insolvency wholly on aparty who was not responsible for that occurrence.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> I am fortified in my view by a precedent found by Aberdeen's counsel. The approach espoused by Professor Williams appears to havebeen used (without citation of supporting authority) by Lord Denning MR in <strong>Fisher v CHT Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%202%20QB%20475" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 2 QB 475 (CA).</a> The Master of the Rolls stated (at 480F-481B):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The [trial] judge held that Crockfords were 20 per cent responsible; that Tolianis, because of their electrician, were 60 per centresponsible; and that the plasterers were 20 per cebt responsible. No one has any doubt about the responsibility of Tolianis by theirelectrician Boothroyd.... Tolianis were rightly held 60 per cent liable. But they have got no money. So they pass out of the picture.The other two [defendants], Crockford and the pasterers, have got to bear the whole damages between them. The question is how shouldthey bear them as between themselves. If the judge's decision was right, it meant that they would have to bear them half-and-half.Crockfords appeal and say that is not right, because that is not a proper apportionment of responsibility."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Lord Denning then concludes (at 482G-483C):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But, nevertheless, I agree that Crockfords, being occupiers, had some responsibility ynder a duty of care. Seabrook was there astheir maintenance man. He knew the switches better than anybody else. He was taking a very considerable interest in the work andwas there ready at hand. So much so that the judge thought that the responsibility of Crockfords was equal to the plasterers. I myselfwould not put it so high. I think that as between Crockfords and the plasterers, Crockfords' responsibility should only be reckonedas one-quarter and the pasterers three-quarters. So, instead of 20 per vent and 20 per cent, I would put 10 per cent to crockfordsand 30 per cent to the plasterers; and they should bear the whole of the damages which they have to pay in those proportions. Soin respect of the whole damages of ï¿¡4,000, one quarter should be paid by Crockfords and three-quarters by the plasterers."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> If one were to apply Professor Williams' principles of contribution in the present case, the outcome would be that the entire damagesawarded to the Action Plaintiffs should be borne by Aberdeen, the Owners and Wong as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Aberdeen should bear 15/35 (that is, 15 ( (15 + 15 + 5)) or about 42.857%.</p>        <p>(2) The Owners should bear 15/35 or about 42.857%.</p>        <p>(3) Wong should bear 5/35 or about 14.285%.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Payments received by the Action Plaintiffs from HMAL, New Best or Ho (such as the interim payment of $1,566,666.67 made by HMAL) shouldbe credited to the amounts payable by Aberdeen, the Owners and Wong respectively in the same fractions.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> More concretely, on the facts Aberdeen should be entitled to claim amounts calculated as follows from the Owners and Won:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) In relation to the Owners:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) As at 31 August 2002 Aberdeen, the Owners, Wong and HMAL had among them paid a total of $35,862,275.81 ("Amount X") (that is,$32,728,942.46 (paid by Aberdeen) + $1,566,666.68 (interim payment by the Owners) + $1,566,666.67 (paid by HMAL)) to the Action Plaintiffs.42.857% of the total paid is $15,369,495.54.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) From the last amount, one must deduct the Owner's interim payment of $1,566,666.68 and the payment of $3,891,964.66 made by theOwners in September 2002. That leaves $9,910,864.20.</p>            <p>(c) Credit should also be given for 42.857% (that is, $671,426.33) of HMAL's interim payment of $1,566,666.67. If that last figureis subtracted, one is left with $9,239,437.87 as the amount due from the Owners by way of contribution.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) In relation to Wong:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) 14.285% of Amount X is $5,122,926.10.</p>            <p>(b) From the latter, 14.285% (that is, $223,798.33) of HMAL's interim payment of $1,566,666.67 should be subtracted. This would leave$4,899,127.76 as due from Wong by way of contribution.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Ms Priscilla Wong (appearing for the Owners) argues that Aberdeen cannot claim contribution because such claim is not "in respectof the same damage" as that suffered by the Action Plaintiffs. I do not accept this submission. Aberdeen is claiming to be reimbursedfor part of the damages which it has paid to the Action Plaintiffs. Aberdeen and the Owners are jointly and severally liable forsuch damages. Aberdeen's claim for contribution is thus quintessentially "in respect of the same damage" that the Action Plaintiffshave suffered.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Ms Wong suggests that Aberdeen's claim is an abuse. She says that damages (including the apportionment of liability among the ActionDefendants) has already been dealt with by Suffiad J in December 1999 in the Judgment. To bolster her point, she refers to variousContribution Notices filed by the Action Defendants against each other, all of which would have been before Suffiad J at the trialof the Action Plaintiffs' claim. Again I disagree.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> There is no "res judicata" in the Action barring the present claim. The present claim only arises because, after the trial heardby Suffiad J, Aberdeen actually paid damages to the Actions Plaintiffs in an amount greater than its liability as apportioned bySuffiad J and Aberdeen cannot now recover the same from the insolvent Action Defendants. The question whether Aberdeen can shiftpart of the damages which it has borne onto the Owners and Wong is an issue which has only arisen since the Judgment and which couldnot therefore have been determined by Suffiad J. The question is accordingly not one which was so clearly part of the subject-matterof the Action and something which so clearly should have been raised then, that it would amount to an abuse of process to allow thequestion to be litigated in the present proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Ms Wong notes that the Owners have paid the Action Plaintiffs representing their 15% share of liability as apportioned by SuffiadJ. While that is correct, it begs the issue whether, in light of the circumstances, the Owners have to contribute something in relationto the amounts left unpaid by the insolvent Action Defendants which Aberdeen has had to pay. Aberdeen, too, paid up its 15% shareof liability,. But it also had to pay much more. That the Owners have paid up to their 15% share, does not answer the question whetherAberdeen is entitled to some relief against that "more". Contrary to the Owners' Draft Defence, I do not believe that Aberdeen isestopped from making a claim by reason only of the Action Plaintiffs' acceptance of the Owners' 15% payment.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Ms Wong finally submits that, even if I am against her on the question of liability, I should exercise the Court's undoubted discretionunder CLCO s. 4(1) to reject Aberdeen's claim. Any contribution awarded to Aberdeen against the Owners should be "just and equitable"having regard to the extent of the Owners' responsibility for the damage in question.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Ms Wong suggests that Aberdeen has been slow to exercise any rights against the insolvent Action Defendants. Had it acted promptly,it may have recovered something from (say) HMAL and Ho and its claimed contribution from the Owners and Wong would then be correspondinglyless. The Owners are now prejudiced by Aberdeen's delay in what they themselves can now recover from HMAL or Ho, even if the Ownersby paying Aberdeen were to become subrogated to Aberdeen's rights against HMAL or Ho.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> While I have sympathy with Ms Wong's argument, it would be wrong in principle to impose the consequences of the insolvency of someof the Action Defendants wholly on Aberdeen. This is especially the case where, as far as Suffiad J was concerned, Aberdeen and theOwners were culpable to the same degree of 15%. Further, Aberdeen's claim is just within the 2-year time limit imposed by LO s. 6(1).In light of the absence of affirmation evidence from the Owners as to the prejudice suffered by them as a result of Aberdeen's Writbeing issued when it was, I do not think that it is warranted to exercise my discretion to exempt the Owners from making contribution.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I conclude that Aberdeen is entitled to contribution from the Owners and Wong as already calculated above.</p>    <p class="heading">B. Default judgment against Wong</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Aberdeen's solicitors served the Statement of Claim on Wong personally on 27 September 2003.

Miscellaneous reliefs sought by Aberdeen</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> At the hearing before me, Ms Wong did not oppose Mr Chan's application to re-amend the Statement of Claim in the manner suggestedby Summons Â§1. Mr Chan explained that the thinking behind the re-amendment was that, Aberdeen being itself one of the Owners, itwould be unfair for the Court to require Aberdeen to contribute towards any liability which the Owners may have for the costs ofAberdeen's action in the event that Aberdeen succeeds. I gave leave for the re-amendment. But I pointed out to Mr Chan that, sincethe facts underlying the re-amendment were not contained in the evidence filed by Aberdeen in support of the Summons, I could notnow make a summary order for the substantive relief prayed by the re-amendment. If, following this Judgment, the parties cannot agreeon whether Aberdeen should or should not contribute to any costs payable by the Owners, the question will have to be brought beforethe Court for determination.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I also indicated to Mr Chan that, in the event I found in Aberdeen's favour, I was not minded to make an Order in terms of SummonsÂ§3. I doubt that the system of primary and secondary judgments suggested by Professor Williams in the passage quoted above is apractical solution to deal with the problem of the potential bankruptcy of another Action Defendant (in this case, Wong). The Courtshould as much as possible avoid giving "floating judgments" which crystallise on the happening of certain contingencies in the future.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> I shall instead adopt a procedure similar to that used when dealing with string contracts in a sale of goods context. A buyer sometimesclaims that, as a result of a seller's delivery of defective goods, the buyer is faced with claims from the sub-buyers to whom thebuyer has on-delivered the goods. Typically, at the time of the trial, the sub-buyers' claims may not yet have been brought so thata buyer cannot establish that he has incurred an actual loss. In such situation, the Court normally declines to make a declarationthat the buyer is entitled to be indemnified by the seller against future claims made by sub-buyers. That would be too much likegiving the buyer a blank cheque. Instead, following <strong>Trans Trust SPRL v Danubian Trading Co. Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%202%20QB%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] 2 QB 297</a>, the Court of Appeal (Cons VP, Kempster JA and Power J) in <strong>Wong Ho Wai Ying v Yeung Shui Cheung</strong>, unrep., Civil Appeal No. 128 of 1992, 24 February 1987 ([1987] HKLY 960) has held that the proper course is to reserve the questionof the seller's liability (if any) to indemnify the buyer for later consideration with liberty to apply for directions.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> By analogy with that practice, I shall adjourn the determination of Summons Â§3 (along with the corresponding Prayer 2A in the nowRe-Amended Statement of Claim) <em>sine die</em> with liberty to restore.
