Essentially, althoughnot completely, it is an application for a stay of proceedings in favour of the courts in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This is thejudgment consequent upon that application.</p>    <p align="left" class="heading"><strong>THE FACTS</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> This is a misdelivery claim. The material facts are in short compass. The Plaintiff herein is a Hong Kong based trader. Its claimagainst both Defendants arises from the shipment of 325 cartons of travelling bags to be transported to Johannesburg, via Durban,South Africa. The consignment in question was duly shipped from Hong Kong on or about 31<sup>st</sup> January 1997 upon a vessel owned by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the vessel arriving in Durban in February, and thereafter the goods were transported overland from Durban to Johannesburg.However, the Plaintiff alleges that in or around the end of February the consignment, which appears to have been warehoused in Johannesburg,was wrongfully released to an unknown third party without production of the Bill of Lading and without the Plaintiff's authority,with the result that the Plaintiff had suffered loss and damage in the sum of US$114,012.50.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The Bill of Lading, issued in Hong Kong on 31<sup>st</sup> January 1997 for and on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (then known as Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V.) as Carrier by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (then known as Nedlloyd (HK) Limited) as Agent, contained, at Clause 25 thereof, a Law and Jurisdiction Clause, which readsthus:-</p>    <p align="left" class="quote">          "25 LAW AND JURISDICTION</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(1)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Law of application</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Insofar as anything has not been dealt with by the terms and conditions of the Bill of Lading the Law of the Netherlands shall apply.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(2)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">Jurisdiction</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">All actions under the contract of carriage evidenced by this Bill of Lading shall be brought before the Court at Rotterdam and noother court shall have jurisdiction with regard to any such action, unless the Carrier appeals to another jurisdiction or voluntarilysubmits himself thereto."</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It is this jurisdiction clause which is at the heart of the Defendants' submissions in this case.</p>    <p align="left" class="heading"><strong>THE ARGUMENTS</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> It is, I think, appropriate broadly to consider the arguments put forward by Mr Davidson, on behalf of the Defendants, in the mannerin which they have been itemized upon the face of the Summons; accordingly I take the Defendants in turn.</p>    <p align="left" class="heading"><strong>A. 1<sup>ST</sup> DEFENDANT</strong></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is undoubtedly the carrier who issued the relevant Bill of Lading, which bill contains and/or evidences the contract ofcarriage between itself and the Plaintiff. It follows that there is no room for doubt that Clause 25 of that Bill 'bites' upon therights and obligations of the parties, and, unsurprisingly, Mr Davidson founded his submission that the proceedings herein be stayedupon the effect of this clause. Further, it was clear that during the course of argument on this application, both Mr Davidson forthe Defendants and Mr Cheung, who appeared on behalf of the Plaintiff, were proceeding on the basis that the effect of this clausewas to place the burden upon the Plaintiff to establish why the Court should not exercise its discretion in favour of granting astay, see in this context the observations of Brandon LJ (as he then was) in <i><strong>The</strong> "<strong>El Amria</strong></i>"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 Lloyd's LR 119</a> at 123.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> However, although Mr Cheung appeared to accept that such burden was indeed upon his client, the precise nature of Clause 25 (namely,its exclusivity or otherwise) was not specifically addressed, in oral argument at least, and subsequent to the hearing the Courtinvited clarification from the parties on the point, at the same time inviting the attention of Counsel to an earlier decision ofthe Commercial Court in <strong><i>CL 61 of 1997, T &amp; K Electronics Limited v. The Tai Ping Insurance Company Limited</i>,</strong> which decision, inter alia, considered the juridical effect of exclusive foreign jurisdiction clauses, and declined to follow MrJustice Cresswell in "<strong><i>The Rothnie</i></strong>",  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 Lloyd's LR 206</a> at 211, wherein in terms of the burden of proof the learned Judge appeared to liken the effect of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clauseto that of its exclusive counterpart.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> As a consequence of the clarification requested, the Court received additional written submissions from both parties. In these submissionsthe Defendants maintained their stance as to the exclusivity of the clause, although Mr Cheung on behalf of the Plaintiff now arguedthat the clause should be regarded as non-exclusive; and therefore it presumably followed (although he did not specifically say so)that the burden of proof should not, in fact, be upon the Plaintiff to demonstrate why a stay should not be granted, and that theexistence of such a non-exclusive clause was simply one factor to be placed into the normal discretionary 'mix', so to speak.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In the face of these subsequent conflicting written submissions, therefore, in my view a primary issue for decision must be a determinationas to the nature of the clause in question, given the relevance of such classification in terms of the burden of proof. As the Courtexpressed the position in<strong><i>T &amp; K Electronics Limited</i></strong>, <i>op.cit</i>, at page 2 :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "The existence in a contract of an exclusive foreign jurisdiction clause is of considerable significance in arguments asto whether jurisdiction, which otherwise plainly exists as of right, should be exercised over a civil dispute; in instances wheresuch an exclusive jurisdiction clause exists, the Court retains a discretion whether to grant a stay of proceedings brought in breachof such clause, 'but the discretion should be exercised by granting a stay unless strong cause for not doing so is shown': per LordGoff in <i><strong>The Pioneer Container</strong>,</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20AC%20324" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 AC 324</a> (at 347F), a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. The importance attached to the presenceof an exclusive foreign jurisdiction clause derives from the principle that parties should abide by their agreements, so that, ifsuch a clause exists, the starting point is that proceedings should be stayed, the burden of proof then being on the Plaintiff, whichhas commenced proceedings in breach of such contractual term, to show why a stay should not be granted."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Accordingly, having considered the additional written submissions by both parties, I have come to the conclusion that Clause 25 isto be construed as an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the absence of the word 'exclusive' notwithstanding. In this regard, I am inclinedto agree with the Plaintiff's supplemental written submissions on the point. At the end of the day the issue is essentially one ofconstruction as to whether the clause in question obliges the parties to resort to the relevant jurisdiction - see <strong><i>Sohio Supply Co. v. Gatoil (USA) Inc</i>.,</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 Lloyd's LR 588</a> at 591, wherein Staughton LJ specifically approved the views expressed by the authors of <i><strong>Dicey and Morris on The Conflict of Laws</strong></i>, who put the matter thus :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is a question of interpretation, governed by the law applicable to the contract, or more accurately, the law governing the jurisdictionagreement, whether a jurisdiction clause is exclusive or non-exclusive, ..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Moreover, in addition to the particular use of the words 'all claims' and 'shall', I am also attracted by, and accept, the furtherargument, deriving from an analogous submission which found favour in the English Court of Appeal in <i><strong>Continental Bank v. Aeakos Compania</strong></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20505" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 Lloyd's LR 505</a>, to the effect that the provision that no other court should have jurisdiction unless appealed to or submitted to by the carrierlent support to the argument that the clause should be considered an exclusive jurisdiction clause. As Steyn LJ put it in <i><strong>Continental Bank</strong>, op.cit</i>. at 509 :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The juxtaposition of a submission by the appellants to the jurisdiction of the English Courts and the option reserved in favour ofthe bank to sue elsewhere brings into play the <i>expressio unius exclusio alterius</i> canon of construction. It suggests that a similar option in favour of the appellants was deliberately omitted. In our judgment thelanguage of cl. 21.02 evinces a clear intention that the appellants, but not the bank, would be obliged to submit disputes in connectionwith the loan facility to the English Courts. ...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> If this interpretation be correct, the legal position is clear: the Court retains a discretion whether to grant a stay brought inbreach of such a clause <i>"but the discretion should be exercised by granting a stay unless strong cause for not doing so is shown</i>". In the circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that Mr Cheung was correct in accepting, during oral argument, that having commencedproceedings in Hong Kong in breach of such contractual term, the burden was indeed upon his client to show why a stay should notbe granted. This being the case, the question thus arises as to whether the Plaintiff has so succeeded, on the evidence before theCourt, in establishing such 'strong cause' for not granting the stay now sought.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> On the material which has been placed before the Court, the answer to this rhetorical question must, I think, be 'No'. In my viewlittle of substance is put up by the Plaintiff in the discharge of this burden; and whilst the Court can of course take account ofthe broad circumstances of the case, little or no attempt has been made, for example, to grapple with the matters itemized by BrandonLJ in <strong><i>The "El Amria"</i></strong> at sub-paragraphs (5)(a) - (e) of his list of relevant principles, which for convenience of reference I set out hereunder:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">" (5) In particular, but without prejudice to (4), [the Court in its discretion to take into account all the circumstances of thiscase] the following matters, where they arise, may properly be regarded:</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          (a) In what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated, or more readily available, and the effect of that onthe relative convenience and expense of trial as between the English and foreign Courts.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          (b) Whether the law of the foreign Court applies and, if so, whether it differs from English law in any material respects.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          (c) With what country either party is connected, and how closely.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          (d) Whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural advantages.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">          (e) Whether the Plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign Court because they would: (i) be deprivedof security for their claim; (ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained; (iii) be faced with a time-bar not applicable in England;or (iv) for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial."</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> To the contrary. The affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the Plaintiff comprises three affirmations of Mr Chui Man, of which thesecond simply clarifies his authority to make the affirmations and reveals that the Plaintiff hired the service of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant for carriage of goods from Hong Kong to Johannesburg on four occasions, including the present, whilst the third affirmationmerely exhibits shipping orders and bills of lading relevant to those four occasions. Whilst Mr Chui's first affirmation, in substance,establishes only that the Plaintiff was never informed that the carrier was other than the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, or that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was the agent, and avers the existence of a strong case by the Plaintiff against both Defendants "being carriers and/orbailees for reward" and having no defence in what is said to be a clear instance of misdelivery.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> After some reflection, I have come to the view, in light of the evidence placed before it, that the Court should accede to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant's stay application. I confess that in the circumstances that this is a decision which I view with little enthusiasm, giventhat jurisdiction has been established in Hong Kong as of right, but on the law as it stands, and in light of the evidence filedwhen taken together with the classification of the clause in question, the Court effectively is left with little room for manoeuvre.This is not a matter in which no defences are raised or deposed to (in which context I note that in this case the issue of the preciseambit of the <i>Hague-Visby Rules</i> again raises its head), and no real attempt, it seems to me, has been made on the evidence to establish the "strong cause" necessaryfor the discretionary refusal of a stay. Accordingly, insofar as the parties have bound themselves contractually to go to the Netherlands,so be it; and whilst I have received no evidence as to Netherlands' law, no point has been taken that for the purposes of the presentapplication there is any difference between that and Hong Kong law.</p>    <p class="heading">B. THE 2<sup>ND</sup> DEFENDANT</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Mr Davidson similarly asks for a stay of proceedings against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, and matches this, also, with an application that the amended Statement of Claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant be struck out as being frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Let me say at the outset that I do not accept that the striking out application is well-founded; in the circumstances, I do not considerthat the requisite benchmark has been attained, particularly in light of the allegations of estoppel/course of dealing between theparties. I turn, therefore, to consider the two differing elements of the stay application insofar as it applies to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The first of these is an attempt to invoke the jurisdiction clause in the Bill of Lading against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. In this regard Mr Davidson makes two points. He says that the case against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant qua carrier is risible on the basis of the facts as disclosed both in the evidence and in terms of the relevant documentation- the Bill of Lading in question was clearly issued by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as agent for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant - but that since the Plaintiff has pleaded that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is the carrier, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant nevertheless is entitled to proceed on this basis for the purposes of argument. There has been no application to amend;ergo, submitted Mr Davidson, Clause 25 'bites', and like arguments surrounding the jurisdiction clause apply to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I do not accept this submission, attractively though the point was put. I am far from satisfied that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was privy to the contract of carriage, and for present purposes I am disinclined to accept the bald contention that "havingpleaded it, they are stuck with it".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I turn therefore to Mr Davidson's alternative argument. In this context he relies upon the Himalaya clause in Clause 4.2 of the Billof Lading. Insofar as relevant this reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... every such Person shall have the benefit of every right, defence, limitation and liberty of whatsoever nature herein containedor otherwise available to the Carrier as if such provision were expressly for his benefit, and in entering into this contract theCarrier, to the extent of these provisions, does not only do so on his own behalf but also as agent and trustee for such Persons."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Mr Davidson submits that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is clearly within the terms of this clause. He has a problem, however; the relatively recent case of <i><strong>The</strong> <strong>"Mahkutai"</strong></i> [1996] 2 Lloyd's Rep.1, a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the effect of a Himalaya clause did <i>not</i> serve to include a mutual agreement such as an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Mr Davidson seeks to overcome this difficulty by distinguishingthe precise wording of the clause in <i><strong>The</strong> <strong>"Mahkutai</strong>"</i> from that in the present case; in particular, he points out that the instant clause refers also to 'rights' and 'defences', and arguesthat it is plainly a 'right' to have claims brought against his client in another jurisdiction. However, I do not think that thesemantic differences in the respective clauses suffice to get him home. The reasoning of their Lordships - see here the speech ofLord Goff in particular, <i>op.cit.</i> at pp.9-10 - emphasizes the mutuality of the agreement as embodied within an exclusive jurisdiction clause, and contrasts that withthe true function of a Himalaya clause, namely, to prevent cargo-owners from avoiding the effect of contractual defences availableto the carrier by suing in tort persons who perform contractual services on the carrier's behalf. It is this primary consideration,it seems to me, which underpins the view of their Lordships to the effect that the exclusive jurisdiction clause in that case didnot fall within the scope of the Himalaya clause.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, therefore, this leaves outstanding the third string to Mr Davidson's bow; interestingly, an application <i>by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantt</i> that the proceedings against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant be stayed on the grounds that they are an abuse of process because there is an agreement between the Plaintiff and the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that the claims herein must only be brought against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, and that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is obliged to indemnify the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant for liabilities it may have for the claims herein. This agreement also derives from Clause 4.2 of the Bill of Lading, therelevant part of which amounts to a promise by the shipper to the contractual carrier that no claim or allegation :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"shall be made against any Person whomsoever (including all Sub-contractors of the Carrier) by whom the Carriage is performed or undertaken,other than the Carrier, which imposes or attempts to impose upon any such Person ... any liability whatsoever in respect of the Goods,or the Carriage of the Goods whether or not arising from the negligence on the part of such Person and, if such claim or allegationshould nevertheless be made to indemnify the Carrier against all consequences thereof."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Mr Davidson submitted that such a clause has recently been upheld in the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong in <i><strong>The Nedlloyd Colombe</strong></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20HKC%20655" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 HKC 655</a>, and he suggested that the present case is even stronger in that in <i><strong>The Nedlloyd Colombe</strong>,</i> wherein the Court of Appeal stayed the proceedings therein at the application of a non-party, Safmarine, which had taken out a summonsin that action for an order that leave be granted to intervene for the purpose of seeking a permanent stay of all proceedings broughtagainst the defendants. In the instant case, said Mr Davidson, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was the contractual carrier under the Bill of Lading, wherein pursuant to Clause 4.2, the cargo-owners undertook to makeno claim against any person by whom the carriage was performed, and there is an indemnity from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant insofar as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant incurred liabilities. Accordingly, the reasoning goes, there would be circuity of action in that insofar as the Plaintiffsucceeded against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would have a remedy against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, who would in turn be indemnified by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> This point is well made, and it is on this basis that I think that Mr Davidson succeeds in terms of a stay of proceedings againstthe 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. <strong><i>The Nedlloyd Colombo</i></strong> is highly persuasive, albeit, as Litton V-P stressed in his judgment in that case, the jurisdiction to stay at the instance of another(albeit in this instance not a stranger to the litigation) is sparingly used. However, in his judgment the learned Vice-Presidentquoted with approval an extract from the judgment of Ackner J (as he then was) in <i><strong>The Elbe Maru</strong></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 Lloyd's Rep 206</a>, wherein in response to the argument advanced that, notwithstanding a promise to bring no claim in terms similar to Clause 4.2 inthis case, the action should, as a matter of discretion, be allowed to proceed, Ackner J. observed as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the suggestion that the court should not exercise its discretion but should allow the action to proceed, then to be followedby a claim against the applicants and then to be followed by the applicants claiming against the respondent seems to me to ignorethe well established proposition ... that there should be an end of useless litigation. If the action ought not to be brought, thenthe court should intervene and stop it rather than allow a series of circuitous actions which ultimately end up achieving exactlywhat the stay sought would achieve, apart from the disbursement of a quite unnecessary amount of costs."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">ORDER</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> It follows from the foregoing that, although not without some real hesitation, in my judgment this application succeeds in termsof a stay of proceedings against <i>both</i> the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> I make also an Order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of and occasioned by the application be to the Defendants, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">(William Stone)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Mr Y.L.
