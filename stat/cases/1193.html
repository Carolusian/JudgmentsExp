The disputearises from a transfer of shares in a takeover bid between the Fu Chip Investment Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Fu Chip)and the Tsuen Wan Shing On Estate Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Shing On) in February 1973. At that time the plaintiffsPau On, Ho Mei Chun and Pau Lap Chung (hereinafter referred to respectively as the 1st plaintiff, 2nd plaintiff, and the 3rd plaintiff)together owned all the shares in the Shing On. On the 27th February 1973 by an agreement in writing (hereinafter referred to as themain agreement) Exhibit C between the three plaintiffs of the first part, the Shing On of the 2nd part and the Fu Chip of the 3rdpart the three plaintiffs agreed to sell and the Fu Chip agreed to buy all the plaintiffs' shares in the Shing On for $10.5 millionto be paid in the form of 4.2 million of the Fu Chip shares of $1.00 each to be valued at $2.50 and allotted by the Fu Chip. Thedate of completion was set for the 31st March 1973. At the time the Fu Chip was a public company the shares of which had been listedin the Far East Stock Exchange for trading. The 4.2 million shares to be allotted would be new issues for the purpose of the takingover of the Shing On. Under the main agreement the three plaintiffs also covenanted not to sell or transfer 60% of the said Fu Chipshares so allotted to them on or before April 1974. On the same day (that is 27th February 1973) by another agreement (hereinafterreferred to as the subsidiary agreement) between the three plaintiffs and the 1st defendant the plaintiffs agreed to sell and the1st defendant to buy 2,520,000 shares of the Fu Chip (that is the 60% of the Fu Chip shares allotted to the plaintiffs under themain agreement) at the price of $2.50 each i.e. total of 6.3 million and that the completion should take place on or before 30thApril 1974. Later, by mutual consent, the completion date of the main agreement was postponed to the 30th April 1973.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> There is a dispute as to the terms of the subsidiary agreement which dispute is part of the plaintiffs' case and I shall refer toit later. In the meanwhile the Fu Chip notified the Far East Stock Exchange Ltd. of the execution of the main agreement and appliedfor permission to deal in and for quotation of the new allottment of 4.2 million shares to be allotted to the plaintiffs. The FuChip also published an announcement of the main agreement as well as the application. It is observed that in the said announcementthe Fu Chip published not only the acquisition of the shares of the Shing On but also the acquisition of other properties for whichthe Fu Chip shares were allotted and the applications to the Far East Exchange Ltd. for dealings in all such Fu Chip shares. On the31st March the Far East Stock Exchange Ltd. approved the above mentioned application in respect of the 4.2 million shares to be allottedto the plaintiffs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> On 19th April 1973 Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co., solicitors for the Fu Chip started to press the Shing On for the completion of the mainagreement. This led to an exchange of correspondence between Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co., and Hasting &amp; Co. then solicitors forthe Shing On. Eventually the main agreement was completed on 4th May 1973 but not after the subsidiary agreement had been cancelledand the guarantee in Exhibit B executed by the 1st defendant and 2nd defendant on the same day. In the guarantee 1st defendant andthe 2nd defendant quaranteed that the price of the said 2,520,000 Fu Chip shares would not fall below $2.50 each on the marketingday immediately following the 30th April 1974 and agreed to indemnify the plaintiffs if the price fell below that mark on the saiddate. On the 1st May 1974 the market price of the Fu Chip shares quoted at the Exchange was at 36 each. The difference in price forthe 2,520,000 shares (that is 60%) of the Fu Chip shares so retained by the plaintiffs as covenanted in the main agreement betweenthe market price and the guaranteed price of $2.50 each is $5,392,800. The aforesaid details are the background of this action andare not in serious dispute. The substantial difference between the parties are the circumstances under which the guarantee came intobeing on the 4th May 1973 and the consequences thereof.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> By their pleadings the plaintiffs' case is that prior to the execution of the main agreement and the subsidiary agreement the partieshad negotiations in mid February 1973 when it was orally agreed between the plaintiffs and the defendants that in consideration ofthe plaintiffs selling to the Fu Chip all of the plaintiffs' shares in the Shing On for the sum of $10.5 million to be satisfiedby the allottment of 4.2 million shares of $1.00 each in the Fu Chip, the defendants guaranteed that the closing market value onthe following marketing date immediately after the 30th April 1974 for the 2,520,000 shares of the 4.2 million shares so allottedto the plaintiffs should not be less than $2.50 per share and agreed to indemnify the plaintiffs in respect of the said 2,520,000shares against any loss, damage and other expenses which the plaintiffs might incur or sustain in the event of the closing marketprice of the Fu Chip shares falling short of $2.50 each on the marketing day following the 30th April 1974. Then they gave instructionsto the solicitors to reduce the agreements into writing.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> It is contended by the plaintiffs that, whilst the agreement was executed by them in the presence of the two defendants after thegist of the contents were explained to them by a friend who was a solicitor's clerk, the subsidiary agreement was executed by themwithout any explanation but on the information preferred by the 1st defendant that it contained the guarantee and indemnity as agreedorally between them in mid February 1973. The plaintiffs all signed the subsidiary agreement without reading the documents believingthat it contained the guarantee and indemnity as orally in the terms as orally agreed. The subsidiary agreement was in fact one ofsale and purchase whereby the plaintiffs agreed to sell 2,520,000 of the Fu Chip shares to the 1st defendant for $6.3 million, thecompletion to take place on or before the 30th April. The plaintiffs were never given a copy of either the main agreement or thesubsidiary agreement until April 1973 when the plaintiffs discovered the discrepancy of the subsidiary agreement from the oral agreementof mid February 1973. Negotiation ensued and as a result, the defendants signed on the 4th May 1973 a document in the terms of thesaid oral agreement in mid February 1973 in consideration of the cancellation of the subsidiary agreement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Alternatively, the plaintiffs claim that the defendants signed the guarantee in consideration of the plaintiffs giving a writtenundertaking to the defendants that the plaintiffs would retain, for one year, 60% of the Fu Chip shares to be allotted to them, wouldindemnify the defendants of any loss or damages caused by their breach of this undertaking and would give the defendants the optionof purchasing the 60% of such Fu Chip shares upon the happening of certain events.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Further and in the alternative the plaintiffs claim that the said guarantee was signed by the defendants in consideration of theplaintiffs performing their obligations to the Fu Chip on the 4th May 1973 under the main agreement. The plaintiffs further contendalternatively that if the said agreement is invalid then the defendants are still bound by the subsidiary agreement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> On the aforesaid grounds the plaintiffs now claim the total sum of $5,392,800 the deference between $6.3 million being the priceof the 2,520,000 shares of the Fu Chip calculated at $2.50 each and $907,200 being the price of the same calculated at 36 each, themarket value of such shares on the 1st May 1974.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The defence is that there had been no such oral agreement between the parties in mid February 1973 as alleged by the plaintiffs.Both the main agreement and the subsidiary agreement were signed by the plaintiffs on the 27th February 1973 at the office premisesof Wing On Co. after the plaintiffs had perused the same and after one Chow Hin Yau had explained the contents of the same to theplaintiffs at lunch in the Golden City Restaurant on the same day. Both the main and subsidiary agreements represented what wereagreed upon by the parties thereto. One of the terms of the main agreement was that each of the plaintiffs must retain in their ownright 60% of the shares of the Fu Chip to be allotted to him and not to sell the same on or before the 30th April 1974. By the subsidiaryagreement the plaintiffs agreed to sell and the 1st defendant to buy the said 60% of the Fu Chip shares so retained by the plaintiffsat $2.50, that is the 2,520,000 Fu Chip shares for $6.3 million and that the said sale and purchase for the said shares should becompleted on or before the 30th April 1974. On or about 27th February 1973 the Fu Chip notified the Far East Exchange Ltd. of theexecution of the main agreement and applied to list the shares to be allotted to the plaintiffs for trading. On the 16th March theFu Chip made a public announcement that it had agreed to purchase all the issued shares in the Shing On. On or about the 28th Marchthe date for completion under the main agreement was extended by consent of the parties to the 30th April 1973. On or about the 31stMarch 1974 the said application by the Fu Chip was approved by the Far East Stock Exchange Ltd.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> On or about the 24th April 1973 the 1st defendant explained to the 1st plaintiff the importance of the plaintiffs completing thetransaction in the main agreement. Thereupon the 1st plaintiff alleged that the subsidiary agreement did not represent what had beenorally agreed between the plaintiffs and the defendants in that the plaintiffs never agreed to sell to the 1st defendant the said2,520,000 shares in the Fu Chip as set out in the subsidiary agreement. The 1st plaintiff further required a guarantee from the defendantsthat the price in respect of the said 2,520,000 Fu Chip shares would not be less than $2.50 each for one year and said that unlesssuch a guarantee was forthcoming the plaintiffs would refuse to sell the Shing On shares to the Fu Chip. On or about the 1st May1973 the 1st defendant again impressed upon the 1st plaintiff the importance of the plaintiffs completing the transaction with theFu Chip and that, in view of the Fu Chip's application to the Far East Stock Exchange Ltd. and the said public announcement madeby the Fu Chip on the 16th March 1973 to that effect, the failure on the part of the plaintiffs to complete the said transactionwould cause the public to lose confidence in the Fu Chip shares.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> On the 3rd May 1973, Mr. Chan Kwai Wah, the plaintiffs' agent, met the 1st defendant and repeated the same demand and the same threatthat unless the guarantee was forthcoming the plaintiffs would refuse to complete the transaction with the Fu Chip under the mainagreement. It was under such threat that the defendants signed the guarantee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In the premises the defendants contend that the said guarantee was signed by the defendants under an unlawful threat to repudiatethe main agreement administered by the plaintiffs who knew well of the detrimental effect of such repudiation on the market priceof the Fu Chip shares. As such the said guarantee is null and void and unenforceable. In the alternative it is contended that thesaid guarantee was given for a past consideration. It is denied that the defendants gave the said guarantee in consideration of theplaintiffs giving the defendants a written undertaking to retain 60% of the Fu Chip shares to be allotted to them under the mainagreement and the option referred to in the plaintiffs' Statement of Claim. It is further contended that the subsidiary agreementwhich had been cancelled by mutual consent cannot be revived simply because of the said guarantee being invalid and that the plaintiffsare estopped from relying on the subsidiary agreement because it had been cancelled and because of the plaintiffs' own refusal toabide by its terms.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Joining issue with the defendants in their Reply the plaintiffs deny any conversation on or about the 24th April 1973. The plaintiffsalso deny that the 1st defendant mentioned the adverse effect of the plaintiffs' failure to complete the main agreement on publicconfidence in the Fu Chip. They further allege that on the 1st May the 1st plaintiff did say that the plaintiffs were prepared tocomplete the transaction under the main agreement only if the defendants would provide the plaintiffs with a guarantee and indemnityin accordance with the oral agreement. Thereupon the 1st defendant admitted that there was a mistake in the subsidiary agreementand that the defendants were prepared to give to the plaintiffs a guarantee and indemnity which would be prepared by Yung, Yu, Yuen&amp; Co. Chan Kwai Wah, the plaintiff's agent, merely repeated the request of the said guarantee in terms of the oral agreementand inquired when such guarantee would be given. As a result the defendants gave the guarantee freely and were under no threat. Finallyit is contended that by signing the said guarantee the defendants had represented to the plaintiffs that it was valid. Acting onsuch representation the plaintiffs agreed to the cancellation of the subsidiary agreement thereby changing their position to theirdetriment. As such the defendants are estopped from alleging that the said guarantee is ineffective or invalid.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Despite the multiplicity of alternative issues of law and facts raised in the pleadings, the ultimate question still is whether theguarantee is binding on the defendants. Further such alternative issues depend largely on the facts of the case. Before an answerfor the ultimate question can be found it is necessary first to consider the evidence in order to dispose of the alternative issues.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> One of the issues raised is that sometime in mid February 1973 the parties had reached an oral agreement to the effect as pleadedin paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim. The plaintiffs allege that the guarantee was signed on the 4th May 1973 in order to giveeffect to the said oral agreement since the subsidiary agreement, Exhibit B, was never read by or explained to the plaintiffs beforethey signed it and as such never represented the true intention of the parties as expressed in the said oral agreement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> According to the 2nd plaintiff there had been negotiations between the plaintiffs and the defendants on five separate occasions overa period of 9 days immediately preceding the 22nd February when they reached the said oral agreement. There and then the 1st plaintiffand the 2nd plaintiff went with the defendants to see Mr. Philip Yuen of Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co. their solicitors (then for bothparties) to give instructions personally for reducing the said oral agreement into writing. They told Mr. Yuen that the Fu Chip wasto take over the Shing On by allottment to the plaintiffs of 4.2 million Fu Chip shares valued at $2.50 each and that there shouldbe a guarantee given by the defendants and the Fu Chip that 60% of the 4.2 million Fu Chip shares so allotted would not fall in valueto below $2.50 each for one year after the transaction and that the defendants and the Fu Chip would pay the difference between $2.50and the market price of the Fu Chip shares on the marketing day immediately following the 30th April 1974 if the Fu Chip shares shouldfall below the value of $2.50 each. On the other hand the 1st defendant demanded that the plaintiffs would not sell the 2,520,000of the 4.2 million shares within one year or that the plaintiffs would have to compensate the defendants and the Fu Chip for anyloss. At around noon on the 27th February the 1st defendant rang the plaintiffs for an appointment to go to tea at the Golden CityRestaurant without mentioning the purpose for such a meeting. All the three plaintiffs went bringing with them a solicitor's clerkby the name of Chow Hin Yau. Mr. Chow was a clerk to Hastings &amp; Co. who were then solicitors advising the Shing On. On theirarrival they saw only the 1st defendant with a group of the 1st defendant's friends.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> At the lunch table the 1st defendant produced a copy of the main agreement for their perusal. Mr. Chow then explained to the plaintiffsthe gist of the contents of the main agreement and left the party at about 2 p.m. The subsidiary agreement was not produced to theplaintiffs until the parties had finished lunch and were down at the lobby of the Golden City Restaurant. It was produced by the2nd defendant who did not appear until then. The defendants represented to the plaintiffs that the subsidiary agreement, ExhibitA7-9 was the document of mutual guarantee. No one was there to explain the contents of the subsidiary agreement to the plaintiffs.The plaintiffs did not know English. By that time Chow Hin Yau had left. The plaintiffs signed the subsidiary agreement believingit to be a document of mutual guarantee and in accordance with their oral agreement. Then both the main agreement and the subsidiaryagreements were taken away from the plaintiffs who were not given a copy thereof until sometime near the end of April. It is, however,the 2nd plaintiff's evidence that on the 28th March 1973 the 1st defendant took the main agreement only to the plaintiffs' officefor their signature for a postponement of the completion date to the 30th April 1973. Again no copy of any agreement was given tothe plaintiffs. It was near the end of April when the plaintiffs obtained a copy of the 2 agreements that they found out that thesubsidiary agreement was not a document of guarantee but an agreement of purchase and sales.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The defence evidence on this point is that there was no oral agreement as alleged by the plaintiffs. Between the 12th February 1973and 19th February 1973 the 1st defendant was in Taiwan. On the 20th or 21st of February 1973 the 1st plaintiff first indioated tothe 1st defendant that he, the 1st plaintiff, was interested in the Shing On being taken over by the Fu Chip. On the 23rd February1973 the Fu Chip shares were listed on the Far East Stock Exchange for dealing for the first day. On that day the 1st defendant wentto the 1st plaintiff's share-brokers firm, the Wing On Company, to watch the market. The 1st defendant bought a fair number of theFu Chip shares on that day to support the prices of the Fu Chip shares - see Exhibit E, the bought notes. The question of takingover the Shing On was then revived at the closing of the market for the day. The parties negotiated and bargained over the termsof the take-over several times during the following few days. There was mention as to the form of the guarantee for the value ofthe Fu Chip shares to be allotted to the plaintiffs in consideration of the take-over of the Shing On. The 1st defendant offeredto sign an agreement to buy back 60% of the shares which the plaintiffs were obliged to retain for one year after the completionof the main agreement at the price of $2.50. This was acceptable to the plaintiffs. The 1st plaintiff and 1st defendant went to seeMr. Yau, a conveyancing clerk in Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Company to give instructions for drawing up their agreement. In the presenceof the 1st plaintiff the 1st defendant gave instructions to Yau who later repeated such instructions to the parties. Both raisedno objection. Yau indicated that the agreement would be ready by the following day, The 1st defendant suggested that the partiesshould sign the agreement at Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Company. However the 1st plaintiff suggested that the 1st defendant should meethim before 1 p.m. at the Golden City Restaurant 4th floor for tea the next day and sign the agreements so that he could show themto Chow Hin Yau of Hastings.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> On the morning of the 27th February 1973 the defendants collected two copies each of the main agreement and the subsidiary agreementin escrow and took them to meet the plaintiffs at the Golden City Restaurant. All the four copies were handed to the 1st plaintiffwho asked Chow to explain the contents to him which Chow did. But the agreement was not signed there. The parties then went backto the Wing On Company where the documents were handed to Mr. Chan Kwai Wah who explained generally the outline of the two documentsto the plaintiffs who then signed both the main agreement and the subsidiary agreement. The 1st defendant identified Exhibit C asone of the two originals of the main agreement to which the Shing On seal was applied and which was signed by the plaintiffs andthe defendants. As to the extension endorsement it was signed on or about the 27th March 1973 at the Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Companybefore Mr. Yau.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> In view of the evidence it is obvious that the parties could not have reached any oral agreement before the 23rd February 1973. The1st defendant was away from Hong Kong until 19th February 1973. In any event there was no market price for the Fu Chip shares toform the basis of any bargain before the 23rd February 1973 when such shares were first put on the open market. The 2nd plaintiff'sevidence that the parties reached agreement before the 22nd February 1973 and went to Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Company to give instructionsto reduce the agreement into writing is not reliable. The 2nd plaintiff's only explanation for fixing the price of the Fu Chip sharesat $2.50 each, which is that the 1st defendant simply fixed a price at that level, appears to me to be far fetched. She frankly admittedthat she could not remember if the price for the Fu Chip shares were agreed at $2.50 each only on the 23rd February 1973 and saidin cross-examination that it was after the Fu Chip shares were listed before any discussion of the take-over began. This is in directconflict with her evidence-in-chief and reflects upon the credibility of the 2nd plaintiff's evidence though it is by no means decisiveon the question whether there was an oral agreement in terms as alleged by the plaintiffs. Even the 1st defendant's evidence is thatprior to the 27th February 1973 the parties had come to terms which were reduced into writing. In his evidence-in-chief the 1st defendanttold of their discussion on the 26th February 1973 as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"On following Monday, 26/2/73 we met. We talked about the price. I first offered $8.5 million. They declined. Mrs. Pao wanted $11million. I refused because even figure they worked out was only $10.8 million. Then Mrs. Pao suggested $10.8 million. Backling tookplace and eventually agreed upon figure of $10.5 million and that payment to be made by allocation of shares valued at $2.50 each.It took only half an hour to reach this agreement. I was anxious to acquire and they were anxious to sell. After agreement reachedMrs. Pao told me she had licence as stock broker and in future we could join to be banker in a game. At that time we were all inhigh spirits. We met again that afternoon to talk of details of the transaction. I suggested that the shares allocated to them shouldnot be sold for 1 year as to 60%. I have them the reason - that as major shareholder they must support the shares. They were wellpleased saying that we were in the same boat and hope the boat would float. Then Mrs. Pao asked what happened if the shares droppedbelow $2.50. I said I would sign an $2.50 after 1 year. Both Mr. and Mrs. Pao agreed. Then Pao and I went to see Mr. Yau at Yung,Yu, Yuen &amp; Company. I gave an account to Yau of the take-over by the Fu Chip of Shing On Company. Yau was instructed to preparetwo agreements - one for taking over of Shing On by Fu Chip by issuing 4.2 million shares of Fu Chip to acquire all shares of ShingOn Company."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It is obvious that the parties could not have had any negotiation at a time nine days prior to the 22nd February 1973. It has beenproved conclusively that the 1st defendant was in Taiwan during that period up to the 19th February 1973. I believe that the partiesdid not start negotiation until the 23rd February 1973 when the Fu Chip shares were first traded in the Far East Stock Exchange.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The 1st defendant went on to tell of the circumstances under which the main agreement and the subsidiary agreement were signed asfollows:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="8%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="86%" class="quote">On following morning I and Lau Kam Ching went to Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Company about noon.

It is notpart of the plaintiffs' case that either Mr. Yuen or his clerk, Mr. Yau, was negligent. No solicitor worthy of his profession wouldproduce a draft agreement of sales as is the subsidiary agreement while instructions were given to draft a guarantee. Mr. Yau franklyadmitted that he merely used the printed standard form of sales for the subsidiary agreement. This accounts for the conflict betweenthe terms of the main agreement and the terms of the subsidiary agreement. In the main agreement the plaintiffs covenanted with theFu Chip that they would not sell or dispose of 60% of the Fu Chip shares allotted to them within one year of the completion of thetransaction. In the subsidiary agreement the plaintiffs agreed to sell 60% of the said shares to the 1st defendant within one yearof the completion of the transaction under the main agreement. In the preparation of the subsidiary agreement both the plaintiffsand the defendants were the clients of Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co. I do not believe that any solicitor would so deliberately favourone of his clients to the detriment of the other as to include terms as harsh and prejudicial as those in the subsidiary agreement.Clause I of the subsidiary agreement provides that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. The Seller shall sell to the Buyer and the Buyer shall buy from the Seller free from all incumbrances the said shares in the saidCompany together with all dividends bonus and issues, if any, accrued or to accrue thereon whether accrued before or after the signingof this Agreement."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Having heard the evidence of the 2nd plaintiff and the 1st defendant and having seen them in Court I form the opinion that both arefairly sharp business people each trying to get a better bargain over the other in the take-over negotiation. However, the 1st defendantis of a slightly more sophisticated type. As such he was able to obtain an advantage over the plaintiffs by getting them to agreeto the form of transaction as contained in the main agreement and the subsidiary agreement - a transaction he said he would not haveentered had he been in the plaintiff's place. I find as a fact that in the course of their negotiation the plaintiffs inquired asto the form of protection they would be given for agreeing to retain 60% of the Fu Chip shares allotted to them under the main agreementfor at least one year. Thereupon the 1st defendant offered to repurchase the said shares from them at $2.50 each at the end of theyear. The plaintiffs agreed in principle to this form of safeguard. It was in such circumstances that the 1st plaintiff and the 1stdefendant went to give instructions to Mr. Yau of Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co. I am satisfied that everything leading to and includingthe preparation of the draft agreement were done in a rush. No one including Mr. Yau paid much attention to the legal refinementsor the unreasonableness of some of the provisions in the draft subsidiary agreement. However, I am satisfied that at the materialtime the plaintiffs knew that the subsidiary agreement which they signed would take the form of a sale and purchase agreement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The 2nd plaintiff's evidence as to the circumstances under which they signed the main and subsidiary agreements were full of embellishments.Her evidence is not reliable. I am satisfied that it was her husband, the 1st plaintiff who suggested that the documents should betaken to the Golden City Restaurant for execution. That was the plaintiff's usual place for lunch. There he could bring his friendand a trusted solicitor's clerk, Mr. Chow Hin Yau, to read the documents in draft without causing embarrassment of bringin Mr. Chowto Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co. I cannot accept the plaintiffs' evidence that Mr. Chow went to the Golden City Restaurant without knowingthat his assistance was required on that occasion. As to the signing of the subsidiary agreement I accept the evidence given by the1st defendant, that the draft copies of both the main agreement and the subsidiary agreement were handed to the plaintiffs for perusalthat Chow Min Yau had read and explained the gist of the contents of both draft agreements to the plaintiffs and that the main agreementwas signed and sealed at the same time as the subsidiary agreement was signed at the Wing On Company after the plaintiffs' employeeChan Kwai Wah had read through the drafts. The two drafts were prepared by the same person. Mr. Yau, after instructions were givento him at the same time the previous day. Both drafts related to the take over transaction of the Shing On. By their own pleadingsthe plaintiffs allege that they signed the main agreement at the Golden City Restaurant in the presence of both defendants. Thisis in conflict with the 2nd plaintiff's evidence that the 2nd defendant was absont when they signed the main agreement. There isanother reason which leads me to reject the plaintiff's evidence that they never read the draft agreements before signing them. The2nd plaintiff maintained that after the documents were signed both the main agreement and the subsidiary agreement were taken awayfrom them by them defendants on the 27th February 1973. At that time the seal of the Shing On had not been applied to the main agreement.Yet one of the originals of the main agreement - Exhibit C2 - which was forwarded to the Far East Stock Exchange on the 27th February1973 had the seal of Shing On applied to it. Another copy of the original main agreement - Exhibit C1 - which had been kept in theoffice of Charles Marfan since early March 1973 also bore the Shing On seal. The Shing On seal was at all material times in the possessionof the plaintiffs up to the 4th May 1973. This lends support to the 1st defendant's evidence that the main agreement was signed andsealed in the Wing On Company on the 27th February 1973. On the balance of probability I also believe that the subsidiary agreementwas signed by the parties in the same place and in the same manner by the parties as alleged by the 1st defendant.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Having found that the plaintiffs signed the subsidiary agreement with full knowledge of the nature of its contents there is no roomfor doubt that the alleged oral agreement as set out in para.2 of the Statement of Claim never existed. Had there been such an oralagreement the plaintiffs would have raised an objection before they signed the subsidiary agreement. There is also no merit in theplaintiff's claim that the guarantee was signed on the 4th May 1973 to give effect to the true intention of the parties as expressedin the alleged oral agreement or in rectification of a mistake.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> There is no necessity to decide on the validity of the subsidiary agreement. It has been cancelled by mutual consent. It is sufficientto say that if the plaintiffs repudiated the subsidiary agreement solely on the ground that it did not represent the true intentionof the parties or of non est factum the plaintiff must fail for the reasons I have given.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I will now consider the evidence on the circumstances leading to the signing of the guarantee. The plaintiff's evidence is that the1st plaintiff left for Taiwan on the 18th April 1973. Shortly after that Mr. Chow Hin Yau of Hastings who looked after the propertyof the Shing On telephoned the 2nd plaintiff and informed her of a letter from Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co. which reads:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="8%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="86%" class="quote">We have instructions from Messrs.

As a result Chow wrote in reply in thefollowing terms:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="8%" class="quote">"</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="86%" class="quote">With reference to your letter of the 19th instant, we are instructed by our clients Messrs.

Chan returnedwith a copy of the subsidiary agreement. The 2nd plaintiff said that that was the first time she set eyes on the contents of thisdocument which was explained to her. Nothing was done until the 1st plaintiff returned from Taiwan on the 29th April 1973 and allpapers were handed to him. The 1st plaintiff took the matter up with the 1st defendant. The 1st plaintiff's attitude was that unlessa guarantee and indemnity for the price of the 2,520,000 Fu Chip shares was given by the defendants the plaintiffs would not completethe main agreement with the Fu Chip. On a day between the 30th April 1973 and the 3rd May 1973 the 1st defendant agreed to make afresh arrangement. As a result the guarantee was approved in draft between Chow Hin Yau of Hastings on their behalf and Yung, Yu,Yuen &amp; Co. on behalf of the defendants. In the afternoon on the 4th May 1973 they all went to Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co. and signedthe documents. The plaintiffs and the defendants signed for the cancellation of the subsidiary agreement Exhibit The plaintiffs signeda guarantee and indemnity - Exhibit A-39 and the defendants signed the guarantee - Exhibit A-37-38. The 2nd plaintiff can't rememberthe exact sequence of the documents being signed but says that they were signed one after another. Then the parties went to the officeof Charles Marfan to complete the transaction under the main agreement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The defence evidence is that after the main agreement and the subsidiary agreement were signed on the 27th February 1973 he tookthem back to the office of Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Co. He caused copies of the main agreement to be sent to Charles Marfan &amp; Co.,the Fu Chip's secretary and to the Far East Stock Exchange in connection with the Fu Chip's application for listing the new Fu Chipshares. On the 31st March 1973 the Far East Stock Exchange Ltd. approved the listing of the new shares. On the 2nd April 1973 the1st defendant telephoned the 2nd plaintiff to inform her of the approval and asked the plaintiffs to complete the transaction withthe Fu Chip. The 2nd plaintiff stated that her husband was still thinking over the matter. Since then the plaintiffs continued toavoid an answer on the excuse that the 1st plaintiff was away. On the 16th April 1973 the 1st defendant telephoned the 2nd plaintiffon the same subject. When the 2nd plaintiff asked for a guarantee as to the Fu Chip shares which the plaintiff agreed to retain forone year under the main agreement. This dispute continued in correspondence between the parties' solicitors until the 4th May 1973when the draft guarantee was agreeable to both parties. The defendants agreed to give the guarantee solely because the plaintiffsthreatened to repudiate the main agreement with the Fu Chip. The parties signed the cancellation of the subsidiary agreement first,then the guarantee. There was a further dispute as to how the plaintiffs could ensure that they would not dispose of the 60% of theFu Chip shares to be allotted to them. This resulted in the signing of another document by the plaintiffs to indemnify the defendantsshould they (the Plaintiffs) dispose of the said Fu Chip shares in breach of the main agreement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I have already found that there was no oral agreement between the parties in mid February 1973 for a guarantee to be given by thedefendants and that the plaintiffs knew of the nature of the subsidiary agreement. There is nothing to form the basis of the plaintiff'sdemand for the guarantee as told in the 2nd plaintiff's evidence. Exhibit 21 was written by Chow Hin Yau on instructions of the 2ndplaintiff. Had there been an oral agreement as alleged Mr. Chow would have written for a guarantee of 60% only of the shares so allottedto the plaintiffs and not for 100% of them. Mr. Chow said that the 2nd plaintiff gave the figure to him before he wrote Exhibit 21.I find as a fact that the only reason why the plaintiffs asked for a guarantee in April 1973 is that they realised by then that theyhad not obtained a good bargain after all. That probably is the reason for the Plaintiffs' change of attitude in April 1973. Theevidence is that both parties were keen to go through the transactions at the time the main agreement was signed. There is also evidencethat by early April the 1st plaintiff had known of the approval to deal in the Fu Chip shares to be allotted to the plaintiffs bythe Far East Stock Exchange. His departure for Taiwan before the completion of the main agreement is difficult to under-stand. Inthis connection I find the 2nd plaintiff's evidence that the 1st defendant did not inform the plaintiffs of the said approval inApril illogical and unsatisfactory.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> There is also evidence that both the plaintiffs and the defendants were optimistic about the price of the Fu Chip shares. In factthe feeling was such that it was better to hold shares than cash. Although the price of the Fu Chip shares suffered a slight setback in late April 1973 it was considered that that was in sympathy with the general market. At that time the plaintiffs and thedefendants could not have foreseen that the market, including the Fu Chip shares would continue to slump to such an extent as wasfound in the latter part of 1973. The 1st plaintiff's decision to go to Taiwan was made probably in order to play for time and toenable the 2nd plaintiff to start a new bargain. No reason was given for the necessity of his Taiwan trip. It is more inexplicablewhy he should leave at a time when it was essential for him to remain in Hong Kong to complete the main agreement with the Fu Chip.He knew by that time an announcement of the acquisition by the Fu Chip of the Shing On shares had been made to the public. He knewalso that the defendants were anxious to see to that the Fu Chip completing the transaction. He knew that the longer the defendantshad to wait the better bargaining power he would have in his hand. In short he knew he had the upper hand over the defendants whowould have to agree even if he wanted something more than the original bargain viz: the subsidiary agreement. In my opinion his threatof refusing to complete was, for the plaintiffs, a good starting point for a new bargain and his temporary absence a very shrewdmove.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> It is not necessary for me to decide on the sequence in which the guarantee, the cancellation of the subsidiary agreement and theindemnity, Exhibit A-39, were signed. The 2nd plaintiff's evidence on this point is hazy. The defence evidence is that the cancellationof the subsidiary agreement was signed first. However, subject to the question of admissibility of extrinsic evidence, a questionI shall deal with later, I am of the opinion that the guarantee was signed by the defendants solely to induce the plaintiffs to completethe main transaction and nothing else. Had the indemnity, Exhibit A-39, been a consideration for the guarantee it would have beenincluded in the text of the guarantee in however general a term. It will be observed that the draft of the guarantee had been throughthe hands of solicitors' clerks at least 3 or 4 times and was finally submitted to a solicitor who had read and explained it to theparties before execution. On this point I am inclined to accept the 1st defendant's evidence that the indemnity, Exhibit A-39, wassigned by the plaintiffs on a subsequent demand by the defendants after the guarantee had been signed. As to the cancellation itis the plaintiffs' own evidence that it was cancelled for one reason and one reason alone viz: it did not represent their true intention.The guarantee was to replace it.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> It remains for me to consider how in fact this alleged threat on the part of the plaintiffs affected the defendants. That the defendantswere thoroughly disgruntled is beyond doubt. Because of the plaintiffs' change they had to give up what they considered to be a verygood bargain in the subsidiary agreement. In its place they were asked to sign a guarantee as to the price of a block of shares inthe Fu Chip. In this way they could gain nothing even if the price should go up. At the time the main agreement was signed the partieswere optimistic as well as enthusiastic. In the words of the 1st defendant the plaintiffs were hoping to "play bank" together withhim on the Fu Chip shares - meaning controlling the market of such shares by buying and selling. There was some evidence that theprice of the Fu Chip shares in April was not as high as it was in February or March 1973. But the price for such shares was stillmuch higher than its normal value of $1.00 each. Further the 1st defendant was still fairly confident. In cross-examination he said:"I continued to buy the Fu Chip shares to support the price. I knew the Fu Chip shares were not worth $3.00 each then. But in thosedays it was a blind chase." The 1st defendant frankly admitted that in February and March he purchased a lot of the Fu Chip sharesin order to push up the price and then resell at a profit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In answer to questions in cross-examination about the price movements of the Fu Chip shares the 1st defendant said:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">Q.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">As to Fu Chip shares between 23rd February 1973 and 27th February 1973 prices at Far East between $2.90 and $3.50?</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">A.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">Agree.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">Q.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">But in Exhibit E, the prices you paid were as high as $4,00?</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">A.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">Yes.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">Q.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">In Far East Exchange the price on 5th March 1973 went up to $4.60?</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">A.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">I believe so, though can't remember.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">Q.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">Near end of March 1973 the prices about $3.30?</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">A.</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">Can't remember.

At thetime the demand was made the 1st defendant placed the matter in the hands of his solicitors. He had proper legal advice. He knewvery well whether he gave the guarantee or not the main agreement between the Fu Chip and the plaintiffs was still valid as a separatedocument. The Fu Chip could have sued the plaintiffs for specific performance or for damages. Out of the original issued and paidup capital of 12,600,000 shares in the Fu Chip the 1st defendant owned 6,531,000 shares (see Exhibit D at page 17). In addition hehad purchased more since the listing of such shares. His brother, the 2nd defendant owned 1,500,000 million shares. Between the twoof them they owned the controlling interests of the Fu Chip. By then the 1st defendant had already set himself about in manipulatingthe price of the Fu Chip shares by buying and selling. If the defendants refused to give the guarantee on the Fu Chip shares, thenthe Fu Chip shares might drop a few 10 in price only if the general condition of the market remained bullish. It would be possiblefor the 1st defendant to push the price up again with his manipulation. The Fu Chip, after all, is an investment Company. All itsassets consist of landed property. So long as the properties in the Fu Chip have been quoted in their true value the success or failurein the taking over of the Shing On could not have affected the true value of the Fu Chip shares. Whatever set back in the marketprice of the Fu Chip shares could not have sent them below their true value. Even if it did, the defendants might have suffered atemporary paper loss of profit but would not have suffered a financial ruin. The 1st defendant did threaten that the Fu Chip wouldsue the plaintiffs on the main agreement. However, in the end he chose to avoid litigation and yielded to the plaintiffs' demand.The 1st defendant must have considered the matter thoroughly in the light of the then marketing condition and formed the opinionthat the risk in giving the guarantee was more apparent than real. As I have said earlier on, neither party at the time could haveforeseen the stock market subsequently slumping in such manner. Had the plaintiffs realised that the prices in general in the stockmarket would fall to the extent as we now know then they would not even bother to demand for the guarantee. They would be quite satisfiedwith the subsidiary agreement. Therefore I find as a fact that when the defendants agreed to sign the guarantee neither they northe plaintiffs envisaged a drastic fall of the market and that the defendants never expected that on the guarantee they might berequired to compensate the plaintiffs in terms of millions of dollars. This was an error of judgment in a business deal. The defendantswere reluctant to be deprived of a good bargain - the subsidiary agreement. But I find that they were quito prepared to take a calculatedrisk (which at the time appeared to be very little) in order to pacify the plaintiffs who were adamant. It was in such circumstancesthat the guarantee was given.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Having come to the aforesaid conclusions on the facts of this case I shall deal now with some questions of law and other alternativeissues before I return to the ultimate question - the binding effect of the guarantee. The first question is whether extrinsic evidenceis admissible to show the circumstances under which the various documents were signed or for the interpretation of the guarantee.Here the plaintiff pleaded that they signed the subsidiary agreement without knowing its contents which never reflected the genuineintention of the parties. On the other hand the defendants plead that the guarantee was signed under duress or as the result of anunconscienable bargain. Both are relevant issues or questions relevant to the issue. It is only proper that parol evidence shouldbe admissible to show the circumstances leading to the execution of both documents. Extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove anymatter which by substantive law affects the validity of a document or entitles a party to any relief in respect thereof. See Phipsonon evidence - p. 1789 and p.1802. Learned Counsel for the parties have not seriously challenged the admissibility of extrinsic evidencerelating to the execution of these two documents. Mr. Zimmern for the defendants, however, contends that the extrinsic evidence isnot admissible to contradict or vary the plain terms of the guarantee. The guarantee - Exhibit B, reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "In consideration of your having at our request agreed to sell all your shares of and in the above mentioned Company whoseregistered office is situate at 274 Sha Tsui Road Ground Floor Tsuen Wan New Territories in the Colony of Hong Kong for the considerationof $10,500,000 by the allotment of 4,200,000 shares of $1.00 each of Fu Chip Investment Company Limited whose registered office issituate at No. 33 Wing Lok Street Victoria in the said Colony of Hong Kong and that the market value for the said ordinary sharesof the said Fu Chip Investment Company Limited shall be deemed as $2.50 for each of the $1.00 shares under an Agreement for saleand purchase made between the parties thereto and dated the 27th day of February 1973, we Lau Yiu Long of No. 152 Tin Hau TempleRoad, Flat Cl, Summit Court, 14th Floor in the Colony of Hong Kong Kowloon Merchant and Benjamin Lau Kam Ching of No. 31 Ming YuenStreet West, Basement in the said Colony of Hong Kong Merchant the director of the said Fu Chip Investment Company, Limited herebyagree and guarantee the market value for the said 4,200,000 ordinary shares of the said Fu Chip Investment Company shall be $2.50per share and that the total value shall be of the sum of $6,300,000 for the period between 15th of April 1974 to the 30th of April1974 and we further agree to indemnify and deep you indemnified against any damages, losses and other expenses which you may incuror sustain in the event of the market price according to The Far East Stock Exchange Ltd shall fall short of the $2.50 during thesaid period between 15th April 1974 and the 30th April 1974 that no time or indulgence granted for the said Fu Chip Investment CompanyLimited shall exonerate our liabilities hereunder."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> It is submitted that the consideration referred therein was a past consideration. Any extrinsic evidence tending to prove a presentor executory consideration would be in contradiction of a plain term of the guarantee and as such should be inadmissible. Mr. Gittinsfor the plaintiffs contends, however, that the form of the guarantee is exactly the same as those contained in the Encyclopaediaof Forms and Precedents (See Vol. 9 Encyclopaedia of Forms and Precedents p. 777-824) and that extrinsic evidence is always admissibleto show the true consideration - in the present case, the plaintiffs completion of the main agreement with the Fu Chip.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The common law rule that no extrinsic evidence is admissible to contradict the plain terms of a written agreement has been subjectmatter of many judicial interpretations which indicate a fair number of exceptions. Thus in para. 650 of Chitty on Contracts it issaid:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "Extrinsic evidence may therefore be admitted to show want of or failure of the consideration stated to have been givenin a written instrument. Thus the words in a bill of exchange 'for value received' do not preclude the court from finding that noconsideration has in fact been given. Extrinsic evidence is also admissible to prove the true consideration where no considerationhas been stated or where the consideration is inaccurately recorded. Also an additional consideration may be proved, provided itdoes not contradict the stated consideration. 'The rule is that, where there is one consideration stated in a deed, you may proveany other consideration which existed, not in contradiction to the instrument; and it is not in contradiction to the instrument toprove a larger consideration than that which is stated."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> In the case of <u>Wood</u> v. <u>Wise</u><sup>(1)</sup> where a lease of rent restricted premises was expressed to be granted "in consideration of the sum of Â£850" in addition to the rentreserved in the lease extrinsic evidence was admitted to show that the sum of Â£850 expressed in the lease was in fact commuted rentintended by the landlord and tenant and not a premium or a condition of the grant. Evershed M.R. said at p.39 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "There was a good deal of discussion of the question whether it was permissible for the court to hear extrinsic evidenceof the bargain made, or whether the court in this matter was confined to the deed. It is convenient for me to deal first with thatpoint, and I conclude that extrinsic evidence was clearly admissible, though the result of so concluding is far from decisive ofthe case. I note that this is not an action on the deed; the question here is whether the plaintiff has a statutory right of actionunder section 2(5) of the Act of 1949. Moreover, if she has, then prima facie the defendant has done that which was illegal, andfor which he is liable to criminal proceedings. As a matter of principle, therefore, evidence must be admissible to prove the truenature of the transaction; but, further, the evidence is required not to vary the deed, but with a view to explaining and provingwhat was in truth the consideration. For this purpose extrinsic evidence has always been admissible."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Romer L.J. said at p. 54:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Morever, the extrinsic evidence is not sought to be introduced in the present case with a view to contradicting anything that isexpressed in the lease, but in order to show what was the true nature of the Â£850, which, it is to be observed, is nowhere describedin the lease as a 'premium'."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In <u>Goldshede</u> v. <u>Swan</u><sup>(2)</sup> the consideration expressed in a quarantee for a loan was:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In consideration of your having this day advanced to our client, Mr. Vernon Dolphin of Piccadilly, in the county of Middlesex, thesum of Â£750, secured by his warrant of attorney, payable on the 22nd day of August next, we hereby jointly and severally undertaketo pay the same on the said 22nd day of August, or so soon afterwards as you apply for same, in case default should be made in paymentof the sum of Â£750."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">It was held that extrinsic evidence was admissible to show that the consideration expressed in the document of guarantee was in factan executory consideration. At p.159 Pollock, C.B. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where any written instrument is ambiguous, evidence is receivable to construe its meaning, but not to alter or vary in any mannerthe terms of that instrument. Here it was proved, that the guarantee was given, and that the money was thereupon advanced. In thecase of Butcher v. Stewart, the memorandum was held to be prospective, and judgment was given for the plaintiff. That case is verysimilar to the present. It was a special case, and eas very recently decided. The present case also falls within the same principleas that of Haigh v. Brooks. The expression 'this day' may mean something which has been done, or which is to be done this day. Evidencemay therefore be properly admitted to explain its meani, g though not to contradict it. The words are not to have that grammaticalstrictness of construction put upon them for which the defendant's counsel contends; but such a one as will explain the meaning ofthe parties."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The principle of extrinsic evidence being admissible to prove additional consideration to the consideration expressed in a powerof attorney was approved in <u>Frith</u> v. <u>Frith</u><sup>(3)</sup> where Lord Atkinson citing the case of <u>Clifford</u> v. <u>Turrell</u> said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Vice-Chancellor (Sir L.

In the present case the extrinsic evidencepurports to explain that the consideration which was described in the guarantee as "having agreed to sell" in accordance with theterms of the main agreement of the 27th February 1973 was in fact an executory consideration of "agreeing to sell" or "agreeing tocomplete the sale" on the 4th May 1973. Following the same reasoning which fell from the learned Chief Baron, I am of the opinionthat extrinsic evidence in the present case is admissible to explain the terms in the guarantee. Such evidence is not contradictory.On the contrary it purports to show the true nature of the consideration. Indeed it is the Defence case that the plaintiffs demandedthe guarantee as a condition for their willingness to complete the sale in the main agreement. I am of the opinion that parol evidenceor extrinsic evidence is properly admissible in the present case for the interpretation of the consideration expressed in the guarantee.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> There is a subsidiary and related contention to this. It is suggested that an agreement to do something which the plaintiffs wereunder a legal duty to do to a third party could not constitute a valuable consideration. The plaintiffs were under a duty to theFu Chip to complete the sale of the Shing On shares to the Fu Chip under the main agreement. Thus their agreement with the defendantsto do the same was in fact no consideration at all.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> In my opinion this problem is more juristic as a mental exercise than judicial. In the words of the learned authors of Cheshire andFifoot in the Law of Contract (8th eddition) "the paucity of modern litigation on the question suggests that it is not a pressingproblem". Having considered the relevant authorities the principle obtained, as I understand it, is that the performance of or apromise to perform a duty to a third party is valuable consideration for endorcing a promise by the promisor provided that such performanceof or undertaking to perform the said duty is to the detriment of the promisee or to the benefit of the promisor. See Cheshire andFifoot on Law of Contract 8th edition p. 92-95, Chitty on Contracts Vol. 1 23rd edition para. 130-132; also <u>Shadwell</u> v. <u>Shadwell</u><sup>(5)</sup>; <u>Scotsen</u> v. <u>Pegg</u><sup>(6)</sup>; <u>Turner</u> v. <u>Owen</u><sup>(7)</sup> and <u>Chichester</u> v. <u>Cobb</u><sup>(8)</sup>. This principle was the ratio in <u>Scotsen</u> v. <u>Pegg</u> which received the approval of the majority decision of the Privy Council in New Zealand was <u>Shipping</u> v. <u>Satterthwaite</u><sup>(9)</sup> where Lord Wilberforce at page.1020 said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In their Lordships' opinion, consideration may quite well be provided by the stevedore, as suggested, even though (or if) it wasalready under an obligation to discharge to the carrier. (There is no direct evidence of the existence or nature of this obligation,but their Lordships are prepared to assume it.) An agreement to do an act which the promisor is under an existing obligation to athird party to do, may quite well amount to valid consideration and does so in the present case: the promisee obtains the benefitof the direct obligation which he can enforce. This proposition is illustrated and supported by Scotsen v. Pegg which their Lordshipsconsider to be good law."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> In the present case the promise or act of selling the Shing On share to the Fu Chip by the plaintiffs could be valuable considerationfor the guarantee signed by the defendants.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Such act or promise might not be to the detriment of the plaintiffs. But it was for the benefit of the defendants. In the words ofthe 1st defendant he was anxious that the plaintiffs should complete the transaction in the main agreement. Their refusal to completewould affect the share price of the Fu Chip of which he was the majority shareholder. It is the defendants' case that the guaranteewas signed solely on the plaintiffs' demand for the guarantee before the plaintiff would perform the main agreement. Although thedefendants were unwilling they eventually signed the guarantee so that the plaintiffs would complete the transaction.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> It is contended by the plaintiffs that the guarantee was signed in consideration of the cancellation of the subsidiary agreement.Such cancellation would, of course, be sufficient consideration if it was the true intention of the parties. I have found as a factthat that was not so.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The guarantee never referred to the cancellation of the subsidiary agreement as a consideration. The plaintiffs' evidence is suchthat at all material times they never suggested the cancellation of the subsidiary agreement as a quid pro quo for the guarantee.On the contrary, the plaintiffs' evidence is that the terms of the subsidiary agreement never represented their true intention andshould be cancelled in any event and should be replaced by a guarantee which would give effect to their true intention. The evidenceof the 2nd plaintiff and that of Chan Kwai Wah suggest that the plaintiffs would refuse to complete the transaction under the mainagreement with the Fu Chip unless the defendants give them a guarantee as to the price of the Fu Chip shares allotted to them. Inhis evidence in chief Chan Kwai Wah said "I did mention to Lau that Pao did not want an agreement of sale in advance and would onlyaccept a form originally agreed to viz: a straight guarantee that the value would be the same for one year".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Indeed such intention was manifested in the letter of Hastings, acting for the Shing On, to Yung, Yu, Yuen &amp; Company - ExhibitA-21. At that time, predominent in the mind of the plaintiffs was that the subsidiary agreement should be cancelled in any eventbut they would not complete the transaction with the Fu Chip unless the defendants gave them the guarantee. I have found as a factthat there was no oral agreement as alleged by the plaintiffs and that the subsidiary agreement was not signed by mistake. Thereis no basis for this claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> In view of the foregoing I also find that even if the guarantee is invalid such finding will not bring the subsidiary agreement backinto force. The general rule is that a recision is implied where the parties have effected such an alteration of the terms as tosubstitute a new contract in place of the old. If a recision is effected the contract is extinguished and it cannot afterwards beset up again by one of the parties against the other. The decisions in <u>Egremont</u> v. <u>Courtenay</u><sup>(10)</sup> and in <u>Firth</u> v. <u>Midland Railway Co.</u><sup>(11)</sup> are not true contradictions to this principle.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> In the Egremont case the surrender of the old lease depended on the validity of the new lease. Once the new lease was held invalidit is not surprising that the surrender was equally inoperative. This is eviden in the judgment of Coleridge, J. who said at p. 686:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There were the counterparts of three leases produced, of the respective dates of 1755, 1785 and 1812; and the plaintiff's case wasthat the two latter were invalid, which was admitted, and that the last was granted in consideration of the surrender of the first,and operated as a surrender of it. This was necessary to his case, as one of the lives on which the lease of 1755 was granted wasstill in being, and that lease still in force unless so surrendered. But the defendant contended that the surrender having been madewholly in consideration of the grant of a new and valid lease, did not take effect because the new lease was invalid."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">and again at page 688:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We have had occasion to consider this doctrine in another case of the same sort, and to examine the decisions at some length, andwe need not now repeat that examination, contenting ourselves with saying the principal to be found laid down by Lord Mansfield inWilson v. Sewell (1766) 1 Wm. B1. 617 4 Burr at p. 1980 and Davision d. Bromley v. Stanley (1768) 4 Burr. at p. 2213 seems to usthe true one; that when a new lease does not pass an interest according to the contract, the acceptance of it will not operate asa surrender of the former lease; that, in the case of a surrender implied by law from the acceptance of a new lease, the conditionought also to be understood as implied by law, making void the surrender in case the new lease should be made void; and that in casethe express surrender is so expressed as to show the intention of the parties to make the surrender only in consideration of thegrant, the sound construction of such an instrument, in order to effectuate the intention of the parties, would make the surrenderalso conditional, to be void in case the grant should be void."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> In Firth's case the new agreement merely provided a substituted mode of performance of precisely what was required to be done inthe old agreement. When the substituted mode of performance could not be carried out specific performance was ordered in accordancewith the old agreement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> In the Egremont case the consideration for the surrender of the old lease was the grant of a new lease. In the Firth case the substanceof the new agreement was a variation of the mode of the performance of what was to be done under the old agreement. It was in suchcircumstances that the terms of the old agreement were received when those of the new agreement became void or voidable. In the presentcase the plaintiff pleaded that the subsidiary agreement (the old agreement) was void because the parties were not ad idem and thatit was voidable on the ground of non est factum. The guarantee, (the new agreement) made no reference to the old agreement as considerationfor the new agreement. It is the plaintiffs' case that the subsidiary agreement was rescinded on such grounds. The basis for theguarantee, according to the plaintiffs' pleadings, is that it gave effect to the true intention of the parties who had a verbal agreementin mid February 1973. To hold that the invalidity of the guarantee alone could case a resurrection of the subsidiary agreement wouldbe wrong in law and amounting to allowing the plaintiffs to approbate and reprobate in saying that the subsidiary agreement was invalidand valid in the same breath.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> It is alleged that the defendants' conduct in signing and giving the guarantee constitute a representation that the guarantee isvalid and effective so as to induce the plaintiffs to complete the transaction with the Fu Chip. Relying on such representation theplaintiffs acted to their detriment by agreeing to cancel the subsidiary agreement. The short answer to this contention is that itwas the plaintiffs who demanded the guarantee because the subsidiary agreement never represented their true intention. The demandby the plaintiffs was not induced by the defendants' representation. I have found that the plaintiffs would demand for the cancellationof the subsidiary agreement in any event. In my opinion this plea revolves round the question whether the guarantee was forced uponthe defendants by threat or as a result of an unconscienable bargain. If the guarantee was signed without any threat then the plaintiffscan sue upon the guarantee. Otherwise the plaintiffs cannot rely on estoppel to change the nature of a voidable document (i.e. thesubsidiary agreement). Estoppel is an equitable remedy which is not available to any party who comes to Court with tainted hands.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Lastly I will consider the ultimate question - the binding effect of the guarantee on the defendants. I have found that the plaintiffs,well knowing the detrimental effect on the prince of Fu Chip shares and on the defendants' financial position if they refused tohonour the main agreement with the Fu Chip, threatened to repudiate the main agreement unless the defendants signed the guarantee.Learned Counsel contends that the guarantee was signed under a threat or as a result of an unconscienable bargain. It falls uponme to find whether in law and in fact such a threat renders the guarantee unenforceable. A number of cases have been cited as relevantto this question of law.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> In <u>D. &amp; C. Builders Ltd.</u> v. <u>Rees</u><sup>(12)</sup> it was held that financial intimidation would vitiate a true accord to accept a lesser sum than the amount of the debt so that thecreditor was not barred from suing for the balance by accepting the lesser sum. In that case the creditors were, to the knowledgeof the debtor, in desperate finanoial straits. The debtor then indicated to them that he (the debtor) would pay a lesser sum in satisfactionor nothing. In the words of Danckwerts L.J. at p. 626:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Rees really behaved very badly. They knew of the plaintiffs' financial difficulties and used their awkward situation to intimidatethem. The plaintiffs did not wish to accept the sum of Â£300 in discharge of the debt of Â£482, but were desperate to get some money."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The case of <u>Rookes</u> v. <u>Barnard</u><sup>(13)</sup> is the authority for the proposition that the tort of intimidation comprehends not only threats of criminal or tortious acts butalso threats of breaches of contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> In <u>Barton</u> v. <u>Armstrong and others</u><sup>(14)</sup> it was held that where the plaintiff proved that threats were used (in that case, threats of murder) and the threats were a reasonfor the plaintiff executing a deed the plaintiff was entitled to relief to have the deed set aside even though he might well haveentered into the contract if no threats had been uttered to induce him to do so and that it was for the defendant to prove that thethreats and unlawful pressure did not in fact contribute to the plaintiffs' decision to sign the deed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> The case of <u>Lloyds Bank</u> v. <u>Bundy</u><sup>(15)</sup> appeared to have been decided on special circumstances. It was decided on the basis of a breach of fiderciary care on the part ofthe Bank towards its client, an old man, who executed a guarantee and a charge on his property in order to assist his son from financialruin. The Court of Appeal held on evidence that the Bank failed to ensure that the client had independent and informed advice whetherthere was any prospect of the son's Company's affairs becoming viable and that there was inequality of bargaining power. Having enunciatedthe general rule of the law that no bargain would be upset which was the result of the ordinary interplay of forces Lord DenningM.R. said at p. 763:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Yet there are exceptions to this general rule. There are cases in our books in which the courts will set aside a contract, or a transferof property, when the parties have not met on equal terms, when the one is so strong in bargaining power and the other so weak that,as a matter of common fairness, it is not right that the strong should be allowed to push the weak to the wall. Hitherto those exceptionalcases have been treated each as a separate category in itself. But I think the time has come when we should seek to find a principleto unite them. I put on one side contracts or transactions which are voidable for fraud or misrepresentation or mistake. All thoseare governed by settled principles. I go only to those where there has been inequality of bargaining power, such as to merit theintervention of the court."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> He went on to give a number of examples in cases where the court would grant relief and said in conclusion at p. 765:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Gathering all together, I would suggest that through all these instances there runs a single thread. They rest on 'inequality ofbargaining power'. By virtue of it, the English law gives relief to one who, without independent advice, enters into a contract onterms which are very unfair or transfers property for a consideration which is grossly inadequate, when his bargaining power is grievouslyimpaired by reason of his own needs or desires, or by his own ignorance or infirmity, coupled with undue influences or pressuresbrought to bear on him by or for the benefit of the other. When I use the word 'undue' I do not mean to suggest that the principledepends on proof of any wrongdoing. The one who stipulates for an unfair advantage may be moved solely by his own self-interest,unconscious of the distress he is bringing to the other. I have also avoided any reference to the will of the one being 'dominated'or 'overcome' by the other. One who is in extreme need may knowingly consent to a most improvident bargain, solely to relieve thestraits in which he finds himself. Again, I do not mean to suggest that every transaction is saved by independent advice. But theabsence of it may be fatal. With these explanations, I hope this principle will be found to reconcile the cases."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> On this point Sir Eric Sachs said at p. 771:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As regards the wider areas covered in masterly survey in the judgment of Lord Denning M.R., but not raised arguendo, I do not ventureto express an opinion - though having some sympathy with the views that the courts should be able to give relief to a party who hasbeen subject to undue pressure as defined in the concluding passage of his judgment on that point."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> This principle was further explained by Lord Denning M.R. in <u>Clifford Davis Management Ltd.</u> v. <u>W.E.A.

However the Court will not enforce a contract which is forced upon a party who stands in such unequal bargaining powerthat he is driven to the wall and derives virtually no benefit from the contract or, at best, in obviously unconscienable bargain.To this principle the facts in the Bundy case, the Clifford Davis case and the D. &amp; C. Builders case are classic examples. Inthis connection the Court will look into the bargaining power of the parties bearing in mind that a threat of breach of contractmay well be a form of intimidation so as to place one party in an advantageous position and that once it is proved that the threatis a reason for the other party to enter into the contract it is up to the threatening party to prove that the threat did not infact contribute to the other party entering into the contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> In the present case I find as a fact that the defendants signed the guarantee in error of judgment by yielding to the plaintiffs'demand.

That was not more than 5 per cent of the highest value paid for the Fu Chip shares in March 1973. That would notcause the financial ruin of the defendants.

Otherwise they would have raised the point much earlier.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> Further, the defendants owned the controlling interests of the Fu Chip. They could have stood firm and caused the Fu Chip to suethe plaintiffs for breach of the main agreement.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> In the business world it is a frequent occurrence that the contracting parties are not equal in bargaining power. So long as thelaw of supply and demand obtains in matters of economics it does not require great imagination to accept such a phenomenon. So longas one party does not make such unconscienable demand as to give virtually nothing in return or that the other party is not drivento desperation for the bargain one has to accept that the contract is simply the result of ordinary interplay of forces.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> Having regard to the circumstances of the present case I am of the opinion that the defendants merely yielded to a temptation oftaking the easy way out to solve a problem by accepting a risk far greater than their expectation. The defendants' position was muchstronger than that of the farmer in the Bundy case and the builder in the D. &amp; C. Builder case. In the circumstances of thiscase I find that the case does not merit the intervention of the Court for the guarantee to be declared unenforceable. In short thedefendants are bound by the guarantee. There will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $5,392,800.00 with costs.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left"> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left">(1)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%202%20QB%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 2 Q.B. 29.</a></p>    <p align="left">(2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1847-8) 1 Ex. p.154.</a></p>    <p align="left">(3)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%20AC%20254" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) A.C. 254</a></p>    <p align="left">(4)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20All%20ER%20746" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 A.E.R. 746.</a></p>    <p align="left">(5)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281860%29%209%20CB%20%28NS%29%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1860) 9 C.B.
