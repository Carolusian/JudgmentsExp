In the course of theevening, there was an altercation at a nearby table and the Plaintiff intervened to pacify the participants. Nothing more eventuateduntil some considerable time later when, with others, he left the nightclub. As he left, he saw lying on the pavement a man coveredin blood. This man - Police Constable Poon Chun Wah - was one of those who had participated in the earlier altercation. The Plaintiffwas approached by another person present outside the restaurant and an accusation of having organised the attack upon the woundedman was levelled at him. The Plaintiff denied this but at that point another person, who had also been one of the participants inthe altercation, came upon the scene, informed the Plaintiff that he was a policeman and directed the Plaintiff to remain where hewas.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> That man had identified himself properly for he was one Chan Chi Fai, a serving police constable. Other members of the Royal HongKong Police Force then arrived at the scene and the Plaintiff was taken to Wanchai Police Station.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> At about 5:25 a.m. on the morning of the 4th, the Plaintiff was interviewed by Constable Chan, was formally arrested by him and wascautioned in respect of his involvement in a wounding offence. The Plaintiff was detained and was later charged with a series ofother offences, including c1aiming to be an office bearer of a triad society; the wounding offence; another wounding under s.19 andtwo offences of assaulting a police officer. He was detained in police custody and on the 5th of June, having been taken before aMagistrates Court, was granted bail. As a condition of that bai1, the Plaintiff was required to surrender his travel documents andto make a report twice per week to the Wanchai Police Station.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> On the 12th June, the Plaintiff again appeared in the Magistrates Court and his bail was extended. On the 19th June, on his finalappearance in the Magistrates Court, the Crown offered no evidence in respect of all of the offences other than the two woundingoffences. On the 8th July, the matter having been transferred to the Victoria District Court, the Plaintiff pleaded not guilty tothose charges and was remanded upon bail for trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> While awaiting trial, and at some time in late August or early September, Constable Chan contacted the brother of the Plaintiff indicatingthat the criminal charges in respect of the Plaintiff were "negotiable". In November, Constable Chan indicated that he required $54,000to influence the evidence he would give at trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> On the 6th November, the Plaintiff and his brother made a report to the Independent Commission Against Corruption. On the 10th November,acting under the instructions of members of the Commission, the Plaintiff and his brother met with Constable Chan. Present then werePoon Chun Wah and two others. The Plaintiff handed over $15,000, which had been provided to him by the Commission, to one of theothers. Constable Chan and his companions were arrested. On the 16th November, the Attorney General entered a nolle prosequi in respectof the remaining charges then outstanding against the Plaintiff. In the following year, Chan Chi Fai and Poon Chun Wah were convictedof offences relating to the perversion of justice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Plaintiff issued his writ on the 9th May 1984 and he pleaded that Constable Chan, purporting to act in the course of his duty</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âwrongfully, maliciously and without reasonable cause arrested and detained the Plaintiff at Wanchai Police Stationâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">The gravamen of the Plaintiff's complaint is that he was falsely imprisoned for a period of 32 hours on the 4th to the 5th of June1981. In his Defence, filed in 1985, the Attorney General admitted that Chan Chi Fai was a police officer and admitted that he âwrongfully,maliciously and without reasonable cause arrestedâ the Plaintiff. The period of detention was also admitted as was the subsequenthistory of the matter and the convictions of Chan Chi Fai and Poon Chun Wah.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The Attorney General relied on a lack of any authority in Constable Chan to make an unlawful arrest, the malice as pleaded takingthe servant outside the scope of his employment so that vicarious liability was negatived.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> In a careful and detailed judgment, His Honour Judge Evans, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, upheld the Attorney General'scontentions and dismissed the claim. He accepted that there was no doubt that Constable Chan had grievously wronged the Plaintiffand he accepted that Constable Chan was a Crown servant, a finding which is not challenged. He relied on that which he describedas "the well known passageâ in Salmond on Torts at page 437 as to the liability of a master for the acts of his servant. That passagesuccinctly states the law that a master id not responsible for a wrongful act done by his servant unless it is in the course of hisemployment. It is deemed to be in the course of his employment if it is either a wrongful act authorised by the master or a wrongfuland unauthorised mode of doing some act authorised by the master, a master being responsible not merely for what he authorises hisservant to do but also for the way in which that servant does it. The passage continues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIf a servant does negligently that which he was authorised to do carefully or if he does fraudulently that which he was authorisedto do honestly or if he does mistakenly that which he was authorised to do correctly, his master will answer for that negligence,fraud, or mistake. On the other hand, if the unauthorised and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorisedact as to be a mode of doing it, but an independent act, the master is not responsible: for in such a case the servant is not actingin the course of his employment but has gone outside of it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> When considering the actions of a member of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force references to that which I might term âpolice casesâin other jurisdictions may well be of little use. The method by which they are given authority differs considerably. In Hong Kongsuch a person is a Crown servant and his authority derives from the Crown. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300">Cap.300</a> makes clear the liability of the Crown in respect of tortious acts committed by its servants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The issue here is whether the malice pleaded, and gratefully accepted by the Attorney General, is sufficient to take what was undoubtedlyan authorised act done by-a Crown servant outside the ambit of the course of the employment of that Crown servant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In the Court below, reliance was placed upon <u>Kooragang Investment Pty. Limited v. Richardson &amp; Wrench<a>[1]</a></u>. I prefer to consider the matter as reported in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] A.C. 462.</a> There a valuer, who was the defendantsâ servant, carried out valuations on the defendants' behalf for a client group of companies.The valuations were made with the defendants' knowledge and authority. Then the companies failed to pay for the valuations and thedefendants instructed their servant not to carry out any more work for that client group. Later the valuer became a director of oneof the client group's member companies and thereafter, and without the knowledge or authority of the defendants, carried out aboutthirty valuations for it. In preparing those valuations, the servant used the premises of the group, the note paper of the defendantsand signed the valuations in the corporate name of the defendants. No fee was paid to the defendants. Two of the valuations werepassed on to the plaintiffs investment company. They were negligently made and the plaintiffs suffered financial loss. The plaintiffssought to recover against the defendants as being vicariously liable for the actions of their servant valuer. In the Supreme Courtof New South Wales the action was dismissed. The matter came before the Judicial Committee and the plaintiffs' appeal was dismissed.It was held that an employer's actual authority to his servant to do particular act could not be inferred merely from the fact thatthe act itself was of a class which the employer had authorised his servant to do. The servant valuerâs act was clearly an authorisedclass of act by itself. But by reason of the instructions given to him in doing the acts complained of and which resulted in financialloss to the plaintiffs against the direct instructions of the defendants he was acting outside the scope of his employment. It isin that factual light that one must view the words of Lord Wilberforce at page 473F:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt remains true to say that, whatever exceptions or qualifications may be introduced, the underlying principle remains that a servant,even while performing acts of the class which he was authorised, or employed, to do, may so clearly depart from the scope of hisemployment that his master will not be liable for his wrongful acts.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> In my judgment, the situation here is not analogous to that in <u>Kooragang</u><sup>1</sup>. It is clear that Constable Chan's acts, and indeed the-trial judge so found, were acts which he was authorised and empowered toperform and were within the ambit or scope-of his employment. But the judge then went on to consider whether Constable Chan's actwas "excessive" and if so, whether excess was so great as to take his act outside the vicarious liability of his employer. He thoughtit to be a matter of degree and said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"The greater the excess to the point of abuse of a power authorised or instructed to be used legitimately, the further away from liabilityfor that excess the employer becomes."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The judge concluded, borrowing as he did so the words of Lord Wilberforce in <u>Kooragang</u><sup>1</sup> where commenting on the issue before the Judicial Committee Lord Wilberforce said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"A clearer case of departure from the course or scope of employment cannot be imagined: it was total .....",</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">that here the excess and abuse of power was in the same category and therefore in such a situation, the employer cannot be held answerablefor the acts of his servant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> With respect to the trial judge, on the facts of <u>Kooragang</u><sup>1</sup> the comment by Lord Wilberforce obviously lay. On the face of the facts here, it does not.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The reference to "excess" stems from a passage from the judgment of Scrutton L.J. in <u>Poland v. John Parr &amp; Sons<a>[2]</a></u> where he said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"To make an employer liable for the act of a person alleged to be his servant the act must be one of a class of acts which the personwas authorised or employed to do. If the act is one of that class the employer is liable, though the act is done negligently or,in some cases, even if it is done with excessive violence. But the excess may be so great as to take the act out of the class ofacts which the person is authorised or employed to do." (Emphasis supplied)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The servant in Poland<sup>2</sup> was a carter. He had implied authority to make reasonable efforts to protect his master's goods. He was returning home one lunchtime close behind a cart on which there were bags of sugar. A boy was walking alongside that cart with his hand on one of the bags.The servant honestly and reasonably thought that the boy was pilfering or about to pilfer. He gave him a cuff on the neck which felledthe boy whose leg was then injured by a wheel of the cart which passed over it.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The question there was of a limited authority which raised the issue of an emergency existing or being reasonably supposed to exist- an implied not direct authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It was held that in the circumstances such implied authority did exist and that the violence exerted was not so excessive as to takethe carter's act outside the scope of his authority. The defendants were held liable. Bankes L.J., at page 242, had this to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"In deciding whether an act of a servant is one for which his master is responsible the act must be regarded from two points of view.First, was it merely a wrong method of doing an authorised act, in which case the master is responsible; and secondly, where theauthority is not otherwise established but has to be inferred from the circumstances, was the act one which was done for the servant'sown purposes and not in his master's interest?"</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I would stress that in this instant ease there is no question of anything other than direct authority. The judgment of Scrutton L.J.went on at page 243:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"It has been argued that an employer cannot be liable if the act of his, servant is illegal or excessive. In my opinion Dyer v. Munday <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%201%20QB%20742" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 1 Q.B. 742</a> negatives the first alternative. Lord Esher M.R. in that case put the question whether the act was or was not for the employer'sbenefit. That may be one test, but where excessive violence is charged another question must be considered namely, whether the excessis such as to take the act out of the class of authorised acts. It was also argued that an employer could not authorise an act whichhe could not lawfully do himself. But in may cases employers have been held responsible for acts of their servants which if doneby themselves would have been illegal."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> This last sentence must, with the greatest respect, be correct. For the fraudulent servant, for whose fraudulent conduct the masteris liable, is clearly not "authorised" to act fraudulently.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Lloyd v. Grace, Smith &amp; Co.<a>[3]</a> - a case particular to its facts but which emphasised, with one modification, the general principles laid down in <u>Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank</u><a>[4]</a>. It made it clear that benefit to the master was unnecessary for liability, for one of the main reasons why <u>Lloyd</u><sup>3</sup> attracted the distinguished judgments that it did was to clarify the <u>Barwick</u><sup>4</sup> principle by holding that the fraud of an agent did not need to be for the benefit of the master before the master could be liable.In this modern era, <u>Lloyd v. Grace, Smith &amp; Co.</u><sup>3</sup>, being the seminal case in this branch of the law, one can ignore the issue-as to whether or not the act of the servant was for thebenefit of his master and the dictum of Lopes L.J. in <u>Dyer v. Munday</u><a>[5]</a> at page 747, where he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe law says that for all acts done by a servant in the conduct of his employment, and in furtherance of such employment, and forthe benefit of his master, the master is liable, although the authority that he gave is exceeded .â¦.. There is no distinction inthis respect between the effects of a tortious and a criminal act, provided such acts are done by the servant in the conduct of hisemployment and in the interest of his master.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">must be considered in the light of <u>Lloyd v. Grace, Smith &amp; Co.</u><sup>3</sup></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Warren v. Henlys, Ltd.<a>[6]</a> turned on whether the subsequent assault by the petrol station attendant was or was not in the course of his dealings, as an employee,with the victim. It is clear that there had been a break in that the transaction which the servant was employed to do had been completed,the car driver had left. He returned, having called the police, and told the employee that he would report him to his employer. Itwas at that juncture that the assault took place. It was held that that assault was one of personal vengeance on the employee's partand not done in the course of his employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Here, whatever the motive for Constable Chan's action may have been, all his acts on the 4th and 5th of June were done in furtheranceof his employment. There was no break in that employment. The fraudulent servant acts for his own financial benefit and in that senseit would be from a âcaprice of the employeeâ but nevertheless, the master is not absolved from liability given that the classof acts which he was authorised or employed to do. In my judgment so too with malice, with an illegal act and so too with an attemptat a prospective illegal gain.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> For myself, I think the present case, by its circumstances, is taken outside the <u>Warren v. Henlys, Ltd.</u><sup>6</sup>, <u>Riddell v. Glasgow Corp.</u><a>[7]</a> and <u>Keppel Bus Co. Ltd. v. Sa'ad bin Ahmad</u><a>[8]</a> line for in all of these there was held to be either a break in the employment or a lack of authority neither of which existed here.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> In <u>Riddell</u><sup>7</sup> a woman brought an action for damages against the corporation as the result of a slanderous statement made by the municipal tax collector,the corporation's servant. It was held not to be within the scope of his authority, which was to collect police assessments payableand to grant receipts for such payment, to express his own opinion as to the falsity or genuineness of any prior receipt shown tohim or to make any statement or comment-upon it. His sole duty, in respect of false receipts, was, on the evidence, to report tohis superiors. The claim failed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> In <u>Keppel Bus Co.</u><sup>8</sup>, where a passenger was travelling on a bus owned by the appellant bus company, there was an altercation between the bus conductorand the passenger. Other passengers intervened and separated them. The bus conductor continued to collect fares but, as he did so,abused the passenger who asked him to desist. The conductor then struck the passenger with his ticket punch. The trial judge heldthe bus company to be vicariously liable for the resultant, and severe, damage to the passenger. The Court of Appeal of Singaporeupheld his finding.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The Judicial Committee allowed the appeal by the bus company holding that, although a bus conductor may have a duty to keep orderamongst passengers there was no evidence of any disorder at the time of the assault. There was no evidence to justify the ascriptionof the conductor's act to any authority, express or implied, therefore in assaulting the passenger the conductor was not acting inthe course of his employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Here, where the trial judge, in concluding his judgment, said of an officer deliberately and maliciously abusing his power by makingan arrest which he knew at the time to be false and who was motivated, not by any sense of pursuit of duty, but in order to obtainrevenge or money:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"then he is of course not carrying out his duties at all and what he is doing is exercising a power given to him by legislation andcriminally abusing it"</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">and consequentially that his acts are taken outside the doctrine of vicarious liability I, with respect, disagree.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The constable was abusing his powers but that does not in any way derogate from the fact that he had those powers - his duty wasto investigate crime and arrest the perpetrators - and that he exercised them whatever his motivation may have been. I think motiveto be irrelevant and the fact that the constable was doing an act which he was fully empowered and directly authorised to do, basethough his motives may have been, does not absolve his employer from liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> I would allow this appeal, find the defendant liable and hear counsel as to the course we should take in respect of damages.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Sir Alan Huggins, V.-P.:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> We are called upon to consider the circumstances in which a master can be held vicariously liable for a tort of false imprisonmentcommitted by his servant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The respondent Defendant is sued on behalf of the Crown as the employer of a police constable who - so it was pleaded in the Statementof Claim and admitted in the Defence - wrongfully and maliciously arrested the Plaintiff and charged him with an offence which theconstable well knew the Plaintiff had not committed. Following the arrest the Plaintiff was kept in custody for two days before beingreleased on bail. In consequence of his false imprisonment the Plaintiff is alleged to have suffered serious damage.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> No oral evidence was adduced but it would seem that two statements made by the Plaintiff to' the police were before the judge. Thejudge proceeded on the basis that the facts were not in dispute and stated them as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"On the 4th of June 1981 the plaintiff was at a nightclub with business associates and during the evening he had occasion to pacifysome men at an adjoining table who had become involved in a petty altercation with the plaintiff's brother. He gave the matter nofurther thought and quite some time later, in the company of a number of others, he left the nightclub. As he did so, at the entrance,he saw one of the men he had spoken to earlier lying on the ground covered in blood. Another of that group then approached the plaintiffand accused him of having organised an attack upon the man on the ground. The plaintiff protested and then yet another man from thetable came up and said that he was a policeman and told the plaintiff not to leave. That man was indeed a police constable namedChan Chi Fai. Other police officers then arrived and at their invitation the plaintiff went to Wanchai Police Station.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">The plaintiff was not t hen under arrest, but at 5.25 a.m. on the same morning none other than Chan Chi Fai himself interviewed theplaintiff in the station and arrested and cautioned him for the wounding offence. The plaintiff denied the allegation but he wasthereafter detained and later charged with a series of charges embracing claiming to be a member of a triad society, wounding withintent and assaulting a police officer, all based on Chan Chi Fai's account of events and what is admitted to be his false identificationof the plaintiff as one of the assailants.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">The plaintiff was then kept in custody until the 5th of June 1981 when he was granted bail by a magistrate.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">We are further asked to accept from the Plaintiff's first statement that he left the nightclub at about 3 a.m.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In the course of his reply before us counsel for the appellant Plaintiff made it clear for the first time that it was his case thatthe allegation of malice in the Statement of Claim was surplusage and that the Plaintiff contended it was irrelevant to the casealthough his own case had been put forward on the basis that the constable was motivated by malice and it is clear from the Judgmentin the court below that it was on that basis that the case proceeded.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> When the judge spoke of, an arrest âmotivated not by any sense of pursuit of duty at all but in order to obtain revenge or moneyas the case may beâ, he was not making a finding that the obtaining of revenge or money was the motive in the present case: hewas merely giving examples of possible motives for an arrest which might be made by an arresting officer who knew at the time thatthe arrest was false. It was enough for his purposes that the arrest in the present case was, as appeared from the pleadings, maliciousas well as unjustified in fact.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I accept that the allegation of malice, supported as it was by detailed allegations of subsequent events tending to show malice,was not material to the Plaintiff's claim. It was, however, vital to the defence sought to be advanced, and the Statement of Defencetook advantage of the immaterial allegations in the Statement of Claim by admitting them. What was cantended on behalf of the AttorneyGeneral was that the malice of the servant resulted in his moving outside the scope of his employment, so that vicarious liabilitywas negatived. That contention was upheld by His Honour Judge Evans, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court. The Plaintiff appeals.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> It is common ground that a master is liable for the torts of his servant only where the servant is acting in the course of his employment.The basis of the liability is an actual or implied authority to do the act. The act may itself be wrongful or it may be a lawfulact done in a wrongful manner. Where it is the manner of doing the act which is wrongful, the master will be liable unless the mannerof doing it is such that the servant can no longer rightly be regarded as acting in the course of his employment. Although a mastermay never have authorized his servant to act negligently, if the servant does discharge his duties negligently and causes damageto a third party, the master will be liable. Even where the servant takes an opportunity created by his employment to act fraudulently,the master may be liable: <u>Lloyd v Grace, Smith &amp; Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1912%20AC%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1912 A.C. 716.</a> That was a case where the party defrauded was entitled to assume that the act done by the servant was being done in the course ofhis employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> The judge recognized that the presence of malice did not necessarily take the act of every tort-feasor outside the scope of his employmentbut thought that in the circumstances of the present case it took this particular constable outside the scope of his employment.He relied upon a passage in the judgment of Hilbery, J. in <u>Warren v Henlys Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1948%202%20All%20ER%20935" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1948 2 All E.R. 935</a>, 938H:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt is unfortunate the words 'in the course of the employment' seem to have given rise to so much difficulty, but, if one thinksof the course of the employment as meaning, coupling that phrase with that Scrutton, L.J. said [in Poland v John Parr &amp; Sons <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1927%201%20KB%20236" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1927 1 K.B. 236]</a>, in the course of doing an act which was one of the class of acts which the servant was authorised or employed to do, the matterbecomes reasonably clear.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">However, he said that what was done must not be âfrom any caprice of the servantâ (per Willes, J. in <u>Bayley v Manchester, Manchester, Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire Railway Co.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281872%29%20LR%207%20CP%20415" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1872) L.R. 7 C.P. 415</a>, 420) and that in the end it was âall a matter of degreeâ and, as such, a question of fact. He found that for the constable toarrest the Plaintiff not only without reasonable and probable cause but to satisfy his own personal malice did take the arrest outsidethe scope of his employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> In so finding the judge might appear from the cases upon which he relied to have adopted the approach that making arrests was withinthe scope of the constable's employment but that in making an arrest in the circumstances of this case he was so far exceeding thatauthority that the employer was not liable. It was the judge's suggested application of this concept of âexcessâ which Mr. Litton,on behalf of the Plaintiff, stigmatized as âbizarreâ. It is a concept based upon some words of Scrutton, L.J. in <u>Poland v John Parr &amp; Sons</u> (supra) at p.243:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"To make an employer liable for the act of a person alleged to be his servant the act must be one of a class of acts which the personwas authorized or employed to do. If the act is one of that class the employer is liable, though the act is done negligently or,in some cases, even if it is done with excess violence. But the excess may be so great as to take the act out of the class of actswhich the person is authorized or employed to do."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">However, in the event I do not think Judge Evans did rely upon an âexcessâ of power in the sense in which the word was used inthat case, for he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"Where an officer â¦ deliberately and maliciously abuses a power directly to make an arrest which he knows at the time is false,motivated not by any sense of pursuit of duty at all but in order to obtain revenge or money as the case may be, then he is of coursenot carrying out his duties at all and what he is doing is exercising a power given to him by legislation and criminally abusingit and his position to such an extent as to take his acts and responsibility for them outside the doctrine of vicarious liability."</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">This was in apparent conflict with his statement that</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe act of arrest and the act of detention of the plaintiff were both acts which Chan Chi Fai was empowered to do. His actions,as actions, were acts which he was authorised and empowered to perform and were within the ambit or scope of his employment.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">and it seems to me that what he meant was no more than that the constable's acts were of such a nature that they could have been withinthe scope of his employment in some circumstances. He thought that in the circumstances of this case they were clearly not authorizedand that the Attorney General should not be held vicariously liable: they constituted such an âexcess and abuse of powerâ thatthe departure from the course or scope of the employment âwas totalâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> My anxiety has been to isolate the factors which are relevant to a determination of the question whether an act is, in the wordsof Scrutton, L.J. in <u>Poland v John Parr &amp; Sons</u> (supra), âone of a class of acts which the person was authorized or employed to doâ. Whether or not the constable was nominallyâon dutyâ at the time is relevant, but it cannot be conclusive: a constable who, when lawfully checking that shops have beenproperly secured at night, finds one unlocked and proceeds to enter and steal from the till could hardly be said to be acting withinthe scope of his employment. On the other hand, a constable who in purported exercise of his duty (although without authority infact) asks for property and, having received it, appropriates it to his own use would be within the scope of his employment: see<u>Lloyd v Grace Smith &amp; Sons</u> (supra). In that case Earl Loreburn said at p.725:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIf the agent commits the fraud purporting to act in the course of business such as he was authorized, or held out as authorized,to transact on account of his principal, then the latter may be held liable for itâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify">It is possible to conceive of a case where a constable making an arrest was known not only by himself but also by the person arrestedto be acting purely out of malice and not purportedly in the course of his duty âto take lawful measures to apprehend all personswhom it is lawful to apprehend and for whose apprehension sufficient grounds existsâ (sic) <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.10</a> of the '<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232" class="autolink_findacts">Police Force Ordinance</a>. It would be unjust that his employer should be held liable for that wrongful arrest. However, in the present case the constableclearly did purport to act as such and used the trappings of his office to execute his malicious design. He not merely said thathe was a constable but he summoned the assistance of other constables who acted throughout in good faith; he arrested the Plaintiffwithin the confines of a police station; he formally charged him there and he had him detained in a cell in the police station. Ofcourse the Plaintiff knew that he was not guilty of the offence charged, but he could not be certain that the constable did not honestlybelieve him to be guilty, so that he would on any view be acting in the execution of his duty. In those circumstances, it seems tome, the Crown as employer held the constable out as authorized to do what he did, and I too would allow t he appeal.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>Clough, J.A.</b></p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> As we are differing from the carefully reasoned reserved judgment of the trial judge I consider that I should give my reasons foragreeing with the conclusion, in the two judgments which have been delivered, that this appeal should be allowed.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> The difficulties that arose in this case stem from the fact that the law regarding the vicarious liability of a master for the wrongfulacts of his servant is sometimes easier to state than to apply to any particular set of facts. It is not always easy to reconcileone decision with another. Each case turns on its own facts and distinctions may be fine: compare for example <u>United Africa Co. Ltd. v. Saka Owoade<a>(1)</a></u> with the earlier case of <u>Cheshire v. Bailey</u><a>(2)</a>.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> It is settled law that a master is liable for the wrongful acts of his servant committed in the course of his employment. The questionsometimes arises, as in the present case, whether or not the relevant act complained of was done in the course of the servant's employment.It is common ground between the parties to the appeal that the Attorney General, as the nominal defendant for the Crown, stands inthe same position as regards the issue of the vicarious liability for the wrongful act of the arresting officer in this case, asany other employer who is liable for the wrongful acts of his servant committed in the course of his employment.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p41">45.</a> The crucial question on this appeal is whether, as the judge held, the admitted gross abuse of his powers by the arresting officerin arresting and detaining the plaintiff wrongfully, maliciously and without reasonable cause is a factor of excess which takes theofficer is purportedly authorised act of arrest outside the course of his employment.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> In arriving at this conclusion the judge expressed himself to be relying on authority, including dicta cited by him from the decisionof Hilbery J. in <u>Warren v. Benlys Limited<a>(3)</a></u> who had cited in that case passages from the earlier judgment of Scrutton L.J. in <u>Poland v. John Parr &amp; Sons<a>(4)</a></u>. Both those cases were decided in relation to circumstances in which the servant had resorted to physical violence. In the lattercase a carter had struck a boy who he reasonably believed was about to pilfer goods from the carter's employer's vehicle. In thefirst mentioned case a petrol pump attendant had assaulted a customer after the customer had paid his bill and told the attendanthe would report him to his employers for abusing the customer in the erroneous belief that the customer had tried to drive away fromthe garage without paying or surrendering the required petrol ration coupons.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> In both those cases the court was thus concerned factually with acts of violence by the servant. In <u>Poland's case</u> Scrutton L.J. had observed at p .243 of the report of that case:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"To make an employer liable for the act of a person alleged to be his servant the act must be one of a class of acts which the personwas authorized or employed to do. If the act is one of that class the employer is liable, though the act is done negligently or,in some cases, even if it is done with excessive violence. But the excess may be so great as to take the act out of the class ofacts which the person is authorized or employed to do. Whether it is so or not is a question of degree. It has been argued that anemployer cannot be liable if the act of his servant is illegal or excessive. In my opinion <u>Dyer v. Munday</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%201%20QB%20742" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 1 Q.B. 742</a> negatives the first alternative. Lord Esher M.R. in that case put the question whether the act was or was not for the employer'sbenefit. That may be one test, but where excessive violence is charged another question must be considered - namely, whether theexcess is such as to take the act out of the class of authorized acts."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> It was held by the Court of Appeal that in the circumstances of the case the carter had implied authority to make reasonable effortsto protect and preserve his employer's property and that in striking the boy he had used violence that was not so excessive as totake his act outside the scope of his authority. His employers were therefore held liable for his acts.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> In <u>Warrenâs Case</u> the attendant's employers were held not liable for the assault committed by the attendant. Distinguishing <u>Dyer v. Munday</u><a>(5</a><u>)</u>, Hilbery J. held that the attendant's act was one of personal vengeance and was not done in the course of his employment becauseit was not an act of a class which the attendant was authorised to do or a mode of doing an act within that class. It is clear fromhis judgment that Hilbery J. was influenced in his decision by his finding of fact that the assault had occurred at a time when theplaintiff's business with the attendantâs employers had been concluded. This is demonstrated by the following passage which occursat p.937 D-G in the judgment:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"On those facts certain things seem clear. The plaintiff had had his car filled with petrol. Beaumont had performed the duty he wasthere to perform regarding the petrol and had seen to it that the customer paid. The only reasonable inference that can be drawnis that, although the Ford truck had pulled up, no petrol was going to be delivered to that truck. So far as the plaintiff and Beaumontwere concerned, the plaintiff's business with the defendants was at an end. He had paid his money and handed over the coupons. Hehad actually gone off thereafter on a matter which concerned him personally in his relations with Beaumont - that is, he had gonefor the police and made a complaint to them about Beaumont!s conduct towards him, and when the policeman said he was not taking actionbecause he did not consider it a police matter, the plaintiff had actually turned to go to his car to leave, clearly, I think, showing- and no jury could otherwise find - he had finished with the defendants at that stage. Then Beaumont speaks to him, asks him ifhe is going to report him, and, hearing that the answer is in the affirmative, gets hold of him, twists him round and strikes him,an act of personal retribution for something which Beaumont thought would affect him personally.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The judge in the present case observed:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAs I read the authorities, the proper approach is that advanced by Scrutton, L.J. and adopted by Hilbery, J. and that is, thatif the act is one of a class of acts authorised, then the employer is liable, save for the exception (and it may not be the onlyexception) that in the case of excess, that excess may be so great as to take the act outside the general rule of liability for actswhich a person is authorised or employed to do. It appears to me in the end to be all a matter of degree."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> I accept that this proposition is supported by the authorities to the extent that excessive physical violence used by a servant inexecuting an authorised act may take the servant's act out of the course of his employment and absolve his employer from vicariousliability for the servant1s wrongful act. However it is well settled that a master is liable for the wrongs of his servant committedin the course of his employment whether that wrong be fraudulent or otherwise: <u>Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank<a>(6)</a></u> as explained and applied in <u>Lloyd v. Grace Smith &amp; Co.</u><a>(7)</a> The same principle was applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in <u>United African Company Limited v. Saka Owoade</u><sup>(1)</sup> at p.l44 where Lord Oaksey observed:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">"There is in their Lordship's opinion no difference in the liability of a master for wrongs whether for fraud or any other wrong committedby a servant in the course of his employment. It is a question of fact in each case whether the wrong was committed in the servant'semployment ..."</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> It follows, in my judgment, that if it is once determined that when a servant committed a wrong against a third party he was actingin the course of his employment, then it is immaterial whether or not the servant acted fraudulently, maliciously or merely by reasonof honest mistake. It also follows that fraudulent or malicious intent, as distinct from physical violence, cannot by itself constituteexcess for the purposes of taking a servant's wrongful act out of the course of his employment.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> The matter can also be tested by reference to the principles applicable in relation to damages where there is vicarious liabilityfor wrongful arrest by a servant. Thus in <u>Hussien v. Chong Fook Kam</u><a>(8)</a> where liability fell on the Government of Malaysia for the wrongful arrest of the respondents Lord Devlin had this to say at p.950about the scope of damages for which the Government and the arresting officers were liable:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe court is not in this category of case confined to awarding compensation for loss of liberty and for such physical and mentaldistress as it thinks may have been caused. It is also proper for it to mark any departure from constitutional practice, even ifonly a slight one, by exemplary damages: but these do not have to be large. The subject has been considered by the House of Lordsin <u>Rookes v. Barnard</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] A.C. 1129</a>, 1221. The Board approves also of what was said on this topic by Scott L.J. in <u>Dumbell v. Roberts</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1944%5d%201%20All%20ER%20326" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1944] 1 All E.R. 326.</a> In particular, the Lord Justice said, at p.329:</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe more high-handed and less reasonable the detention is, the larger may be the damages: and, conversely, the more nearly reasonablythe defendant may have acted and the nearer he may have got to justification on reasonable grounds for the suspicion on which hearrested, the smaller will be the proper assessment.ââ</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Accordingly, in my judgment, the degree of high-'handedness and unreasonableness involved in making a wrongful arrest is materialas to damages but a high degree of high-handedness or unreasonableness does not take the wrongful act of the servant out of the courseof his employment, it merely aggravates the wrongful act and gives the complaining party grounds for claiming exemplary damages.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Citing <u>Kooragang Investments Property Limited v. Richardson &amp; Wrench Limited</u><a>(9)</a> the judge concluded that the âexcess rind abuse of powerâ of the arresting officer made this a clear case of departure from thecourse or scope of employment. It is clear to me from the judge's findings of fact referred to in the judgment of my Lord HugginsV.-P. and from the concluding passage in the judge's judgment that he would have held that the arresting officer was acting in thecourse of his employment when he arrested the plaintiff had it not been for the admitted fact that the officer had grossly abusedhis powers at the time. If the officer had been acting bona fide but mistakenly at the time the decision would have been differentbecause the judge considered the law to be as follows:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe greater the excess to the point of abuse of a power authorised or instructed to be used legitimately, the further away fromliability for that excess the employer becomes. The Crown could, for example, be liable for an excessive use of force whilst makingan otherwise legitimate arrest. It could be liable where the wrong person was arrested in a mistakenly but honestly held belief atthe time that the right person was being arrested. Where an officer however deliberately and maliciously abuses a power directlyto make an arrest which he knows at the time is false, motivated not by any sense of pursuit of duty at all but in order to obtainrevenge or money as the case may be, then he is of course not carrying out his duties at all and what he is doing is exercising apower given to him by legislation and criminally abusing it and his position to such an extent as to take his acts and responsibilityfor them outside the doctrine of vicarious liability. His pretended ostensible performance of his duty in the act of allegedly arrestinga criminal is, as a weapon in the hands of an assailant, in pursuit of his own criminal objective of making a false and vindictivearrest and not otherwise.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> In my judgment the judge here fell into error because he failed to bear in mind that, as <u>Barwickâs Case</u> established many years ago, the law draws no distinction between bona fide mistake on the one hand and deliberate criminal intenton the other hand when determining as a question of fact whether or not the wrongful act of a servant was done in the course of hisemployment.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> It seems to me to be an inescapable conclusion that the arresting officer was acting in the course of his employment when he arrestedthe plaintiff. A crime had been committed in the presence of the arresting officer. The plaintiff had been required to go to thepolice station where an investigation was taking place in which the plaintiff was a suspect. The arrest took place in the policestation in the course of the police investigation of the crime. In fact the officer was using the authority conferred upon him byhis employer for his own purposes, as was the fraudulent clerk in the <u>Grace Smith Case</u>, but he was undoubtedly employed about his employer is business at the time of the arrest. His personal motivation and malice wasnot therefore relevant.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> The judge was understandably reluctant to hold the Crown vicariously liable for the malicious wrongful arrest effected by a policeofficer in what the judge termed âa disgusting situationâ. For my <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/232#p1" class="autolink_findacts">part I</a> understand the underlying principle of the law to be that if an employer vests his servant with express or implied authority to doan act on the employer's behalf, and the servant does such an act in the course of his employment, the employer is vicariously liableif the act is done wrongfully, whatever may be the degree or character of the wrong. In the case of a breach of the subjectâs constitutionalright to liberty this seems to me to be an eminently just result.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> I would therefore allow the appeal.</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Henry Litton, Esq., Q.C. &amp; Robert Whitehead, Esq.
