The Plaintiff commenced legal proceedings in the High Court for damagesagainst Ng.  The insurer of the car joined as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Ng then commenced third party proceedings for an indemnity against the 1<sup>st</sup> Third Party, <b>Alliance</b>, her employer and the registered owner of the private car that she drove that night.  The shareholder and Managing Director of thecompany, <b>Pang</b>, was joined as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In 2009, the main action was settled by payments made by Ng and the insurer of the car.  The third party action was also transferredto the District Court.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Undisputed background</b></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Alliance is a consultant on procedures for attaining the ISO 9000 and logistic operational security standard compliance.  Pang wasat the material time a shareholder and Managing Director of Alliance.  Alliance was the registered owner of the car.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In February 2005, Ng joined Alliance as a consultant.  By April 2005, Ng had worked for Alliance for a month and a half and wasstill in her probation.  Driving was however not one of the duties that she was employed to perform.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Allianceâs office was at the material time situated at Lippo Tower, Queensway.  Occasionally, Pang would park the car at the carpark of the Bank of China Tower (â<b>the Car Park</b>â).  Not being a tenant of that commercial building, Pang managed to use the Car Park with the assistance and arrangement of hisfriend Victor Lui (â<b>Lui</b>â).  Lui was a manager of the management company there.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 8 April 2005, which was a Friday, Pang had to catch an 8:25 pm flight for Shanghai on business.  He asked Ng to come along tothe Airport Express Station in Central (â<b>the Station</b>â).  His instruction was that Ng had to drive the car to the Car Park after he was dropped off at the Station that evening.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  However, hours later, the car was driven across the harbour to Kowloon.  At about 11:15 pm, the car was on its way near the tollplaza after exiting the Hunghom Cross Harbour Tunnel.  At a certain point, a double-decker bus apparently had to brake because ofthe car.  Upon the bus braking, one of the passengers on board got injured.  That passenger was the Plaintiff in the High Court action.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The car did not stop but carried on with its journey.  The car was subsequently identified; and so was Ng as the driver at the time. For the traffic accident, Ng was subsequently prosecuted for careless driving, failing to stop after accident and failing to reportafter accident.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 23 January 2006, Ng was tried on those charges (Kowloon City Magistracy Case No. KCS 21959-61/2005).  She was convicted of carelessdriving on her own guilty plea; and was acquitted of the other charges after trial.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Plaintiff commenced the main action claiming for common law damages against Ng.  The insurer of the car joined as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  In May 2009, the main action was settled by payments made by Ng and the insurer in the sums of HK$30,000 and HK$190,000respectively.  The insurer also paid the Plaintiffâs costs of the main action.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The third party action</b></p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Ng claims for an indemnity by Alliance and Pang, jointly and severally, for the sum of HK$30,000 and her costs of defending themain action.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  According to the pleadings, the basis of the claim for indemnity is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Alliance was the owner of the car.  It was a company car.  On the day in question, Pang needed to go to the Station to catch aflight on business.  He requested Ng in the course of her employment to drive the car to the Car Park after dropping him off at theStation.</p>        <p>(2) Notwithstanding her protest on the ground of lack of driving experience, Pang insisted.  Pang suggested that Ng might drive thecar home first and back to the Car Park the other day.  Ng acceded to Pangâs request.</p>        <p>(3)   Alliance and Pang were fully aware of the risk of accident, in view of the lack of driving experience of Ng.  The accident happenedin the course of Ngâs driving of the car at the request and for the interest of Alliance and Pang.</p>        <p>(4) Therefore Alliance and Pang are liable to indemnify Ng.  Further or alternatively, it was an implied term of the employment contractthat Ng should be so indemnified.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><b>The law</b></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In the context of an employer-employee relationship, <i>Halsburyâs Laws of England</i> (4<sup>th</sup> ed) Vol.16 at para.35 summarises the principle as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAn employer is under an implied duty to indemnify or to reimburse the employee, as the case may be, against all liabilities andlosses and in respect of all expenses incurred by the employee <b>either in consequence of obedience to his orders, or incurred by him in the execution of his authority, or in the reasonable performanceof the duties of his employment</b>.

There is no dispute that Lui was Ngâs boyfriend.  There is also no disputethat as a favour, Lui would occasionally give Pang permission to park the car at the Car Park, though neither Alliance nor Pang hadthe right to do so.  Pang had to call Lui one or two days in advance so that Lui could make arrangement with the management officeto designate a space for the parking.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  According to Pang, on 8 April 2005, he intended to park the car at the Car Park while he would be on business in Shanghai for acouple of days.  This is in line with Ngâs evidence.  The fact was that he did not return until 12 April 2005, which was Monday,as scheduled in the itinerary.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Sometime on 8 April 2005, Pang called Lui and obtained his agreement to arrange the car to be parked at the Car Park while he wouldbe in Shanghai.  As mentioned above, Pang asked Ng to come along with him to the Station so that she could drive the car to the CarPark after he had left.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  There is dispute as to whether Ng protested against Pangâs request.  According to Pang, Ng appeared to be an experienced driver. There was also suggestion that Ng had driven vehicles in her service as an auxiliary police constable.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The undisputed fact was that by then, Ng had started her employment for only a month and a half.  She was still on probation.  Shehad got her driving licence for about 8 months.  It was also not disputed that she did not own a car; took public transportationto and from work; and had never driven the car before.  In the circumstances, it is credible that Ng was reluctant and initiallyrefused to accede to the request.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  According to Ng, in order to persuade her, Pang suggested that she could use the car to drive home first and park it back to theCar Park the following day.  In court, she added that Pang also made other suggestions that she could use the car for other personalpurposes before parking it.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  But as Ng showed her reluctance to drive for the relatively short distance from the Station to the Car Park because of lack of drivingexperience, it would be surprising that Pang would offer to her to drive the car further and elsewhere including her home which wasin Kwai Chung.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Indeed it is also Ngâs case that Pang expressly promised to indemnify her if there was any trouble.  But it should be noted thatthere is no such pleaded basis for her claim in the Third Party Notice.  Nor is that mentioned in the Statement of Claim preparedby her counsel.  This was mentioned for the first time in her statement.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In any event, Pang emphasized that Ng was expected to drive the car to the Car Park immediately after he had left the car.  He gaveno indication that Ng could use the car for any other purpose.  On the contrary, Ng was clear that Pang did not say this had to beimmediate.  In my view, there had to be a reasonable range of time, however immediate Pang might intend.  There could be contingencies. Pang contemplated that and hence he instructed Ng to contact Lui in case of difficulty.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Though Pang explained in court what he had in mind was the difficulty that might be caused by the management office when Ng soughtto enter the Car Park, he did not actually spell out such difficulty when instructing Ng.  I tend to believe that his instructionto Ng to contact Lui in case of difficulty was given in general terms.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  There is no dispute that no one else in the office then had a driving licence.  For Pangâs purpose, regardless of Ngâs drivingexperience, she appeared to be the only one whom he could turn to.  It is not difficult to understand the situation as one of Ngacceding to a request from the boss.  She did so, despite the fact that this was not what she was employed to do or what she professedto do.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I find that it was in these circumstances that Pang made the request and Ng acceded to it.  I also find that his instruction toNg was in general terms that she would drive the car to the Car Park after he had left; and should contact Lui if necessary.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>What happened after Pang had left</b></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  There is no dispute that in the evening of 8 April 2005, Pang and Ng set out to another car park where the car was then parked. Pang then drove the car to the Station and left.  Ng had stated that this was about 8:00 pm.  But in court, she accepted that ithad to be earlier, as Pang was catching the 8:25 flight.  She corrected the time to about 7:30 pm.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  According to Ng, she then called Lui.  Lui asked her to wait for him at the International Finance Centre (â<b>IFC</b>â) (which is adjacent to the Station) and he would help her drive the car.  Lui had to come out of Cheung Chau.  In court, Ng explainedthat she then parked the car first by the roadside near the IFC.  She then parked it somewhere between the piers for Cheung Chauand Ping Chau to wait for Lui.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  According to Ng, by the time when Lui arrived, it was already 10:30 pm.  Lui told her that it was too late to park the car backto the BOC Tower.  In court, she added that according to Lui then, it was after office hours and the car without permit could notbe parked at the Car Park without special reasons.  Lui suggested that they drove themselves home that night; and he would drivethe car from his home back to the Car Park the following morning.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  There seems to be dispute as to whether Lui was in fact present that night.  Indeed, the existence of Lui in the car at the timeof the accident was never revealed to the police and in the criminal trial. At one point, I too had doubt, particularly in the caseof Ng and Lui who were both auxiliary police constables.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  However, the auto-toll record produced shows the movement of the car in line with Ngâs version.  In the small hours of 9 April2005, the car headed towards Shatin where Lui lived (at Ma On Shan).  In the morning of the same day, the car was driven from theNew Territories to Kowloon and then to the Hong Kong Island.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  According to Ng, it was Lui who parked the car at the Car Park on 9 April 2005.  She did not go to work that day which was a Saturday. When she returned to work on 12 April 2005, Ng sent an email to Pang, who was still in Shanghai, informing him that Lui had depositedthe key to the car at the management office of the Car Park; and Lui would contact him regarding the exact location where the carwas parked.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I find that Ng did call Lui after Pang had left; and Lui was indeed present with Ng subsequently at the night in question.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  There is dispute as to whether the car could not be parked at the Car Park because it was too late as alleged.  According to Pang,the Car Park should be open 24 hours and he never had any difficulty in parking the car there on the previous occasions.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  However, Pang confirmed in court that when he talked to Lui that day on the telephone, he was not specific about the exact timewhen the car would be parked at the Car Park.  Pang was not entitled to use the Car Park (irrespective of its open hours); and hadto count on Luiâs arrangement for the parking on every occasion.  Therefore, whilst Ngâs evidence of the impossibility of parkingthe car at the Car Park that night was hearsay, Pang is not really in a position to positively say otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Ng was asked by Lui to wait for him and eventually for at least 3 hours without a clue that the car could not be parked at the CarPark by the time when Lui came out of Cheung Chau.  Ng accepted that Lui ought to know that.  She also accepted that somehow Luimade no mention of that during their telephone conversation before she left the office or their telephone conversation after Panghad left.  This might sound odd, but not inherently improbable, I find.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  It was suggested that Ng waited for Lui to effectively give him a lift.  But there is no dispute that Lui had his own car.  Theinescapable fact was that the car had to taken care of that night and Lui was supposed to be the one to arrange to have the car parkedat the Car Park.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The fact, as I find, was that Ng was not prepared to drive the car on her own any further.  According to her, and I find, Lui hadadvised her of the potential difficulty in parking at the Car Park because of the narrow space there.  In view of the then relationshipbetween Ng and Lui, I would not be surprised that Lui would ask Ng to wait for him and Ng would be prepared to do so even for hours.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The fact was that after picking up Lui, Ng and Lui made use of the car to go home first.  As mentioned above, the auto-toll recordshows that.  Did the detour take the driving of the car outside the scope of Ngâs authority?</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  It was submitted on behalf of Ng that it did not.  My impression is that this was also Ngâs belief.  This explains why in heremail dated 12 April 2005, she openly informed Pang that it was Lui who deposited the key to the car at the management office ofthe Car Park.  Pang did not seem to have taken issue as to how that came to be the case afterwards.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Pang gave instruction to Ng in general terms that in case of difficulty, she should contact Lui.  Pang had to count on Lui to arrangefor the parking of the car.  So did Ng.  Lui remained the only one who was in a position to do that.  It was not for Ng to disagreewith Luiâs suggestion but to entrusted the car to Lui to park at the Car Park.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Much was said about whether they could have parked the car somewhere in Central overnight instead of driving it to their homes. I believe they could have.  But in the absence of clear instruction from Pang in such event, this would be a matter of judgment. The fact that the car could not be parked at the Car Park that night necessitated an alternative arrangement for the night and probablya detour.  The decision to take the car home first per se was not a manifestly bad judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  A detour is a detour, whether it was to a nearby car park or to their homes.  Traffic accident could have happened in whatever detourtaken.  It was not the choice to take the car to their homes, as opposed to any other route or destination, per se that gave riseto the traffic accident.  It was how the car was driven at the material time that did.  I conclude that by taking the detour in thecircumstances at the night of 8 April 2005, Ng did not act outside her authority.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Ngâs manner of driving</b></p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Ng admitted driving the car.  According to her, Lui was sitting by her side in the front seat.  The first destination was Ngâshome at Kwai Chung.  She took the Cross Harbour Tunnel to Kowloon. </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  As a result of the accident, Ng was convicted of careless driving on her own guilty plea.  Now she claimed to have done so by mistakebecause of the lack of legal representation and the intention to save time and costs.  This is regrettable, if not a shame, for Ngwith her auxiliary law enforcement background to make such suggestion.  Having said that, I am entitled to consider the evidencein respect of how Ng contributed to the occurrence of the accident.  After all, the evidence in this respect was really tested inthe criminal trial,</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In her statement, Ng explained how she was controlling the car and keeping her lookout after exiting the tunnel.  Both she and Luiwere unaware of any contact with the double-decker bus or an accident.  Hence she did not stop.  But upon their arrival at her homein Kwai Chung, she inspected the car out of caution.  She found a scratch.  She believed that that was the aftermath of another accidentto the car the day before.  On the following day, she telephoned Pang who allegedly confirmed her such belief.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Pang could not recall such telephone call from Ng on 9 April 2005. The telephone records produced show no such telephone call tohim from Ng on that day either.  However, Pang did confirm that when he returned to Hong Kong and collected the car, he noticed nodamage to the car except for that caused by the traffic accident on 7 April 2005 as Ng said.  Also the bus company has never filedany claim against Alliance or Ng for damage to the bus.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  All the evidence tend to show that objectively, there was no or minimal contact between the car and bus.  It was the braking ofthe bus that caused the injury to its passenger, not any impact of contact, not to mention collision, between the two vehicles. Indeed it might still be the manner in which Ng controlled the car that caused the bus driver to apply the brake.  But the followingtwo things should be noted.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In principle, in the present context of indemnity, the concern is whether Ng drove the car in a manner and to a standard as reasonablyexpected of her by Pang in the circumstances.  The answer could be yes, though this may constitute no defence in terms of liabilityof Ng or her employer to other road users who expect the same standard of reasonable care applicable generally.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  To begin with, it was not one of Ngâs duties to drive for Alliance or Pang.  Ng also did not profess to have the skills to doso in the course of her work.  She acceded to Pangâs request with reluctance.  Pang either knew the lack of driving experienceof Ng or did not care to satisfy himself of her skills to drive, perhaps apart from the fact that she possesses a driving licence. This was the risk Pang took by putting Ng to drive the car.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In fact, in the absence of contrary evidence including perhaps that of the bus driver, it cannot be said that Ng drove the car ina manner below what she was reasonably expected to do by Pang, and not the other road users, in the circumstances of this case.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Considering all the evidence, I am satisfied that neither the detour Ng took nor her manner of driving the car that night amountedto the grounds that would have deprived her of the right to an indemnity as explained in the authorities discussed above.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Liability of Alliance and Pang</b></p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The claim for indemnity is against Alliance and Pang jointly and severally.  In her answers to the notice to admit facts dated 23March 2009, Ng confirmed her understanding that she accepted the instruction of Pang to drive the car as that of Alliance.  Objectively,it also cannot be said that in giving his instruction to Ng, Pang did so in his personal capacity or for his personal interest inthe circumstances of this case.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion and order</b></p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  For the above reasons, I enter judgment in favour of Ng against Alliance in the sum of HK$30,000 together with her taxed costs ofdefending the main action on the District Court scale.  Interest on such sums shall run at the judgment rate from 29 April 2009 (dateof the consent order in the main action).  The claim against Pang is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  I make a nisi order that Alliance shall pay Ngâs costs of the third party proceedings.  There should effectively be one set ofcosts incurred by Alliance and Pang.    I therefore make no order as to costs between Ng and Pang.  Costs shall be taxed on the DistrictCourt scale, if not agreed, with certificate for counsel.  In the absence of application within 14 days to vary, the nisi order shallbecome absolute.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Simon Leung</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td style="text-align:center">District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Simon H W LAM instructed by Messrs Yu Hung &amp; Co for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</p>        <p>Mr NASIR of Messrs Nasirs for the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Third Parties</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2010/144.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
