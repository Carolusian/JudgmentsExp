The Defendants claim that the Plaintiffâs statements of claim inthe two actions disclosed no reasonable cause of action, are frivolous and vexations and an abuse of process of Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The summonses to strike out were issued on 24 July 2007.  They were adjourned by Acting Registrar Ko on 6 August 2007 to be heardtogether on 30 November 2007.  At the Plaintiffâs request, the hearing was further adjourned to 15 January 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Background</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 24 August 2004, the Plaintiff took out a writ of summons against the Inland Revenue Department (âIRDâ) for illegally freezinghis bank accounts and trespassing into his premises under DCCJ No. 4492 of 2004 (âaction 4492â).  The IRD filed and served adefence and counterclaim for unpaid assessed tax in the sum of $831,600 with interests against the Plaintiff on 24 September 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiff (âMr. Wongâ) applied in action 4492 by summons for an extension of time to file a reply and defence to counterclaim. The summons was heard by Master Ko (as he then was) on 27 October 2004 (âthe 27 October 2004 hearingâ).  At the end of the hearing,Master Ko, with the consent of Mr. Ho Chi Sum, Government Counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendants, granted an extension of28 days to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On the basis that the Plaintiff failed to file a reply and defence to counterclaim before the expiry of 28 days, the Defendantsobtained a default judgment on the Defendantsâ counterclaim against the Plaintiff on 30 December 2004 in action 4492 (âthe defaultjudgmentâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Mr. Wong applied to set aside the default judgment.  The application was heard and dismissed by my brother judge, H.H. Judge Chow,on 20 June 2005.  Upon failing to obtain leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal from Hon. Justice Cheung J.A. on 17 November 2005,Mr. Wong renewed his application to the Court of Appeal under HCMP 2032 of 2005.  His application for leave to appeal was refusedby Hon. Justices Yuen and Tang JJA on 7 March 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In Mr. Wongâs application to set aside the default judgment, he alleged that he had informed Master Ko and Mr. Ho Chi Sum at the27 October 2004 hearing that he and his family was under a threat of kidnap and he was put under police protection at the time, therefore,he required an extension of time to file the reply and defence to counterclaim.  He claimed Mr. Ho had agreed outside Master Koâscourt âto temporary set aside DCCJ 4492 of 2004â until further notice from him (âthe agreementâ).  Mr. Wong claimed Mr. Howas consequently in breach of the agreement and the default judgment should be set aside.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr. Ho in his affirmation of 24 July 2007 denied he had agreed to anything like what Mr. Wong alleged.  He claimed he had only agreedto Mr. Wongâs request for 28 days extension for the filing of a reply and defence to counterclaim in action 4492 on 27 October2004.  He had informed Master Ko at the hearing that he had no objection to Mr. Wongâs request for an extension of 28 days.  Hehad further told the Master at the hearing that judgment will be applied for should the Plaintiff failed to file the reply and defenceto counterclaim after 28 days (see Hoâs affirmation and exhibit HCS-1).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  These allegations were repeated at the Court of Appeal hearing before Hon. Justices Yuen and Tang JJA on 28 February 2006.  Referenceswere made to these allegations at paras. 15-17 of the judgment of Hon. Justice Yuen JA (p. 87 of the documents bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 22 May 2007 and 22 June 2007, Mr. Wong took out three summonses to set aside the default judgment of 30 December 2004 under action4492 and to amend the writ of summons.  He further sought leave to amend the statement of claim alleging he was misled by Mr. Hoand the IRD.  The 3 summonses were dismissed by Master K.W. Wong at the hearing on 25 June 2007.  Mr. Newton Chan was the GovernmentCounsel representing the defendants at the hearing before Master K.W. Wong on 25 June 2007.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Plaintiff commenced a new action against Mr. Ho and the IRD in the Court of First Instance under HCA 2132 of 2005 claiming fordamages for breach of agreement by Mr. Ho.  The statement of claim was struck out and the action dismissed by Registrar Chan on 30June 2006.  Mr. Wong appealed against the order of Registrar Chan.  The appeal was heard and dismissed by Mr. Justice Chung on 21February 2007.  The application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed by Hon.

This had been raised at the application to set asidethe default judgment before Judge Chow on 29 March 2005, it was raised again at the application of leave before Hon. Justices Yuenand Tang JJA on 25 February 2006.  The allegation had been carefully examined by the Court of Appeal (see para. 27 of Hon. JusticeYuen JAâs judgment at p. 89 of the bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Furthermore, Mr. Wong had made the same allegation in HCA 2132 of 2005 against Mr. Ho and the IRD.  The basis of Mr. Wongâs actionwas the alleged breach of agreement of 27 October 2004 by applying for and entering the default judgment in action 4492.  In hisjudgment dismissing the appeal against Registrar Chanâs order dismissing Mr. Wongâs claim, Mr. Justice Chung found Mr. Wongâsarguments to be untenable, he said in p. 9 of his judgment:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">26.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">First, the main issue in this action, namely, the alleged agreement reached between the parties on 27 October 2004, has clearly beendetermined by the courts earlier.  It is obvious that when the courts concluded the default judgment in the tort claim was a regularjudgment, they must have made a finding adverse to the plaintiffâs claim that an agreement has been reached between him and theIRD (through D1) on 27 October 2004. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">27.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">Despite the plaintiffâs contention to the contrary, the fact that this action shares a common factual basis with the tort claim(and the leave application) is shown by the need for those facts to be set out in the statement of claim herein (especially para.3 onwards)â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Chung J. held at para. 28 of his judgment that the IRD being named a defendant in the tort claim (action 4492), the leave applicationand the High Court action; and Mr. Ho, though not named as a defendant in the tort claim or the leave application, was the same personwho allegedly entered into an agreement with Mr. Wong on 27 October 2004, can be regarded as âparties to the proceedings for thepurpose of the doctrine of res judicataâ. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Abuse of Process</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I find that Mr. Wong by commencing this action against the Defendants is indeed guilty of mounting a collateral attack upon a finaldecision against the plaintiff which has been made by another court of competent jurisdiction in previous proceedings in which theplaintiff had a full opportunity of contesting the decision in the court by which it was made.  This was the finding of Lord Diplockin Hunter v. Chief Constable of the West Midland Police  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 529</a> at 541B-C where Lord Diplock held the action to be an abuse of process of court.  In the present actions, Mr. Wong is guilty of thesame conduct.  To allow the two actions to continue would be an abuse of process of court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I am satisfied Mr. Wong had more than exemplified the collateral attack by repeatedly making the same allegation against Mr. Hoat the application to set aside judgment, the application for leave to appeal, the HCA 2132 of 2005 and in the present action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>DCCJ 2808 of 2007</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr. Wong claimed in this action that Mr. Chan had misled Master Wong to focus on the default judgment of 30 December 2004 and JudgeChowâs decision refusing to set aside the default judgment, and ignored the two other defendants in action 4492.  I find the allegationsof âmisleadingâ Master Wong to be frivolously made.  Mr. Chan does not owe any duty to Mr. Wong as he represented Mr. Wongâsopponents in these proceedings.  The fact that he is a government counsel does not mean he has a duty to advise members of the public,particularly the individual who has been claiming against Mr. Chanâs clients.  Further, Master Wong could not have been misledat the hearing when Mr. Wong admitted he had failed to file and serve a reply and defence to counterclaim within time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr. Leung, Government Counsel representing the Defendants, at the hearing accepted that Mr. Wongâs substantive claim had not beendealt with though judgment on the Defendantsâ counterclaim had been entered. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr. Wong, at the close of his submission, made a last minute oral application to âmergeâ the present action with action 4492. He claimed he had been silenced by the RAO and RPO imposed by H.H. Judge M. Chan on 12 November 2007.  The restricted proceedingsorder relates to the counterclaim in action 4492 and a number of other actions in the District Court; the restricted applicationorder relates to action 4492, DCCJs 3884 and 3915 of 2006.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Judge Chanâs order prohibited all further proceedings and applications relating to a list of District Court actions commencedby Mr. Wong for reasons fully set out in her decision.  If Mr. Wong feels aggrieved and considers he has good grounds he would nodoubt take such appropriate actions as he sees fit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  So far as the application to âmergeâ which I understand he meant to âconsolidateâ the two actions, it is but a last minuteattempt to raise the same issue of the alleged âagreementâ on 27 October 2004 in action 4492.  This should not be allowed inview of the RAO against him and also for the reasons set out above.  Repeating the claim in a fresh action would be against the doctrineof res judicata and the mounting of a collateral attack on the Defendants including the Commissioner of IRD whose department hadbeen a party in action 4492 and HCA 2132 of 2005.  The application is therefore refused.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Conclusions</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  For reasons set out above it would be against the doctrine of res judicata if Mr. Wong is permitted to raise the same issues inpursuing DCCJ 2807 of 2007 against Mr. Ho, the IRD and the Commissioner of IRD.  It is an abuse of process of Court.  The statementof claim and the writ of summons is hereby struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  For reasons set out above, I find Master Wong was not misled at the 25 June 2007 hearing when he dismissed the three summonses toamend the claim against Mr. Ho and the IRD based on the allegation of the 27 October 2004 agreement.  Neither was Master Wong misledin refusing to set aside the default judgment of 30 December 2004 for there is no jurisdiction for him to do so.  Mr. Chan owed noduty to the Plaintiff as his duty was to his client Mr. Ho and the IRD.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I hold that the two statements of claim and writs of summons in 2807 and 2808 of 2007 disclosed no reasonable cause of action, arefrivolous and vexation and an abuse of process of court.  I hereby grant the orders sought by the Defendants and strike out the twostatements of claim and the two actions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Costs â I can see no reason why costs should not follow the event.  The Plaintiff shall pay the costs of the Defendants to betaxed if not agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">( H.C.
