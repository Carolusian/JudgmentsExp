Aftergraduation, he obtained to many one of the âdream jobâ as an administrative officer (âAOâ) in the Government of Hong Kong,and he was one of the 29 AOs appointed in that recruitment exercise out of a total of 13,000 applications.  However, it seemed thatthings then went the other way for the Claimant.  After he started his work as an AO under probation, his supervisor was not satisfiedwith his work performance.  He was then transferred to another post within the Government, but unfortunately, the new supervisormade similar comment about him.  Subsequently, the Claimant was informed by the Civil Service Bureau (âCSBâ) that his appointmentas AO would not be confirmed.  In order to avoid the embarrassment of citing âdismissalâ as the ground for terminating his employment,the Claimant resigned on his own initiative.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  It is the Claimantâs case that he was suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder (âGADâ), which is a kind of psychiatricdisability, and some other disabilities at the time when he worked as an AO, and his resignation was the result of a series of discriminatoryand harassing conducts on the part of various other senior AOs of the Government.  He therefore brings the present action for disabilitydiscrimination and harassment under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/487" class="autolink_findacts">Disability Discrimination Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/487">Cap. 487</a> (âDDOâ) against the Government to claim for damages which amount to, according to the document entitled âClaimantâsCalculation of Loss of Earnings and Benefitsâ, the sum of $20,264,701.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 2 June 2005, HH Judge H. C. Wong made an order prohibiting the naming or other identification of the Claimant in the contextof any report of this case, and that the name of the Claimant should appear as the letter âMâ in any report or judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  As shown in the latter part of this judgment, there are quite a number of issues involved in this case.  To give an overall picture,I would try to summarize the main issues as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the Government was aware that the Claimant was suffering from any kinds of disability when he worked as an AO?</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">assuming that the Government had had no such knowledge, whether the display of certain symptoms of the psychiatric disorder on thepart of the Claimant would be sufficient to make the Government liable under the DDO?</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the treatments received by the Claimant were made on the ground of his alleged disabilities?</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iv)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">in the case that the Claimant was suffering from GAD or some other kinds of disability, whether it was reasonable or justified forthe Government to apply the same criteria in assessing the work performance of the Claimant? and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(v)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">with the alleged disabilities of the Claimant, whether he would be able to fulfill the inherent requirements of the job of an AO?</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">By reason of the length of this judgment and for easy reference, an index listing out the various topics of this judgment is includedin the appendix in the end of the judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  One of the main difficulties in the present case is that the Claimant was suffering from some kind of psychiatric disorder, thesymptoms of which may appear in any other person without suffering from such disability.  Unless the employee behaves in a totallyirrational manner, it would not be easy for an employer to say whether his or her employee is suffering from such kind of disability. This problem is particularly relevant in a competitive society like Hong Kong where a lot of the employees are working under variousdegrees of stress.  Further, the local jurisprudence in this area of the law is still in the early stage of development, and thisadds to the challenges facing the court in the present case.  However, before I proceed to deal with the legal principles involvedin the case, it would be better for me to first resolve the factual disputes between the parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">BACKGROUND OF THE CASE</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The facts in this section are mainly agreed facts or facts which are not contentious.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Mickey Chan, which is the fictitious name of the Claimant, was born in August 1976.  He was raised in Hong Kong and emigrated toCanada with his family when he was 17.  After arriving in Canada, he first attended a community college for about one year.  In September1995, he was admitted to a reputable university in Burnaby, British Columbia where he studied business administration.  In September1997, he applied for the post of AO with the Government of Hong Kong.  He passed 5 written tests and a 2-daysâ selection interviewconducted by a 3-membersâ selection board in Vancouver, and he was one of the 29 candidates appointed as AO out of some 13,000applicants for that recruitment exercise.  In fact, he was ranked 23 among all the candidates.  Mickey passed the examinations inthe university with second class honours, missing the first class honours by a small margin.  Later, he passed the medical examinationof the Hong Kong Government and his appointment as probationary AO was confirmed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In the application form for AO, Mickey had declared that he was not a candidate with a disability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The employment package of an AO is an attractive one.  In 1998 when Mickey joined the Government, the monthly salary of an AO was$35,285.  He was also entitled to 31 days of annual vacation leave, free medical and out-patient dental treatment, reduced ratesfor hospital accommodation, housing benefits upon reaching a certain pay-scale and local education allowances for children.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Each newly recruited AO is provided with an induction training programme which embraces various training modules on a wide varietyof subjects, normally including management, law, media skills, language and personal development.  As AOs are required to be capableof taking many different roles and responsibilities in the administration of the Government, to ensure the all-rounded developmentand versatility, it is the general policy of the Government to require all AOs to be exposed to different areas of work, includingthose which require skills that the officers may have yet to develop full competency, for training and development.  Hence, AOs onprobation are usually given 2 substantive postings of different nature in the 3 yearsâ period of probation.  The postings may beto a policy or resource bureau, a District Office or a department in the Government.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The AO Grade Management Division of the CSB would monitor and assess the performance of AOs of all ranks through Performance AppraisalReports.  AOs on probation are normally appraised and reported on by their supervisors once every 6 months for the first 2 yearsand then once every 4 months for the last year of probation.  The appraising and reporting officer would apply the 25 âcore competencyârequirements in assessing the work performance of the AOs.  By reason of the versatile nature of the work done by AOs, the âcorecompetencyâ requirements cover a broad range of knowledge, skills and qualities required in most posts, including leadership quality,communication skill, personal effectiveness, analytical skill, staff and resource management skills and knowledge of work.  Further,the appraising and reporting officer would assess the probationerâs long term potential to reach the directorate ranks in the AdministrativeService, and it is the policy of the Government that only those probationers who have displayed all-rounded abilities and clear potentialto advance to the directorate ranks would be allowed to pass probation.  Further, probationers would be assessed taking into accounttheir learning curve at different stages of their 3 years of probation.  If a probationary AO is considered to be below the standardrequired of an AO, a Performance Review Conference (âPRCâ) would be convened with the appraising officers to review the caseand to discuss follow-up actions, including the possibility of immediate termination of the employment of the relevant AO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  After attending the induction training programme, Mickey started his work as an Assistant Secretary in the Home Affairs Bureau (âHABâ)on 26 October 1998, whilst his family continued to stay in Canada.  His supervisor was one Mr. John Wan, the then Principal AssistantSecretary for Home Affairs (âMr. Wanâ).  The responsibilities and duties of Mickey mainly involved the formulation of youth policyof the Government, and his work required constant contacts with the Commission of Youth, the Fight Crime Committee, other Governmentbureaus and departments and non-Governmental organizations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  What happened between Mickey and Mr. Wan is a matter of some dispute.  However, it is clear that Mr. Wan was not satisfied withthe work performance of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mr. Gary Poon (âMr. Poonâ), the Assistant Secretary for the Civil Service (Administrative Service) in the CSB, was responsiblefor arranging the recruitment and training of new AOs and monitoring the performance of AOs during their probation period.  By reasonof his job responsibilities, Mr. Poon was also present when Mickey attended the recruitment interview in Vancouver.  In or aboutJanuary 1999, Mr. Poon had a telephone conversation with Mr. Wan to discuss Mickeyâs progress.  By that time, Mr. Wan expressedhis dissatisfaction about Mickeyâs performance, and according to the note made by Mr. Poon, the complaint was mainly as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">[Mr. Wan] was not satisfied with the performance of [Mickey], who seemed to have difficulties to settle in the job.

In that meeting, Mr. Poon told Mickey about the comments byMr. Wan, and there was some discussion about the difficulties faced by Mickey in his work.  As Mickeyâs case was one which raisedsome concern, after that meeting, Mr. Poon referred Mickeyâs case to his supervisor, Ms. Bernadette Linn, who was then a PrincipalAssistant Secretary for the Civil Service (Administrative Service) of the CSB.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In July 1999, Mr. Wan requested the CSB to transfer Mickey out of the HAB, and Mr. Wan also completed the first appraisal reportof Mickey (âthe 1<sup>st</sup> Appraisal Reportâ) covering his work performance from 26 October 1998 to 25 April 1999.

The countersigning officer agreed with such appraisal.  Mr. Wan then had an interview with Mickey to discuss the 1<sup>st</sup> Appraisal report on 14 July 1999.

Generally effective, with some room for improvement.â  Mr. Wan was again of the view that Mickey was not yet fitted for confirmation,with which the countersigning officer agreed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On 29 July 1999, Mickey was transferred to the Transport Bureau (âTBâ) to work as an Assistant Secretary under the supervisionof Mr. Patrick Ho (âMr. Hoâ), the then Principal Assistant Secretary of the TB.  There was a âhand-over periodâ of aboutone week, during which the outgoing Assistant Secretary would help Mickey to get acquainted with the work in the TB.  The main responsibilitiesof Mickey by that time were as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">to provide input to and to co-ordinate the efforts of the Transport Department (âTDâ) and other relevant departments to rationalizebus services to solve the congestion problem in the Central Business Districts;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">to examine working papers and proposals of and to attend meetings on the consultancy study on the co-ordination of public transportservices with new railways, and to monitor the implementation of the policy to improve the co-ordination of different public transportmodes;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">to draft replies to enquires from transport operators and the general public on matters relating to franchised bus services and inter-modalco-ordination, to collate background information for preparation of replies to questions from members of the Legislative Counciland briefs and lines to take for the relevant meetings of the Chief Secretary for Administrationâs Committee and the LegislativeCouncil Transport Panel;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">to monitor the progress of bus service improvement measures;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">to examine the agenda items for the monthly board meetings of franchised bus companies and to develop recommendations for the GovernmentDirectors sitting on those boards in consultation with the relevant colleagues in the TB and the TD;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(f)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">to participate in the consultant selection exercise and pre-study preparation for the Consultancy on Trolley Bus Feasibility Study;and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(g)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">to perform other duties such as to alternate with the other Assistant Secretaries in the TB in acting as the secretary of the bi-weeklyBureau Directorate Meetings (âBD Meetingsâ).</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is common ground that the workload in the TB by that time was heavier than that in the HAB, and Mickey and other AOs in the Bureauwould usually have to work until late in the evenings and during Sundays.  However, there is no evidence to suggest that the workloadthere was heavier than that of other bureaus or departments. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Unfortunately, Mr. Ho was again not satisfied with the work performance of Mickey.  On the other hand, Mickey complains that Mr.Ho was bad-tempered and was hostile to him.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  One of the duties of an Assistant Secretary of the TB was to take turn to be the secretary of the BD Meetings.  However, by reasonof his disabilities, Mickey claims that he had great difficulty in preparing the papers for such meetings, in particular if the worksinvolved formatting of documents and preparation of visual presentations such as diagrams and charts.  Further, Mickeyâs work ofteninvolved collection and analysis of a lot of data about bus routes.  These data were often presented in visual forms which causedMickey great difficulty.  There was also a dispute between Mr. Ho and Mickey about the arrangement of Mickeyâs secretarial support. Mickeyâs secretary was one Ms. Judy Ho, but Mickey complained that she was inefficient and made a lot of mistakes in typing andpreparation of documents.  Mickey therefore sometimes sought the assistance from Ms. Lavin Lai who was the secretary of Mr. Ho. After learning about the same, Mr. Ho told Mickey that it was not desirable for him to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  As Mickeyâs case was identified as one which required close monitoring, Mr. Poon called up Mr. Ho in November 1999 to discussMickeyâs progress.  During that telephone conversation, Mr. Ho expressed his dissatisfaction about the work performance of Mickey. With that comment, Mr. Poon noted in the file that Mickeyâs case required close monitoring in the future.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr. Poon was posted out of the CSB in March 2000, and his successor was Mr. Tony Cheng (âMr. Chengâ) who happened to have workedunder Mr. Ho previously in the Constitutional Affairs Branch.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In April 2000, Mr. Ho approached Mr. Cheng expressing his disappointment of Mickeyâs work performance at the TB.  On 11 April2000, Mr. Cheng had a meeting with Mickey to discuss such issue.  One of the subjects of discussion was the difficulties faced byMickey in his work.  Mr. Cheng also warned Mickey that if his performance did not improve, a PRC might be held and recommendationmight be made for the termination of his employment.  It was also decided that Mickey would be put under observation for a periodof one month, and if his performance did not improve by the end of that period, his employment with the Government might be terminated. Further, Mr. Cheng asked him to submit a performance improvement plan in a weekâs time.  Apart from the aforesaid, the contentsof the conversation are matters of some dispute. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On 17 April 2000, Mickey had another meeting with Mr. Cheng to discuss Mickeyâs work performance.  During the meeting, Mr. Chengshared with Mickey his own experience of taking 3 months of sick leave as a result of work stress.  Apart from that, there is againdispute between the parties as to the contents of the conversation at that meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  After the completion of the observation period of one month in mid-May 2000, Mr. Ho was again not satisfied with the work performanceof Mickey.  Mr. Cheng duly reported the matter to his supervisor, Ms. Linn, and they both agreed to convene a PRC in respect of Mickeyâscase.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  On 23 May 2000, Mr. Ho completed a performance appraisal report of Mickeyâs performance in the TB covering the period from 29July 1999 to 28 January 2000 (âthe 3<sup>rd</sup> Appraisal Reportâ).  In this report, Mr. Ho made the following comments about Mickeyâs work performance:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>[Mickey] is a diligent officer who worked long hours and stayed up late in the office.

Mr. Ho was also of the view that Mickey was unlikely to become fitted for confirmation to the AdministrativeGrade.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  As Ms. Linn and Mr. Poon recommended to convene a PRC in respect of Mickeyâs case, a report was then made to Ms. Anissa Wong whowas by that time the Deputy Secretary for the Civil Service and the supervisor of Ms. Linn.  In support of such recommendation, awritten submission in the form of a memo was prepared by Mr. Cheng and Ms. Linn on 25 May 2000.  After outlining the complaints byMickeyâs 2 supervisors, Mr. Cheng wrote the following in the said memo:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>9.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>â¦â¦[Mickey] felt very stressful in the past few months: could not sleep well, always feeling tired and could not concentrate atwork â¦â¦ Recently, he has stomach ache, cold and flu.

Ms. Wong informed Mr. Lam about the poor comments by Mickeyâs 2 supervisors and the likelihood of a recommendationfor the termination of Mickeyâs employment.  Mr. Lam endorsed the assessment and the convening of the PRC.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  On 26 May 2000, the PRC was held to discuss Mickeyâs case.  It was attended by Ms. Anissa Wong who was the convenor of the PRC,Ms. Linn, Mr. Cheng, Mr. Wan and Mr. Ho.  During the conference, Mr. Wan and Mr. Ho expressed their dissatisfaction about the workperformance and ability of Mickey.  After the discussion, the participants of the conference recommended to terminate Mickeyâsemployment.  In fact, para. 6 of the notes of the PRC summarizes the recommendation as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>The Conference considered that the nature of [Mickeyâs] two postings were typical for AOs and that the extent of supervision which[Mickey] received should be comparable to that of his peers.

There were consistent problems with both his abilities and personality.

Hence, the Conference recommendedthat his service should be terminated.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  After the conference, Mickey was interviewed by Ms. Anissa Wong, Ms. Linn and Mr. Cheng.  There is again dispute about the contentsof the conservation in that interview, but it is common ground that the CSB officers informed Mickey that the Government was goingto terminate his employment as a probationary AO, and it would be in the interest of Mickey to tender the resignation himself.  Afterthe interview, Mickey was given time to consider his options.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  In the morning on 2 June 2000, Mickey was not in the office and Mr. Cheng tried to contact him repeatedly by phone.  After arrivingat the office in the afternoon, Mickey tendered his resignation letter indicating that the effective date of his resignation was2 July 2000.  Later on 12 June 2000, Mickey sent another letter to the CSB requesting to change the effective date of his resignationto 5 July 2000.  Around that time, Mickey sought treatment from a psychiatrist Dr. Peter Yu.  Mickey received from Dr. Yu 2 certificatesrecommending sick leave from 15 to 28 June 2000.  The diagnoses in the 2 certificates were âanxiety disorderâ and âanxietystateâ respectively.  On 26 June 2000, Mickey, relying on such certificates, applied for sick leave from 6 to 20 July 2000.  Onthe same day, Mickey sent another letter to the CSB requesting to change the effective date of his resignation to 25 July 2000.

However, Mickey experienced difficulty in the last 2 employments.  According to him, he had problems in preparingvisual presentations for the clients of his employers and his supervisors became frustrated.  Mickey claims that after his supervisorshad learnt about his disabilities, they were not understanding and were even hostile to him.  As a result of such alleged discriminatoryconducts, he had to quit both jobs.  At the time of the trial, Mickey was unemployed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">MEDICAL CONDITION OF MICKEY</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  At this stage, one would wonder why Mickey performed so badly as an AO.  Was he suffering from any disability?  In this part ofthe judgment, I will set out the medical findings about Mickey made by the various experts engaged by the parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Professor Peter Lee, an experienced clinical psychologist engaged by the Government, conducted a series of worldwide-establishedtests to assess the emotional, cognitive and memory functioning of Mickey.  After such tests, Professor Lee made the following findings:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Mickey is a person of relatively high intelligence;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">there is a marked discrepancy between Mickeyâs verbal and non-verbal intelligence, and Mickey performs poorly on tasks involvingvisual scanning, perceptual details and tasks requiring ability to see and to assemble whole concept or pictures from their individualparts;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Mickeyâs verbal learning and memory functions are normal but his non-verbal learning and memory functions are remarkably weak;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iv)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Mickey has difficulty in performing tasks without specific instructions;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(v)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Mickey has difficulty in making decisions under pressure; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(vi)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Mickey is prone to anxiety.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  According to Professor Lee, the highly unusual drop of IQ points in Mickeyâs non-verbal intelligence indicates a significant discrepancybetween the functioning of both sides of the cerebral hemisphere of Mickeyâs brain.  Had there been reported accident involvinghead injury, Professor Lee would suggest that such specific weakness in cognitive functioning was the result of brain injury.  Howeverwithout a specific cause, Professor Lee cannot offer an explanation for such deficiency.  On the other hand, Professor Lieh-Mak,an experienced psychiatrist engaged by Mickey, describes such deficiency as âvisual short-term memory deficitâ.  It is acceptedby all the medical experts that Mickey had experienced all such problems long before he joined the Government, though Mickey wassomewhat able to compensate such deficit by various means, for example, avoiding choosing academic subjects or assignments whichinvolved a lot of visual presentations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  With such kind of cognitive weaknesses, one can easily understand why Mickey had difficulty in the work at the TB.  After lookingat some visual images, he would soon forget the contents of such images. By that time, one of his duties was to deal with the problemof traffic congestion caused by the public buses in the central business districts.  In working out the solution to such problem,Mickey needed to analyze a lot of data presented in visual forms such as diagrams and charts.  Further, in taking turn to be thesecretary of the BD Meetings, Mickey needed to prepare a lot of papers involving diagrams and flow-charts, and he experienced thesame difficulty.  However, such kind of cognitive weaknesses do not explain why Mickey performed so poorly when he worked in theHAB.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Mickey also had problem in motivating others to work, for examples, in obtaining the necessary information from the TD and in supervisinghis own secretary to carry out the work.  It seems that such kind of problem was caused by Mickeyâs poor working ability ratherthan by any of his disabilities.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Dr. Benjamin Lai, another psychiatric expert engaged by Mickey, is also of the view that Mickey has obsessive compulsive personalitytraits, which include tendency towards perfectionism, excessive suppression of emotion, obsession with details and excessive devotionto work.  Although it is pleaded as some kinds of disability in the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, I consider that these traitsare not disabilities by themselves but only a reflection of Mickeyâs personality.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  However, the problem escalated when Mickey started to suffer from a psychiatric or psychological disorder known as GAD or adjustmentdisorder.  Mickeyâs experts, Dr. Lai and Professor Lieh-Mak, are of the view that Mickey was suffering from GAD, while the Governmentâsexperts, Professor Lee and Dr. Chung See-yuen, make the diagnosis of adjustment disorder.  As I see it, the difference lies on thedifferent interpretation and application of the diagnostic criteria of the two leading guides to the classification of mental andbehavioural disorder known as âDSM-IVâ and âICD-10â.  However, so long as all the medical experts agree that both kinds ofdisorder can be regarded as a psychiatric or psychological illness, it is not necessary for me to make a specific finding as to whetherMickey was suffering from GAD or adjustment disorder when he worked in the Government.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  There is an issue, however, as to when Mickey started to suffer from such psychiatric disorder.  The problem arises because evena person free from disability but working under stress may display symptoms associated with such disorder, and so it is not easyfor the experts to tell whether the anxiety suffered by someone exceeds the threshold of becoming an illness.  All the medical expertsagree that the diagnosis of such disorder would depend on the durations, frequencies and severities of the symptoms.  Mickeyâsexpert, Dr. Lai, after reviewing Mickeyâs account of the events, is of the view that the psychiatric illness had an âinsidiousonsetâ in 1999.  Towards the end of 1999 and in the first half of 2000, his psychiatric illness had worsened to a degree that histhought process, emotion and judgment were affected.  Obviously, the expertsâ diagnoses of the disorder would depend on the subjectivecomplaint of Mickey about the symptoms, and so ultimately when he first started to suffer from the illness would depend on the creditabilityof his evidence.  However even based on Mickeyâs own case, it seems that he was only suffering from the psychiatric disorder tothe extent of affecting his work performance and judgment in the end of 1999 and the first half of 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Mickeyâs another expert, Professor Lieh-Mak, is of the view that Mickey had symptoms of the GAD way back in 1995, but it was probablyin December 1998 that Mickeyâs anxiety passed the threshold to become a disorder.  Dr. Chung, however, is of the opinion that Mickeymight have suffered from psychiatric disorder in 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  As I see it, all the medical experts agree that there were a number of factors interacting with each other causing Mickey to developthe psychiatric disorder.  These factors include: (i) the specific weaknesses in his cognitive functioning; (ii) his personality;(iii) his proneness to anxiety; (iv) the difficulties and the pressure encounter by him in his work; and (v) the tension with hissupervisor, and it is difficult to isolate the effect of a particular factor in contributing to the development of the disorder. However, as his work at the HAB was less affected by his cognitive weaknesses and the workload by that time was not particularlyheavy, I am more inclined to accept the opinion of the majority of the experts that Mickeyâs anxiety had not passed the thresholdof being a disorder until mid-1999 when Mickey started to work at the TB.  In any event, it is clear from the medical evidence thatMickey was not suffering from any psychiatric or psychological illness in the first few months when he worked in the HAB in 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Since leaving the Government, Mickey continued to receive psychiatric treatment except for the period between mid-2001 and early2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">MICKEYâS ALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATORY AND HARASSING CONDUCTS AND THE CONFLICTING VERSIONS OF EVENTS</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  As commonly found in discrimination cases involving employers and employees, there are considerable factual disputes between theparties as the allegations by the complainants usually cover a series of incidents which occurred over a period of time.  The samehappens in the present case.  In this section, I will set out the alleged acts and omissions relied on by Mickey as constitutingunlawful discrimination and harassment on the part of the Government and the various officers who had handled his case.  For easyreference, I will also list out in this section the conflicting evidence adduced by the parties if there are disputes about the incidentsconcerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(i) Mr. Wanâs hostile reactions to Mickeyâs disabilities</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  It is pleaded that shortly after Mickey started his work at the HAB on 26 October 1998, Mr. Wan reacted adversely to Mickeyâsdisabilities.  Mr. Wan frequently reacted in a hostile manner when Mickey talked to him anxiously about his work, and on some occasions,including the performance appraisal interview on 13 July 1999, Mr. Wan drove Mickey out of the office.  Mr. Wan also showed stronghostilities when Mickey appeared to be under-react in their conversations, including yelling at Mickey and asking Mickey why he wasnot responsive and telling Mickey that his lack of response was a sign of confusion and lack of motivation.  Mickey claims that suchconducts amount to direct discrimination and harassment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Mickey gives oral testimony in support of such allegations at the trial.  According to him, Mr. Wanâs hostilities had worsenedhis disabilities, causing him to have anxiety and poor concentration.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Mr. Wan, who testifies at the trial, disputes such allegations.  He denies that he had ever talked to Mickey in a hostile manneror yelled at him.  Though there might be occasions when Mickey came to his office for urgent consultation when he was having a meeting,Mickey was then asked to leave and waited until he finished his meeting.  In fact, Mr. Wan tried to offer assistance to Mickey abouthis work, but Mickey did not respond positively to such offer.  After learning from Mickey that he preferred jobs with precedentsand step-by-step procedures to follow, Mr. Wan even restructured the works of Mickey.  However even with the reduced workload, Mickeyâsperformance was far from satisfactory.  Further, he was not aware that Mickey was suffering from any disabilities when he was workingin the HAB.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(ii) Unfavourable comments about Mickeyâs performance by Mr. Wan to Mr. Poon</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  It is pleaded that in January 1999, Mr. Wan gave unqualified poor comments on Mickey to Mr. Poon without referring to or makingallowance or adjustment for Mickeyâs disabilities, thereby causing or influencing the CSB to form the view that the performanceof Mickey was poor.  Mickey claims that such act constitutes direct and indirect discriminations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  It is common ground that Mr. Wan did make such comments to Mr. Poon.  However, Mr. Wan maintains that he was not aware of Mickeyâsdisabilities by that time and those comments were his genuine assessment of the work performance of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(iii) Mickeyâs treatment at the pastoral visit in March 1999</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  It is pleaded that on 26 March 1999, Mr. Poon simply concluded at the pastoral visit to Mickey that the latter appeared to lackmotivation without considering that Mickeyâs disabilities were adversely affecting his performance at work.  Further, Mr. Poonrefused to consider and rejected Mickeyâs request for assistance or accommodation for the difficulty he had at work with Mr. Wan,thereby constituting direct and indirect discriminations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  At the trial, Mickey gives evidence about such interview with Mr. Poon.  However, in answer to the question as to what sort of accommodationMickey was requesting from Mr. Poon because of his disabilities, as opposed to the personality problems that Mickey encountered inhis work at the HAB, Mickey admits that not much had been said in that regard.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Mr. Poon also testifies at the trial.  According to him, he told Mickey about Mr. Wanâs poor assessment of his work performance,and he warned Mickey that there might be early termination of his service if he did not improve.  As Mr. Poon had met Mickey duringthe recruitment interview in Vancouver, Mr. Poon believed that Mickey could do much better in his work.  Regarding Mickeyâs allegations,Mr. Poon testifies that Mickey did not make any specific request in the meeting.  Whilst on the subject of his work, Mickey mentionedthat he would like to have a schedule with more well-defined tasks, but Mr. Poon told him that such job expectation was unrealisticin the working environment of an AO.  Mr. Poon also tried to give some other advice to Mickey about his work.  Like Mr. Wan, Mr.Poon also denies knowledge of any disabilities on the part of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Mr. Poon made a record of the said conversation with Mickey in his note dated 7 July 1999, which in turn supports Mr. Poonâs evidenceat the trial.  In the final section of such note, Mr. Poon wrote down the following observation:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>A worrying case, and [Principal Assistant Secretary] and [Assistant Secretary (Administrative Service) 1] have been informed.

Otherwise, he would have to be further counseled and could be a possible case for [performance] review conference.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(iv) Request by Mr. Wan to transfer Mickey out of the HAB and the unfavourable appraisal in the 1<sup>st</sup> Appraisal Report</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  It is pleaded that in or about July 1999, Mr. Wan requested Mr. Poon to transfer Mickey out of the HAB.  Further, Mr. Wan completedthe 1st Appraisal Report on Mickey which failed to recognize that Mickey was a person with disabilities.  It is also alleged thatthe report was highly critical of Mickeyâs performance so as to ensure that Mickey would be transferred out of the HAB.  Mickeyclaims that such acts constitute direct and indirect discriminations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  It is not disputed that Mr. Wan requested the CSB to transfer Mickey out of the HAB, and Mr. Wan completed the 1<sup>st</sup> Appraisal Report on Mickey with the observations mentioned in the earlier part of this judgment (see: para. 16 above).  The issuesare whether Mr. Wan was aware of Mickeyâs disabilities by that time and whether the comments in that report were genuine appraisalof Mickeyâs performance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(v) Mr. Hoâs hostilities towards Mickey</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  It is pleaded that shortly after Mickey started his work at the TB, Mr. Ho was unable to tolerate Mickeyâs disabilities.  WhenMickey was anxious and unable to respond, became tired easily, had difficulty in concentration, appeared blank or displayed lackof manual dexterity, Mr. Ho then yelled at him, threw things at him, or pounded the desk in front of him even when other people werepresent.  It is claimed that such conducts amount to direct and indirect discriminations and harassment of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In the trial, Mickey gives a very detailed account as to the alleged hostilities of Mr. Ho towards him.  Mickey claims that Mr.Ho disliked him personally, and he considers that as a reason for the hostilities.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Mr. Ho disputes Mickeyâs account of the events.  As he was not aware of the previous appraisals of Mickeyâs work performanceby the CSB and the HAB, he had no reason to dislike Mickey personally.  Though he considers himself to be a person demanding highstandard, he always treated Mickey in a professional manner.  Further, he often tried to offer assistance to Mickey when the latterexperienced difficulties, and Mickey in fact got far more time, supervision and guidance from him than any of the other AOs thathe had supervised.  Mr. Ho admits that, whilst he might at times during the latter part of Mickeyâs posting in the TB been impatientwith him because of his poor work performance and he had made known to Mickey his dissatisfaction, Mr. Ho had never acted in a hostilemanner towards Mickey.  He had not yelled or thrown things at Mickey or pounded the desk, whether alone with Mickey or in the presenceof others.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Further according to Mr. Ho, he was not aware that Mickey was suffering from any disabilities when he worked in the TB.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(vi) Lack of secretarial support for Mickey</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Mickey claims that the lack of secretarial support was one of the reasons causing the tension between Mr. Ho and himself.  It ispleaded that from December 1999, Mr. Ho prohibited Mickey from using the competent secretarial service of Ms. Lavin Lai who was Mr.Hoâs secretary, and restricted Mickey to using the inadequate service of his own secretary, Ms. Judy Ho, thereby forcing Mickeyto spend unnecessary time on secretarial tasks, in particular the preparation of the papers for the BD Meetings, at the expensesof his designated duties.  Mickey claims that such denial of secretarial support amounts to direct and indirect discriminations andharassment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In the trial, Mickey testifies that, by reason of his disabilities, he experienced difficulty in preparing diagrams and charts andother forms of visual presentations.  At the TB, one of his responsibilities was to serve as the secretary for the BD Meetings. The secretary had the duty to prepare the papers for the meetings, and a lot of such papers involved diagrams, flow-charts, tablesand other forms of visual presentations.  As he had problems with such work, he needed competent secretarial support in this regard. Mickey shared a secretary, Ms. Judy Ho, with another AO in the office, but Mickey claims that she was incompetent.  He thereforesought the assistance of Ms. Lavin Lai who was Mr. Hoâs secretary.  However after Mr. Ho learnt about the same, he did not allowMickey to use the secretarial service of Ms. Lai.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Mr. Ho also testifies in some length about the arrangement of secretarial support.  As Mickeyâs supervisor, Mr. Ho noticed thatMickey lacked the ability to motivate others to work with him, and he was also weak in supervising his staff.  Further, when facinga difficult problem, instead of tackling it, Mickey would try to avoid the problem by taking the easy way out, and Mickey also hada tendency to put the blame on others for something which might be the result of his own shortcomings.  Hence, when Mr. Ho learntthat Mickey was asking his own secretary to do certain works, he was concerned.  In order to help Mickey to develop the potentialof a good AO whose duties included the supervision of staffs, he advised Mickey that he should work with his own personal secretaryand to give clear instructions when giving assignments to her.  This was also for the good administration of the office and was afair arrangement for Ms. Lai.  Although Ms. Judy Ho was not an impressive secretary, she was able to deliver with proper instructionand supervision.  Mr. Ho considers that he was only discharging his duty as the supervisor of Mickey, and it is regrettable thatMickey considers that as a harassment by reason of his disabilities.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Further, it is the Governmentâs case that Mickey should not be entitled to preferential treatment in this regard.  Whilst everyAO in the in the Bureau had their own secretary, there was simply no reason for Mickey to ask for more favourable treatment by havingthe service of other secretaries in the office.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(vii) Mr. Hoâs treatment of Mickey after December 1999</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  It is pleaded that after December 1999, the difficulties and the pressure arising from the lack of secretarial support had worsenedMickeyâs disabilities.  Mickey felt restless and needed to walk around the office to calm himself from time to time.  He lost hisappetite and had flu-like illness.  He became tremulous during meetings and developed palpitations on seeing Mr. Ho.  On the otherhand, Mr. Ho escalated his hostility against Mickey thereby constituting direct and indirect discriminations and harassment of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Mickey testifies that he displayed the aforesaid symptoms when he worked in the office, and Mr. Ho continued to be hostile to him. On the other hand, Mr. Ho denies the hostilities and he was not aware of the alleged âsymptomsâ or disabilities on the partof Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(viii) Mr. Hoâs expectation of Mickey</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  It is pleaded that after December 1999, Mr. Ho expected Mickey to achieve performance which AOs without disability might have achievedbut which Mickey was unable to do so because of his disabilities, and reacted in a hostile manner when that performance was not achievedby Mickey.  It is claimed that such conduct amounts to indirect discrimination and harassment of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  It is common ground that Mr. Ho was not satisfied with Mickeyâs work performance.  In making the assessment, Mr. Ho was not awarethat Mickey was suffering from any disabilities, and so he concluded that the poor performance was caused by Mickeyâs weak workingability, poor working attitude and personality problems.  Further, Mr. Ho had already made allowance for the fact that Mickey wasa junior AO who was in the learning process.  Mr. Kevin Ho, the then Deputy Secretary for Transport and the supervisor of Mr. Ho,who had the opportunities to work with Mickey occasionally, agreed with the appraisal of Mickeyâs performance by Mr. Ho.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  There are two Mr. Ho in the present case: Mr. Kevin Ho and Mr. Patrick Ho.  For easy reference, I will simply refer to Mr. PatrickHo as Mr. Ho and Mr. Kevin Ho with the full name.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(ix) Request by Mr. Ho to transfer Mickey out of the TB and the unfair comments in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Appraisal Report</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  It is pleaded that in April 2000, Mr. Ho requested the CSB to transfer Mickey to another post elsewhere.  Further, it is allegedthat Mr. Ho wrote a very bad, unfair and misleading 3<sup>rd</sup> Appraisal Report on Mickey, conveying to the CSB that Mickeyâs performance was so bad that it justified termination of his employmentso as to avoid continuing to work with Mickey, without recognizing that Mickey was a person with disabilities.  Mickey claims thatsuch conducts amount to direct and indirect discriminations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  It is common ground that Mr. Kevin Ho did make a request to the CSB to transfer Mickey out of the TB.  In respect of the assessmentin the 3<sup>rd</sup> Appraisal Report, Mr. Ho maintains that it was a genuine appraisal of the work performance of Mickey, having taken into account thefact that Mickey was a junior AO in the first two years of his job.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Further, although it is Mickeyâs case that both of his supervisors should have made qualifications in the appraisal reports withreference to his alleged disabilities, it is not clear as to what Mickey expects Mr. Wan and Mr. Ho should have done.  During cross-examination,Mickey accepts that their supervisors would not have put down something like âhe cannot perform the work because of GADâ, buthe expects his supervisors to have noted down the âsymptomsâ that they had noticed and how those âsymptomsâ had affectedhis performance at work.  However, if the Governmentâs officers were not aware that those âsymptomsâ were symptoms of disabilities,one cannot in those circumstances expect the appraising or countersigning officers to tone down the appraiseeâs poor performancewith reference to a reason not within their knowledge.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Although it is not pleaded as part of the discriminatory conduct, Mickey complains that there was deliberate delay on the part ofMr. Ho in completing the 3<sup>rd</sup> Appraisal Report.  However, it was the established procedure that the appraisee was required to fill in the information about hisparticulars in the first part of the report before the same was passed to the appraising officer for writing the appraisal.  As Mickeydid not fill in the required information, that caused the delay in the completion of the report.  Although Mickey maintains thatMr. Ho should have chased him for the report, there is simply no factual basis to substantiate Mickeyâs complaint about the delay.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(x) Mr. Chengâs threat of dismissal and his refusal to provide the assistance requested by Mickey</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  It is pleaded that in the meeting on 11 April 2000, Mr. Cheng told Mickey that his performance would be reviewed in a PRC, followingwhich procedures might be commenced which would lead to the dismissal of Mickey.  Further, it is alleged that Mr. Cheng denied Mickeyâsrequest for assistance and accommodation, and he threatened Mickey that the Government could terminate his employment by simply issuinga memorandum.  Mickey claims that these conducts amount to direct and indirect discriminations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Both Mickey and Mr. Cheng testify about the contents of the conversation in that meeting, which was the first time that they met. They discussed the difficulties faced by Mickey in the course of his work.  Getting the impression that Mickey was always tryingto put the blame on others for his poor performance, Mr. Cheng advised Mickey that he should try to focus on overcoming his own weaknesses. Mr. Cheng also offered other advice for his work.  Mr. Cheng denies that he had ever said to Mickey that the Government could terminatehis employment by simply issuing a memorandum.  However, he did mention to Mickey that if the latterâs work performance did notimprove, the Government might terminate his employment.  In this regard, Mr. Cheng also explained to Mickey the mechanism of conveninga PRC.  Apart from the aforesaid, Mr. Cheng testifies that Mickey had not asked for other specific assistance or accommodation inthat meeting.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xi) Mr. Hoâs reluctance to grant sick leave to Mickey</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  It is pleaded that on 14 April 2000, Mr. Ho approved Mickeyâs application for sick leave after showing great reluctance, therebydeterring Mickey from taking any more sick leave even though he was at times so sick that he felt he would faint.  Mickey claimsthat such conduct constitutes indirect discrimination and harassment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  In his testimony, Mr. Ho denies that he had ever refused Mickeyâs application for sick leave or had shown reluctance in doingso.  On the contrary, Mr. Ho processed Mickeyâs applications for sick leave immediately upon receipt of such applications and approvalswere given to Mickey once the necessary internal procedures were completed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xii) Mr. Chengâs refusal to provide assistance to Mickey after 17 April 2000</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  It is pleaded that in a meeting on 17 April 2000, Mickey told Mr. Cheng about his difficulties at work, and he also complained aboutthe lack of effective clerical assistance.  After the meeting, Mickey requested Mr. Cheng to provide for adequate clerical assistance,but no one from the Government actually listened to his request.  Mickey complains that the denial of his request amounts to directand indirect discriminations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Mr. Cheng agrees that Mickey did mention some of the difficulties faced by him in his work, and he told Mickey that he would conveythe message to Mr. Ho.  However, Mr. Cheng considered that a lot of the problems were caused by Mickeyâs own weaknesses, and hetherefore advised Mickey that he should learn to cope with the pressure and the colleagues in his work.  Mr. Cheng does not recallthat Mickey had made any specific request for clerical assistance or other forms of accommodation.  Further, in order to gain thetrust of Mickey, Mr. Cheng even gave Mickey the number of his mobile phone so that Mickey could call him anytime for advice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xiii) Rumour about Mickey leaving the Government</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  It is pleaded that between 18 and 26 April 2000, Mr. Cheng spread the rumour that Mickey was going to leave the Government, andas a result, someone warned Mickey that his time with the Government was running short.  Mickey claims that such conduct amountsto direct and indirect discriminations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Mickey testifies that the rumour was spread by the Governmentâs officers with a view to pressurize him to leave the civil service. In order to step up the pressure and to humiliate him, though it is not expressly pleaded, Mickey claims that Mr. Ho reduced hiswork portfolios in May and June 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  On the other hand, Mr. Cheng denies that he had ever spread any rumour about Mickeyâs departure.  About the adjustment to Mickeyâswork portfolios, Mr. Ho explains that a senior AO of the TB had completed a large-scaled project by that time, and so arrangementhad been made within the TB to transfer some of the portfolios under the supervision of Mr. Ho, which were then very heavy, to thatAO to maximize the use of spare manpower.  Such arrangement had nothing to do with the work performance of Mickey.  After Mickeyhad tendered his resignation, arrangement might have been made to avoid Mickey from gaining any further access to certain confidentialinformation in the course of his work, but such arrangement was only for operational need and was not directed against Mickey personally.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xiv) Mr. Hoâs assessment in the 3rd Appraisal Report</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  It is pleaded that on or about 24 May 2000, Mr. Ho completed the 3<sup>rd</sup> Appraisal Report on Mickey which made no reference to Mickey being a person with disabilities and which was highly critical of hisdisabilities as if they were merely aspects of poor performance, thereby constituting direct and indirect discriminations of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Again, it is the Governmentâs case that Mr. Ho was not aware that Mickey was suffering from any kinds of disability when the latterwas working under his supervision, and the assessment in the report was a genuine appraisal of Mickeyâs performance when he workedat the TB.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xv) The decision to terminate Mickeyâs employment and the treatment received by Mickey in the PRC on 26 May 2000</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  It is pleaded that in the PRC on 26 May 2000, Ms. Anissa Wong, Ms. Linn and Mr. Cheng told Mickey that they had decided to makethe recommendation to terminate his employment.  They also suggested that Mickey should resign himself, otherwise he would be dismissedand a record of dismissal would be included in his testimonial and certificate of service which might affect his future career. According to Mickey, the Governmentâs officers also suggested him to seek the assistance of counseling service, which he had toarrange for himself.  Finally, they misled Mickey by falsely representing to him that he would not be allowed to resign after theCSB had commenced the termination procedures, and he was given 3 days, later extended to 7 days, to tender his resignation.  Mickeyclaims that such conducts on the part of the Governmentâs officers amount to direct and indirect discriminations and harassment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  There is no dispute that the CSB had recommended to terminate Mickeyâs employment, and we have seen the memo by Mr. Cheng dated25 May 2000 outlining the reasons for doing so (see: para. 32 above).  As a result of Mickeyâs poor performance, a PRC was convenedon 26 May 2000.  Ms. Anissa Wong, Ms. Linn and Mr. Cheng first met Mr. Wan and Mr. Ho, and they all agreed with the recommendation. After the meeting, the CSB officers met Mickey, and they informed Mickey about the Governmentâs decision to terminate his employment. However, in order to avoid citing âdismissalâ as the ground for terminating his employment, which might affect his future career,Mickey was offered the option of resigning himself.  However, the CSB officers dispute that they had ever advised Mickey to seekcounseling service, and they had not told Mickey that he would not be allowed to resign after the CSB had commenced the terminationprocedures.  After the meeting, Mickey was given time to consider his options.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xvi) Advice by Mr. Cheng to Mickey to leave the Government</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  It is pleaded that on 26 May 2000, Mr. Cheng advised Mickey that he should leave the civil service on account of his health problems,and this, Mickey says, constitutes direct and indirect discriminations and harassment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  To be precise, according to Mickeyâs first statement, Mr. Cheng had said that Mickey was very ill and had become much thinnerafter joining the Government, and it would be better for Mickey to leave the civil service.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Mr. Cheng, on the other hand, accepts that he might have spoken something like that to Mickey, but not necessarily at the meetingwith Mickey on 26 May 2000 after the PRC.  However, he was only referring to illnesses such as stomach ache, colds and flus whichMickey had earlier on told Mr. Cheng about.  Mr. Cheng genuinely believed that Mickey was not right for the job of an AO and thathis failing attempts to cope with a job that was beyond his ability put pressure on him and affected his health, and hence a changeof the working environment would be beneficial to Mickey.  Again, Mr. Cheng was not aware that Mickey was suffering from any otherdisabilities apart from the said general illnesses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xvii) CSBâs failure to give the necessary warning as required by the Civil Service Regulations</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  It is pleaded that the CSB had failed to give Mickey any written warning that he might be unsuitable for confirmation in his gradein breach of clause 180(3) of the Civil Service Regulations (âCSRâ), which provides that a warning must be given to an officerif there are indications that he may not be suitable for confirmation, and that in such case he should be helped as much as possible. Mickey claims that the failure to give such warning amounts to direct discrimination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  It is difficult to understand Mickeyâs allegation in this regard.  Even according to his own case, various CSB officers had ona number of occasions warned him about the possibility of the Government in terminating his employment by reason of his poor performanceat work.  It is true that such warnings were not given in writing, but I cannot understand how the technical breach of such provisionof the CSR would by itself amount to discrimination.  Further, it is also the Governmentâs case that it had provided all the necessaryassistance to Mickey, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the counseling by the various CSB officers and the pre-mature reassignment of Mickey to a new post after his work at the HAB.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xviii) Pressure by Mr. Cheng to Mickey to resign by making repeated telephone calls</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  It is pleaded that on 2 June 2000, Mr. Cheng phoned Mickey 5 times to pressurize him to resign, thereby constituting direct discriminationand harassment of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Mr. Cheng admits that he had tried to contact Mickey a number of times on that day.  Mr. Cheng originally planned to call Mickeyto see if he had made any decision after the PRC.  As Mickey did not report to work that morning without prior notice, Mr. Chengwas concerned.  He was even afraid that Mickey might do something stupid such as committing suicide, and that was the reason whyhe had made repeated phone calls to Mickey that morning.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xix) Constructive dismissal by the Government</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  It is pleaded that on 2 June 2000, the CSB constructively dismissed Mickey by causing him to tender his resignation in responseto âharassment and intimidationâ, thereby constituting direct discrimination of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  There is no dispute that the CSBâs officers had informed Mickey of their recommendation to terminate his employment.  However,they claims that such decision was made only because of the poor work performance of Mickey throughout his employment as AO and nothingelse.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xx) Failure of the Government to review Mickeyâs case after the tendering of the sick leave certificates</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  It is pleaded that on or about 24 June 2000, despite the sick leave certificates stating that Mickey was suffering from âanxietydisorderâ and âanxiety stateâ, the CSB failed to review Mickeyâs case including the decision to require him to leave thecivil service, thereby constituting direct discrimination of Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  This is a new allegation which Mickey tried to introduce by way of amendment of the pleading in the early stage of the trial.  Unders. 82(1) of the DDO, a claim for disability discrimination should be instituted within 2 years from the date when the act complainedof was done, and so the Government opposed the amendment on the ground that it was made beyond the limitation period.  However unders. 82(3), the court has a discretion to entertain a claim out of time if it considers that it is just and equitable to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  After hearing submissions from the parties, I allowed Mickeyâs application to introduce such new allegation by way of amendmentof the Particulars of Claim and to extend the time for him to make such claim.  In my judgment, the DDO is a piece of social legislationwith a view to eliminate disability discrimination.  As the local jurisprudence is still in the early stage of development, it wouldbe quite understandable for a complainant to discover new argument in the course of preparing the case.  Further, as the new allegationforms part of a series of events leading to the termination of the employment relationship, I do not find that there would be anyreal prejudice caused to the Government if its officers have to deal with such new allegation at the trial.  To me, the court shouldtry to ensure that all the relevant issues relating to such discrimination dispute be decided on the merits, and it is quite undesirableto bar a party from advancing a related argument simply because of limitation of time.  I therefore allowed Mickeyâs applicationin this regard.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  The Governmentâs answer to this new claim is a simple one.  By submitting the sick leave certificates, Mickey was only applyingfor a period of sick leave in July 2000.  As he did not ask for a review of his case, there was no obligation on the part of theGovernment to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(xxi) Refusal by the CSB to grant Mickey further sick leave in July 2000</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  It is pleaded that on 26 June 2000, despite the submission of the sick leave certificates, the CSB refused Mickeyâs applicationfor sick leave for 2 weeks, which Mickey says, amounts to direct and indirect discriminations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  It was recommended in the 2 certificates that Mickey be given sick leave from 15 to 21 June 2006 and from 22 to 29 June 2000.  Howeverin submitting the certificates, Mickey was actually applying for sick leave from 6 to 20 July 2000, a period which was covered byneither certificates.  Hence, the Government contends that the sick leave certificates did not support the application.  Further,according to resignation letter tendered by Mickey, the effective date of his resignation was 2 July 2000.  In such circumstances,it was not necessary for Mickey to apply for sick leave from 6 to 20 July 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">ASSESSMENT OF THE FACTUAL EVIDENCE</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In the above, I have set out the background of this case and the disputes between the parties about certain incidents.  As I seeit, it is common ground that Mickeyâs performance was not satisfactory when he worked at the HAB and the TB, and the main factualdisputes between the parties bolt down to the following issues:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether Mr. Wan and Mr. Ho had shown hostilities to Mickey in the manner as alleged by him, for examples, driving Mickey out of theoffice, yelling at him or pounding the desk?</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the CSB officers had misled Mickey about the termination procedures or were in any way hostile to him?</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether Mickey had displayed all the symptoms of his psychiatric illness as alleged by him in his testimony, or the âsymptomsâwere just limited to the ones observed by the various Government officers, some of which were included in the various appraisal reportsand memos? and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iv)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether the Governmentâs officers dealing with Mickey were aware that he was suffering from some kind of psychiatric illness whenhe worked as an AO?</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  In answering these questions, I need to assess the creditability of the factual witnesses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(i) The evidence of Mickey</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  The oral testimony of Mickey has lasted for over 6 days, which provides me with ample opportunity in assessing the creditabilityof his evidence.  After hearing Mickeyâs testimony, I can make the following observations.  Firstly, I am impressed by the analyticalskill demonstrated by Mickey in answering all the questions put to him during the trial.  He answers the questions carefully, andhe always qualifies his answers in order to protect his own interest.  When he is not sure about the meaning of a particular question,he would ask for clarification before answering the same.  To my surprise, he can provide answers to every question put to him aboutthe details of the events which happened 6 to 8 years ago, and every time when he is asked about a particular incident, he alwayshas some new details to add.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  Mr. Harris SC, counsel for Mickey, urges me to accept Mickeyâs evidence.  As he is an intelligent person and working in the Governmentwas a painful experience for him, he should be able to remember the details about the various incidents without too much difficulty. As compared with the witnesses of the Government who were treating Mickey as one of the many cases that they had to handle in thecourse of their works, the court, as submitted by Mr. Harris, should prefer Mickeyâs evidence over that of the other factual witnessesof the Government.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Despite such submission, I myself have grave reservation about the reliability of Mickeyâs evidence.  According to my observation,Mickey has an obsession that the termination of his employment was the fault of his 2 supervisors and the CSB officers who had handledhis case, and as a result his evidence becomes very biased, and a lot of his evidence is very much his own subjective perceptionof the events without the support of any factual evidence.  In such circumstances, it is very dangerous for the court to rely onhis testimony.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Perhaps I should elaborate on the reasons why I say so.  As I see it, Mickey is very critical about the temperament of his 2 supervisorswhen he worked as an AO, and he always queries the reasonableness of his supervisorsâ instructions.  After leaving the Government,he took up 7 jobs in a period of 6 years, and he makes similar comments about at least 2 of his supervisors in the post-Governmentjobs.  He is always obsessed with the idea that there was certain conspiracy against him, and he always interprets the conducts onthe part of his supervisors and the CSB officers as unfriendly without proper justification.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  As he proceeds on the basis that his supervisors, in particular Mr. Ho, were unfriendly, biased and hostile to him, Mickey regardsthat a lot of the actions taken by Mr. Ho were directed against him personally,  including: (i) the reassignment of Mickeyâs worksor portfolios around the time when Mickey tendered his resignation; (ii) the refusal of Mr. Ho to allow Mickey to use the serviceof his secretary; and (iii) the delay on the part of Mr. Ho in writing his appraisal report.  However, after listening to the explanationby Mr. Ho, it is clear that these decisions and actions were taken with sound reasons and were not directed against Mickey personally.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  For the rearrangement of Mickeyâs portfolios in June 2000, Mickey complains that this was done with a view to humiliate him andto pressurize him to leave the civil service.  However, it is clear that there was another AO of the TB who then completed the workunder a large-scaled project, and there was spare manpower to take up some of the works under Mr. Hoâs portfolios, which they allagree were very heavy by that time.  I consider that as a sensible decision on the part of the management of the TB for the goodadministration of the Bureau, but yet Mickey, quite unnecessarily, regards this as a hostile act.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  In respect of the secretarial support, it is clear that Mickey had problem in motivating others to work with him.  For examples,he had difficulty in obtaining the necessary information from the TD when Mr. Ho required some factual data for his works, and Mickeyâsown secretary could not deliver her works for Mickey when she had no problem in working with others in the TB.  In my judgment, thisshows the weakness of Mickey as an administrator, and as a responsible supervisor, Mr. Ho should have asked Mickey to motivate hisown secretary to do the works, rather than asking other staffs to do the same for him which would be unfair to those staffs.  Thiswas exactly what Mr. Ho did in the present case, but unfortunately, Mickey regards this as a hostile reaction on the part of Mr.Ho in view of his disabilities.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  For the delay in completing the 3<sup>rd</sup> Appraisal Report, Mickey claims that Mr. Ho had deliberately refused to complete the report.  However, the evidence clearly showsthat the delay was caused by Mickey himself, and yet he put the blame on Mr. Ho.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  The list does not end here.  In his testimony, Mickey draws a number of inferences which turn out to be his own subjective deductionswithout the support of any objective factual evidence.  For example, he mentions that there was an agreement or understanding betweenMr. Ho and Mr. Cheng to drive him out of the civil service.  Whilst I appreciate it is Mickeyâs case that Mr. Ho disliked him personally,there is no basis to suggest that there was such a conspiracy.  As he suspects that all the senior AOs were hostile to him, the conspiracywas simply Mickeyâs own imagination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Further, when Mickey was having difficulties with his work, the CSB officers including Mr. Cheng tried to offer him assistance andcounseled him.  However, Mickey claims that Mr. Cheng only wanted him to leave the civil service as soon as possible, and so allthe assistance and counseling were only âsuperficial effortsâ on the part of Mr. Cheng, and he does not regard the same as akind gesture on the part of the CSB officers.  With the greatest respect to Mickey, there is simply no basis for him to say so. The CSB officers were given the responsibility of monitoring the performance of probationary AOs.  As shown by the written records,it was not an easy task for them to deal with the problem of Mickeyâs poor performance.  As I see it, the CSB officers had alreadytried their very best to counsel Mickey, hoping that he would improve and that it was not necessary to have a pre-mature terminationof his employment.  Yet because of his deep prejudice against the various Government officers, Mickey loses his objectivity whichin turn affects the reliability of his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  According to Mr. Ho and Mr. Cheng, Mickey has a tendency to blame others for something which may be the result of his shortcomings. I can only say that the observations above echo such comment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  What is further disturbing is the alarming remark by Mickey that, according to his experience, senior Governmentâs officers wouldnot consider it as compromising their integrity if they have to lie, whether in court or on other occasions.  In other words, Mickeyis saying that the factual witnesses of the Government are all lying in court, and for them lying is not a serious matter.  Mickeysays so from his own experience, and so it suggests that senior Government officers would lie in the course of their works if necessary. This is indeed a very serious allegation.  Obviously, I am not suggesting that the evidence of senior governmentâs officers, byreason of their ranks, is more reliable than that of a junior officer, but there is simply no basis to support such a serious allegation. According to my observation, such remark only highlights the deep prejudice that Mickey has against all the senior Governmentâsofficers who were his supervisors or had handled his case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  Further, I find it increditable that Mickey is able to recall all the minute details of the various incidents about 6 to 8 yearsago.  Although Mickey is an intelligent young man and he has an obsession with details, he always has something new to add everytime when he is asked about a particular incident.  In fact, some of these details are obviously crucial to the issues of the case,and one would wonder why Mickey had not listed out such details in his witness statements in the first place.  In my judgment, Mickeyhas exaggerated his evidence at trial with a view to substantiate his case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  Another factor which may affect the reliability of Mickeyâs evidence is Mickeyâs obsession that he was medically unwell whenhe worked as an AO.  With all the knowledge of the disabilities subsequently gained from the various medical reports, it would bequite easy for Mickey, either consciously or unconsciously, to exaggerate his symptoms and conditions with the benefit of such hindsight. Indeed, if the symptoms were so obvious by that time, why did Mickey not tell the symptoms to his own doctor? The facts reveal thatMickey had consulted his doctor, Dr. S. F. Fung, for more than 10 times between January and June 2000.  He did not mention to Dr.Fung any of the symptoms that he now relies on except upper respiratory tract infection, epigastric pain, sore throat, runny noseand coughing, and Dr. Fung was not alert enough to treat Mickeyâs condition as anything more than flu or upper respiratory tractinfection or asthma.  Further, Mickey did not raise with Dr. Fung complaints about poor concentration and feeling stressful until5 June 2000 which was after his resignation.  Even then, he just mentioned these 2 and not other âsymptomsâ, and he told hisdoctor that he had suffered such symptoms for over a month, and not for about 2 years as alleged by him in his evidence.  Hence,the âsymptomsâ could not have been obvious by that time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid analysis, I find that Mickey has exaggerated his evidence at the trial and I therefore reject his evidenceas unreliable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(ii) The evidence of the Governmentâs officers</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  On the other hand, I find all the factual witnesses of the Government, including Mr. Wan, Mr. Ho, Ms. Linn, Mr. Poon, Mr. Cheng,Ms. Anissa Wong, Mr. Kevin Ho and Mr. Lam, to be honest and reliable witnesses.  The statements of Ms. Anissa Chan and Ms. JennyChan, who were respectively the Chief Executive Officer and the Assistant Secretary of the HAB at the relevant time, are admittedwithout any dispute.  Having considered their evidence, I find that all the Governmentâs officers had treated Mickey in a professionalmanner.  After observing Mickeyâs poor work performance, they tried to offer assistance to him.  Mickeyâs supervisors, Mr. Wanand Mr. Ho, adjusted Mickeyâs working schedule by providing a more structured work plan.  Although they might at times expressedtheir dissatisfaction about the poor performance of Mickey, without knowing that he was a person under disability, it was only anormal reaction on their part.  Further, the CSBâs officers who had handled his case, in particular Mr. Poon and Mr. Cheng, alsotried to counsel Mickey on the difficulties faced by him in the course of his work.  Based on their evidence, I find that the Governmentâsofficers had tried their best to tackle Mickeyâs problems.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  Further, the evidence of the witnesses of the Government, in particular that related to the important meetings such as the pastoralvisit on 26 March 1999, the interview between Mickey and Mr. Cheng on 11 April 2000, the PRC and the subsequent interview on 26 May2000, is all supported by detailed reports and memos made by the relevant officers after the respective meetings.  If there was anythingwhich might indicate to the officers that Mickey was suffering from some kind of psychiatric or psychological illness, there hadhad to be some reference to the possibility of such sickness, and yet there was none shown in the documents.  Further, the Governmentâsofficers did not have any direct financial interest regarding the employment of Mickey.  To them, they had fixed rules and proceduresto follow, and I do not see the difference to them if they had to recommend the early termination of Mickey, which had to go throughthe procedure of obtaining the endorsement of the Public Service Commission (âPSCâ), or to arrange a replacement to relieve Mickeybecause of medical reasons.  Hence, I see no reason for them to be hostile or biased towards Mickey.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  In particular, I would like to make the following observations about certain witnesses of the Government.  Firstly, Ms. Linn impressesme as a conscientious officer who dealt with various matters concerning the welfare of the officers in the Administrative Service. As Ms. Linn says in her testimony, the fact that Mickeyâs case was only one of many tasks that she and her CSB colleagues hadto handle did not mean that they dealt with it causally.  Speaking for herself, the making of a decision to, <i>inter alia</i>, invite a colleague to leave the service was a âheavyâ one, and it was not her nature to force a colleague to leave or to takethe easy way out for her own convenience or that of her colleagues in the CSB.  I have no reason to doubt Ms. Linnâs evidence inthis regard.  Further, Ms. Linn maintains that there was nothing in the year 1999 or 2000 which showed that Mickey was sufferingfrom any kind of disability by that time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  On the other hand, Mr. Harris put considerable effort in attacking the creditability of Mr. Cheng mainly because of his somewhatunusual background.  Prior to his posting in the CSB, Mr. Cheng had taken 3 months of sick leave.  According to him, he then sufferedfrom certain physical but not psychiatric or psychological illness which was related to the stress of the work as an AO.  By reasonof such experience, Mr. Harris submits that Mr. Cheng should have had a better understanding of the relationship between stress arisingfrom work and the health condition of a particular person, and so he should have known that Mickey was suffering from some kind ofdisability when he worked as an AO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  In fact, Mr. Cheng is much more qualified than that.  When he was studying in the university, he did take psychology as one of hissubjects.  After leaving the Government, he became a hypnotherapist whose job includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the relieving of tension on the part of his clients.  Yet after studying Mickeyâs case, he maintains that Mickeyâs incompetenceand working attitude were the culprits for his poor work performance.  He also observes that Mickey had a tendency to blame othersfor something which was the result of his own weakness.  As Mickeyâs performance had remained poor since he started his work asan AO in the HAB, I see no reason to doubt the genuineness of such assessment by Mr. Cheng.  Further, the evidence of Mr. Cheng illustrates2 things.  Firstly, as the display of âsymptomsâ was not obvious, even someone with the background of Mr. Cheng might not beaware that Mickey was suffering from any psychiatric or psychological disability when he worked as an AO.  Secondly, Mr. Chengâspast experience shows that even a person free from disability but who happens to work under stress may display certain symptoms whichmay be indicative of psychiatric or psychological illness, and yet the display of such symptoms may not mean that the person concernedis actually suffering from such kind of illness.  This happened to Mr. Cheng himself when he was taking 3 months of sick leave dueto the stress from work.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Further, I cannot accept that the CSB officers had lied to Mickey that he would lose the opportunity to resign once the terminationprocedures were invoked.  It would be foolish and risky to the extreme if they had done so, because Mickey would not be so naÃ¯veas to not checking out the relevant regulations when it came to such a serious matter affecting his employment at the Government.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Indeed, to find it in favour of Mickey on the factual disputes, the court would have to find, not only that the CSB officers didnot do the jobs for which they were paid properly, but that they had actually conspired together to: (a) coerce Mickey into resigningeven by lying to him in the interview after the PRC; (b) make up a false minutes of such interview; and (c) perjure themselves inthis action.  Bearing in mind that the CSB officers had no financial interest to gain by early termination of Mickeyâs employmentand who did not have time to work closely with Mickey, I do not accept that they would have gone to such an extent to force Mickeyto leave the Government as soon as possible.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  In fact, Mickey agrees that the CSB officers got nothing personal against him, and the only motives which Mickey can attribute tothem for acting in such a dishonourable, dishonest, stupid and risky manners are that they could be saved the troubles of takinghis case to the PSC, and finding a posting for Mickey pending the PSCâs endorsement.  However, neither of such motives is supportedby a single thread of objective evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(iii) Findings of fact</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  Having made the said observations, I accept the evidence of the factual witnesses of the Government and reject the testimony ofMickey.  In particular, I make the following findings of fact:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the appraisals in the various reports were genuine assessments of the work performance of Mickey;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the âsymptomsâ of Mickeyâs disabilities were limited to the ones mentioned in the various documents, including the appraisalsreports and memos, prepared by the relevant Governmentâs officers and in their testimonies;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">various Governmentâs officers who had dealings with Mickey genuinely and subjectively did not know that Mickey was suffering fromany disabilities when the latter was working as an AO in the Government;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iv)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">although Mr. Wan and Mr. Ho might at times be frustrated with the poor work performance of Mickey and expressed their dissatisfaction,they had not been hostile to Mickey in the manner as alleged by him; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(v)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the CSB officers had not been hostile to Mickey and they had not misled Mickey in any way.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  With these findings of fact, some of the claims by Mickey must fail, for examples, those relating to the showing of hostilitiesby Mickeyâs supervisors and the misrepresentation about the termination procedures by the CSB officers.  However, as it is commonground that Mickey was invited to resign from the Government and his work performance had been assessed without particular referenceto his alleged disabilities, I need to deal with Mickeyâs claims even if he fails on the factual issues.  In this regard, I turnto the legal principles involved in this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">WHETHER MICKEY WAS A PERSON UNDER DISABILITY?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  Before Mickey can succeed in his claim, he must be able to prove that he was a person under disability at the time when he workedin the Government.  âDisabilityâ is defined in s. 2(1) of the DDO to mean:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(a)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>total or partial loss of the personâs bodily or mental functions;</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(b)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>total or partial loss of a part of the personâs body;</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(c)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>the presence in the body of organisms causing disease or illness;</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(d)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>the presence in the body of organisms capable of causing disease or illness;</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(e)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>the malfunction, malformation or disfigurement of a part of the personâs body;</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(f)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>a disorder or malfunction that results in the person learning differently from a person without the disorder or malfunction;

As I see it, no medical expert has classifiedthese weaknesses as an illness, and hence even adopting the wide definition in the DDO, I do not accept that these personality traitscan be regarded as disabilities in themselves.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  The expert evidence in the present case does not support that Mickey was suffering from dyslexia or attention deficit syndrome atthe relevant time.  In fact, in dealing with Mickeyâs weaknesses in visual memory and communication, all the medical experts refrainfrom using the term âdyslexiaâ to describe such deficit.  In this regard, Professor Lieh-Mak adopts the diagnosis of âvisualshort-term memory deficitâ while Professor Lee makes the diagnosis of âspecific weakness in his cognitive functioningâ.  Assuch kind of deficit may cause partial loss of body or mental function, it may be caught by the wide definition of âdisabilityâunder the DDO.  However, such kind of disability cannot be easily observed by others, and even Mickey himself did not know that hewas suffering from such deficit until he was examined by Ms. Hannah Chung, a clinical psychologist, after he left the Government. Further, Mickey had declared himself to be a person free from disability in the application form for AO, and when he was in Vancouver,he was able to perform well in the recruitment exercise despite such deficit.  Hence, it is difficult to expect the Governmentâsofficers to know that Mickey was suffering from such kind of disability by that time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  With such deficit, one can easily understand why Mickey had experienced difficulties in his work, in particular those tasks relatingto formatting of documents and preparation of visual presentations.  Before Mickey joined the Government and when he was in school,he was able to cope with such deficit by, for example, avoiding choosing academic subjects or assignments which involved visual presentations. However, when Mickey started to work as an AO, he had less control over his work and his deficit began to affect him.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  There is also no dispute that Mickey was suffering from some kind of psychiatric disorder in the latter half of his employment withthe Government, whether such disorder should be labeled as âGADâ or âadjustment disorderâ.  According to Professor Lee, Mickeyâsproneness to anxiety, the pressure from his work, the tension with his supervisors, his specific cognitive weaknesses and obsessivepersonality traits all contributed to the development of such illness.  However, as I have said in the earlier part of this judgmentunder the section of the âMedical Condition of Mickeyâ, I find that Mickey can only be regarded as suffering from such disorder,to the extent that the anxiety had affected his emotion and judgment, from mid-1999 when he started his work at the TB (see: paras.40-50 above).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  In the light of the wide statutory definition and the medical evidence above, it is very difficult for the Government to argue thatMickey was not a person under disability when he worked in the Government.  Indeed, Ms. Wong SC, counsel for the Government, doesnot seek to challenge Mickeyâs case in this regard.  I therefore so find.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT WAS GUILTY OF DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  The statutory provisions relating to disability discrimination and harassment apply in the context of employment relationship.

On the other hand, harassment is defined in s. 2(6) of the DDO.  To opposethe claim on direct discrimination and harassment, the Government is basically contending that the Governmentâs officers who haddealings with Mickey were not aware that the latter was suffering from any kind of disability.  Hence, whatever treatment receivedby Mickey was the result of his poor work performance and nothing else.

Indeed, Mickey was not diagnosed as sufferingfrom any anxiety disorder until his consultations with Dr. Peter Yu in June 2000, by which time Mickey had already resigned.

Indeed, the DDO is a piece of social legislation which was drafted after considerable study of theanti-discrimination statutes in other jurisdictions, in particular Australia and England.  The wordings used in our DDO may not bethe same as those in the other legislations, and one can only say that the particular choice of wordings in our DDO was deliberateand the differences may reflect the particular view of our legislature in tackling the problem of disability discrimination in HongKong.

Apart from the difference in the comparison exercisewhich I will elaborate further in the latter part of this judgment (see: para. 157 below), the English legislation expressly requiresâaffirmative actionâ, ie. duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled persons.  Further, one should also note that thereis a defence in s. 4A of the DDA (UK) regarding such duty to make reasonable adjustments, if the employer does not know or couldnot reasonably be expected to know that the employee has a disability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  Bearing in mind the said objective of the DDO, I now turn to s. 6(a) itself.  In my judgment, the wording of the section requiresthe court to conduct a two-stage inquiry: firstly to identify a suitable comparator for the purpose of comparing the treatments betweenthe complainant and the comparator; and secondly to examine whether the different treatment, if any, is made on the ground of thecomplainantâs disability.  In <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales (HCA), ibid.,</i> Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ described the former as the âcomparatorâ question and the latter as the âcausationâ question. As I see it, whether the alleged discriminator has knowledge of the complainantâs disability would affect both stages of the inquiry,and I will deal with each individual question in turn.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The âcomparatorâ question</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  As I have mentioned above, the DDO, which mirrors substantially the DDA (Cth), is to be contrasted with the significantly differentapproach to the protection of disabled persons against less favourable treatment in employment in the DDA (UK).  The definition ofdiscrimination in the DDA (UK) does not contain an express provision requiring a comparison of the cases of different persons inthe same, or not materially different, circumstances.  As observed by Charles J in <i>London Borough Council of Hammersmith v Farnsworth</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20IRLR%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] IRLR 691</a>,the focus of the approach under the DDA (UK) is narrower: it is on the âreasonâ for the treatment of the disabled employee andthe comparison to be made is with the treatment of âothers to whom that reason does not or would not applyâ.  The âothersâwith whom the comparison is to be made are not specifically required to be in the same, or not materially different, circumstances:they only have to be persons âto whom that reason does not or would not applyâ (see: para. 32 of the judgment in <i>Farnsworth</i>).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  I now turn to the comparison exercise under our DDO.  In making the comparison, in the absence of an actual comparator being available,the court is entitled to choose a hypothetical one.  Further, the comparator, whether actual or hypothetical, is not a person withoutthe particular disability, but a person without any disability at all (see: <i>L v Equal Opportunities Commission, ibid, at paras. 55-61</i>).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Pursuant to s. 8 of the DDO, the comparison must also be made on the basis that the relevant circumstances in the case of the âcomparatorâare the same as, or not materially different from, those of the alleged complainant.  This means that whilst the comparator identifiedfor the purposes of s. 6(a) is âa person without disabilityâ, he is not a person who, by reason of the absence of disability,does not engage in the conduct of the disabled person at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  This can be illustrated by the judgment in <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales (HCA), ibid. </i> In that case, a teenage male in foster care, Daniel, had suffered brain damage from severe encephalopathic illness when he was ababy, as a result of which Daniel had behavioural problems, in particular, violent and aggressive behaviour towards teachers andfellow pupils.  Because of such disturbed behaviour, his school principal suspended Daniel and later excluded him from the school. It was claimed on behalf of Daniel that his suspension and expulsion from school amounted to discrimination under the DDA (Cth). It was also argued for him that the hypothetical comparator should be a student who did not engage in any violent behaviour, becausethe latter should be a person without disability and the violent behaviour was a result of the disability.  The majority of the HighCourt of Australia, with McHugh and Kirby JJ dissenting, rejected this argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  Gleeson CJ succinctly pointed out the fallacy of such argument at paras. 11 to 12 of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>11.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â¦â¦ The fallacy in the appellantâs argument lies in the contention that, because the pupilâs violent behaviour was disturbed,and resulted from a disorder, s. 5 [of the DDA(Cth)] always requires, and only permits, a comparison between his treatment and thetreatment that would be given to a pupil who is not violent.  Rather it requires a comparison with the treatment that would be given,in the same circumstances, to a pupil whose behaviour was not disturbed behaviour resulting from a disorder.  Such a comparison requiresno feat of imagination.  There are pupils who have no disorder, and are not disturbed, who behave in a violent manner towards others. They would probably be suspended, and, if the conduct persisted, expelled, in less time than the pupil in this case.</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>12.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>If the appellantâs argument is correct, the comparison required by [the DDA (Cth)] is purely formal.

In treating the comparator in such way, the court is also entitled to take into accountthe duty owed by the Government to the public to provide a good administration, just as the school in <i>Purvis</i> owed a duty to protect other pupils and teachers in the school.  As Mickey fails in the âcomparisonâ test, the Government simplycannot be guilty of direct discrimination under s. 6(a).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  In reaching such conclusion, I would also like to point out that in <i>Purvis,</i> the school was aware of the health condition of Daniel and its effect on his behaviour, and yet the court adopted a comparator whosebehaviour was the same as that of Daniel.  In the present case, the Government was not even aware of the disability of Mickey.  Coupledwith the fact that a person without disability might have performed in the same poor manner, I see no reason for the court to adopta different comparator for the purpose of our comparison exercise, bearing in mind that the object of the DDO is to ensure equalityof treatment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The âcausationâ question</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  Even if the comparison reveals that Mickey was treated less favourably, which I do not accept it to be the case, a further questionmust be asked is whether that treatment was made âon the ground ofâ Mickeyâs disability.  That is the âcausationâ questionmentioned above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  Obviously, the words âon the ground ofâ in s. 6(a) are inserted to require a causal link between the less favourable treatment,if any, and the disability itself.  This is certainly consistent with the object of the DDO in ensuring equality of treatment betweendisabled and non-disabled persons.  The DDO does not seek to achieve substantive justice in the sense that an employer has a dutyto take care of the general welfare of a disabled employee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  So far as I understand, Mickeyâs argument runs as follows.  Firstly, the inquiry about the causal link is an objective one, andso a subjective or conscious intention or motive to discriminate is not a necessary condition of liability.  In this regard, Mr.Harris is relying on cases such as <i>Birmingham City Council v EOC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20AC%201160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 AC 1160</a> and <i>Waters v Public Transport Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20173%20CLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 173 CLR 349.</a>  Secondly, for the Government to be liable, it is sufficient for Mickey to establish that he was invited to resign because of hispoor performance, which was in turn caused by his disabilities.  Thirdly, Mickey is relying on s. 3 of the DDO and argues that itis not necessary for him to prove that disability was the sole reason for the unfavourable treatment, so long as it remained oneof the reasons.  S. 3 reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>If-</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(a)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>an act is done for 2 or more reasons; and</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(b)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>one of the reasons is the disability of a person (whether or not it is the dominant or a substantial reason for doing the act),</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>then, for the purposes of this Ordinance, the act is taken to be done for the reason specified in paragraph (b).â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  On the other the hand, Ms. Wong for the Government relies on the case of <i>Nagarajan v London Regional Transport</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%201%20AC%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 1 AC 501</a> and argues that in the âcausationâ inquiry, the court is bound to consider the mental process and the motive of the alleged discriminatoras to why he treated the disabled person in a particular way.  Further, the simple âbut-forâ test is not sufficient to deal withthe issue of causation in the present case, and citing the cases of <i>Chief Constable of the West Yorkshire v Khan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%201%20WLR%201947" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 1 WLR 1947</a> and <i>Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%202%20All%20ER%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 2 All ER 26</a> and <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales, ibid.</i> in support, the court is bound to look for the real reason (<i>causa causana</i>) for the unfavourable treatment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  However, it seems to me that the cases mentioned above are focusing on an issue which may not be that relevant in the present case. Most of the cases cited above relate to sex and race discriminations, in which cases the prohibited grounds of discrimination, ie.sex and race, were known to the alleged discriminators.  <i>Purvis</i>, on the other hand, was a case concerning disability discrimination, but the school had all along been aware of the health conditionof the disabled pupil Daniel.  In these cases, the alleged discriminators, whilst knowing that the individual person they had todeal with was of a particular race or sex or was suffering from certain disability, nevertheless tried to justify the treatmentsof the alleged victims by some other legitimate reasons.  In order not to frustrate the object of the legislation, the courts inthese cases adopted a more objective approach in ascertaining the reasons for the treatment of the alleged victims.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  However, if the alleged discriminator was not aware of the prohibited ground of discrimination, for example someone was sufferingfrom a disability, then whatever treatment received by the alleged victim, it cannot be said that the same was made on the groundof that personâs disability.  That is simply against the plain meaning of the words âon the ground ofâ in our s. 6(a).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  Further, I do not accept the proposition that if the reason Mickey was invited to resign was because of aspects of his performancewhich were regarded as unsatisfactory and which were in fact caused by disability, that is sufficient for the invitation to resignto be an act of discrimination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  In fact, similar argument was tried without success in <i>Purvis. </i> In that case, the argument ran as follows: the decisions to suspend and then ultimately to exclude Daniel were brought about by hisdisturbed behaviour.  Since such behaviour was part of his disability, Daniel was treated as he was âbecause ofâ his disability,and as Danielâs behaviour was brought about by the disorder from which he suffered, it followed that he was treated less favourablythan a person without disability.  In dismissing such argument, Gummow, Hayne and Heyton JJ said the following at para. 223 of thejudgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>In requiring a comparison between the treatment offered to a disabled person and the treatment that would be given to a person withoutdisability, s 5(1) [of the DDA (Cth)] requires that the circumstances attending the treatment given (or to be given) to the disabledperson must be identified.  What must then be examined is what would have been done in those circumstances if the person concernedwas not disabled.  The appellantâs argument depended upon an inversion of that order of examination.  Instead of directing attentionfirst to the actual circumstances in which a disabled person was, or would be, treated disadvantageously, it sought to direct attentionto a wholly hypothetical set if circumstances defined by excluding all features of the disability.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Extension of liability based on the notion of constructive knowledge?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  As I find that the Governmentâs officers were genuinely not aware of Mickeyâs disabilities, Mickey would have great difficultyin passing the âcausationâ test.  However, Mr. Harris submits that there are some cases which tend to support the propositionthat an employer would be liable for direct discrimination of a disabled employee if the former knew that the latter had some kindof disability, or as Mr. Harris emphasizes, a manifestation of a disability.  With these cases, Mr. Harris argues that there wassufficient display of the symptoms of disabilities when Mickey worked in the Government, and such would make the Government liablefor direct discrimination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  I myself have some difficulty with such argument.  As I see it, Mr. Harris is suggesting that the liability is somewhat based onthe notion of constructive knowledge of the disability.  However, if an employer did not have subjective knowledge of the employeeâsdisability, how can we say that a particular treatment given by the employer to the employee was made âon the ground ofâ thelatterâs disability?  The plain meaning of the words in s. 6(a) simply does not support such a proposition.  Further, as I havementioned above, the object of the DDO is to ensure equality of treatment.  If the employer was not aware of the disability, theemployerâs decision for a particular treatment would not have in any way been influenced by the disability of the employee.  Thedecision is not a âcolouredâ decision, and so why should the employer be liable?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  Nevertheless, I must agree that, apparently not to frustrate the object of the legislation, the courts may sometimes adopt a moreobjective approach in considering the âcausationâ question.  Like in the cases of <i>Nagarajan v London Regional Transport, ibid.</i> and <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales (HCA), ibid.</i>, where the alleged discriminators were aware of the prohibited grounds of discrimination but claim that the unfavourable treatmentshad nothing to do with the prohibited grounds, then the court is entitled to adopt a more objective approach on the âcausationâquestion.  However, when the court is venturing into an uncharted territory which is beyond the plain meaning of the statutory provision,the court must be cautious in not imposing an unjustified burden on people like employers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  The issue in the present case is slightly different from the aforesaid cases on causation.  The question here is, to quote the wordsof Sir Ronald Wilson in <i>X v McHugh</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20EOC%2092%2d623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) EOC 92-623</a>, whether âemployers are required to be vigilant in their regard for circumstances affecting the interest of their employeesâ(at p. 77,312).  In considering whether the court should impose such a duty on the employers, we need to examine the cases reliedon by Mr. Harris in support of Mickeyâs claim, including <i>Siu Kai Yuen v Maria College</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%202%20HKLRD%20775" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 2 HKLRD 775</a>, <i>London Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham v Farnsworth, ibid.</i> and most important one <i>X v McHugh, ibid.</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  <i>Siu Kai Yuen</i> is the only local case touching on the issue.  The plaintiff teacher suffered from rectum cancer and took sick leave for an operation. Before he resumed work, the defendant school terminated his employment.  One of the issues raised in that case was whether the defendantwas informed of the nature and extent of the plaintiffâs illness prior to the dismissal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  HH Judge C. B. Chan accepted the submission made by the Equal Opportunities Commission (âEOCâ) on behalf of the plaintiff thatthe alleged discriminatorâs knowledge of the nature and extent of the complainantâs illness is irrelevant for the purposes ofthe DDO, and Judge Chan said the following at para. 35 of her judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>The plaintiffâs legal representative submits that it is irrelevant whether the defendant knew the nature and extent of the plaintiffâsillness.

Hence, putting this case at the highest, it only supports the propositionthat if the alleged discriminator was aware of the illness of the alleged victim, though the nature and extent of the illness mightnot be known, the alleged discriminator may still be liable for direct discrimination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  The decision of the English Employment Appeal Tribunal (âEATâ) in <i>London Borough Council of Hammersmith and Fulham v Farnsworth, ibid.</i> and the decision of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (âHREOCâ) in <i>X v McHugh, ibid.</i> were cited in support of Judge Chanâs reasoning.

She was given a provisional job offer but was referred tothe Boroughâs occupational health physician for âmedical clearanceâ.  The physician then consulted the complainantâs generalpractitioner and the hospital doctor, and found that the complainant had a history of mental illness.  The physician reported thesame to the Borough and expressed her reservation as to whether the complainant was fit for the job.  The Borough therefore withdrewthe offer of appointment and the complainant lodged an action for discrimination.

Further, Charles J held that the approach of the EAT in <i>OâNeill v Symm &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20IRLR%20233" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] IRLR 233</a> that actual knowledge of the disability is required is no longer good law in the light of the decision of the English Court of Appealin <i>Clark v TDG Ltd. trading as Novacold</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20IRLR%20318" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] IRLR 318</a><i>.</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  However, the Employment Tribunal found as a fact, which was upheld by Charles J in the EAT, that the occupational health physicianhad actual knowledge of the complainantâs disability.  As an agent of the Borough, her knowledge as such was imputed to the latter. Further, regardless of the imputed knowledge, the Borough did have actual knowledge, from the physicianâs report, of the evidenceof ill health on the part of the complainant over a number of years which at times had been severe and necessitated hospital admissions,and that the complainant might be liable to further recurrences in the future which would affect her performance and attendance atwork.  Hence, Charles Jâs decision on whether an alleged discriminator must have knowledge of the victimâs disability is strictly<i>obiter.</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  More importantly, the decision in <i>Farnsworth</i> was made based on the interpretation of the then s. 5(1)(a) of the DDA (UK), which is substantially the same as the current s. 3Aof the DDA (UK) but very different from s. 6(a) of our DDO.  The then s. 5(1)(a) of the DDA (UK) provides that âan employer discriminatesagainst a disabled person for a reason which relates to the disabled personâs disability, he treats him less favourably than hetreats or would treat others to whom that reason does not or would not applyâ.  The key words are âwhich relates to the disabledpersonâs disabilityâ, which are substantially different from the words in our s. 6(a), ie. âon the ground of that other personâsdisabilityâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  Indeed, such statutory formulation played a key role in the reasoning of the English decisions.  In <i>Clark v TDG Ltd. trading as Novacold, ibid.,</i> a case relied upon by Charles J in support of his decision, Mummery J made the following observation about such statutory formulationin para. 63 of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â¦â¦it is more probable that Parliament meant âthat reasonâ to refer only to the facts constituting the reason for the treatment,and not to include within that the added requirement of a casual link with disability: that is more properly regarded as the causeof the reason for the treatment than as in itself a reason for the treatment.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  In <i>Farnsworth,</i> Charles J also cited for support another EATâs decision in <i>H J Heinz Co.

As we see it, the expression may include a reason deriving from how the disability manifests itselfeven where there is no knowledge of the disability as such.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  In my judgment, such linguistic difference is material.  Undoubtedly, our DDO has been drafted after considerable study of the correspondinglegislations in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, and so the usage of particular wording in our DDO is significantin determining the scope of protection against disability discrimination.  As I have mentioned above, the DDA (UK) adopts a verydifferent approach to tackle the problem of disability discrimination, and hence, apart from the fact that the alleged discriminatorin <i>Farnsworth</i> did have actual knowledge of the complainantâs disability, I am of the view that the English authorities provide very limited assistancein the interpretation of the meaning of direct discrimination in our s. 6(a).  In this regard, I must also repeat the danger of blindlyfollowing the jurisprudence of other jurisdictions as sounded by Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ at para. 206 of their judgment in <i>Purvis v State of the New South Wales (HCA), ibid.</i> (see: para. 153 above).</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Australian decisions</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  On the other hand, the wording of our s. 6(a) is very similar to that of s. 5(1) of the Australian DDA (Cth), which adopts the phraseâbecause of the aggrieved personâs disabilityâ.  Hence, the Australian jurisprudence is much more relevant for our presentpurposes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  I would first start with <i>X v McHugh</i>, <i>ibid</i>., which is a case heavily relied upon by Mr. Harris in support of Mickeyâs claim.  I must say that the facts are very similar tothose in the present case.  The complainant was described as a brilliant student, who had excelled as an all-rounder at school andgraduated from universities with various degrees.  After working in a number of banks and finance companies, the complainant becameparanoid and suspicious, believing that he was under surveillance and fearing for the safety of his life.  He was then compulsorilyadmitted to hospital twice for psychiatric treatment.  His condition gradually improved until 6 months later where treatment wasno longer thought to be necessary.  The complainant then worked as an auditor for the respondent subject to a probation period of6 months.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a>  After the probation period, the supervisor did not recommend the confirmation of his appointment, because the complainant âhadproblems which impacted on his performance as an auditor which cannot be addressed due to his apparent inability to accept the existenceof such problemsâ.  The supervisor recommended an extension of the probation period to give the complainant an opportunity to receivecounseling.  The mental condition of the complainant then deteriorated and he was admitted to hospital as a compulsory patient forpsychiatric treatment, and the psychiatrist diagnosed the complainant as having paranoid schizophrenia.  The complainant then returnedto work 2 weeks later, and the only medical certificate given to the respondent was a short statement certifying that the complainantwas in hospital suffering from âa medical conditionâ and would be unfit to follow his daily operation for about 5 weeks.  Hecontinued medication after leaving hospital and began to feel control of his job.  However, the complainant failed to make the improvementin his work performance as demanded by his supervisor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  His supervisor recommended to terminate the complainantâs employment.  The complainant then made an immediate response to therespondent, asserting that many complaints against him were lodged during his first probationary period at a time when he was affectedby a medical condition, which was subsequently supported by a more detailed medical report which stated that the complainant wassuffering from âa serious medical conditionâ.  Later, the respondent wrote to the complainant terminating his employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  After certain appeal proceedings, the complainant was allowed to continue his work.  However, his supervisor again recommended thetermination of the complainantâs employment in the probation report one month later.  The supervisor supplemented such report witha further memorandum which in part addressed the medical question.  It mentioned that the complainant at no time, even after hishospitalization, had been prepared to inform the respondent of the possible impact of his medical condition on his performance. The supervisor also stated that â[u]nfortunately, the damage had been done.  It has been said that you never get a second chanceat a first impressionâ.  The respondent considered these reports and then wrote to the complainant terminating his employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  In his claim for direct discrimination based on s. 5(1) of the DDA (Cth), or alternatively for indirect discrimination, the AustralianHREOC ruled in favour of the complainant and held that he had been unlawfully dismissed on the basis of his disability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  In his decision, the President of the Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, held that it is not necessary for an employer to know of theexistence of the employeeâs disability, and it is enough if the employer is shown to have discriminated because of a manifestationof that disability.  Sir Ronald said the following at p. 77312:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>The respondent may well feel aggrieved that there should now be an attempt to hold him accountable for conduct which lacked deliberateintention on his part at the time.

Employers are required to be vigilant in their regard for circumstances affecting the interest of their employees.  I agree, at leastin the circumstances of this case, with the interpretation of the [DDA (Cth)] advanced by Counsel for the respondent, namely, thats. 5 is about objective discrimination.  It is not necessary that an employer know of the existence of the disability.  It is enoughif an employer is shown to have discriminated because of</i> <i>a manifestation of a disability.â</i> (emphasis added)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  One should perhaps note that the employer in <i>McHugh</i> had actual  knowledge, whether by reference to the medical certificate, the medical report and the written response from the complainanthimself, that the latter was suffering from some serious medical condition, although the precise nature of the condition was unknown. Given these facts, whether the employer was aware only of the manifestations of disability but not the complainantâs precise medicalproblems was simply a non-issue in <i>McHugh</i>, and the wide proposition put forward by Sir Ronald is therefore purely <i>obiter. </i> In fact, as submitted by Ms. Wong, such an understanding of <i>McHugh</i> is supported by the decision of the Australian Capital Territory Administrative Appeals Tribunal in <i>Re Prezzi &amp; Discrimination Commissioner and Quest Group Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20ALD%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 ALD 729</a>, in which the said Tribunal made the following observation at para. 37 of the decision:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â¦â¦ Where the impairment is due to some psychological or psychiatric condition, the manifestations of the impairment are less likelyto point to the existence of impairment.  Where the manifestations of an impairment are the</i> <i>necessary consequence</i> <i>of the impairment, then to treat a person unfavourably because of the manifestations means that the person is being treated unfavourablybecause of the impairment.  This would seem to be the reasoning behind the statement in [X v McHugh] that âIt is enough if an employeris shown to have discriminated because of a manifestation of a disabilityâ.  Indeed, this was the very issue in [X v McHugh], sincethe employer did not know that the complainant was a paranoid schizophrenic.  The employer did, however, have a report by the complainantâsdoctor which stated that the complainant suffered from a serious medical condition and that this condition contributed greatly toany relationship and interpersonal problems suffered by the complainant.  To that extent, the statement that âIt is not necessarythat an employer know of the existence of the disabilityâ may not have been necessary for the decision.â</i> (emphasis added)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  In <i>Prezzi,</i> the complainant was suffering from certain psychological impairment, and Quest Group Pty Ltd (âQuestâ) was a contractor engagedby the Government to find work for persons who had been unemployed for a long time, of which the complainant was one.  In the courseof helping the complainant to find work, the complainant made abusive telephone calls to the staffs of Quest and that she made itclear that she would not cooperate with Quest in seeking work.  Quest had difficulty placing the complainant in employment and referredher back to the Commonwealth Employment Service (âCESâ).  By doing so, the complainant claimed that Quest had discriminated againsther by reason of her impairment.  The Administrative Appeals Tribunal dismissed the complaint as unsubstantiated, as there was noevidence to show that, when Quest referred the complainant back to the CES, it was aware or should have been aware that the complainantwas suffering from a psychological impairment, nor did it base its action on a perception that the complainant was suffering fromsuch an impairment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  To me, the Tribunal in <i>Prezzi</i> had succinctly pointed out the difficulty in dealing with disability relating to psychiatric and psychological disorder.  Most ofthe manifestations of such kind of impairment, that are the symptoms themselves, are equivocal and can be found in a normal personwho just happens to work under stress.  Hence in <i>Prezzi</i>, the Tribunal tried to restrict the application of <i>McHugh</i> by limiting the knowledge to those manifestations of the impairment which are the ânecessary consequencesâ of the impairment. In this regard, it would also be interesting to note the observation and the criticism of the decision in <i>McHugh</i> by the Tribunal in para. 48 of the decision:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>â¦â¦it is clear that [Quest] terminated the relationship with [the complainant] because of her abusive and irrational behaviour,which had strong adverse affects on [Quest] staff and showed that it would be difficult to place her in employment.  The relationshipwas not terminated because of any underlying condition which might have been the cause of her behaviour.  It is, we think, necessaryto be cautious about a general application of the principle apparently espoused by the Human Right and Equal Opportunity Commissionin [X v McHugh].  In that respect, the decision is at odds with what seems to be a consistent approach in other jurisdictions.

Despite that, the majority, including Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Callinan JJ, stilldismissed the complaint of disability discrimination, either based on application of the âcomparatorâ test or the âcausationâtest mentioned above.  In any event, the decision in the lower court highlights the problems associated with the discrimination ofpsychiatric or psychological disability, the symptoms of which may just be found in any other person without suffering from suchdisability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  The <i>dicta</i> in <i>X v McHugh</i> was, however, cited with approval in other Australian cases including <i>Randell v Consolidated Bearing Company (SA) Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FMCA/2002/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] FMCA 44</a> and <i>Chinchen v NSW Department of Education and Training</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/2006/180.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] NSWADT 180.</a>  However in <i>Randell</i>, the employer had actual knowledge of the disability of the employee and the presiding Federal Magistrate distinguished <i>Tate v Rafin</i> and <i>Purvis</i> on that basis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  As for the case of <i>Chinchen,</i> the dispute was whether an otherwise gifted child with motor dyspraxia, a learning disability which made it difficult for him tocomplete tasks, especially written ones, under a time constraint, had been discriminated against by his school which had removedhim from its extension class.  The New South Wales Administrative Decisions Tribunal rejected the schoolâs submission that itslack of knowledge of the childâs motor dyspraxia was fatal to the claimantâs case, and held that a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination could still be made out provided that the identified characteristic of that disability, for example difficultywith the completion of tasks under a time constraint, was known to the school.  <i>X v McHugh</i> was cited in support of the decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  However, one thing to note about this case is that it was concerned with the interpretation of s. 49B of the New South Wales Anti-DiscriminationAct 1977 (âthe ADA (NSWâ), which is worded differently from s. 5(1) of the DDA (Cth) and our s. 6(a) and which contains the âcharacteristicsextensionâ in the definition of âdirect discriminationâ.

Mr. Harris is relying on <i>X v McHugh</i> and tries to establish the proposition that for an employer to be liable for direct discrimination, it is not necessary for the employerto know the existence of the employeeâs disability, and it is enough if the employer is shown to have discriminated because ofa manifestation of a disability.  Hence, the basic question is whether it is good law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  In my judgment, I have grave reservation about this wide proposition.  Firstly, it is strictly <i>obiter</i> because the employer in <i>X v McHugh</i> knew about the disability of the complainant.  Secondly, there have been various attempts in the Australian courts and tribunalsto limit the application of <i>X v McHugh</i>, for examples the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in <i>Re Prezzi &amp; Discrimination Commissioner and Quest Group Pty Ltd., ibid.</i> and that of the Federal Court of Australia in <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales (FCA), ibid.</i>  In particular, these cases highlight the difficulty concerning psychiatric and psychological illnesses, the symptoms of which mayappear in any individuals without suffering from such disability.  A direct application of the proposition may therefore sometimeslead to most unjust result.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a>  Thirdly, in reaching the decision in <i>X v McHugh</i>, Sir Ronald had not considered the âcomparatorâ and âcausationâ questions as required by s. 5(1) of the DDA (Cth).  In fact,theFull Court of the Federal Court of Australia in <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2002/503.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] FCA 503</a> made the same criticism about the judgment in <i>X v McHugh</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>Whilst entitled to respect, the decision of HREOC in X v McHugh and the HREOC decisions which apply it arose in an employment settingunder a previous statute and assert the result without setting any satisfactory comparative analysis such as is required by s5 orits equivalent.â</i> (at p. 10 of the Lexis transcript)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  As I have mentioned above and illustrated by cases such as <i>Nagarajan v London Regional Transport, ibid.</i> and <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales (HCA), ibid.</i>, even if the alleged discriminator was aware of the prohibited grounds of discrimination, for example the discriminatee was sufferingfrom a disability, the court is still required to consider the âcomparatorâ and âcausationâ questions as required by s. 5(1)of the DDA (Cth).  With the greatest respect, Sir Ronald had simply failed to do so in <i>X v McHugh. </i> Based on all these reasons, I do not accept the alleged proposition in <i>X v McHugh</i> as a legal principle of general application.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  Hence, what should be the law?  After reviewing the aforesaid authorities, I would set out in the following what I regard shouldbe the proper legal principles to be applied in the present case, in particular about the degree of knowledge of the employeeâsdisability that is sufficient to make the employer liable for direct discrimination under the DDO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  Firstly, as I have mentioned above, the object of our DDO is to ensure equality of treatment between disabled and non-disabled persons. It tries to avoid the making of âcolouredâ decision, in the sense that treatment given to a person should not in any way beinfluenced by that personâs disability, and equal opportunities should be made available to all individuals whether they are sufferingfrom a disability or not.  In such circumstances, there should be no discrimination if the alleged discriminator is not aware ofthe disability of the complainant.  That is the reason why the words âon the ground of that other personâs disabilityâ andâon account of that second-mentioned personâs disabilityâ are used in the definitions of âdirect discriminationâ and âharassmentâin our s. 6(a) and s. 2(6) respectively.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  Secondly, as established by the authorities such as <i>Siu Kai Yuen v Maria College, ibid.,</i> once an employer knew that his or her employee was suffering from a disability, for example the employee had to be hospitalized becauseof a medical condition, and unfavourable treatment was given to that employee, though the nature and extent of the disability wereunknown, that would be sufficient to make the employer liable for direct discrimination if the other requirements are met.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  Thirdly, in determining whether the alleged discriminator did have knowledge of the disability, I maintain that the plain meaningof our s. 6(a) only supports a subjective approach, that is if the alleged discriminator genuinely did not know about the disabilityof his employee, he should not be liable.  Indeed, we have already seen that there are various ways for the legislature to extendthe meaning of direct discrimination, for examples, the use of the formulation âfor a reason which relates to the disabled personâsdisabilityâ in the DDA (UK) and the inclusion of the âcharacteristics extensionâ in defining âdirect discriminationâ ins. 49B of the ADA (NSW).  If our legislature had intended to have a wider definition, it could have expressly so drafted the DDO,and yet our legislature decided to adopt the more restrictive wording of âon the ground of that other personâs disabilityâin our s. 6(a).  As the Hong Kong DDO was drafted after extensive study of the corresponding statutes and jurisprudence in otherjurisdictions, one must give effect to the intention of the local legislature by not extending the meaning of âdirect discriminationâto an unnecessary extent.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  Fourthly, the court, however, is sometimes entitled to adopt a more objective approach in considering the question of knowledge,but there must good reason for doing so.  Assuming that an employee has symptoms which are so obvious as indicating some kind ofdisability, and yet the employer turns a blind eye towards the whole affair and treats the employee in an unfavourable manner, thenI agree that, subject to the satisfaction of the other requirements, such recklessness is sufficient to make the employer liablefor direct discrimination.  To rule otherwise would frustrate the object of the DDO, and the imposition of such a light duty wouldnot cause undue burden on the part of the employers.  This is very similar to the ânecessary consequenceâ test proposed by theFull Court in <i>Re Prezzi &amp; Discrimination Commissioner and Quest Group Pty Ltd, ibid.</i>  If the behaviour and the symptoms of the employee are the necessary consequences of the disability, then the symptoms must havebeen obvious and the employer may be liable under such circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  Mr. Harris, on the other hand, submits that the test should be whether the employer, on all the facts, including the nature andskills of the employer, could reasonably have been expected to suspect disability on the part of his or her employee.  If the answeris yes, the employer is liable.  Such concept of âreasonablenessâ is expressly provided for in s. 4A of the DDA (UK), but I myselfhave great reservation about adopting such test in the present case.  Firstly, the Hong Kong legislature could have introduced suchtest in the DDO, and yet there is none in the statute.  Secondly, I do not accept that it was the intention of the legislature toexpect the employers to play the role of psychiatrists, psychologists or investigators, or to put the employers in a difficult positionof requiring them to investigate every single case when there is some display of equivocal âsymptomsâ.  It is one thing to ensurethat employers should provide equal opportunities to all individuals, but it is quite another matter to impose a duty on them totake care of the general welfare of employees.  The latter is very much a matter of âsubstantive equalityâ as observed by Gummow,Hayne and Heydon JJ in paras. 200-203 of their judgment in <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales (HCA), ibid.</i> (see: para. 153 above).  âSubstantive equalityâ may be a concept adopted by the DDA (UK), but in the absence of such conceptand the âreasonablenessâ test in our DDO, I would maintain that nothing short of the obvious symptoms and recklessness on thepart of the employer is sufficient.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  Fifthly, extra care should be given when dealing with amorphous forms of disability such as mental, psychiatric or psychologicalillness.  I am not suggesting that persons suffering from such disability would lose the protection under the DDO.  However, whenwe are talking about the âmanifestation of a disabilityâ, we are actually referring to the symptoms of the disability itself,and the symptoms of the amorphous forms of disability may cover a wide range of behaviour patterns that some of them are simply sharedby individuals without disability at all.  In the words of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in <i>Re Prezzi</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â¦â¦ Where the impairment is due to some psychological or psychiatric condition, the manifestations of the impairment are less likelyto point to the existence of impairment.â</i> (at para. 37)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  Indeed, as agreed by all the medical experts in the present case, the display of certain symptoms may not result in a diagnosisof any psychiatric or physiological disorder.  A person who is free from disability but works under stress may have insomnia or constantstomach pain, and it is only the frequencies, durations and severities of the symptoms that count.  In particular, employees withpoor working ability may face extra pressure from his work, and it is very difficult for an employer to make a judgment as to whatcauses a particular employee to perform so poorly at work.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Application of the legal principles to the facts of the present case</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  With these observations, I turn to the facts of the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  In my judgment, the facts here fall far short of establishing the necessary knowledge on the part of the Government or its officers. As I accept the factual evidence of the Governmentâs witnesses, the display of the âsymptomsâ on the part of Mickey was notobvious to an extent that it would have alerted the Governmentâs officers about the possibility of Mickey having disability.  Infact, as I have mentioned above, even Mickey did not regard the âsymptomsâ as serious enough for the same to be revealed to hisown doctor (see: para. 123 above).  Further, if the symptoms were obvious, I find it surprising that the Governmentâs officers,who all had had considerable experience in public administration, did not make reference to the possibility of any psychiatric orpsychological disorder in any of the reports or memos, in particular when they had no real financial interest as to how to deal withMickeyâs case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  It is true that Mr. Wan did use the words âslow and sluggishâ in the 1<sup>st</sup> Appraisal Report in appraising the work performance of Mickey, and Mr. Wan also referred Mickey as âthe most inert AO he had everseen.â  On some occasions, Mr. Wan and Mr. Ho also found that Mickey appeared to have a blank face.  But in my judgment, this isfar from suggesting that Mickey was suffering from some kind of disability.  These descriptions must be understood in the contextof the whole report.  While appraising his work performance, Mr. Wan was describing Mickey as a person with low efficiency and productivity. According to Mr. Wan, Mickeyâs lack of motivation and poor working ability and attitude were the main culprits for his poor performance. Further, as Mr. Ho has testified, an employee who does not understand the requirements of the job before him may put up a blankface in front of his supervisor, and this may not be a symptom of any kind of psychiatric disability.  If Mr. Wanâs and Mr. Hoâsevidence is genuine, which I find it to be the case, they should be the best persons to explain why there used these particular descriptionsin their appraisals, and in my judgment, the court should not adopt other interpretations or read those words out of the contextof their use.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  Mr. Harris also relies on the facts that: (i) Mickey had on some occasions worn his sweater inside out; (ii) Mickeyâs office wasmessy; and (iii) Mickeyâs handwriting is like that of a primary school student.  In my judgment, I cannot see how the poor handwritingof Mickey could indicate that he was suffering from some kind of psychiatric disorder at that time.  Further, the wearing of thesweater inside out and the tidiness of the office, at most, show that Mickey was a sloppy person.  I imagine that even a person withoutsuffering from disability may have experienced the same embarrassment of wearing the wrong side of the sweater, especially if heor she is working under pressure with little attention devoted to take care of the daily details.  In fact, I have the opportunityof looking at the relevant sweater produced by Mickey as exhibit.  Except with the label, the sweater looks pretty much the sameeven if one is wear the sweater inside out.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a>  The Governmentâs officers had from time to time noticed that Mickey was suffering from some flu-like symptoms like runny noiseand fatigue.  However, this is far from saying that the display of these symptoms mean that Mickey was suffering from other kindof disability except for flu.  Indeed, when Mickey was reciting these symptoms to his own doctor Dr. Fung, the same did not alertthe said doctor that Mickey was suffering from anything other than flu.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a>  In the memo dated 25 May 2000, Mr. Cheng noted that Mickey was under severe stress for the past few months, and he expressed concernwhether Mickey could stand much further.  Such memo was subsequently read by other senior officers of the CSB.  Later on 2 June 2000,after Mr. Cheng failed to contact Mickey by telephone, Mr. Cheng was also concerned that Mickey might do something stupid such ascommitting suicide.  In his submission, Mr. Harris argues that the reference to the suicidal idea was a âdamning admissionâ onthe part of the Governmentâs officers.  With this background, would it have occurred to them that Mickey might be suffering fromsome kind of psychiatric or psychological disorder?</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  It is always easy now to analyze the situation critically with the benefit of hindsight and all the medical findings obtained afterthe commencement of these proceedings.  However, I accept Ms. Wongâs submission that the observations mentioned above must be understoodin the context of the circumstances facing Mickey by that time.  Looking at it from the point of view of the Governmentâs officers,Mickey had persistently encountered marked difficulties with all aspects of the job of an AO so much so that his suitability forthe post was called into question right from the beginning.  Further, according to Dr. Chung, anxiety may be considered normal ifit is appropriate to the stress.  In particular, anxiety may not be regarded as excessive if the person suffering it has a reasonto worry.  In Mickeyâs context, he had every reason to be anxious as he was worried about his poor work performance and the likelihoodof dismissal, and so Mickeyâs anxiety might be understandable adverse psychological reaction in response to the stress of doinga job that was beyond him and possible dismissal from the job.  In other words, even a person free from disability would be worriedwhen he or she was facing the same situation, even to the extent of having suicidal idea.  Hence, these observations, reading themin the light of Mickeyâs performance in the Government, only suggest that Mickey was under intense stress by that time but notnecessarily suffering from any kind of disability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  Mr. Harris further argues that various Governmentâs officers should have regarded to the facts that Mickey managed to obtain secondclass honours university degree and to pass the competitive AO recruitment exercise, his poor performance would then be a symptomindicative of some form of disability.  His argument is somewhat supported by the expert opinion of Professor Lieh-Mak.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a>  However, if Mr. Harrisâ argument is correct, there would be no point for the Government to set up the probation system in thefirst place.  One must appreciate that candidates who achieve good academic performance and perform well in interviews and examinations,which are conducted in more or less structured environment, may not be able to perform well as an AO.  The demands and the pressureassociated with the actual job may be different and so the whole point of imposing a 3-yearsâ probation period is to weed out unsuitableappointees.  There had been previous occasions in which the appointment of AO was not confirmed and Mickey might just be one of thosecases.  Further, the recruitment boards noted the following weaknesses of Mickey, including that he was weak in oral English expression,his arguments and points were not particularly perceptive and there was room for improvement for his social skill.  In such circumstances,Mickeyâs poor performance might just be caused by such weaknesses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a>  Further, even if I were to accept Mickeyâs evidence about the display of symptoms, I do not think that it would advance his caseany further.  According to him, there is a long list about the alleged symptoms, including, <i>inter alia</i>, showing a high level of anxiety, poor concentration, chronic fatigue, stomach ache, inability to respond or appearance of under-reactionor having a blank mind, sleeplessness, lack of manual dexterity, loss of appetite, flu-like symptoms, fever, feeling of restlessness,palpitations and becoming tremulous, indecisiveness and excessive fear of making mistakes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a>  The list may look impressive.  However, some of these symptoms would only have been known to Mickey himself.  In this testimony,Mickey seems to suggest that his colleagues should have known about his disabilities by reason of âhis lookâ, but there is simplyinsufficient basis to support such inference.  Mickey insists that the people around him saw what he is now convinced to be âsymptomsâ,when they might not even registered it or might have registered it but drew a different conclusion.  Further, it is always easy nowto analyze the situation critically with the benefit of hindsight, but the facts remain that Mickey had been working in the Governmentfor about 20 months, and during that time, he worked closely under the supervision of his colleagues.  In such circumstances, occasionaldisplay of such âsymptomsâ, observed a few times over a long period of time when Mickey worked with them, might not suggest anythingabnormal.  Even Mickeyâs medical experts accept that anxiety is a normal state of being, and only when it oversteps the threshold,then it becomes a disorder.  Psychiatrist and psychologist would look at the severities, frequencies and durations of the symptomsto decide whether someone is suffering from GAD or other kind of psychiatric or psychological disorder, however I do not accept thatit was intention of the legislature to expect lay employers to play the role of psychiatrists and psychologists.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a>  Based on the aforesaid analysis, I do not find that the symptoms displayed by Mickey when he worked as an AO were obvious to anextent as indicating that he was suffering from some kind of disability.  One must understand that working as an AO is a stressfuljob, and it would be quite normal to expect certain AOs to display symptoms of stress, which is quite different from saying thatthey are suffering from some kind of disability.  The Government certainly did not turn a blind eye or was in any way reckless aboutMickeyâs condition.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  Even if I were wrong and that the court were to apply the âreasonablenessâ test as submitted by Mr. Harris, I am of the viewthat the result would be the same.  As the symptoms were not obvious and were equivocal in nature, it would not be reasonable toexpect the Government to speculate as to the reason why Mickey performed so badly as an AO.  In my judgment, this is too onerousa duty to be imposed on employer.  As I have mentioned above, it is one thing to ensure that the employer would provide equal opportunitiesto all the employees, but it is quite another matter to impose a duty on the employer to take care of the general welfare of theemployees, at least this is not the object of our anti-discrimination legislation.  In such case, apart from the âcomparatorâand the âcausationâ questions, Mickeyâs claim must fail because the Government did not know that he was suffering from anydisability.  Nor did the Government treat Mickey under the perception that he was suffering from the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Governmentâs knowledge of the disability in June 2000</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  On 24 June 2000, Mickey submitted to Mr. Ho 2 sick leave certificates by Dr. Peter Yu dated 14 and 20 June 2000, which respectivelystated that Mickey was suffering from âanxiety disorderâ and âanxiety stateâ and recommended sick leave from 15 to 21 June2000 and from 22 to 28 June 2000.  After learning about his disability, Mickey complains that the Government was guilty of discriminationby not reviewing his case of resignation and rejecting his application for sick leave from 6 to 20 July 2000.  As the Governmentdid have some degree of knowledge about Mickeyâs disability starting from 24 June 2000, I think that the alleged discriminatoryand harassing conducts after that date deserve separate consideration.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  In this regard, one must understand that Mickey actually resigned his post by way of letter on 2 June 2000 with the effective dateof resignation one month later on 2 July 2000.  He also applied for leave from 28 June to 2 July 2000.  His resignation was acceptedand his leave application was also granted on the same day, ie. 2 June 2000.  Mickeyâs last day in the office should thereforebe 27 June 2000 and arrangements were made to relieve the duties of Mickey in TB with effect from 28 June 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  On 12 June 2000, Mickey sought to unilaterally postpone the effective date of his resignation from 2 July to 5 July 2000.  Mickeythen took sick leave on 15 June 2000 and from 20 to 22 June 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a>  On 24 June 2000, Mickey submitted the relevant 2 sick leave certificates to Mr. Ho.  The only application that Mickey made in relianceupon these 2 certificates was that made on 26 June 2000, that was the day before his last day in the office, for sick leave from6 to 20 July 2000, a period which was covered by neither certificates.  Also on 26 June 2000, Mickey unilaterally sought to furtherpostpone the effective date of his resignation from 5 to 25 July 2000, which was followed by a letter dated 27 June 2000 faxed byMickey to the CSB to cancel his approved leave from 28 June to 1 July 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a>  The Government put forward 2 reasons for refusing the sick leave application.  Firstly, CSR 1273(2)(b) required sick leave exceeding2 working days to be granted only upon the receipt of a medical certificate.  As Mickey applied for sick leave in July whereas hiscertificates only covered certain periods in June, Mickeyâs application was not supported by the necessary sick leave certificates. Secondly, under the then current CSR 1273(4), an officer was not eligible for the grant of sick leave until his approved leave hadexpired.  By 26 June 2000, Mickeyâs approved leave from 29 June to 2 July 2000 had not expired, and so he was not entitled to thesick leave applied for.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a>  By a letter dated 27 June 2000, Mr. Cheng informed Mickey that as arrangements had been made to relieve his duties on 28 June 2000,the CSB would not withdraw the approved leave and that since Mickey would not be required to report duty from 28 June 2000, he didnot need sick leave after that date.  As the sick leave certificates produced by Mickey did not cover the period in respect of whichleave was being sought, the premise underlying the complaint about the rejection of Mickeyâs sick leave application is simply missing. In such circumstances, Mickey had not been subjected to less favourable treatment and his application was refused for want of compliancewith the relevant provisions of the CSR and not on the ground of his alleged disability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a>  The other complaint is that the Government had failed to review his case after its officers had learned about his disability.  Theshort answer to such claim is that in submitting the sick leave certificates, Mickey did not ask for a review of his case, and hence,there is no basis to support such claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a>  However, even if Mickey were to ask for a review or that the law, for whatever reasons, imposes a duty on the part of the Governmentto review Mickeyâs case, I do not think that the result would be different.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p237" class="para" id="p237">237.</a>  As I have mentioned above, knowledge of the prohibited ground of discrimination is only a pre-requisite to liability.  The complainantmust also have to pass the âcomparatorâ and âcausationâ tests as required by s. 6(a) of the DDO.  As the hypothetical comparatorwould be one who performs as badly as Mickey though without suffering from any disability, Mickey cannot satisfy the âcomparatorâtest as discussed in the earlier part of this judgment (see: paras. 157-164 above).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a>  For the âcausationâ test, I have a few more remarks to make.  Firstly, as established by the cases such as <i>Nagarajan v London Regional Transport, ibid.</i> and <i>Chief Constable of the West Yorkshire v Khan, ibid.,</i>  the court is required to ascertain the real reason for the unfavourable treatment.  In my judgment, the real reason for the Governmentin terminating Mickeyâs employment was his poor performance as an AO.  Mickey had been given the opportunity of serving two postings,and yet his performance had remained constantly poor.  Despite the various efforts helping Mickey to improve, it failed to produceany fruitful result.  This was even the case when Mickeyâs workload was relatively light when he started his work in the HAB, andby that time there was simply no reason for anyone to suggest that he was suffering from some kind of disability.  Hence, poor performancewas the only real reason for the termination of Mickeyâs employment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a>  Further, dismissing Mickey was not an end in itself.  To discharge its duty to the public, the Government had a duty to maintainthe Administrative Service as a taskforce of officers who were all capable of discharging their duties in different posts effectivelyand efficiently.  Just like the school in <i>Purvis,</i> it had a duty to ensure that Daniel would not pose as a danger to other pupils and staffs in the school, and that was the real reasonwhy he was suspended and expelled.  On this particular issue, Gleeson CJ said the following at para. 13 of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>Similar considerations arise in respect of the related issue of identifying the ground of the first respondentâs action, which isto be considered in the light of both ss5 and 10 of the Act.  The fact that the pupil suffered from a disorder resulting in disturbedbehaviour was, from the point of view of the school principal, neither the reason, nor a reason, why he was suspended and expelled. It is the school authority that is the alleged discriminator, and it is the reason or reasons for action of the responsible officersof the school authority that is or are in question,  It is their conduct that is to be measured against the requirement of the Act. If one were to ask the pupil to explain, from his point of view, why he was expelled, it may be reasonable for him to say that hisdisability resulted in his expulsion.  However, s 5, 10 and 22 are concerned with the lawfulness of the conduct of the school authority,and with the true basis of the decision of the principal to suspend and later expel the pupil.  In the light of the school authorityâsresponsibilities to other pupils, the basis of the decision cannot be fairly stated by observing that, but for the pupilâs disability,he would not have engaged in the conduct that resulted in his suspension and expulsion.  The expressed and genuine basis of the principalâsdecision was the danger to other pupils and staff constituted by the pupilâs conduct, and the principalâs responsibilities towardsthose people.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a>  Further, looking at it from the viewpoint of the Governmentâs officers, the anxiety suffered by Mickey in mid-June 2000 mighthave been triggered by the recent event of inviting him to resign.  As I have mentioned above, Mickey by that time had every reasonto be anxious about the possible dismissal by the Government.  As the work performance of Mickey had remained poor since he firststarted to work as an AO, there was no reason for the Governmentâs officers to change their view, even after receiving the 2 sickleave certificates, that Mickeyâs constant poor performance of about 20 months was caused by problems relating to his ability andworking attitude and nothing else.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a>  As the real reason for terminating the employment of Mickey was his poor work performance and his treatment would be the same asthat would be received by the comparator, even if the Government had some degree of knowledge of Mickeyâs disability in mid-June,it is not liable to Mickey for the alleged discrimination or harassment which took place after that date.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Harassment</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p242" class="para" id="p242">242.</a>  As in the case of direct discrimination, the unwelcome harassing conduct must be made âon account ofâ the disability of theperson alleged to have been harassed (see: s. 2(6) of the DDO).  According to para. 48 of the judgment of Judge Muttrie in <i>L v Equal Opportunities Commission, ibid.</i>, the words âon account ofâ in s. 2(6) should carry the same meaning as âon the ground ofâ in s. 6(a).  Since Mickey failson the âcausationâ test in the claim for direct discrimination as the various Governmentâs officers were not or should nothave been aware of Mickeyâs disorder, and the real reason for his treatment was his poor work performance, Mickeyâs claimon harassmentshould likewise fail.  Further, a lot of the complaints on harassment are based on Mickeyâs factual allegations, for examples theyelling at Mickey and the pounding on desk by Mr. Ho.  As I reject Mickeyâs evidence on the facts, his claim for harassment cannotpossibly succeed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a>  I then turn to the claim on âindirect discriminationâ which is defined in s. 6(b) of the DDO:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>6.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="3"><i>A person discriminates against another person in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Ordinance ifâ</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(a)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>â¦â¦â¦</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(b)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>he applies to that other person a requirement or condition which he applies or would apply equally to a person without a disabilitybut -</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(i)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="84%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>which is such that the proportion of persons with a disability who can comply with it is considerably smaller than the proportionof persons without a disability who can comply with it;</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(ii)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="84%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>which he cannot show to be justifiable irrespective of the disability or absence of the disability of the person to whom it is applied;and</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>(iii)</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="84%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>which is to that personâs detriment because he cannot comply with it.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p244" class="para" id="p244">244.</a>  Although the treatments by the employer of all the employees are the same, individual employee with a certain attribute may findit more difficult to comply with the requirements of the employer.  Indirect discrimination is therefore an exception to the objectof treating all persons equally, and by reason of the disability of an employee, it actually requires the employer to treat thatemployee differently.  However, unlike the corresponding provision in the DDA (UK), our DDO stops short of requiring the employersto take âaffirmative actionsâ to accommodate the needs of disabled employees, except for the purpose of relying on the defenceof âinherent requirements of the jobâ which I will elaborate further in the latter part of this judgment (see: paras. 256-279below).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p245" class="para" id="p245">245.</a>  It is Mickeyâs case that the Government was guilty of indirect discrimination by applying to him the same assessment criteriato which all other AOs were subjected (âthe Criteriaâ), without making allowance for his disabilities or giving special assistanceand accommodation to enable him to comply with the same.  In other words, Mickey complains that by reason of his disabilities, hecould not be expected to perform to the same standard as other AOs without a disability.  Thus, his performance should not have beenassessed by reference to such standard, at least not without him being given all the special assistance and accommodation he requiredto reach to such standard.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p246" class="para" id="p246">246.</a>  The Government accepts that the Criteria did constitute a requirement or condition as referred to in s. 6(b).  It is also not disputedthat the conditions in ss. 6(b)(i) &amp; (iii) are satisfied, in the sense that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the proportions of AOs with disabilities who could comply with the Criteria were likely to be considerably smaller than the proportionsof AOs without a disability who could also comply with the same (see s. 6(b)(i)); and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the application of the Criteria to Mickey was obviously to his detriment because he could not comply with such Criteria (see s. 6(b)(iii)).</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p247" class="para" id="p247">247.</a>  However, the Government, relying on s. 6(b)(ii), claims that the application of the Criteria is justifiable irrespective of thedisability or absence of disability of the persons to whom they are applied, ie. all the AOs.

In fact, even Mickeyin his cross-examination accepts that AO is a challenging job, and I do not find that the Government has exaggerated the importanceand the demanding nature of such job.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p251" class="para" id="p251">251.</a>  Having considered the said features, I am of the view that the Government has satisfied the 3 conditions as set out in the caseof <i>Crizzle</i>.  So far as the objective in applying the Criteria is concerned, the Government has to ensure that all AOs do possess the broad rangeof knowledge, skills and qualities required in most of the posts of the AO grade to a reasonable standard so that the duties of differentposts will be discharged effectively and efficiently.  In <i>Crizzle,</i> it was held that it is not for the court to redraft or to redefine the âobjectiveâ, and I accept that the court should not questionthe legitimacy of such objective given the central and crucial role and functions played by the officers of the Administrative Servicein the governance of Hong Kong and the demanding nature of their works.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p252" class="para" id="p252">252.</a>  Secondly, as reasonable measures to achieve the said objective, the Government must adopt a structured system for the assessmentof the performance of AOs according to the Criteria.  Indeed, the recruitment, confirmation and promotion of AOs are only for thebest candidates, and the remunerations of AOs are on terms that are commensurate with the heavy responsibilities and demanding dutiesof the job.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p253" class="para" id="p253">253.</a>  Thirdly, the application of the Criteria is justifiable upon a balance between the discriminatory effect on Mickey and the reasonableneeds of the Government.  As mentioned in the description of the works of the AOs, the Administrative Service is a small workforceand even junior AOs are entrusted with heavy duties, and hence one should not expect the Government to require for anything lessof the officers who carry out public functions of such impact upon the well being of the society.  In fact, even Mickey in his testimonyconcedes that the 25 âcore competenciesâ are fair and reasonable requirements to be applied in the assessment of AOs, even thoseon probation, given their heavy responsibilities.  Further, if an AO, even a junior one, cannot discharge his or her duties efficientlyor effectively, it would seriously affect his or her colleagues in the office, with the result that it can cause undue pressure onthe other colleagues, or even worse, the relevant bureau or department simply fails to carry out the function required of it.  Hencein my judgment, the Government has satisfied the principle of proportionality.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p254" class="para" id="p254">254.</a>  From the various appraisal reports and memos, it is clear that the work performance of Mickey was well below the standard set bythe Criteria.  Although Mickey had on some occasions shown improvement, his performance was still far from being satisfactory.  AsI accept that the appraisals were genuine and honest assessments of Mickeyâs performance, Mickeyâs claim on indirect discriminationmust fail.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p255" class="para" id="p255">255.</a>  One must also note that according to Mickeyâs case on the pleading, it is not that he had been under-assessed by his supervisors,rather what Mickey feels aggrieved about is that his supervisors and reviewing officers had failed to note and address the reasonsfor his poor performance, namely his alleged disabilities.  In fact, Mickey did not raise any objection about his assessments inthe various appraisal reports or to the officers of the CSB, and he agrees in cross-examination that his work performance had putextra burden on his teammates in the office.  I must also add that in the pleading, Mickey relies on some conducts as acts of indirectdiscrimination, for examples, the yelling and throwing of things by Mr. Wan and pounding the desk by Mr. Ho, the reluctance of Mr.Ho in granting sick leave and the suggestion by Ms. Anissa Wong, Ms. Linn and Mr. Cheng to Mickey to seek counseling service.  However,it is unclear as to what unjustified requirement or condition is said to have been applied to Mickey in each of these situations. Hence for whatever reasons, Mickeyâs claim for indirect discrimination cannot succeed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">THE DEFENCE OF THE âINHERENT REQUIREMENTS OF THE JOBâ</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p256" class="para" id="p256">256.</a>  Even if the Government is guilty of discrimination against Mickey, there is still a defence available to the Government if it canestablish that Mickey would be unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the job of an AO.

However since the wording of our s. 12(2) is similar to that ofs. 15(4) of the DDA (Cth), we can obtain some guidance from the Australian authorities in this regard.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p258" class="para" id="p258">258.</a>  The first one is <i>Qantas Airways Ltd. v Christie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20152%20ALR%20365" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 152 ALR 365 (HCA).</a>  In this case, Mr. Christie was employed by Qantas as an airline pilot, and he was a captain of B747-400 aircraft flying on internationalroutes.  The employment contract provided that a pilot could not be employed beyond the age of 60, but Mr. Christie challenged Qantasâdecision not to extend his employment after such age on the ground of age discrimination.  Under s. 170DF(2) of the Industrial RelationAct 1988, the wording of which is similar to that of s. 15(4) of the DDA (Cth), it does not prevent age from being a reason for terminatingemployment if the reason is based on âthe inherent requirements of the particular positionâ, and so one of the issues in thecase was whether the reason for not extending Mr. Christieâs employment was based on the inherent requirements of his position.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p259" class="para" id="p259">259.</a>  At the relevant time, some of the countries covered by most of the routes structure of Qantas enforced the Rule of 60, which wasbased on a standard in an international convention prohibiting pilots of over 60 years of age of flying an aircraft to or over thosecountries.

However, the High Court of Australia held that itwas an inherent requirement of the position which Mr. Christie occupied as a pilot of 747-400 aircraft that such a pilot should notbe excluded from flying those aircrafts to or over those countries which enforced the Rule of 60, and remitted the case back to theFull Court of the Industrial Relations Court to determine whether Mr. Christie, notwithstanding the limited destinations to whichhe could fly after he turned 60, could comply with Qantasâ roster system.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p260" class="para" id="p260">260.</a>  In dealing with the issue of the inherent requirements of a particular employment, the following observations were made in the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>1.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â¦â¦The question whether a requirement is inherent in a position must be answered by reference not only to the terms of the employmentcontract but also be reference to the function which the employee performs as part of the employerâs undertaking and, except wherethe employerâs undertaking is organized on a basis which impermissibly discriminates against the employee, by reference to thatorganization.â (per Brennan CJ)</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>36.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="90%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>A practical method of determining whether or not a requirement is an inherent requirement, in the ordinary sense of that expression,is to ask whether the position could be essentially the same if that requirement were dispenses with. â¦â¦â (per Gaudron J)</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p261" class="para" id="p261">261.</a>  The second case is <i>X v Commonwealth of Australia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20167%20ALR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 167 ALR 529 (HCA).</a>  The claimant, X, was dismissed from the army after being tested HIV positive, and he complained that the dismissal was unlawfuldiscrimination under the DDA (Cth).

As it was an inherent requirement of such job to deal with physical and mental stresscontinually, the Tribunal found that Mr. Rabadi, by reason of his psychiatric disability, was unable to carry out the inherent requirementsof the job.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p265" class="para" id="p265">265.</a>   After referring to these cases, I can perhaps try to summarize the law on the âinherent requirementsâ defence under s. 12(2)of the DDO as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">whether a defendant can rely on the s. 12(2) defence involves a two-stage inquiry: firstly to identify the inherent requirements ofthe relevant employment, and secondly to ask whether because of the employeeâs disability the employee is unable to carry out thoserequirements;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the âinherent requirementsâ defence does not impose an obligation on the employer to alter the nature of the particular employmentso as to accommodate the disabled employee, and the court must give appropriate <i> </i>recognition to the business judgment of the employer in organizing its undertaking and in regarding this or that requirement as essentialto the particular employment;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">when considering whether the requirements of the job are inherent or not, it is the requirements of that particular employment whichmust be considered, not the requirements of some different employments modified to meet the needs of a disabled employee.

As their work closely relates to various aspects of the community, the pressure of the work not just comes from their supervisors,but from the many departments, organizations and institutions that they have to work with both inside and outside the Government. Furthermore, as the work of the Government would be closely scrutinized by the public, AOs must have to cope with the pressure fromthe media and the general public as a whole.  This is certainly different from many other jobs in the private sector.  Whilst itmay be relatively easy for the Government to arrange for an understanding supervisor thereby minimizing some of the pressure, itwould not be possible for the Government to control the pressure from other sources.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p267" class="para" id="p267">267.</a>  The Government contends that it must be inherent requirements of employment as AO to demonstrate all-round capabilities to dischargethe duties in different posts effectively and efficiently under the most demanding conditions, whether as to time to complete thework or the volume of work, and encompassing not only the handling of issues but also of the people one has to work or to deal with. It is also an inherent requirement to withstand the physical and mental stress arising from the job.  In view of the heavy responsibilitiesof the AOs, the limited work force, the duty owed by the Government to the public to provide a good administration, and the possibleimpact of the work of the AOs on the general public, it is, in my judgment, quite impossible for the court to query the legitimacyor the reasonableness of such requirements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p268" class="para" id="p268">268.</a>  The next stage of the inquiry is whether Mickey, by reason of his disabilities, would be able to carry out such inherent requirementsof the employment.  In this regard, Professor Lieh-Mak is of the opinion that Mickey, given appropriate medical treatment, shouldbe able to take up the job of an AO.  While recognizing Professor Lieh-Makâs considerable experience in public administration,I am afraid that I cannot agree with her opinion in this regard.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p269" class="para" id="p269">269.</a>  Firstly, it is not disputed that Mickey had been tried out in 2 different posts and he failed badly in both.  In fact, even Dr.Benjamin Lai and Professor Lieh-Mak agree that when Mickey started off as an AO in 1998, he was not suffering from any exceptionallevel of anxiety, and yet his performance was poor by that time.  Further, all the medical experts agree that neither GAD nor visualshort-term memory can be cured.  In such circumstances, it seems unlikely that after developing a psychiatric disorder and then havingtreatment therefor that would not cure would put him in a better position than that at which he started to work as an AO in October1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p270" class="para" id="p270">270.</a>  Secondly, while Professor Peter Lee agrees that it would not be too difficult to treat GAD alone, Mickeyâs case is more pessimisticbecause of the presence of the following complications: Mickeyâs proneness to anxiety, his obsessive compulsive traits and specificweaknesses in his cognitive functioning.  The last-mentioned weaknesses are said to affect Mickeyâs abilities to multi-task, tohandle situations in which he would need to improvise, identify the underlying questions and work out a solution in the absence ofclear instructions or guidelines, to make and commit to decisions, to stay on a task without being distracted, to handle multipleand different sets of data, in particular working under a time constraint.  Professor Lee is of the view that these vulnerabilitieswould always be lurking.  If Mickey is facing lesser degree of stress, these vulnerabilities would probably lie dormant and not reallyaffecting Mickeyâs everyday life, but when the degree of stress becomes more intense, such vulnerabilities would surface.  Thesewould affect Mickeyâs choice of vocation to the extent that when these cognitive faculties or abilities are called into play, thentogether with Mickeyâs proneness to anxiety and obsessive compulsive traits, they can work against Mickey like a âperfect stormâwhen there is intense stress and can interact in a vicious cycle with one factor aggravating the other.  To a certain extent, ProfessorLieh-Mak agrees with such assessment by Professor Lee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p271" class="para" id="p271">271.</a>  I agree with the opinion of Professor Lee in this regard, which is, to a great extent, supported by Mickeyâs post-government employmenthistory.  In fact, he had 7 jobs in a period of about 6 years after he left the Government, which suggests that Mickey, even afterreceiving medical treatment, had not been able to hold down to a job, whether such job was in the public or private sector.  AlthoughMickey is satisfied with his employment with Consulting Company A and Non-Governmental Social Services Organisation D (see: paras.38-39 above), Mickey was having the same problem with his supervisors in other two employments.  In fact, history seems to have repeateditself here.  According to Mickey, when he was experiencing difficulty with some of the works involving visual presentations, therewas then tension developed between Mickey and his respective supervisors.  As a result, Mickey had anxiety which eventually led tothe termination of his employments.  It might be true that Mickeyâs vulnerabilities were not exposed when he worked in ConsultingCompany A and Non-Governmental Social Services Organisation D where his cognitive weaknesses were not called into play, or therewere some other factors favourable to Mickey by that time.  However, taking into account that there are constant changes in the postingin the Administrative Service, and every new post is like a new job with different supervisor and colleagues, it is very likely thatMickeyâs vulnerability would surface at some stage, which would then affect his functioning as an AO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p272" class="para" id="p272">272.</a>  Further, all the medical experts agree that the only external cause identifiable as inducive of Mickeyâs anxiety was the stressat work as an AO.  They also agree, to a certain extent, in order to prevent a recurrence of his work problems in 1999 and 2000,Mickey should be placed in a âstructured and supportiveâ working environment.  Although one may attach different meanings tothis phrase, it seems that, taking into account what happened when Mickey worked for the Government and other employers after heleft the Government, this working environment would mean at least:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(i)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">a reduced workload;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(ii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">minimized distraction in the work place;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iii)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the assignment of one task at a time with instructions and guidelines as clear as possible and deadlines as reasonable as possible;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(iv)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">a pampered and protected working environment with a supportive and understanding supervisor and other colleagues who are ready toperform for Mickey tasks which he finds difficult, in particular, words processing, document formatting and other clerical tasks;and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(v)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">colleagues who are watchful of how they are communicating with Mickey, with no flare-up of anger or showing of any ambiguous signsof disapproval.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p273" class="para" id="p273">273.</a>  However, as the work of an AO has a public interface and a lot of the work may be subject to pressure from outside sources, it issimply impossible for the Government to provide such kind of working environment for Mickey.  As testified by the Governmentâsofficers, such job expectations are unrealistic for the job of an AO.  By reason of the limited number of AOs working in the AdministrativeService, it would be quite legitimate for the Government to expect an AO to work independently under extreme pressure, otherwisethe Government would fail in its duty to provide a good administration for the public.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p274" class="para" id="p274">274.</a>  Mr. Harris, however, submits that it is not open to the Government to argue that Mickey could not have continued to do the job,as there was a lack of investigation, when Mickey was still an AO, as to whether there was any posting which would be suitable tohim taking into account his disabilities.  However, the statutes and the case law do not impose such an obligation on the employersto carry out investigation by that time.  Indeed, the court is entitled to consider the job nature, the duties of an AO and Mickeyâsdisabilities in making an assessment as to whether he would be able to fulfill the inherent requirements of the job.  I imagine thatit is technically possible for the Government to allocate Mickey with a job which has no interface with the public, to provide caringcolleagues and a good and understanding supervisor who is not concerned about deadlines.  However in such circumstances, I wouldnot say that this is still a job for an AO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p275" class="para" id="p275">275.</a>  Mr. Harris further submits that the Government has exaggerated the uniqueness and difficulty of the job of an AO.  He says thatmany jobs in management and business fields also involve a great deal of day to day pressure, ability to cope with changing workrequirements, to work with different colleagues and to move periodically from one posting to another, and the job of AO is not uniquein this regard.  However, if a job in the private sector involves the same degree of stress and constant changes in posting likethose of an AO, I also have grave doubt, taking into account Mickeyâs disabilities and shortcomings, whether he can cope with suchjob.  Such worry is, to a certain extent, supported by the employment history of Mickey after he left the Government.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p276" class="para" id="p276">276.</a>  In s. 12(2)(ii) of the DDO, it states that an employer must provide services or facilities to the disabled employee to enable thelatter to carry out the inherent requirements of the job, provided that it would not impose an unjustifiable hardship on the employer. Mr. Harris therefore tries to argue that the âinherent requirementsâ defence is not open to the Government, as the DDO obligesthe Government to make âreasonable accommodationâ in relation to Mickeyâs disabilities which, if given, would have allowedMickey to reach the standard required to be confirmed to the permanent establishment of an AO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p277" class="para" id="p277">277.</a>  However as I have pointed out in the earlier part of this judgment, unlike s. 4A(1) of the DDA (UK), the DDO does not impose a generalobligation on the employers to positively make reasonable adjustments for a disabled employee (see: para. 155 above).  Hence, onemust distinguish between a general obligation to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate disabled employees on the one hand, fromthe provision of services or facilities to enable disabled employees to carry out the inherent requirements of the employment asstated in s. 12(2) on the other.  It is only when an employer seeks to invoke the defence under s. 12(2) that the issue of whetherhe has provided those services or facilitates arises.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p278" class="para" id="p278">278.</a>  As shown in the cases mentioned above, the law does not require an employer to alter the nature of the particular employment soas to accommodate the disabled employee.  Indeed, the imposition of such an obligation would render the âinherent requirementâdefence nugatory.  In making available this defence to an employer, it must be the legislative intent that the nature and inherentrequirements of the employment are preserved.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p279" class="para" id="p279">279.</a>  Hence, in the present context, there is no duty on the part of the Government to alter the inherent requirements identified above. Obviously, the Government would need to provide reasonable services and facilities that are external to the employment to enableMickey to carry out such requirements.  However, taking into account the disabilities of Mickey, I wonder what other services orfacilities could the Government have provided in order to help Mickey to, say, to cope with the pressure of his work.  In my judgment,if Mickey was expecting a âsuper-secretaryâ to carry out all the works relating to the preparation and analysis of visual presentations,and a supervisor who would not show any frustration even if he repeatedly missed the deadlines, Mickey was actually asking the Governmentto lower or alter the inherent requirements of the job.  The law may perhaps require an employer to provide external aid to enablea blind employee to read the documents so that he can complete his work, but it is quite another matter to ask the employer to engageanother staff to do the actual work of the disabled employee.  In any event, the provision of the âservicesâ or âfacilitiesâshould not impose an unjustifiable hardship on the employer (see: provisio (ii) in s. 12(2)), and I would say that, in the presentcontext, it is certainly an unjustifiable hardship on the Government to require it to do anything more in the circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p280" class="para" id="p280">280.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid, even if the Government is guilty of discrimination by trying to terminate the employment of Mickey,I find that Mickey, by reason of his disabilities, would be unable to fulfill the âinherent requirementsâ of the job of an AOand the Government is therefore entitled to rely on the defence under s. 12(2) of the DDO.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">LIMITATION ISSUES</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p281" class="para" id="p281">281.</a>  In view of my decision above, it is not necessary for me to consider whether Mickeyâs claim is time-barred under s. 82(1) of theDDO, which requires a claim under the DDO to be brought within 24 months from the time when the act complained of was done.  Unders. 82(2A), the time taken by the EOC to investigate the complaint would be disregarded for the purpose of the limitation provision,and sub-section (3) empowers the court to entertain a claim out of time if it considers that it is just and equitable to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p282" class="para" id="p282">282.</a>  Although limitation is no longer a live issue, for the sake of completeness, I would also address this issue very briefly.  As thetime taken by the EOC for investigation would be disregarded, the remaining complaint by the Government is only two-fold.  Firstly,the claim for harassment is time-barred.  The last act of the alleged harassment was committed on 2 June 2000.  Mickey did not lodgea complaint of disability harassment with the EOC until 18 March 2002, and the EOC discontinued the investigation on 3 January 2003. As the writ of summons herein was issued on 31 March 2004 and only the period from 18 March 2002 to 3 January 2003 would be disregardedunder s. 82(2A), the claim for harassment is time-barred.  On the other hand, Mickey lodged the complaint of disability discriminationmuch earlier on 19 December 2000, and so the time taken by the EOC for investigating such claim was much longer.  That is the reasonwhy the Government is not taking any limitation issue on the claim for discrimination.  Secondly, the Government objects the newclaim about the discriminatory conducts which allegedly took place after the Government received the 2 sick leave certificates inmid-June 2000.  Mickey sought to introduce this new claim by way of amendment of pleading in the early stage of the trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p283" class="para" id="p283">283.</a>  For the second issue, I have already dealt with the same in some details in paras. 102-105 of this judgment, and I have nothingfurther to add here.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p284" class="para" id="p284">284.</a>  Regarding the first issue, the claim for harassment is technically time-barred.  However, as Mickey is relying on substantiallythe same facts to substantiate both the claims on discrimination and harassment, it would be highly undesirable for the court justto entertain one claim and not the other, bearing in mind that the DDO is a piece of social legislation.  Further, as both claimsinvolve the same factual issues, it would not cause any real prejudice to the Government for it to deal with the additional claimon harassment at the trial.  Hence if limitation is a live issue, which I do not find it to be the case, I would certainly exercisemy discretion to entertain the claim on harassment out of time.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">OTHER STATUTES AND MATERIALS PRAYED IN AID BY MICKEY</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p285" class="para" id="p285">285.</a>  In the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, this action is also said to have been brought pursuant to Article 22 of the Hong Kong Billof Rights Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/383">Cap. 383</a> (âHKBORâ) and Article 39 of the Basic Law, which are in identical terms to certain articles inthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economics, Social and Cultural Rights.  Butin my judgment, these statutory provisions, which contain general principles of equality before and equal protection of the law,only provide the constitutional basis for anti-discrimination on the ground of, <i>inter alia</i>, a personâs disability.  The DDO, on the other hand, is the specific legislation which lays down the regime whereby specified actsin prescribed fields on the ground of a personâs disability are made unlawful and aggrieved persons may seek redress <i>via</i> a claim in tort.  In such case, it is unnecessary for the court to go into either of the provision in the HKBOR or the Basic Lawin deciding Mickeyâs claim.  In this regard, I would repeat the observation of Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ at para. 206 of theirjudgment in <i>Purvis v State of New South Wales (HCA), ibid.</i>, sounding out the caution in relying on some aspirational statements in international instruments in construing the provisions inlocal anti-discrimination legislations.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p286" class="para" id="p286">286.</a>  In the trial, Mr. Harris also seeks to rely on the following 2 documents in support of Mickeyâs claim:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="95%">            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">CSB Circular No. 20/80 dated 3 October 1980 on âProcessing of cases involving officers suspected to be mentally illâ; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="3%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="92%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">âEmployment of People with a Disability in the Civil Serviceâ issued by the CSB in 1999.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p287" class="para" id="p287">287.</a>  Some of these documents may show that it is the Governmentâs policy, where appropriate, to give certain preferential treatmentto job applicants and employees with a disability.  However, such policy is not the law.  So far as the determination of liabilityfor discrimination and harassment is concerned, there is only one set of law for all the employers, and so the determination shouldbe governed solely by the provisions in the DDO, and how the Government deals or would have dealt with another employee with a disabilityin accordance with its policy is simply irrelevant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">QUANTUM OF THE CLAIM</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p288" class="para" id="p288">288.</a>  In view of the aforesaid analysis, it is not necessary for me to assess the quantum of Mickeyâs claim.  I have also considered,for the sake of completeness, whether I should proceed to make the assessment in the event that this case goes elsewhere and a contraryview is taken in respect of the liability of the Government.  However, I decide not to do so.  In considering the defence of âinherentrequirementsâ, I have taken a certain view as to whether Mickey, in view of his disabilities, would be able to cope with demandingand stressful jobs even after medical treatment, and this would have a bearing as to the assessment of Mickeyâs damages in thefuture.  In any event, I have not obtained very much assistance from the parties on the issue of quantum, and a lot of the supportingmaterials and quantification of the claim were only supplied to me after the commencement of the trial.  If a contrary view is takenelsewhere about liability, I am of the view that a fresh hearing on assessment of damages would be necessary to explore a lot ofthe unaddressed issues on quantum.  In fact, both counsel agree with my decision in the event that Mickey fails on the issue of liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p289" class="para" id="p289">289.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid, Mickeyâs claim is dismissed.  Pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s73c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 73C(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>, I make an order <i>nisi</i> that both parties shall bear its own costs of the action and that the Claimantâs costs to be taxed in accordance with legal aidregulations.  Since this case involves legal principles of some importance, to save the trouble of the parties in coming back beforeme applying for leave to appeal, I also make an order <i>nisi</i> that there be leave to appeal against my judgment in this case.  The order <i>nisi</i> shall be made absolute 28 days after the date of the handing down of this judgment.  In the case of an appeal, I must remind theparties to comply with the requirements in O. 58 r. 2 of the Rules of the District Court, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a> and the time will start to runfrom the date when the order <i>nisi</i> is made absolute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">CONCLUDING REMARKS</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p290" class="para" id="p290">290.</a>  Working in the Government can be considered as an unfortunate event in Mickeyâs life, and the present litigation is certainlynot a pleasant experience for him.  However, Mickey can be regarded as an intelligent person, and it is only that he, by reason ofhis shortcomings and disabilities, is not suitable to work as an AO.  As I see it, it is now time for Mickey to make a fresh startin his life.  With more insight gained into his own problems, I am sure that Mickey can find a suitable job in the future which canbenefit from his talent.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p291" class="para" id="p291">291.</a>  In the present case, one of the reasons why an employer may be difficult to find out whether an individual employee is sufferingfrom any kind of psychiatric or psychological disorder is that the symptoms of such disability may just be found in any other personswho happens to work under stress.  This is certainly not a healthy phenomenon.  Although I do not accept Professor Lieh-Makâs evidencein its entirety, I must agree with her observation that mental health of employees in working environment is a very much neglectedissue in Hong Kong.  Undoubtedly, Hong Kong is a very competitive society, and so employees inevitably have to bear with variousdegrees of stress arising from work.  However, stress can also affect the health of individuals in various ways.  Having made suchobservation, I am afraid that this is not a discrimination issue for determination by the court and I can leave it to the relevantauthorities and professionals to address this difficult problem.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p292" class="para" id="p292">292.</a>  Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude to both counsel for their able and meticulous submissions and the thorough researchthat they had conducted in this case.  Indeed, this case raises a lot of issues which have not been canvassed in the local courtsbefore, and I am sure that the efforts of counsel in this case would be most valuable in assisting the development of our own jurisprudencein this area of the law.  It is often said that the development of the common law depends, to a significant extent, on the qualityof the advocates, and the assistance I have derived from counsel in this case can only reflect the accuracy of such observation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(David Lok)<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr. Paul Harris SC, instructed by Messrs.
