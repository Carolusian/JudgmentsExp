It is and was a market participant of the stock exchangeof Hong Kong (âSEHKâ) registered with the trading number of 1440.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Miss Chan Hing Fung Katie, was at all material times an employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (âHou Takâ).  In or about August 2001, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Miss Katie Chan (âMiss Chanâ), represented to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff (âMiss Wanâ) that Hou Tak was offering a special investment plan to its customers.  Miss Chan invited Miss Wan to openan account with Hou Tak so that it would be able to trade on securities under the special investment plan on Miss Wanâs behalf. The benefits in the special investment plan, according to Miss Chan, was that Hou Tak would purchase shares on behalf of its customersat a discount and the participants of this plan would be entitled to interests on the amount deposited with it at an extremely favourablerate.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Miss Wan was tempted by the offer from Miss Chan and agreed to open an account with Hou Tak to take advantage of this special investmentplan offered by Miss Chan in August 2001.  Over the period of 5 months between 6<sup>th</sup> August to 28<sup>th</sup> December 2001, Miss Chan informed Miss Wan that Hou Tak had on Miss Wanâs behalf and instructions conducted security tradings andMiss Chan requested Miss Wan to make a number of deposits into Hou Takâs bank account.  As a result, Miss Wan took out sums ofmoney from the joint bank account of herself and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, her husband, and purchased four cashier orders drawn in favour of Hou Tak between 6<sup>th</sup> August and 7<sup>th</sup> December 2001 in the total sum of $722,450.82.  These were paid into Hou Takâs bank account at the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited,account number 070-916-0-071602-2.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  According to the evidence of Miss Wan, Miss Chan would send bought and sold notes issued by Hou Tak to Miss Wan.  These notes showedthe appropriate brokerage fee, stamp duty and transaction levy have been duly paid.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It is not disputed that a total sum of $113,000 had been paid to Miss Wan as profits from the share transactions purportedly enteredinto by Hou Tak on her behalf; these were $33,000 on 26<sup>th</sup> September 2001, $40,000 on 15<sup>th</sup> April 2002 and $40,000 on 8<sup>th</sup> May 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Judgment against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Miss Chan, had been entered in default of defence on 18<sup>th</sup> February 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Undisputed Facts</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Hou Tak admitted that in or about January 2001 Miss Wan was introduced to Miss Katie Chan, who was then an Account Executive andSettlement Clerk employed by Hou Tak, by Yu Mei Shan (âMiss Yuâ), a mutual friend of Miss Wan and Miss Chan.  Unknown to HouTak, Miss Yu held a joint account with Miss Chan at the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited.  Through Miss Yu, Miss Wan was told abouta âHigh Interest Share Schemeâ.  Miss Chan contacted Miss Wan subsequently and offered her the opportunity to take part in thesaid scheme that she claimed Hou Tak was offering to its staff as part of an employee bonus scheme.  Miss Chan claimed she was ableto offer to her clients this scheme which was based on investments into certain chosen securities promising high yield interestssignificantly above market rates of investment returns.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Attracted by the apparent success in Miss Yuâs investment in this so-called âHigh Interest Share Schemeâ, Miss Wan was persuadedto take up this opportunity.  In or about August 2001, Miss Wan sent by fax to Miss Chan her personal particulars including copyof her identity card and details of her home address.  She then at Miss Chanâs request deposited various sums into the bank accountof Hou Tak at the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited by means of cashier cheques at Miss Chanâs request to enable Miss Chan to takepart on her behalf in the âHigh Interest Share Schemeâ.  Unknown to Miss Wan, Miss Chan dishonestly misappropriated the sumsof money deposited by Miss Wan for her own personal use.  Miss Chan told Miss Wan that the sums she paid into Hou Takâs accounthad been applied in the âHigh Interest Share Schemeâ on Miss Wanâs behalf to obtain a certain share, namely stock number 0066(MTR Corporation Limited).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Miss Wan was not asked to complete or to sign any client account opening form, mandate or agreement in favour of Hou Tak nor wasshe asked to execute any written document addressed to Hou Tak in relation to the opening of the account.  Throughout this period,she communicated constantly with Miss Chan believing that Miss Chan had opened an account on her behalf at Hou Tak and that MissChan had been dealing in securities on her behalf.  She received âbought notesâ issued by Hou Tak sent to her by Miss Chan, oneach occasion she was requested to deposit a sum of money equivalent to the value of the shares purchased into Hou Takâs bank accountby Miss Chan.  On each occasion when payments were made and deposited into Hou Takâs bank account, Miss Wan was told by Miss Chanthat shares in stock number 0066 had been purchased on her behalf.  Miss Chan would ask Miss Wan to collect the bought and sold notesfrom the office of Hou Tak on each occasion.  These bought and sold notes were produced in Court, they showed the appropriate amountof shares purchased or sold, the brokerage fee, stamp duty and transaction levy paid. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In or about mid July 2002, Miss Wan contacted Miss Chan on the telephone, Miss Chan informed and confessed to her that all the dealingsthat she purportedly handled for Miss Wan at Hou Tak and the relevant documents were fakes.  A manager of Hou Tak confirmed to MissWan what she was told was true.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  As a result of the discovery of the fraud, the Securities and Futures Commission (âSFCâ) was notified.  On the advice of theSFC, Pricewaterhouse Coopers (âPWSCâ) was instructed to conduct an investigation and internal control review of Hou Tak, thereport of that investigation and internal control review was completed on 18<sup>th</sup> October 2002 (â the PWSC reportâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>The Findings of the Investigation and Internal Control Review of the SFC</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In the Executive Summary, pages 7 and 8 of the summary of findings of the PWSC report states the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>4.

It is a question of fact in each case whether the wrong was committed in the courseof the servantâs employmentâ.  However, the House of Lords in <i>Armagas Ltd v Mundogas (The Ocean Frost)</i> has now accepted a line of authority indicating that vicarious liability for fraud is governed by âa set of principles and a lineof authority of peculiar applicationâ so that âit is unnecessary to consider the development of the basis of vicarious liabilityin relation to torts such as negligence or trespass, which have followed a somewhat different lineâ.  Of its very nature fraudinvolves the deception of the victim and by that deception his persuasion to part with his property or do some other act to his owndetriment and to the benefit of the person practising the fraud, and for this reason the decision whether an employee committed fraudin the course of his employment can only be made after the authority, actual or ostensible, with which the employee is clothed hasbeen ascertained.  Thus in <i>Uxbridge Permanent Benefit Building Society v Pickard</i>, a case of fraud committed by a solicitorâs clerk, counsel for the defendant solicitor argued that the case should be treated asanalogous to those cases in which an employee had been held to be on a frolic of his own, but the argument was rejected.  As LordGreene M.R. said:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âIt appears to me to be drawing an analogy where no analogy exists, because in the case of the servant who goes off on a frolicof his own, no question arises of any actual or ostensible authority upon the faith of which some third person is going to changehis position.  The very essence of the present case is that the actual authority and the ostensible authority to [the clerk] wereof a kind which, in the ordinary course of an everyday transaction, were going to lead third persons, on the faith of them, to changetheir position, just as a purchaser from an apparent client or a mortgagee lending money to a client is going to change his positionby being brought into contact with that client.  That is within the actual and ostensible authority of the clerk.  It is totallydifferent in the case of a servant driving a motor car or cases of that kind, where there is no question of the action of third partiesbeing affected in the least degree by any apparent authority on the part of the servantâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In the House of Lords case of Lloyd v Grace Smith &amp; Co.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%20AC%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] AC 716</a> at page 725, Earl Loreburn held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">  âIf the agent commits the fraud purporting to act in the course of business such as he was authorized, or held out as authorized,to transact on account of his principal, then the latter may be held liable for it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Mr. Chang, Counsel for Hou Tak relied on the case of Ming An Insurance Co.

By âclose connectionâ is meant a connection between the employeeâs unauthorised tortuous act and his employment whichis so close as to make it fair and just to hold his employer vicariously liable.  I consider close connection to be an intellectuallysatisfying and practical criterion for vicarious liability.  It imposes vicarious liability when, but only when, it would be fairand just to do so.  And it provides a workable concept, namely a sufficiently close connection, for determining in each case whetherdoing so would be fair and just.  The case before us is of negligent driving by an employee.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The case of Ming An involved negligent driving by an employee who had gone to collect food from outside the hotel.  The Hong KongCourt of Final Appeal considered the closeness between the employerâs work and reckless driving of employee.  The hotel was heldto be vicariously liable for the employeeâs acts.  The Court of Final Appeal in Ming An applied the close connection test involvingthe consideration of (a) Whether the employee was acting within the scope of his employment; and (b) Whether his negligent drivingwas so closely connected with his employment and that it was fair and just to hold the employer vicariously liable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Chang further referred to the case of Armagas Ltd. v.

Such circumstancesexist where the employer by words or conduct has induced the injured party to believe that the servant was acting in the lawful courseof the employerâs business.  They do not exist where such belief, although it is present, has been brought about through misguidedreliance on the servant himself, when the servant is not authorized to do what he is purporting to do, when what he is purportingto do is not within the class of acts that an employee in his position is usually authorized to do, and when the employer has donenothing to represent that he is authorized to do it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> It is not disputed that so far as Miss Wan was concerned, she honestly believed she was a client of Hou Tak with an account opened.Evidence produced included the bought and sold notes on Hou Tak âs stationery and forms.  Miss Wan had made 4 deposits of moneyinto Hou Takâs bank account at the Bank of China.  Furthermore, on Hou Takâs computer record, she was registered as a clientalthough no transactions or deposit of funds were entered on the computer record under Miss Wanâs account.  In the words of EarlLoreburn, Miss Chan committed the fraud purporting to act in the course of business such as she was authorized or held out as authorizedto transact on behalf of her principal, consequently, the employer is therefore liable for Miss Chanâs acts.  Actual or ostensibleauthority was conferred on Miss Chan to conduct the business of an account executive and settlement clerk as an everyday transaction,it led Miss Wan to change her position and trusted Miss Chan with her money.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> It is not disputed that Miss Chan was acting as a stockbroker agent for Miss Wan.  She held herself out as a servant or agent ofher employer, Hou Tak.  So far as Miss Wan was concerned, all the transactions and receipts, bought and sold notes received by MissWan were in order, for Hou Tak was recorded to have charged brokerage fees.  Therefore, so far as a third party is concerned, inthis case, Miss Wan, Miss Chan was acting on the business of her employer.  Hou Tak could have found out about Miss Chanâs activitiessuch as her using Hou Takâs bank account, its clientâs account, itâs forms, stationery and bought and sold notes etc. to perpetratethe fraud had Hou Tak adopted a proper internal control system and made sure each and everyone of its employees kept proper recordsof accounts opening applications, maintain a good system of recording of all dealings and tradings in compliance with the rules andregulations of the SFC.  Further, had Hou Tak segregated the work of the settlement clerk and the accounts executive, the fraud andMiss Chanâs deceptions would have been detected a long time ago.  It is, therefore, not opened to Hou Tak to turn round now andsay âI have no idea what my employee was doing behind my back, I did not ask her to defraud her clients, I did not gain from it.â Because Hou Tak had failed to properly supervise its employees and impose a system of internal control, it is tantamount to haveinstalled a system allowing its employees to defraud clients, even though Hou Tak may have nothing to gain from the actions of itsemployee.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Negligence</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> âA stockbroker owes a duty to his clients to exercise reasonable professional care in executing his commissionsâ¦  It seems thathis first duty is owed concurrently in tort and in contractâ.  (Clerk and Lindsell on Tort 19<sup>th</sup> Edition, para. 10-197 at page 685).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Mr. Chang submitted that Miss Wan was not a client of Hou Tak because no account was ever validly opened in Miss Wanâs name withHou Tak.  Further, no account opening form was ever signed by Miss Wan and no proper procedures had been followed.  Mr. Chang furthersubmitted that Hou Tak merely provided a window for Miss Chan to steal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> I cannot agree with Mr. Changâs submission that what Hou Tak did was merely providing a window for Miss Chan to steal.  What HouTak did was more than holding a window open.  The SFC had imposed guidelines for all stockbrokers registered with the SFC to follow. In the PWSC review of Hou Takâs internal control procedures, it identified a number of serious weaknesses in Hou Tak which facilitatedMiss Chanâs dishonest acts.  They were set out in the press release of SFC on 18<sup>th</sup> August 2003, they included the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">1.     Failure to segregated settlement and dealing functions;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">2.     Absence of written company policies and procedures manual;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">3.     Failure to implement effective internal and compliance system;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">4.     Failure to monitor the activities of staff members;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">5.     Inadequate procedures for staff dealing and reporting of interest in relating account;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">6.     Inadequate account opening controls;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">7.     Failure to restrict access to its computer system and to store securely its company stamp, letterhead, stationery, blank contractnotes, client agreement and official receipts; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">8.     Inadequate clearing and settlement procedures.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> As a result, the SFC found that âthe responsible officerâ of Hou Tak, Mr. Winston Van, had failed to discharge his functionsproperly in managing and supervising Hou Takâs operation.   As to Hou Takâs licence representative, Miss Wong Yuet Wah Cynthia,the Settlement and Accounts Manager of Hou Tak, the SFC stated in its press release: âWong was found to have inadequately dischargedher supervisory duties over Chan.â  The SFC further stated, âWong was also found to have failed to properly check informationand account opening forms and to ensure such information was supported by relevant documents.  Wongâs failings contributed to HouTakâs failure to detect Chanâs dishonest acts and exposed Hou Tak and its client to serious financial loss that might otherwisehave been avoided.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The findings of the SFC clearly indicated that Hou Tak was negligent in its operation and in the supervision of its staff. Its failureto act and to supervise its staff properly and to ensure a proper system of the internal control was in place had provided Miss Chanan opportunity to defraud Miss Wan.  In other words, Hou Tak had provided a platform which enabled Miss Chan to operate a dishonestscheme to defraud Miss Wan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> I further find that because Hou Tak had failed to impose a strict account opening procedure and to conduct regular checks on itsaccount executives to see if they had opened accounts for their clients without following the proper procedures and fill in the accountopening forms with supporting documents, it is not opened to Hou Tak to accuse the customer, Miss Wan, to have failed to file a writtenaccount opening application form.  Miss Wan had supplied all the information to Miss Chan either by telephone or by fax, it was nother fault that Miss Chan did not ask her to sign an account opening form.  And in spite of the absence of an account opening form,Miss Wanâs name appeared as an account holder in Hou Takâs computer record.  This clearly showed Hou Tak did have on its recordthat Miss Wan had opened an account with Hou Tak even though the record failed to register the numerous sums paid into Hou Takâsbank account by her for trading purposes and that she had traded in stock no. 0066 a number of times through Hou Tak.  Miss Wan wasable to produce a number of bought and sold notes issued by Hou Tak to her quoting her account name âAWKLâ.  The PWSC reportcertainly regarded all 13 of Miss Chanâs clients as clients of Hou Tak.  Miss Wan was number 13 on the list.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In the words of the SFCâs the Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr. Alan Linning in the SFC press release:  âWeak internal controlsin the brokerage put the brokerâs clients and the broker itself at risk.  At worst, they allow brokerage employees to defraud clients.â This was exactly what happened.  Hou Takâs weak internal control system had allowed Miss Chan to defraud clients.  I have no doubtif Hou Takâs internal control system with an appropriate and proper accounting system and management of transfer of funds, HouTak would have discovered sums deposited by Miss Wan into its bank account had been siphoned off by Miss Chan into a joint accountheld by herself and her friend Miss Yu, and that these funds deposited was not used to trade on clientâs instructions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>Conclusions</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I am satisfied that Hou Tak is vicariously liable for Miss Chanâs fraudulent acts.  It is further liable vicariously for the failureof Miss Wong to properly check the information in account opening documents and to supervise Miss Chan as the Settlement Managerand Account Manager and the supervisor of Miss Chan.  Hou Tak is also liable under negligence for failing to impose internal controlprocedure to prevent its employees to defraud its clients.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> As to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs claim, I agree with Mr. Chang that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff does not have the right to sue Hou Tak.  There was no evidence that the investment made by Miss Wan was made on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs behalf.  Her evidence was, the money that she used to pay into Hou Takâs bank account was drawn from a joint bankaccount of herself and her husband.  The money might have been drawn from a joint account, however, the account opened at Hou Takwas in Miss Wanâs sole name and all the trading that Miss Chan purportedly done was on Miss Wanâs behalf even though these werelater found to be bogus tradings; Miss Chan had clearly defrauded Miss Wan but there was no evidence she had defrauded the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.  I also find Hou Tak not liable to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, because the account âAWKLâ opened at Hou Tak was in Miss Wanâs name only.  I therefore dismiss the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs claim against Hou Tak.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> I give judgment to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the sum of $(722,450.82 â 113,000) = $609,450.82.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Interest</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> I allow interest on the judgment sum from the date of writ to the date of judgment at half judgment rate; thereafter at full judgmentrate until full payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>Costs</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Costs to follow the event, I do not see any exception in this case.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant shall bear the costs of these proceedings to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for Counsel.  As the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff did not give evidence nor adduce any evidence, the trial was not prolonged, I am satisfied there was no extra cost wasted. I therefore make no order as to costs so far as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff is concerned.  The costs order nisi will be made absolute within 14 days hereof should there be no application made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">( H.C.
