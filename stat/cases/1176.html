Between December, 1978 and September, 1979, the EducationDepartment received 6 anonymous letters and one anonymous telephone call, all complaining about the manner in which the plaintiffcarried out her duties as principal.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The allegations ranged from partiality and inefficiency to corruption. An investigation was made in each case by officers of thedepartment. The plaintiff was interviewed by 4 officers during the period in question. Their conclusion was that the complaints weretotally groundless and unjustified.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff now wishes to bring an action for libel against the writer of the anonymous letters. In this originating summons sheasks for an order that the defendant:-</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">(1)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">Disclose the names, if any, of the complainant; and</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">(2)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="84%">Give discovery of all documents in the possession of the Education Department relating to the complaints.</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In her supporting affidavit the plaintiff states that, if she were allowed access to certain school circulars, which were submittedto the department in support of the anonymous letters, she would be able to identify the culprit.After the complaints began, theplaintiff adopted the practice of marking the circulars issued to each teacher with dots placed in different places, in order toenable her subsequently to identify the recipients.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> During the investigation the plaintiff was shown, briefly, the letters in question. The handwriting in some of these letters wasrecognizable and she now wishes to examine these letters more thoroughly.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Chan for the plaintiff relies upon the House of Lords case <u>Norwich Pharmacal Co. &amp; others v. Commissioners Customs and Excise</u><sup>(1)</sup>. In that case the appellants were the owners and licensees of a patent covering a chemical compound known as 'furazolidone'. Informationpublished by the respondents showed that some 30 consignments of furazolidone had been imported into the United Kingdom between 1960and 1970. None of those importations had been licensed by the appellants. Each of the consignments therefore involved a tortiousinfringement of the appellants' patent. The appellants tried to discovered the identity of the importers in order to bring legalproceedings against them but were unable to do so. When the goods were imported the respondents, in the exercise of their statutoryduty, had obtained information relating to the goods including the names of the importers. On importation the goods came under thecontrol of the respondents who directed the goods to be held in transit sheds until, the necessary formalities having been completedand the customs duties paid, they were released to the consignees. The appellants asked the respondents to supply them with the namesof the importers of furazolidone but the respondents replied that they had no authority to do so. The appellants then brought anaction against the respondents claiming, inter alia, an order for discovery of the names of the importers. Graham J. granted theorder sought, but the Court of Appeal reversed his decision holding that since the appellants had no cause of action against therespondents they could not obtain an order for discovery against them. On appeal, it was held that although as a general rule noindependent action for discovery would lie against a person against whom no reasonable cause of action could be alleged, or who wasin the position of a mere witness in the strict sense, the rule did not apply where (a) without discovery of the information in thepossession of the person against whom discovery was sought no action could be begun against the wrongdoer, and (b) the person againstwhom discovery was sought had himself, albeit through no fault of his own, been involved in the wrongful acts of another so as tofacilitate the wrongdoing. In such circumstances, although he might have incurred no personal liability, he was under a duty to assistthe person who had been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoer. In the performance oftheir statutory duties the respondents had been sufficiently involved in the importation of furazolidone in breach of the appellants'patent as to impose on them, subject to considerations of public policy, a duty to disclose the identity of the importers so thatthe appellants could commence proceedings against them. Their lordships also considered the public interest in confidentiality, butdecided that it was outweighed by the interests of justice in disclosure of the names.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Counsel for the defendant takes no point as to confidentiality, but submits that, while he is content to leave the matter to theCourt, the principle laid down in the Norwich Pharmacal case should not be extended. In my judgment, by granting this applicationand ordering discovery, no extension is involved.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Graham argued that no clear-cut wrong is revealed by the affidavit. It is true that the defence of privilege may exist by virtueof the duty of the Education Department to enquire into complaints made by a person with a common interest. If the complaints weremade maliciously, however, privilege is lost. Mr. Graham says there is no evidence of malice. Having regard to the nature and frequencyof the letters, I would be reluctant to go so far. This is essentially a matter for the trial court.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It is also submitted that the allegations do not amount to defamation in the absence of evidence of motive. I do not agree. Theyare prima facie defamatory and that is sufficient for the purpose of these proceedings. Counsel also takes the point that, if theplaintiff was able to recognize the handwriting in the letters, there is no need for discovery. I think this is a genuine slip bythe deponent or her legal advisers. In the context it seems clear that the word 'familiar' should have been used instead of 'recognizable'.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It seems to me that the real question is whether the Education Department was sufficiently involved in publication of the defamatorymatter. In the case cited above Lord Reid said at page 948: "........... if through no fault of his own a person gets mixed up inthe tortious acts of others so as to facilitate their wrongdoing he may incur no personal liability but he comes under a duty toassist the person who has been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoers."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Lord Morris of Borth-y-gest put it this way: "It is not suggested that in ordinary circumstances a court would require someone toimpart to another some information which he may happen to have and which the latter would wish to have for the purpose of bringingsome proceedings. At the very least the person possessing the information would have to have become actually involved (or activelyconcerned) in some transactions or arrangements as a result of which he has acquired the information."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Defence counsel, however, points to another passage in Lord Reid's speech, which, he contends, is against the plaintiff. His Lordshipsaid at page 948: "A person injured in a road accident might know that a bystander had taken the number of the car which ran himdown and have no other means of tracing the driver. Or a person might know that a particular person is in possession of a libellousletter which he has good reason to believe defames him but the author of which he cannot discover. I am satisfied that it would notbe proper in either case to order discovery in order that the person who has suffered damage might be able to find or sue the wrongdoer.Neither authority, principle, nor public policy would justify that."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Had the recipient in the Education Department filed the letters and taken no further action, it would have fallen into the categoryof a 'mere witness', described above, and the plaintiff would have been debarred from relief. Lord Dilhorne said at page 960: "..........discovery can be granted against a person who is not a mere witness to discover, the fact of some wrongdoing being established, whowas responsible for it. ........... Someone involved in the transaction is not a mere witness. If he could be sued, even though therebe no intention of suing him, he is not a mere witness. ......... it matters not that the involvement or participation was innocentand in ignorance of the wrongdoing."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In the present case the Education Department was involved in the performance of its duty to investigate complaints against schoolstaff. The libels were published to at least 4 members of the department. This is a sufficient involvement in the tort to enablethe plaintiff to succeed in these proceedings. There will be an order in terms of the summons, but the costs will be borne by theplaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%"> </td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="50%">(E. de B.
