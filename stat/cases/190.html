Lau was then a Deacon of the Church and assigned to be in charge of the altar boys at St. Josephâs.  About 18 monthslater in similar circumstances, by which time he had been ordained a Priest, Lau sexually assaulted H again.  Many years passed. Then, following a police investigation, Lau was charged and convicted after trial for these crimes and sentenced to a term of imprisonmentof 4Â½ years.  Meanwhile within a year of the first violations H suffered a mental breakdown and was found to be suffering from schizophreniaand post-traumatic stress disorder.  Subsequently H was examined and interviewed by a psychiatrist.  He found that the abuse he sufferedat the hands of Lau might have been the principal precipitating factor which caused the schizophrenia. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  By this action H sues Lau in damages for the loss occasioned by Lauâs actions.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, is joined and sued vicariously as Lauâs employer and in negligence for failure toprevent the assaults or properly investigate them once they became known.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  This is an application made in two summonses by the Catholic Diocese to strike out the causes of action brought against it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Legal Principles</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Two emerge in the context of this case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The first is that striking out should be ordered only in plain and obvious cases.  It is not the appropriate forum for the determinationof difficult points of law.

This is a drastic remedy and it follows that no court should give effect toit unless it is satisfied that the legal basis of the claim is unarguable or almost incontestably bad: and â¦ where the legal viabilityof the cause of action is sensitive to the facts, an order to strike out should not be made.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The second is that on the matter of what actually happened the evidence adduced in support of the claim and allegations in the statementof claim are assumed to be true.

He became an altar boy in 1987.  FromSeptember 1987 to June 1990 he attended St. Josephâs School.  In September 1990 he was sent to the UK to be a boarder at SacredHeart College in Weymouth.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In December 1990 H returned home for the Christmas holidays, resuming his altar boy duties.  It was then that he met Lau, who hadbeen assigned by the Diocese to take charge of the altar boys of St. Josephâs Church.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The first series of assaults took place on or about 4 January 1991.  Lau invited H to spend the night with him, in his quartersat St. Josephâs, for the purpose of undertaking what he called sexual therapy.  In the shower and then in his bed Lau violatedH, which in the fullness of time gave rise to three convictions of indecent assault, gross indecency and attempted buggery. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 6 January H returned to England.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In September that year he suffered a mental breakdown which was diagnosed to have been caused by schizophrenia.  He was put on amedication called Sulpiride, an anti-psychotic drug.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The second time H was sexually abused by Lau was during the Summer holidays of 1992.  By this time Lau was an ordained Priest andthe appointed school manager of St. Josephâs School.  Again he invited H to his quarters.  The abuse gave rise to the fourth convictionof indecent assault.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  H was still mentally ill and except for a short period did not attend school for the 1992/1993 year.  During this time he was treatedat the Yung Fung Shee Psychiatric Centre.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  H returned to England for the 6<sup>th</sup> form school year of 1993/1994 but did not complete it because of his ill-health.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Having come back to Hong Kong in July 1994, this time for good, H made a complaint to the police; that he had been molested andby whom.  But no action was taken.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  After that there was a deterioration in his condition and on two occasions he was admitted to Castle Peak Hospital, each for weekson end.  Thereafter he was regularly treated at Yung Fung Shee until September 2003.  Throughout this time he remained on the medicationSulpiride.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Meanwhile in 1995 H confided in a Priest whom he had met in the course of his duties as an altar boy, called Father Chiu.  Thisled to a series of meetings, the most significant of which took place in June 1995.  Chaired by Father Chiu, it was attended by H,a friend of H, and Lau.  It was tape-recorded by Father Chiu.  During the course of it Lau admitted abusing H, broke down and beggedforgiveness.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  That month Lau was suspended from the priesthood.  In September 1995 he resigned from the priesthood.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  H records that he expected that the Diocese would follow-up on his complaints and Lauâs admissions and report the assaults tothe police.  That did not happen; moreover, the tape of the June meeting was erased.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In 1999 H made another complaint to the police.  Again there was no action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  But in May 2002 the police invited a further complaint and H complied.  This led to Lauâs arrest on 4 May 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  H was interviewed by a senior medical officer of psychiatry called Dr Wong Ming Kong.  Dr Wong concluded that it was possible thatthe abuses had occurred, and that they might be the single precipitating factor of Hâs schizophrenia.  H records that that wasthe first time he had been told and realized there was or might be a link between the abuses and his mental ill-health.  It was onlythen that he came to realise that he might have a claim in damages against Lau and as well the Catholic Diocese.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Lauâs trial was conducted in the District Court in January 2003.  Lau chose not to give evidence.  The result was a convictionin respect of both incidents, and the sentence of 4Â½ years.  Lau appealed to the Court of Appeal and then Court of Final Appeal. Both appellate courts rejected his arguments and dismissed the appeals.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Following letters before action H filed his writ; so began this action in October 2004.  Prior to this he had applied for and beengranted an anonymity order.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Before going to the claims made by H in his statement of claim there is one further matter to deal with, which arose after Lauâsconvictions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In an announcement published in the February 2003 edition of Kung Kao Po, the Catholic Churchâs official periodical, the headof the Catholic Diocese in Hong Kong Bishop Zen wrote of the saga giving rise to Lauâs conviction and imprisonment.  In the articlehe admitted the Diocese had been negligent in the selection and then training of Lau as a Roman Catholic Priest and apologized toH and his family.  He was also critical of the handling by the Dioceseâs head at the time the violations first came to light, thelate Bishop Wu.  He admitted the Bishop was unprofessional according to todayâs standards in not investigating fully whether Lauâswrongdoing amounted to criminal offences.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Claims against the Catholic Diocese</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  There are three in all.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The first is a breach of a duty of care to H.  Particulars of this breach include failing to take reasonable care in the selectionand training of Lau, failing to take reasonable care in his attachment and his supervision, failing to take precautions to protectH from a foreseeable injury, and permitting his abuse by Lau.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The second is vicarious liability for the sexual abuses H suffered at the hands of Lau.  The third is that Hâs suffering and losswas aggravated by negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Particulars of that include a failure by the Diocese to respond to Hâs complaints of abuse by Lau following the July 1995 meeting,failing to report the abuses to the police and the erasing of the tape-recording of the meeting and Lauâs admissions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Summonses to Strike out</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Two were filed.

The plaintiffs sued to recover from the defendants for being vicariously liable for the wardenâstorts.  The Court of Appeal held against the plaintiffs, on the basis that the wardenâs acts could not be regarded as the unauthorisedmode of carrying out his authorized duties.  The House of Lords allowed the plaintiffâs appeal.  It was held that having regardto the circumstances of the wardenâs employment including the close contact with the pupils and the inherent risks it involved,there was a sufficient connection between the work he had been employed to do and the acts of abuse that he had committed, for theseacts to be regarded as having been committed within the scope of his employment.  The defendants thus should be held vicariouslyliable for them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Lord Steyn said at p.230:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âThe question is whether the wardenâs torts were so closely connected with his employment that it would be fair and just to holdthe employers vicariously liable.  On the facts of the case the answer is yes.  After all, the sexual abuse was inextricably interwovenwith the carrying out by the warden of his duties in [the boarding house].  Matters of degree arise.

He ventured that the attempt to rephrase this ground from vicarious liability for the assault was to circumventthe unanswerable; that the actual assault is time-barred.  But a deliberate act, and the assaults can only be described as deliberate,cannot be construed as a breach of duty of care; he prayed in aid the English Court of Appeal case <i>K R v Bryn Alyn</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%202%20All%20ER%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 2 All ER 716.</a>  He quoted from the headnote part of which reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="4%" valign="top" class="quote">(3)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="94%" valign="top" class="quote">The correct approach to vicarious liability for abusive conduct was, â¦, to identify the wrongful act, deliberate or otherwise, inrespect of which vicarious responsibility was claimed and to assess the closeness of its connection to the employment in question. If the act was sufficiently closely connected with the employment, there was vicarious responsibility.  In such circumstances, therewas no justification or need, for the purpose of establishing vicarious responsibility, to elide the duty in respect of which theemployeeâs deliberate act was a breach with a duty of care delegated or âentrustedâ to him by the employer.

What he did was to accept moral responsibility by commenting on two areas; the way priests in the making are selected and their training,and whether misconduct should be reported to the police.  Mr Duncan submitted comments such as this do not create a cause of action. There was no legal liability for the Diocese to take any step; no obligation to report a crime or otherwise respond to an alreadycommitted act of trespass to the person that had been committed years before.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  <i>Clarke (supra)</i> is distinguishable because in that case the sexual abuses were continuing, as the administrators in the church stood by.

This was an intermittent relationship; there was no live-in residency, no in locoparentis relationship that could be said to have developed.  Furthermore, H was by the time he met Lau already at school in England,and had only met him a short while before the acts were committed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In the majority of the Canadian cases an ingredient vital to the outcome was that the victims lived in the establishments wherethey were violated and were under the control of the wrongdoer 24 hours in the day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Further, that the Canadian cases were fact specific and could not be called upon to extend in Hong Kong the concepts of breach ofduty of care and fiduciary duties. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  The plaintiff had other remedies available to him, or would have had, had his action been made in timely fashion.

Mr Duncanâs primary argument that the facts of these cases are radicallydifferent from the facts in this case is a compelling one. But it seems to me that this is an issue that should be determined onlyafter an analysis of all the evidence. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  For my part I think that whether or not the role of a Deacon or Priest who is put in charge of youthful altar boys equates in termsof power and control over them with that of a warden of a hostel, giving rise to a close connection between his employment and actsof abuse committed by him on an altar boy, is not something that can be dismissed on the reading of an affidavit and statement ofclaim.  This would only be possible on a full trial of the issues.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  This deals with the claims going to breach of duty of care and of fiduciary duties.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Insofar as the negligence claim is concerned: support for liability under this head lies in <i>Clarke (supra)</i>.

In such actions the date by which the action must be brought is three years from when it accrued or of the claimantâsknowledge if later, but subject to the provisions of section 30.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Section 30 gives the court a discretion to override the limits imposed by section 27 having regard to the extent to which the partiesmay be prejudiced by those limits on the one hand and the exercise of such discretion on the other.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Section 30(3) states:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(3)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">In acting under this section the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to: </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">(a)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote">the length of, and the reasons for, the delay on the part of the plaintiff;

This is evidenced by the diagnosis of 1992 and prescription of Sulpiride for the next 11 years, the psychiatric treatmentat Yung Fung Shee, the in-house treatment on two occasions at Castle Peak, and the finding of Dr Wong in his report of May 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Mr Fung referred me to a line of cases to show that the courts have tended to adopt a liberal approach to the meaning of âdisabilityâin section 22 of the LO, such that it should not be confined to mental incapacity, or a general incapacity to manage oneâs ownaffairs.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  He cited three Hong Kong cases on the point, at first instance:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>Shek Chi Wai v Chai Jennifer</i>, HCA 6295/93 unreported (Yam J);</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>Leung Tai Seng v Hospital Authority</i>, HCPI 481/04 unreported (DJ Poon);</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>Yeung Shea Chun v The Director of Legal Aid</i>, HCA 8439/96 unreported (Waung J)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Mr Fung submitted that applying such law H must be treated as being under a disability at least until May 2002; thus the actionis not time-barred having been brought in October 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Mr Duncanâs response is that if H is found to have been disabled until May 2002, there is no evidence to show that the disabilityat that point was over.  There is only a bare assertion to that effect and with the burden on H to establish that he was disabledand when he stopped being disabled he has failed to achieve that.  He quoted from Dr Wongâs report as to his condition as at May2002 which indicated there was no disability:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="3%" valign="top" class="quote">9.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="95%" valign="top" class="quote">When last seen on 8 May 2002, he was calm and settled, polite and cooperative, with good rapport, coherent and relevant speech, withneutral stable and congruous mood, and free from any cognitive, psychotic or suicidal impairment.â </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  And further, that whilst during the years prior H might have been suffering from a continuing mental illness, this was controlledby medication, leaving him able to manage his own affairs and thus not be disabled.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  My view is that the issue of disability and cessation of that disability has to be determined from an evaluation of the evidenceon the point. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  It is not challenged that H suffered long term from a recognized mental illness which required medication and psychiatric treatmentboth in-house and as an outpatient.
