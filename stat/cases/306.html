I have been asked to assess what consequential damages (if any) the Plaintiffs have suffered as a result of the unlawfulholding over by the Defendants at 184, Queen's Road Central from the end of November, 1964 to June, 1965.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The exact location of these premises is right at the end of Queen's Road Central. It would be fair to say that this places the premiseson the perimeter of the area known as the Central District of Hong Kong.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The declaration asked for in the terms of paragraph 13 of the amended Statement of Claim reads:-</p>	<blockquote>		<p style="text-align:center">"<u>DECLARATION</u></p>		The Plaintiffs have suffered damage and continue to suffer damage as a result of the wrongful holding over of the said Defendantsand/or the said company.<p align="center"><u>PARTICULARS OF DAMAGE</u></p>		Damages resulting from relay in commencing and effecting the re-development of Nos. 184, 184A, 186, 188, 190 and 192 Queen's Road,Central, namely:-<blockquote>			<p>(a) Any fine premium or penalty which may be imposed by the Hong Kong Government.</p>(b) Loss of rents and profits from the buildings to be constructed on the above said properties at $73,193.00 per month?"</blockquote>	</blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The declaration actually made in the judgment was in slightly different terms - I reproduce what is set out at the top of page 13of the Judgment:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I therefore declare that the first, second and third Defendants are liable in respect of breach of covenant and wrongful holdingover to pay to the Plaintiffs such damages as may be assessed by the Registrar upon completion of the new building."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Although the point was not taken, it may have been open to me to refuse to hear the reference as the building which Mr. Justice Blair-Kerrhad in mind when he made the declaration in 1965 was a 16 storey skyscraper which was to be erected in the manner described in evidence.In fact these plans were scraped and a 24 storey building was built in its place and instead of it being finished in July 1966 itwas not ready for occupation until October 1968.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Having heard the evidence and listened to counsel for 4 days, I propose to do my best to assess damages. I do so, however with somemisgiving. It may well be that a strict interpretation of the declaration which Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr made restricts the referenceto a 16 storey building, and as it was not built, it is not open to me to assess damages now that a different building has been erected.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> I do have some authority on the point that I am free to give a wider interpretation to the reference by paragraph 995 of <u>Mayne &amp;</u> <u>McGregor</u> on Damages XII<sup>th</sup> Edition.</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="left" class="quote">" (1) Province of judge and jury: law and fact</p>        Where an action is heard by a judge and jury, it is a general rule that matters of law are for the judge and matters offact for the jury. This rule applies equally to the issue of damages: the only difficulty lies in ascertaining when an issue of damagespresents a question of law and when a question of fact.<p>The matter has received most attention in relation to remoteness of damage. For a long time the question of remoteness was regarded,according to the prevailing dicta, as a question of law. Later it was suggested that the question of remoteness was one of fact.This apparent conflict was neatly resolved by McNair J. in <u>Mehmet Dogan Bey</u> v. <u>Abdeni</u><sup>(1)</sup> where he laid down an all-embracing rule. He said:</p>		<blockquote>			"It is the function-of the judge to direct the jury as to the meaning of the terms 'natural and direct consequences' or 'reasonablyforeseeable consequences' and whether a particular head of damage is capable in law of being a consequence falling within these phrases,and to direct them whether there is any evidence that a particular consequence is a consequence falling within these phrases; itis then for the jury to find as a fact whether a particular head of damage is such a consequence and the jury's conclusion on thatpoint (subject to there being evidence to support it) is final"<sup>(2)</sup></blockquote>		He added that in his opinion the matter had been so treated in <u>Weld-Blundell</u> v. <u>Stephens</u><sup>(3)</sup> and that his view was in accord with Devlin J. 's judgment in <u>Royal Greek Government</u> v. <u>Minister of Transport</u> <sup>(4)</sup>.<p>It would seem that other issues in relation to damages should be treated in the same way. Thus while both Bankes and Scrutton L.JJs.said in <u>Paysu</u> v. <u>Saunders</u><sup>(5)</sup> that the question of mitigation of damage is a question of fact, it is clear that they were referring to the question of whethera plaintiff under an admitted duty to mitigate his loss, has satisfied that duty<sup>(6)</sup>. But whether the circumstances are such as to give rise to a duty to mitigate must surely be a question of law".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> I interpret my position as that of an assessor who has been directed by a judge that the wrongful holding over was capable of givingrise to a claim for damages, and it is now for me as assessor to find as a fact whether particular heads of damage have in fact arisenand further what damage has been suffered.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> A similar division of responsibility can also be made in the case of mitigation of loss and remoteness of damage.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Indeed the circumstances which govern both the contingencies of remoteness and mitigation cannot in many cases be seen, or if seencannot be appreciated to their full extent until after an adjudication has been made on the question of liability.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> I understand that in assessing the loss of the Plaintiffs I should take into consideration any steps by way of mitigation of losswhich I feel the Plaintiffs should reasonably have taken and secondly if damage has been occasioned which was not foreseeable andwhich is thereof too remote, then I should not take that into consideration.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> By the same taken, if collateral steps are taken to mitigate loss then a question of fact also arises as to whether the end resultmitigates the loss or is too collateral to it thus giving rise to a res inter alios acta.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In approaching my task it is also necessary that I should make a finding of fact based upon the evidence of what has happened inthe years which have passed since the reference was made especially on the vital question of whether damages should be assessed onthe loss of rent or the loss (if any) suffered by the Plaintiffs as a result of a six months delay in their being able to sell offthe16 storey building unit by unit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The declaration for consequential damage given by the Judge was clearly given on the evidence led before him that the premises tobe erected would be 16 storeys in height and he was further told that they would be LET OUT in their entirety.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The now 24 storey building became ready for occupation in October 1968.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Units in the new building have been partially rented out and partially sold off. Out of 97 units 32 units have been sold and 23 unitshave been rented out: Of the 23 rented out 9 have been rented to a firm in which the Plaintiffs' company is substantially interested.42 units have neither been rented nor sold.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Most of these sales and lettings took place in the latter part of 1969 and it is true to say that for most of the time since thepremises were ready for occupation they have been empty.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The impact of the bank run which started on the 9th of February, 1965 was known to Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr when he made the declarationbut it had not made itself fully felt upon the world of real estate at the time judgment was given on the 17th of July, 1965.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> To compound my difficulties the Plaintiffs' principal witness at the hearing before Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr, who was also the principalat the hearing before me, was less than truthful in informing the trial judge of his companies' intentions.

This passage deals with the proposition that thereis no recovery for loss which the Plaintiff has avoided, unless the matter is collateral. It was Mr. Cheung's case that as the erectionof the 24 storey building owed its genesis to the drop in market prices occasioned by the bank run and not to the wrongful holdingover, the mitigation effected by the erection of a larger and a more profitable building was res inter alios acta. As the profitwould be collateral to the wrongful act, the Defendants could not plead the advantage which flowed from a better investment to absolvethem from their reponsibility to pay damages due and arising out of their wrongful act.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> In particular, he cited the final part of paragraph 162:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Viscount Haldane's formulation of this rule, with its reference to steps taken in the ordinary course of business, is geared to contractrather than to tort: this is understandable since <u>British Westinghouse Co.</u> v. <u>Underground Ry.</u><sup>(1)</sup> was a case of breach of contract. A wider formulation, which more readily includes tort, is that matter completely collateral andmerely res inter alios acta cannot be used in mitigation of damage. (This expression was praised by Lord Reid in <u>B.T.C.</u> v. <u>Gourley</u><sup>(2)</sup>). This has the great merit of stating the rule at once concisely and completely; but it gives no indication of how the rule operatesand of what solutions would be reached when applying it to particular circumstances.

commercially viable to sell units, then that was the intention of the Plaintiffs whether the building to be constructedwas 16 storeys or 24 storeys. I also find as a fact that if any renting was to be done this would only take place as an operandidesperandum. Mr. Chen's omission to inform Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr that his company had 3 months before the trial submitted plansfor a different building altogether of 24 storeys is a particularly sinister feature of this case, and the act of concealment fromthe Court was cynically dishonest.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The Plaintiffs chose before me to base their claim upon the damages which they say they have suffered by their being deprived ofrents for six months.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> I disbelieve the evidence given by Mr. Chen both before Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr and myself that it was the Plaintiffs' intention torent out the premises which they contemplated building at the time the declaration was made.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> That being so, what damages have the Plaintiffs suffered by the six month wrongful holding over of the Defendants?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> This now takes me on to the Defendants' case which was devoted to establishing:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%">(i)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="93%">that the Plaintiffs by erecting a 24 storey skyscraper instead of a 16 storey skyscraper have mitigated their loss to such a degreethat if all the units are sold at present day prices, there will be no loss at all.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%">(ii)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="93%">that all the evidence before me points to the fact that in contradiction to what Mr. Chen Tsang Hsi told Mr. Justice Blair-Kerr itwas not the intention of this company to rent out premises at all but to sell them unit by unit; and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="5%">(iii)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="93%">that all the evidence before me points to the fact that if the premises were rented out in 1966 the figures of occupation by tenantswould have been much lower than 100% or 95%.</td>        </tr>    </table>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The Defendants called two witnesses:-</p>	<blockquote>    <table border="0" width="85%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%">(1)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="93%">Mr. Cheng Yan Tak, a clerk from the Tenancy Tribunal who produced the official file of Exemption Proceedings applications HE 111 and123 of 1963 in respect of the premises in question; and</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%">(2)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="93%">Mr. F.P.

The Plaintiffs say the bank run. The Defendantssuggest that the intention was there before the bank run started and that if any decision was consciously made to alter the plans,it was triggered off by the wrongful holding over.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> In making a finding on this point I am thrown back on the evidence of Mr. Chen and elusive as he was in coming to the point on anyquestion put to him, I find as a fact that the Plaintiffs, as so frequently happens in the would of real estate were and are at alltimes opportunists. The minds of the Plaintiffs at the end of 1964 and the beginning of 1965 were open to be conditioned by the ebband flow of events.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> One would have been the wrongful holding over, a second would have been the bank run, a third the possible relaxation in the restrictionsof the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a>, and I have no doubt that a fourth was that wave of optimism which at all times moves so strongly in the breasts of developers toreap the maximum profit obtainable from a site freed from the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The dividing line which separates the reason which prompted the decision to build the 24 storey building is now so blurred by theevents of late 1964 and early 1965 that I hold that the birth of the idea to change the plans cannot be laid entirely on one eventand certainly not fairly and squarely on the Defendants wrongful holding over.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> I am satisfied, though my mind is not entirely free of doubt, that the erection of a 24 storey building instead of a 16 storey buildingis a case of res inter alios acta and for this reason I reject the submission made by Mr. Zimmern on this leg that as a greater profitwill accrue to the Plaintiffs from this building than from a 16 storey building, the end result is that his clients are absolvedfrom paying damages.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> In seeking to distinguish the British Westinghouse<sup>(1)</sup>, the Wertheim v.

These Reports said that the prices which had risen to a then all timepeak in January 1965 had after the bank run fallen away and that in the case of shops the demand generally was not very good anda number of shops in the Central District remained vacant for most of the year.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> In the case of offices the large amount of new office accommodation being developed in the center of Victoria seemed likely to resultin a surplus and rents appeared to have passed their peak.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> The decentralization of offices, despite the comparatively small size of Hong Kong, appeared to be very difficult to achieve andonly in times of a shortage of space in Central Victoria did firms seem inclined to move out.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> During the year 1965/66 office accommodation became available in the Central district in Prince's Building, International Buildingand in the year 1966/67 office accommodation became available in Realty Building, New Henry House, the Hong Kong Chinese Bank Building,the China Underwriters Life Building, Che Sang Building, Canton House, Lok Yew Building, Wang Kee Building, and a number of othersalong Queen's Road Central and Des Voeux Road Central.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> Towards the end of his evidence Mr. de Ville said that he thought that a selling figure of $200.00 per square foot for office accommodationin July 1966 was exaggerated and that the figure should be $150.00 per square foot. Mr. de Ville was not pressed to give a valuationfor shop premises in July 1966 but in view of the fact that he reduced the office figure by 25% it must be presumed that shop premiseswould also see a reduction.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> In any event I think the July 1965 sale prices which Mr. de Ville gave of $150.00 per square foot for office accommodation and byimplication a lower figure then his 1965 figure for shop premises are grossly inflated. On his own admission he was not in Hong Kongat that time and he did not personally know the area of these premises. I found him a most unconvincing witness.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> It is quite apparent that at July 1966 there would not only her have been a shortage of office premises in the central district buta glut. As the premises, the subject matter of this assessment, are right out on the perimeter of the central district I hold asa fact that to sell units in a 16 storey building at that time whether as offices or as shops, it would have been necessary to competewith all the buildings which I have just mentioned, all of which were more central than these premises.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> I further old as a fact that had the 16 storey building been ready for selling off in units in July, 1966, they could only have beensold at "give away" prices.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> It is true that the Plaintiffs could have mitigated their loss by renting out parts of the premises but this again could, in relationto the competition they were experiencing, only have been done once again at give away prices.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> The Plaintiffs have by the Defendants wrongful holding over been deprived of the opportunity to receive this rental income (whateverit might have been) for six months.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> If circumstances had been different, it might have been necessary for me to make an assessment of the 6 months rent the Plaintiffswould have lost had they been able to rent out units in the building. This would have posed some difficulty because I would havehad to make a finding on what portion of the building would at that time have been let out and what rent would have been received.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> However, I have found as a fact that any letting would only have been an operandi desperandum and that the Plaintiffs would witha 16 storey building have done what they have now done with their 24 storey that is to say waited until not only a seller's marketappeared but a good seller's market.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> The figures given by Mr. Chen showing the sale price of units in the new 24 storey building indicate that since the first unit wassold prices have hardened and continue to go up.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Any loss which the Plaintiffs have experienced by the loss of rents (which I have already held would only have been on a temporarybasis) is entirely offset by the undoubted gain they must make on the sale of the units at current day prices or on higher prioesas the market hardens when weighed against July 1966 prices which I have already held must have been well below the figures whichMr. de Ville gave of $150.00 a square foot for office premises with the price of shops correspondingly down as well.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> In his final submission Mr. Cheung suggested that if I accepted that the measure of damages had to be assessed on any loss sustainedin selling units I should take into consideration the investment loss occasioned by the scheme being held up for six months by theDefendants' wrongful act.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Whatever merit there is in this suggestion is again met by the fact that whilst a wrong has been occasioned and some loss sustainedthat loss is wholly offset by the undoubted profit which the Plaintiffs must have or will succeed in making by selling off unitsin the new building (i.e. a 16 storey building had it been built).</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> I find in this case that the Plaintiffs have suffered no loss. They have, however, been wronged. They are entitled to damage forthis, but as no loss has been sustained, the damages can only be assessed at a nominal amount and this I now do and so certify inthe sum of $1.00.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">(J.R.
