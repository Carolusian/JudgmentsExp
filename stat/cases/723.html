Alternatively, he submitted that the questions to be raised are ones which, by reason of their great general or public importance,ought to be submitted to the Court of Final Appeal for decision under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(b).</a> He also submitted that if the case does not strictly satisfy the abovementioned test of importance, this Court should nonethelessexercise its residual discretion in favour of granting leave to appeal.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The facts relevant to the present application may be summarised as follows. The defendants' vessel, now named "Resource 1", was arrestedin Hong Kong on 9 February 1997 by the Plaintiff cargo owners. The plaintiffs allege that their cargo of 30,000 metric tons of baggedcement was shipped on board the vessel, then named "Tian Sheng No. 8", in October 1996 at Rizhao, China for shipment to Bangladesh,but that there was a deviation with the cargo being wrongfully discharged and sold at Haikou. The in rem action pursuant to whichthe vessel was arrested is brought on the basis that the plaintiffs have good causes of action in contract, tort and bailment. Theloss and damage allegedly suffered by the plaintiffs, as particularised in the Points of Claim, is said to exceed US$2 million invalue.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> After the vessel's arrest, service of the in rem Writ was acknowledged on 24 February 1997 by Messrs Sinclair, Roche &amp; Temperleyon behalf of the vessel's present owners, namely, International Resources Investment Inc. Such defendants allege that they had purchasedthe vessel from her previous owners, on 6 December 1996, an entity whose identity was subject to some controversy, but need not detainus at present.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The defendants accordingly say that the matters complained of by the plaintiffs took place prior to their acquisition of the vessel.However, it is not in dispute that, by virtue of the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a>, potential liability in rem is preserved against a vessel notwithstanding a change in its ownership having taken place between thetime that the causes of action accrued and the time of her arrest, such provisions sometimes being said to give the plaintiffs a"statutory lien" over the vessel. As Mr Sussex pointed out, such potential liability on the part of the new owners is generally cateredfor by their obtaining a suitable indemnity from the previous owners as a condition of the purchase. If they choose to acknowledgeservice, the new owners are entitled to deploy any defences open to the previous owners and, in the present case, they have doneso, having filed a defence joining issue on the merits of the plaintiffs' claim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> When the plaintiffs obtained an order for sale pendente lite on 18 March 1997, the defendants put up a bail bond in the sum of US$1.01million and so secured the release of the vessel. However, the defendants did not then, or at any other time, seek to challenge theCourt's in rem jurisdiction under Order 12 rule 8 of the High Court Rules. Instead, some time after the arrest, the defendants appliedfor a stay of the proceedings on the basis of an exclusive jurisdiction clause and on the ground of forum non conveniens. That applicationwas subsequently abandoned on 6 January 1999.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In the meantime, on 25 April 1998, the defendants issued a summons before Waung J to set aside the Warrant of Arrest and consequentially,for cancellation of the bail bond on the ground that the case did not come within the Court's admiralty in rem jurisdiction as constitutedby <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12B</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Waung J dismissed the summons inter alia on the basis that, not having challenged the Court's jurisdiction under the provisions ofOrder 12 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 8</a>, it was not open to the defendants to make such a challenge on some other basis. He so held applying the Court of Appeal's decisionin <strong>Wo Fung Paper Making Factory Ltd v Sappi Kraft</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20HKLR%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] HKLR 346</a> that every application which, if successful, would result in the defendant avoiding the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts hasto be made under Order 12 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 8.</a> This Court (differently constituted, with Suffiad J then forming part of its membership) upheld Waung J's decision.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether as of right</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The defendants contend that they are entitled to appeal that decision to the Court of Final Appeal as of right under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(a).</a> For that contention to succeed, the Court's decision must involve a final judgment. As laid down in <strong>First Pacific Bank Ltd v Robert H P Fung</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20HKLR%20527" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] HKLR 527</a>, this means that the defendants must show that, whatever its result, the appeal would finally dispose of the controversy betweenthe parties.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> In our judgment, applying that test, the Court in the present case is not concerned with a final judgment. The appeal would settlethe question whether the defendants are entitled to challenge the Court's in rem jurisdiction. If the defendants fail, it will remainfor the plaintiffs to establish substantive liability in contract, tort or bailment. If the defendants succeed and if in rem jurisdictionis held to be lacking, the arrest would be set aside and the bail bond which now represents the res would be cancelled. However,in personam jurisdiction having been founded against the defendants by their submission to the jurisdiction, there would still remainfor determination all questions of substantive liability in respect of which issue has been joined on the merits. The appeal wouldtherefore not finally dispose of the controversy between the parties.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> We accept, of course, that commercially, it may (but by no means necessarily will) be that, without an arrested vessel or substitutedsecurity for their claim, the plaintiffs will decline to pursue the in personam proceedings against the defendants. The test, however,is whether the judgment is a final judgment as a matter of law and not whether, commercially, a particular result of the appeal islikely to lead to abandonment of the claim.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Accordingly, in our view, the application for leave to appeal as of right fails because the judgment sought to be appealed againstis not a final judgment within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(a).</a></p>    <p class="heading">Great general or public importance</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> The questions said to qualify under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(b)</a> as questions which, by reason of their great general or public importance, ought to be submitted to the Court of Final Appeal fordecision were formulated by Mr Sussex as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <div align="left">            <table border="0" width="100%">                <tr>                    <td width="8%" valign="top">(1)</td>                    <td width="92%" valign="top">Whether RHC Order 12 rule 8 is a comprehensive and exclusive code for dealing with all questions relating to the jurisdiction of theHigh Court, so that where a defendant contends that the Court lacks substantive jurisdiction, and does not challenge his own amenabilityto be brought before the Court, that defendant must nevertheless apply under RHC Order 12 rule 8 and comply with the time limit therebyprescribed.</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="8%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="92%" valign="top"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="8%" valign="top">(1A)</td>                    <td width="92%" valign="top">If a challenge to jurisdiction, such as that made in <strong>Wilkinson v Barking Corporation</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%201%20KB%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] 1 KB 721</a>, does not have to be made under RHC Order 12 rule 8, should the admiralty jurisdiction in rem be characterised in the same way asthe jurisdiction issue under consideration in <strong>Wilkinson v Barking Corporation</strong>?</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="8%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="92%" valign="top"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="8%" valign="top">(2)</td>                    <td width="92%" valign="top">Whether <strong>The "Evpo Agnic"</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20WLR%201090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 WLR 1090</a> is good law insofar as it decides (at p 1096D) that "owner" in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12B(4)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap 4</a>) means "registered owner", and, if so, whether it is permissible for the Court to conclude that someone other than the partywhose name appears on the relevant register is in fact the owner.</td>                </tr>            </table>        </div>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Questions (1) and (1A)</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Question (1A) was not in the Notice of Motion but was allowed to be included in this application by leave of the Court.

However, in our view, as appears from the judgment of Mayo JA,with whom the other Judges agreed (at pp 5 and 6), this Court held that the question of whether the present case falls within theadmiralty in rem jurisdiction (as laid down by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s12b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 12B)</a> is plainly an entirely different question from the jurisdiction question posed in <strong>Wilkinson v Barking</strong>.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> <strong>Wilkinson v Barking</strong> was a case in which the challenge was to the court's merits jurisdiction, namely, as to whether the power to determine certain rightsof local authority employees had been taken away from the court and vested exclusively by statute in some other tribunal. In thepresent case, the challenge is as to the amenability of the vessel to the Court's in rem jurisdiction, being a "jurisdiction jurisdiction"challenge which, like the challenge in <strong>Wo Fung Paper</strong>, must be brought within the four corners of Order 12 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 8.</a></p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> In the <strong>Rothmans</strong> case (<em>supra, at pp</em> 375-6), Mustill J (whose decision was upheld by the English Court of Appeal) considered the circumstances in which possible objectionsto a court exercising jurisdiction can be waived and gave as an example where waiver was possible, the Court's exercise of jurisdictionunder Order 11, as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"The next issue is whether a party can, by waiver, concede to the court the jurisdiction to entertain actions which by virtue of article28 [of Schedule 1 to the Carriage by Air Act 1961] ought properly to have been instituted elsewhere. For this purpose, two situationsmust be distinguished.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">The first exists where an action is brought in respect of a matter which in the ordinary way the court would have no jurisdictionto entertain, but where it is not precluded from doing so if no objection is taken. Thus, for example, if a plaintiff obtains leaveunder R.S.C., Ord. 11, in a case where it should not have been granted, the action can properly proceed unless an application ismade to set aside the writ and service. The objection is one which can be waived, and the entry of an unconditional appearance isan example of such a waiver.</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">The second situation exists where the objection is not simply that the matter lies outside the jurisdiction of the court, as conferredby the common law or by statute, but is one in respect of which jurisdiction has been actively withdrawn from the court and conferredon another tribunal."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> This Court has in effect decided that objections to the admiralty in rem jurisdiction are to be treated on the same basis as objectionsto jurisdiction asserted under Order 11, as discussed by Mustill J, with the consequences prescribed by <strong>Wo Fung Paper v Sappi Kraft</strong>.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The plaintiffs invoked the admiralty in rem jurisdiction by serving and arresting the vessel in Hong Kong on the grounds set outin the affidavit leading arrest. If no objection was taken to the court exercising such jurisdiction, the court is entitled to proceedon the assumption that jurisdiction has been properly invoked. If in fact there was a potential objection on the ground that thesubject-matter of the dispute "lies outside the jurisdiction of the court, as conferred by ....... statute", such objection can bewaived and is deemed to have been waived unless an application to set aside the Writ, service and/or the arrest is made in accordancewith Order 12 rule 8.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The Court's conclusion is also strongly supported by the wording of the rule. Order 12 rule 8(3) expressly provides for challengesto the admiralty in rem jurisdiction to be made under Order 12 rule 8(1). This requires and presupposes an acknowledgment of serviceand notice of intention to defend by the vessel's owners if they wish to mount a challenge. The submission to the court's jurisdictionprescribed by Order 12 rule 8(7) if a challenge is not made pursuant to sub-rule 1 within the time limited gives a clear indicationthat it was intended to make Order 12 rule 8 a compulsory code for challenges to jurisdiction, including challenges to the admiraltyin rem jurisdiction.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> This Court has accordingly decided that the applicability of Order 12 rule 8 to such challenges is plainly settled. In our view,in such circumstances, it is appropriate to refuse the defendants' application, leaving them to seek leave from the Court of FinalAppeal, if so advised.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> There is an additional ground for refusing leave under section 22(1)(b) which is of at least equal weight. As Mr Michael Bunting,who appeared for the plaintiffs, pointed out, the defendants find themselves advancing the intricate argument summarised above purelyor very largely because they have chosen not to avail themselves of simple procedures made available by Order 12 rule 8 for challengingany invocation of jurisdiction. Not only did they choose to make no challenge under that rule in the time limited by Order 12 rule8(1), at no stage have they sought an extension of time for the bringing of such a challenge.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> In our view, the availability, in appropriate cases, of extensions of time for Order 12 rule 8 applications lends force to a constructionof the rule which attributes to it the intention and ability to provide an all-embracing code for challenging amenability to jurisdiction.The claim that the questions formulated by the defendants as set out above are of great general or public importance is severelyundermined or destroyed if such questions need to be canvassed only as a result of the defendants' failure to avail themselves ofreadily accessible procedures designed to enable the jurisdictional questions to be tested.</p>    <p class="heading">Question (2)</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In the light of the conclusion that leave should not be granted under section 22(1)(b) in respect of Questions (1) and (1A), Question(2) is not engaged. It is concerned with an argument only arising if the challenge to the in rem jurisdiction is to be entertained.No justification exists for giving leave to appeal on that question alone. Accordingly, in our judgment, leave must also be refusedin respect of Question (2).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> We are also unable to see any ground for the grant of leave pursuant to the residual discretion given to the Court by section 22.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Accordingly, in our view, the application must be dismissed. We make an order nisi that the costs of this application be to the plaintiffsin any event.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(G P Nazareth)</td>                <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Simon Mayo)</td>                <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(R A V Ribeiro)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Vice President</td>                <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Justice of Appeal</td>                <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Michael Bunting, instructed by Messrs Richards Butler, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p align="justify">Mr Charles Sussex, instructed by Messrs Ng &amp; Partners, for the Defendants</p>        <p align="justify"> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2000/273.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
