The plaintiffs were passengers on a coach travelling from Hong Kong to Guangzhou on tickets which were bought at the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs office in Hong Kong. The plaintiffs are residents of Hong Kong. The driver of the coach was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, who is also a resident of Hong Kong. The coach was travelling on the GuangzhouâShenzhen Highway whilst being drivenby the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, when it was involved in an accident as a result of which the plaintiffs have sustained personal injuries. The plaintiffshad received their medical treatment in Hong Kong.</p>        <p class="quote">2. In this action, the plaintiffs claimed against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for negligence, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, a company incorporated in Hong Kong and resident here, for breach of contract, as well as being vicariously liable forthe negligence of 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was allegedly an:</p>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ employee and/or agent of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant â¦â.</p>        <p class="quote">3. The accident occurred on 24 July 2005.  The action was commenced on 7 July 2008.  â¦â </p>        <p>(HCMP 1759/2009, Judgement dated 11.11.2009)</p>    </blockquote><p class="heading"><u>Preliminary matter</u></p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  At the outset of the trial, Ms. C. Tong, Counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, applied to amend her defence to the effect of bringing up the issue as to whether the Plaintiffs did or did not wear safetybelts at the material time. Ms. L. Lau, Counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant agreed to the application, but not Mr. A. Lam, Counsel for the Plaintiffs.  Upon discussion, I allowed the applicationand agreed to give reasons later.  Here are them:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  The safety belt issue is important. It affects quantum to be assessed, if necessary.  Without it, one of the real issues amongthe parties will not be determined by the Court.</p>        <p>(b)  The issue is factual and simple.  It could be easily resolved by, for example, production of a photo taken, a certificate aboutthe coach, and so forth.  It was up to the parties to adduce evidence before this Court. In any event, at least, 3 witnesses wouldbe able to testify before me.</p>        <p>(c)  I did not see any real or substantive prejudice suffered by the Plaintiffs.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>The Defences</u></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Defences may be summarized in the followings.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  <u>1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</u></p>      <blockquote>          <p>(i) The accident was caused by the negligence of other drivers, not him.</p>          <p>(ii) The Plaintiffs were estopped and precluded from claiming him because after the accident, a group of persons, including the Plaintiffs,executed a waiver in favour of him.</p>          <p>(iii) If he would be however held liable, the Plaintiffs were contributory negligent because they failed to wear the seat belt.</p>          <p>(iv) Further, in any event, the damages were excessive.</p>      </blockquote>        <p>(b) <u>2<sup>nd</sup>  Defendant</u></p>      <blockquote>          <p>(i) It was only an agent to sell tickets for and on behalf of its principal, the service provider å»£æ±å¥åå ä¸æéå®¢éæéå¬å¸(âå¥åå ä¸â).  The coach licence ç²µZ.BH04æ¸¯was registered in the name ofå¥åå ä¸.  It also provided the coach, thedriver (i.e. the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant) and the insurance coverage in PRC.</p>          <p>(ii) The Plaintiffs were found sustaining no injures by the PRC hospital.</p>          <p>(iii) Thereafter, they waived the rights of compensation.  In reliance of it, å¥åå ä¸or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant did not follow up the matter.  The Plaintiffs were therefore estopped and precluded from claiming it.</p>          <p>(iv) After all, the damages were also excessive.</p>      </blockquote>    </blockquote><p class="heading">Issues</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  With the above in mind, coupled with the assistance from Mr. Lam in his opening, I further set out the issues as below:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) How did the accident happen?  Was it caused by the negligence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, or some other drivers?</p>        <p>(2) Did the Plaintiffs suffer injuries at the accident?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) After the accident, what intimation did the Plaintiffs make to the Mainland traffic police?  Under what circumstances they signedthe âwaiverâ headed with âç³è«æ¸â?  To whom the document was written?  What was written thereon and its legal effect?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) What was the relationship between the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and å¥åå ä¸?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5) Subject to (4), what was the relationship between the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and the Plaintiffs? Was there a contract between them?  If so, did the contract contain an implied term of safety?   Further,if applicable, was the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in breach?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6) As an alternative to the contractual claim, did the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant owe a duty of care in tort to the Plaintiffs?  If so, was the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in breach?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(7) Was the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant vicariously liable for the negligence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, if any?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(8) Subject to the determination of liability, were there safety belts available at the coach for the passengers at the material time? If so, did the Plaintiffs wear them?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(9) Was the Plaintiffsâ claim excessive?  What are the appropriate damages to be awarded?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  It should be mentioned at this juncture that:</p><blockquote>        <p>(a) Ms. Lau kindly confirmed that Hong Kong law was applicable to the present disputes.</p>        <p>(b) Subject to the determination of liability, all Counsel also kindly agreed the following quantum.</p>    </blockquote><table width="100%" border="0">  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td width="5%">(i)</td>    <td style="width: 53%"> The Husband:</td>    <td width="20%">$</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(1) Pre-trial loss of earnings </td>    <td>1,008.0</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(3 days of sick leave)</td>    <td> </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(2) Medical expenses</td>    <td>12,028.0</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(3) Travelling expenses</td>    <td>1,000.0</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(4) Purchase of nourishing food</td>    <td><u>12,581.5</u></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%"> </td>    <td> 26,617.5</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%"> </td>    <td>======</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td>(ii)</td>    <td style="width: 53%">The Wife:</td>    <td>$</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(1) Medical expenses</td>    <td>22,232.0</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(2) Travelling expenses</td>    <td>1,000.0</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(3) Purchase of medical equipment</td>    <td>2,695.0</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%">(4) Purchase of nourishing food</td>    <td><u>12,581.5</u></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%"> </td>    <td>38,508.5</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="width: 8%"> </td>    <td> </td>    <td style="width: 53%"> </td>    <td>======</td>  </tr></table>    <p class="heading">The Evidence</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  To decide on the issues, one has to rule on the facts of the case upon available evidence before the Court, including documentationand oral evidence from witnesses.  Without the question of authenticity, documents are generally more reliable than witnesses asthe latter may elect not to tell the truth, exaggerate consciously or unconsciously, forget part of the facts as memory fades outas time goes on.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In the present proceedings, both documents and live witnesses were available.  There was no argument that any of the documents wasfabricated or untrue.  There were however lots of arguments that the witnesses were not to be believed.  Upon thought, it is my generalobservation that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  written documents are preferred to if there is a conflict between them and witnesses, and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)  the Plaintiffsâ evidence are preferred to if there is a conflict between them and those of the Defendants.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  I say so for the following reasons.</p><p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is important because he was the driver of the coach.  âHow did the accident happen?â and âWere there safety beltson the coach?â are two key factual disputes herein.  However, he failed me in a number of aspects.</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant tried to suggest that the accident was caused by other drivers.

However, in my view, for the present purpose, such questionis not particularly relevant. On balance, the one who paid for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had to be somebody who was responsible for the acts of him. The payment, without reservation, amounted to an admissionof liability. </p>        <p>(c)  The oral evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant turned to be unreliable under the cross-examination of Mr. Lam.</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">(i) The 1st Defendant told the Court that he started to notice the truck when it was at a distance of about 100 metres from him. Thereafter, before the swerving, it was about 20 metres.  It therefore suggests that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was driving faster than the truck.</p>          <p class="quote">(ii) Within such period, he further told that there were some 10 to 20 small vehicles cutting the lanes in between.  He had to bealerted by the then traffic condition.</p>          <p class="quote">(iii) As pointed out by Mr. Lam,</p>        </blockquote><p class="quote">âIt is trite law and common sense that each and every driver has to keep a safe braking distance behind the vehicle immediatelyin front of it so that even if the driver of the vehicle in the front suddenly slowed down, the driver of the vehicle following itwould have sufficient time to react to the situation. The duty is squarely upon D1 in the present situation.â</p><p class="quote">(para. 3(g) of Mr. Lamâs Final submission)  (iv) As to the heavy vehicle, to start with, I cannot understand how it could be âstationaryâon a highway. There is no single piece of evidence suggesting the same, apart from that of the 1st Defendant. However, even if itwere âstationaryâ there:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦  There is also no merits in D1âs allegation whatsoever because it was his duty to keep a safe braking distance behind thefirst vehicle (the truck), and part of the reasons for that was he would have been able to see the traffic condition on the right-hand-sidelane, including the second vehicle.â </p>        <p class="quote">     (para. 3(h) of Mr. Lamâs Final Submission)</p>        <p>(d) Ms. Tong suggested that the accident was inevitable as far as her client was involved.  She cited a number of authorities.  Theyhowever cannot help the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant because the argument is a factual one and depends much on the particular circumstances of the case.</p>        <p>(e)  Regarding the safety belt issue, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant said that there was such facility, lap belt (å®å¨è°å¸¶), on the coach for the passengers. The Plaintiffs just failedto use them.  Nonetheless, the availability of the safety belts on the coach is not supported by any objective evidence, like photosor certificate of inspection.  Quite to the contrary, one would expect that such live and important issue had to be appeared somewherein the documents concerning investigation of the accident in PRC and compensation for the victims whose claim was either settledor lodged there, but it did not appear anywhere in these documents.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(f)   The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant also said that the coach was examined in Hong Kong every year, including checking that safety belts were provided at thepassenger seats.  However, upon being put that the relevant Hong Kong legislation (viz. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/374F/s8a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 8A(1)</a> and (2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/374F" class="autolink_findacts">Road Traffic (Safety Equipment) Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/374F">Cap 374F</a>) did not require so, even at the date of the trial herein, not to mention years ago when the accident happened, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was unable to give any further reply.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(g)  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs evidence in relation to the taking care of the safety belts every day is far from believable.  As pointed by Mr. Lamin paragraph 8(h) of his Final Submission,</p>    </blockquote><blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ while he was driving the coach in 2003-2005, before he went off duty everyday, he would adjust all the safety belts on the45 passengers seat of the coach to the shortest length and buckle up all the safety belts so that all the safety belts would restneatly and tidily close to the gap of the vertical back and the horizontal seat of the passengers seat.  With the greatest respect,this allegation is nothing but false. There is absolutely no reason, not to mention no good reason, for D1 to buckle up the safetybelts knowing full well that the passengers coming on board the next journey would have to unbuckle the safety belt before they couldbuckle up.  No driver would have done what D1 alleged to have done.  It is clear that D1 made up the allegation with a view to beefingup his case that there were safety belts provided for the passengers seat of the coach â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The evidence of the director of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Mr. Chen, is also important for the purpose of determining the exact relationship among the parties, in particular thatbetween the Plaintiffs and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. Unfortunately, I also find him unreliable.</p>    <blockquote>      <p>(a)  The 2nd Defendant pleaded that it only sold the tickets as the agent of å¥åå ä¸.  The staff at the counter would informall customers as such.</p>        <p>(b)   However, no staff was called to give evidence to such effect. </p></blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant usually sold tickets for buses they managed.  Mr. Chen told the Court that it had started selling tickets for å¥åå ä¸from17 September 2004.  Before the accident, they did not encounter any problem.  After the same, they added something on the ticketsto the effect that they were selling the same as agent only.</p>    </blockquote><blockquote>        <p>(d)  Without commenting whether the new practice could help the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant avoiding its liability in future, such change simply makes clear that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant did not realize the importance of the difference between selling their own tickets and selling tickets for others.  Assuch, it also makes the oral representation by all counter staff to customers not to be believed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Having decided that the Plaintiffsâ case is more credible in considering the overall oral evidence before me, I cannot acceptall of their factual propositions as some of them were either untrue or unreliable in light of the documents.</p>    <blockquote>      <p>(a) Both Plaintiffs maintained that the tickets did not contain any ticket end (ç¥¨å°¾), but it cannot be true as both vertical edgesof the original tickets produced by them (exhibit P2 to P4) clearly bear âdotsâ.  It means that each ticket contains 3 parts:the ticket stub (ç¥¨é ­), the ticket itself (ç¥¨èº«) and the ticket end (ç¥¨å°¾).</p>      <p>(b) The Plaintiffs disclosed not only 3 original tickets, but also a copy of the back sheet of another ticket being stuck with a roundlabel containing: printed words of âå ä¸å·´å£«â and hand written numbers of â7422â.  The Plaintiffs could not come up withany explanation of the document but admitted that it was produced by them.  With respect, it must be something coming into theirhands or possession of any of their family members out of the subject trip.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>(c) With the above copy label in hand and coupled with the photos of the coach as shown in the investigation by the PRC traffic police(showing the name of å»£æ±å¥åå ä¸æéå®¢éæéå¬å¸ on the side of the coach), it makes one hard to agree that the Plaintiffswere entirely unaware of âå ä¸å·´å£«â; âå¥åå ä¸â or âå»£æ±å¥åå ä¸æéå®¢éæéå¬å¸â at all. One ofcourse must accept that all passengers had to get off and board the coach 3 to 4 times throughout the journey at the Hong Kong Immigrationand PRC Immigration. The labels were provided to the passengers to help them identifying the âcorrectâ coach to get on.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Upon consideration, I make the following finding of facts:</p>    <blockquote>      <p>(a) The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant failed to keep a safe distance between his coach and the truck ahead.  When the truck slowed down, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had to swerve to the right lane to avoid a direct collision and as such, it rammed into the heavy vehicle.</p>      <p>(b) After the accident, the Plaintiffs were sent to the local hospital there, receiving simple and initial treatment.  It was lateat night.  They wanted better treatment in Hong Kong.  They also wanted to take their mother and children back to Hong Kong.</p></blockquote>    <blockquote>      <p>(c) The Mainland traffic police told them that they had to stay if they wanted to claim in PRC.  The family was desperate to leavefor Hong Kong.  They did not have legal advice.

Thus it arises when a person is entitled to alternative rightsinconsistent with one another and that person acts in a manner which is consistent only with his having chosen to rely on one ofthemâ¦  It is important to appreciate that, in this context, the party who makes the election only abandons his right to treat thecontract as repudiated: he does not abandon his right to claim damages for the loss suffered as a result of the breach.  A secondtype of waiver may be called âwaiver by estoppelâ and it arises when the innocent party agrees with the party in default thathe will not exercise his right to treat the contract as repudiated or so conducts himself as to lead the party in default to believethat he will not exercise that right â¦â</p>      <p class="quote">(Chitty on Contracts, Vol. 1 13<sup>th</sup> ed. at p.1543-1544) </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>      <p class="quote">(ii) Waiver in the context of tort:</p>      <p class="quote">â<b>Wavier by an election inconsistent with a tort claim</b>.

Take this illustration: railway A issues tickets for railway A and railway B.  Thetraffic is sometimes worked by carriages and servants belonging to railway A, and sometimes by carriages and servants belonging torailway B.  A passenger takes a ticket from railway A and gets into a carriage belonging to railway B, drawn by railway Bâs engines,and manned by railway Bâs servants.

He could sue railway A on the contract arising from the ticket issued bythe company to carry him the whole distance with reasonable care or caution, or he could sue railway B as the immediate authors ofthe negligence, on the implied contract or undertaking which would arise from his having been received into the carriage, or fromhis having been invited to go into the carriage of railway B and become a passenger on the railway.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>      <p>(i) Service provider may attract liability under the concept of holding out.

However, the Wife had a total of 79 days of sick leave certificate. She therefore had a bigger claim of $45,622.50 ($16,500 x 79/30 + 5% MPF).  Further, she said that thereafter she easily lost herattention, made mistakes at work easily and could not carry out some manual work requiring strength.  As a result, her elder brother,the other director of the employer, decided a salary deduction.  She had no choice but to accept it as she did perform âworseâthan before.  She asked for a further sum of $137,025 ($16,500 - $12,000 x 29 months + 5% MPF).  The Defendants disagreed and challengedthe claim.
