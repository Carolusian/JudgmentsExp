At the conclusionof the hearing of this appeal, this court reserved its judgment which we now give.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Although the history behind the litigation is somewhat involved and took the judge many pages in his judgment to explain, the essentialfacts found by the judge are not in dispute.  For the purposes of this appeal it is sufficient to state that the plaintiffâs claimrelates to land known as Lot No. 525RP in DD No. 26 in Tai Po (âthe landâ).  The land is registered in the name of Li Wing Fu,also known as Li Koon Shing, deceased (âMr Liâ).  Mr Liâs estate is sued by the plaintiff as the 4<sup>th</sup> named defendant, it is represented by Mr Liâs eldest (adopted) son, the 1<sup>st</sup> named defendant (âthe 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâ).  The other two defendants (âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâ and âthe 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantâ respectively) are the other two sons of Mr Li.  The essential claim in the action is for a declaration that the registeredowner of the land and the defendants have lost the right to bring any action to recover the land or any part thereof by reason of<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/374">Cap. 374</a>.  An order is also sought to vest all the estate right title benefit and interest in the land in the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The judge reached the conclusion that the plaintiff had made out a case of adverse possession of the land, having been in adversepossession since 1954.  There was a question which arose as to whether the period of adverse possession as against the defendantscould be counted from 1954 or 1968.  Again, for the purposes of this appeal, that issue does not need to be addressed.  I would mentionthat the judge approached the matter on the basis that the plaintiff could only rely on adverse possession from the later date andthus, at paragraph 74 of the judgment, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â74.But for one matter, the upshot of all this is that I would be prepared to make a declaration that by 12 March 1988 (the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Mr Liâs acquisition of title to the subject lot) at the latest, Mr Chan has acquired a possessary title to the subjectlot and Mr Liâs title to the same has been extinguished, by reason of Mr Chanâs adverse possession of the same for a continuousperiod of no less than 20 years.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  That one matter to which the judge referred was the effect of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Leases (Extension) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150">Cap. 150</a> (âthe Extension Ordinanceâ).  In particular, the question was whether the effect of the Extension Ordinance was tocreate a new estate by reason of the extension which had the effect of rendering the prior adverse possession by the plaintiff irrelevant. The judge was faced with conflicting decisions at first instance as to the effect of the Extension Ordinance.  </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In <i>Unijet Ltd v Yiu Kwai Hoi</i> HCA 13637/1998 (21 June 2002), Sakhrani J held that the extension under the Ordinance could only be achieved by a surrender and re-grant,or a âreversionary leaseâ.   In those circumstances, notwithstanding the possessory title <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the original lease (as renewed) obtained by a squatter prior to April 1988 [or June 1997] when the re-grant [or alternatively thereversionary lease] took effect, time began to run again upon the re-grant [or the reversionary lease] taking effect. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In contrast, Lam DJ, as he then was, in <i>Mutual Luck Investment Ltd v Yeung Chi Kuen</i> HCMP 6047/1998 (25 November 2002), had come to the opposite conclusion.  He held, in effect, that the source of the governmentâslesseeâs right to the extension was his pre-existing lease and, since the title of the government lessee had been extinguishedas against the squatter under the pre-existing lease, the fact that he acquired a new legal estate could not assist him.  In so holding,Lam DJ considered that he was following the reasoning in the Privy Council decision in <i>Chung Ping Kwan v Lam Island Development Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 38</a> (âthe Lam Island decisionâ).</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The judge below preferred the reasoning of Lam DJ and in doing so mentioned three further points.  The first was that to hold infavour of the government lessee would âmean that a squatter who had obtained a good possessory title prior to April 1988 was, bya side-wind under the Extension Ordinance, deprived of his possessory title to the land in question for the remainder of the termof the renewed lease (pursuant to the Renewal Ordinance) of more than 9 years, before it was due to expire on 27 June 1997.â  Secondly,he felt that it was difficult to construe the Extension Ordinance on the basis that a reversionary lease would take effect in June1997.  Thirdly, he held that the effect of the Extension Ordinance was to give the government lessees a statutory option to extendtheir leases, thus, in effect, re-writing the original leases.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On that basis the judge below gave judgment for the plaintiff and made a declaration that Mr Liâs title had been extinguishedby reason of the plaintiffâs adverse possession of the land and that since 12 March 1988, at the latest, the plaintiffâs possessorytitle was good against the defendants.</p>    <p class="heading">The Extension Ordinance</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Before turning to the arguments on the appeal, it would be convenient to set out some of the provisions of the Extension Ordinance. Under section 5 of the Extension Ordinance a government lessee may exclude the application of the Extension Ordinance.  Section5(1) provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<b>Option by the lessee</b></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)A lessee may exclude from the application of this Ordinance his interest under a lease, other than an undivided share in the landto which the lease relates, by registering in the Land Office register, before the appointed day, a memorandum in a form specifiedby the Land Officer.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Part II of the Extension Ordinance deals with the question of extension of New Territories leases.  That part commences:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">âPART II</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">EXTENSION OF NEW TERRITORIES LEASES</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><b>6. Extension of leases</b></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The term of a lease to which this Ordinance applies is extended, from the date on which it would, apart from this Ordinance, expire,until the expiry of 30 June 2047, without payment of any additional premium.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On this appeal Mr Chan SC, who appeared on behalf of the defendants, argued quite simply that the only way in which section 6 ofthe Extension Ordinance could be implemented is by means of a surrender and re-grant or alternatively by the grant of a new leasewhich would take effect after the expiry of the old lease in June 1997.  He said that in either event that would constitute a newestate.  In those circumstances, the fact that the plaintiff may have acquired squatterâs rights as against the defendants in respectof the old lease did not mean that any rights had been acquired which would affect the new lease which took effect either on thecoming into operation of Part II of the Extension Ordinance or else upon the expiry of the old lease in June 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In the course of his argument, Mr Chan relied heavily on the decision of the majority of the House of Lords in <i>Fairweather v St. Marylebone Property Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20AC%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] AC 510.</a>  Although the decision in that case was heavily criticised by Professor Wade in an article in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1978%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1978 LQR 541</a>, those criticisms are not pertinent to the matters which are relevant in this case.  In his speech Lord Radcliffe explained, in termsto which Professor Wade did not object, the effect of the limitation provisions.  For present purposes the provisions then prevailingin England can be taken as having the same effect as those in Hong Kong.  He said that it was a misunderstanding that had been clearlyexplained by Scrutton, LJ in <i>Taylor v Twinberrow</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%202%20KB%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] 2 KB 16</a>, to treat the legal effect of adverse possession under the Limitation Acts as if it gave a title.  Its effect was âmerely negativeâ. Where the possession had been against a tenant, its only operation was to bar the tenantâs right to claim against the man in possession.  Although he qualified that by saying at page 535:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI think that this statement needs only one qualification: a squatter does in the end get a title by his possession and the indirectoperation of the Act and he can convey a fee simple.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>He went on to say, at page 536:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â...but he <i>(i.e. the squatter)</i> has not the title or estate of the owner or owners whom he has dispossessed nor has he in any relevant sense an estate âcommensuratewithâ the estate of the dispossessed.  All that this misleading phrase can mean is that, since his possession only defeats therights of those to whom it has been adverse, there may be rights not prescribed against, such, for instance, as equitable easements,which are no less enforceable against him in respect of the land than they would have been against the owners he has dispossessed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Lord Denning, in agreement with Lord Radcliffe, explained that although the title of the leaseholder may be extinguished as againstthe squatter, the leaseholderâs title remained as against the landlord of the premises.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  If one applies those principles to the facts of this case, leaving aside the question of any extension in 1988, the defendants wouldnot have been able to assert title as lessee against the plaintiff but, as against the government, the lease remained good.  Oneexample of that is that rent would still have had to have been paid.  Another example is that the plaintiff would have had no rightsagainst the government under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.  Hence it would naturally follow that the plaintiff would have had no rights once the defendantsâ rights had ceased.  Thus althoughthe judge correctly pointed out that the plaintiff could have confidently expected not to have been ousted until the end of the defendantsâterm of the lease, the plaintiff could have had no expectation or otherwise that he would have any rights after June 1997, or evenearlier, if the lease had terminated for any reason, for example because of government action for non-payment of rent.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr Chan argued that, in those circumstances, since the government had good title as against the plaintiff, if it granted a new estate,whether it be to the defendants or anybody else, that new estate would be good as against the plaintiff.  <i>Chung Ping Kwan v Lam Island Development Co. Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 38</a> at 46H-47B.  In my view, Mr Chanâs argument to this extent cannot be faulted and, indeed, the defendants did not seek to argueotherwise, nor did the judgment below proceed on any other basis.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The <i>Lam Island</i> decision is not directly relevant to this case.  It was a decision as to the effect of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/152" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories (Renewable Government Leases) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/152">Cap. 152</a> (âthe Renewal Ordinanceâ) in relation to a lease that had contained an option to renew.  Quite apart from the factthat the wording of the Renewal Ordinance is different from the Extension Ordinance, the important part of the decision was thatthe original lease had contained a right of renewal.  That, the Privy Council held, gave the lessee a right in respect of the propertywhich he could enforce against the landlord.  The Privy Council held that the adverse possession barred the lessee from assertingagainst the squatter that specifically enforceable right, and the legal estate which flowed from that right, as much as it barredthe lessee from asserting against the squatter the other rights granted to him by the lease.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The question in this case might be thought to come down to whether the extension granted by section 6 of the Extension Ordinanceamounts to a new estate which was created or whether as Lam DJ held, there was for all practical purposes an insertion into the oldlease of an option to renew which would take effect as a surrender and new grant.  However, even when that latter proposition isanalysed it can be seen that the notional insertion of an option to renew in a lease must constitute giving a new right.  Hence,even if it should be assumed that there was a notional insertion of the option, that would, in my view, constitute the creation ofa new estate or at the very least a new right which would rise to a term beyond that originally contracted for and time would beginto run again as against the squatter.  I consider that on its proper construction section 6 of the Extension Ordinance did createa new estate in the leaseholders who did not opt out of the provisions of the Extension Ordinance under section 5.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Thus, although I consider that there is some attraction in the notion that section 6 of the Extension Ordinance means that somehowthe original leases were to continue unaltered save for the fact that they would not expire in June 1997, I consider that withoutvery clear wording, which would have in some way either preserved the âsquatterâs titleâ or made it clear that no new estatewas being created, the effect of what has been done is that a new estate had been created.  The legal effect may thus be wider thanhad at first been envisaged. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It may well be that squattersâ rights were curtailed in the New Territories in the period after March 1988, after the coming intoforce of the Extension Ordinance, but, as was pointed out by Lord Denning, squattersâ rights are often vulnerable.  Whilst thatresult might have not been at the forefront of the intention of the legislature, it would be equally unimaginable, if not more so,that the legislature would have wished to grant immunity to squatters in the New Territories as against the registered owners whowould be liable to pay the rent for the land. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The intention of the legislature in passing the Extension Ordinance was to provide legislation in accordance with what had beenagreed in the Joint Declaration.  That agreement would appear to have had a twofold purpose.  In the first place it was to securethe continuity of land tenure, particularly in the New Territories, so that financial confidence could be maintained based upon acertainty that land tenure would continue.  By the early 1980âs the continued financing of land purchases in the New Territorieshad become something of blind faith since bankers were in severe quandaries as to whether land tenure which expired in 1997 couldbe used as security for loans extending beyond that date.  In the second place the provisions of the Joint Declaration, in this regard,were there to safeguard the revenue source from land for the future government of Hong Kong.  Hence questions of squattersâ rightsdid not come into the policy behind the Extension Ordinance. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Insofar as it might be relevant to consider the policy behind the legislation relating to limitation of actions, that has been variouslydescribed as being that long dormant claims should not be permitted since they had âmore of cruelty than justice in themâ; coupledwith that, defendants might have lost the evidence to disprove a stale claim and finally that persons with good causes of actionshould pursue them with reasonable diligence: see Halsburyâs Laws of Hong Kong, vol. 17 para. 245.004.  Whilst it might be saidthat statutes relating to limitation are beneficial and should be construed liberally and not strictly, that does not, in my view,predispose that construction of a statute relating to ownership of land, but not in any way concerned with limitation, has to befavourable to squatters, who, after all, commenced their occupation as trespassers and thus were wrongdoers.  This would be all themore so since they would be occupying land without paying rent and one of the purposes behind the Extension Ordinance was to enactprovisions which had been agreed on the basis that they would preserve the income of the ultimate landlord i.e. the government.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I would therefore allow this appeal, make an order dismissing the plaintiffâs claim, make a further order granting an injunctionin terms sought in paragraph 2 of the prayer for relief sought in the notice of appeal and make an order for an enquiry as to damagesas sought in paragraph 3 of the prayer for relief in the notice of appeal.

Lam DJ concluded that time did not begin torun again upon the re-grant in April 1988.  He reached that conclusion because he did not think that Lord Nicholls intended to confinethe rationale of <i>Chung Ping Kwan v</i> <i>Lam Island Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 38</a> to a new estate obtained pursuant to an option to renew contained in the original lease and that a new interest granted pursuantto statute could come within the scope of such a rationale provided there was sufficient nexus between the old interest and the newone.  See paragraph 55 of <i>Mutual Luck</i>.  In considering the correctness of this analysis, it is necessary first of all to determine what <i>Lam Island</i> did decide.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  <i>Lam Island</i> had nothing to do with the interpretation of the Extension Ordinance.  Rather, it concerned the interpretation of the New Territories(Renewable Crown Leases) Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/152">Cap. 152</a> (âthe Renewal Ordinanceâ) and its effect on squatters who had been in adverse possessionof land in the New Territories.  Until 1959, crown leases of land in the New Territories were normally for a term of 75 years from1 July 1898 with an option to renew for a further term of 24 years less three days.  Original leases were thus to expire on 30 June1973 and renewed leases on 27 June 1997.  Under the Renewal Ordinance, such leases were deemed to have been renewed for a periodof 24 years less three days from 1 July 1973.  It was held that an option to renew contained in the original lease was an existingproperty right vested in the lessee which was specifically enforceable against the lessor and although upon the exercise of the option,the lessee obtained a new legal estate, that was no more than implementation of a pre-existing contract embodied in the originallease.  Where a squatter has been in adverse possession for the prescribed period, that barred the lessee from asserting againstthe squatter all his rights under the original lease and that included the option to renew because the source of that right was theoriginal lease itself. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In his speech, Lord Nicholls cited with approval the decision of the Full Court of Victoria in <i>Bree v Scott</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281904%29%2029%20VLR%20692" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1904) 29 VLR 692.</a>  In that case, the defendant had been in adverse possession of land since 1878 under such circumstances as to acquire title underthe Statute of Limitations.  A., the plaintiffâs predecessor in title had entered into the land in question under the Land Act1869 sometime prior to 1878 as Crown licensee and subsequently became Crown lessee.  A person who had acquired prior rights by licenceand lease under that Act could acquire the fee upon the performance of her obligations under them.  In 1885, a grant of the landin question issued to A., âin pursuance of the Land Act 1869â.  The plaintiff brought an action to recover the land from thedefendant and the question for determination was whether that claim was time-barred.  The answer depended on whether time ran infavour of the defendant from the time she entered into possession or from the date of the Crown grant.  In holding that time ranfrom the earlier date, AâBeckett J said this (at p. 713):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis inactive licensee and lessee afterwards acquired a legal estate in the fee, not by virtue of any new right unconnected withher prior interest, but by the maturing of a right which had its inception in the licence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It will be seen that the point made here was that ownership of the licence vested in the licensee an inchoate right to call for theCrown grant which right became absolute on the performance of certain obligations.  The acquisition of the licence under the LandAct was therefore crucial: without it, A. would not have been in a position to call for a Crown grant at the later date.  The rightto the Crown grant could thus be said to have had its inception in the licence. </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  In <i>Mutual Luck</i>, Lam DJ framed the crucial issue (at para 56) as âwhether there was such a continuity of interest that the new legal estate â¦could not be regarded as a new right unconnected with the prior interest under the old lease, but should be regarded as the maturingof a right having its seed in the old leaseâ and found (at para 58) âa nexus between the old lease and the new legal estateâin the original grant made in 1918 deemed to be renewed in 1973 without which the plaintiff could not have had the benefit of theextension.  Mr Chan SC described paragraph 58 in Lam DJâs judgment as a âquantum leapâ because it ignored the source of therights possessed by the lessee at the time the squatterâs rights were acquired.  Lam DJ went on to say this (at para 59):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â59. It is true that the Plaintiffâs right under the extension derived from statute rather than an inherent property rights (<i>sic</i>) within the original lease.  But so was the right of the grantee in <strong>Bree v Scott</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281904%29%2029%20VLR%20692" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1904) 29 VLR 692.</a>  In that case, the statute had been enacted when the grantee became a licensee of the land whilst in the present case, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150">Cap. 150</a> wasonly enacted in 1988.  Is this a material distinction?â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>To that question, after referring to certain passages in the judgment of Lord Nicholls in <i>Lam Island</i>, his answer (at para 63) was this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â63. It seems to me on proper reading of the judgment of Lord Nicholls, the material question is not whether the right of the lesseeto the new legal estate stemmed from an option to renew or other right inherently built into the old lease or right bestowed on thelessee when the old lease was granted.  The material question is whether there was a specifically enforceable right in the lesseeto call for the new legal estate by reason of his interest under the old lease when he was already lawfully in possession.  If hehad such a right, Section 9(1) would operate in favour of the lessor and conversely, if such a lessee had slept on his rights, thefact that he acquired a new legal estate could not assist him.  That is precisely why Lord Nicholls said that the legal source ofthe lesseeâs entitlement to his new legal estate could not be ignored.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  But the focus of Lord Nichollsâ judgment was not the existence or otherwise of a specifically enforceable right; rather it wasthe existence of a right that was part and parcel of the original lease or embedded in it and one which gave rise to or matured intothe new legal estate.  That was the crucial feature of both <i>Lam Island</i> and <i>Bree v Scott</i>.  So, had the option to renew in <i>Lam Island</i> not formed part of the original lease but had come about, for example, through a subsequent agreement between the parties, the resultwould have been very different.  In that scenario, the right to renew would not have had its source in the original lease but inthe subsequent agreement.  Adverse possession by a squatter for the prescribed period would bar all rights of the lessee under theoriginal lease but not those arising under the subsequent agreement.  The fact that there happened to be in existence a landlordtenant relationship is insufficient to satisfy the âcontinuity of interest in the landâ contemplated by AâBeckett J in <i>Bree v Scott</i> (at p. 712) which on proper analysis required the original lease to have been the seed of the subsequent fruition of title (see MaddenCJ at 700).  Quite simply, it would not pass the test laid down by Lord Nicholls because, on any footing, the original lease couldnot be said to be the âlegal source of the lesseeâs entitlement to the new estateâ.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In the present case, whether or not the new estate that came into existence took effect through a surrender and regrant or a reversionarylease of an estate coming into possession on the expiration of the renewed lease on 27 June 1997 or the insertion or the engraftingof an additional term into the lease made mandatory by statute, the crucial fact is that the right to a new term (i.e. the extension)was not part and parcel of the original lease or an inherent property right embedded in the original lease; rather, it was a newright that came into existence in April 1988 and conferred by statute upon a lessee of New Territories land who did not opt out ofthe Extension Ordinance under section 5.  I cannot agree that the original lease under consideration could be said to be the âseedâfrom which the extension was the âfruitionâ as appeared to be the view of Lam DJ.  The observations of Madden CJ in <i>Bree v Scott</i> (at p. 708) viz.:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ [the grantee] was a person from the seed of whose license the subsequent Crown grant was the fruitionâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p>when properly understood, do not warrant that conclusion.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  As noted above, at the date the licence in <i>Bree v Scott</i> was acquired, the Land Act 1869 (which conferred on the licensee the right to call for a grant of the fee upon the performance ofcertain obligations) was already in place.  When the licensee acquired the licence, she automatically obtained the right to callfor a Crown grant subject to her fulfilling certain conditions.  When the lease in the present case was granted, the lessee had noinchoate right to the extension available under the Extension Ordinance for the simple reason that that Ordinance did not exist until1988.  Put differently, in the present case, the rights of the lessee under his original lease which were extinguished once the prescribedperiod of adverse possession elapsed did not and could not have encompassed the right to an extension conferred by the ExtensionOrdinance.  It would follow that the term conferred by the Extension Ordinance is a new estate and for the purposes of limitationof action, time would begin to run again from the date of its creation.</p>    <p>Hon Yuen JA:</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I must respectfully differ from the judgments of the Vice-President and Hon Le Pichon JA in this appeal and that of Hon SakhraniJ in <i>Unijet Ltd v Yiu Kwai Hoi</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKC%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKC 90.</a></p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In the present action, Deputy High Court Judge Andrew Cheung (now Hon Andrew Cheung J) found that the 1<sup>st</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantsâ father (â<u>the Lesseeâ</u>) had present interests in the land (within the meaning of s.8 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>) in 1954 or 1968 (for present purposes, it does not matter which year is taken).  He found as a fact that the Plaintiffâsfather (â<u>the Squatterâ</u>) dispossessed the Lessee in 1954 or 1968 and thereafter remained in continuous possession of the land for 20 years or more.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The effect of those findings was that in 1974 or 1988, the Lesseeâs title in the land was, as between himself and the Squatter,extinguished under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>.  This did not of course affect the Lesseeâs interests in the land as between himself and the Government in its capacity as lessor(â<u>the Lessor</u>â).  Nor did this have any effect as between the Squatter and the Lessor, because during the Lesseeâs term of years under thelease, the Lessorâs future interests in the land (within the meaning of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>) had not yet fallen into possession. </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  So much, I believe, is clear on the general principles of the law of limitation.  On what basis, then, could the Lessee recoverthe land from the Squatter by proceedings commenced in 1998?</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr Edward Chan SC for the Lessee submitted that by the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories Leases (Extension) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/150">Cap. 150</a> (â<u>the Extension Ordinanceâ</u>) enacted in 1988, there was a surrender of the lease from the Lessee to the Lessor and an immediate regrant of a lease from the Lessorto the Lessee.  Alternatively, he submitted, there was a grant of a reversionary lease from the Lessor to the Lessee of an estateto come into possession when the existing lease expired on 27 June 1997.  Either way, a new legal estate came into existence underwhich the Lessor (and so, the Lessee claiming through it) could eject the Squatter. </p>    <p class="heading">Surrender and regrant</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I should first set out my understanding of what is meant by a surrender and regrant.  Generally, a lessor and a lessee can agreeto alter the term of years under an existing lease by the lessee surrendering to the lessor the interests he (the lessee) has underthe existing lease, and the lessor giving him a fresh grant of a single term of years from that date for the period as altered expiringon the newly agreed date (which may be earlier or later than the expiry date under the original lease). </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  For the reasons discussed below, I do not consider that the Extension Ordinance operated as a surrender and regrant.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  First, a surrender and regrant has not been expressed, or even been impliedly referred to, in the Ordinance.  In my view, if thelegislature had intended that there should be a surrender and regrant of nearly all government leases in the New Territories (shortterm tenancies and special purpose leases excepted), it could easily have said so.  A search of the Laws of Hong Kong shows thatthe terms âsurrenderâ and âregrantâ are commonly used in our statutes.  They are conspicuously absent from the ExtensionOrdinance.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The Extension Ordinance refers instead to an âextensionâ.  Mr Chan on behalf of the Lessee submitted that an âextensionâof a term of years is not a concept or mechanism known to the common law (such as surrender and regrant).  In my view, this worksagainst the Lessee, not in his favour, as the legislature must be taken to have known that.  Yet it chose not to use the languageof surrender and regrant with which it was familiar, but chose to use the word âextendâ.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In fact, the preamble to the Extension Ordinance tells us the source of its power to âextendâ the term of years - the JointDeclaration of the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China on the Question of HongKong, in particular the Annex dealing with leases of land granted by the British Hong Kong Government: Annex III of the Joint Declaration,paragraph 2.  The Ordinance was devised in and for unique historical circumstances, deriving its authority from the Joint Declarationof the two governments.  It was adopted as part of the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on 1 July 1997 under s.7of the Hong Kong Reunification Ordinance. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  As I see it, there was an imposition by the legislature of an additional provision in the leases, under which lessees were entitledto extend the term of years as against the lessor for the time being: the British Hong Kong Government and then, upon reunification,the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Given the unique historical circumstances in which this Ordinance was devised and the purpose it served, it is in my view neithernecessary nor desirable to seek to justify, or engineer, the extension by reference to the mechanism of surrender and regrant, whichthe legislature had clearly chosen not to employ.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Secondly, even within the common law, âthe implication of surrender and regrant is a fiction based on estoppelâ which is notto be encouraged or extended (<i>Baker v Merckel</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%201%20QB%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] 1 QB 657</a>, 667).  This must especially be so where the grant of the right to extend the term of years was not a consensual act of individualparties (it being settled law that no difference is to be drawn between a lease granted by the Government and a private lease: <i>Hang Wah Chong</i> <i>Investment Co Ltd v Attorney General</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20HKLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 HKLR 336</a>, 341), but was a right conferred by statute made applicable to nearly all leases throughout the New Territories.  In my view, argumentsbased on estoppel have no place in such a situation.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Last but not least, the analysis of the Extension Ordinance as a surrender and immediate regrant breaks down even if the Ordinancewere read merely as a private document agreed between individuals.  It is settled law that on surrender, the original lease mergesin the lessorâs reversion and is extinguished immediately (Megarry &amp; Wade, The Law of Real Property 6<sup>th</sup> ed Â§14-172).  On regrant, a lease is freshly granted for a single term <i>commencing from the time of surrender</i> and expiring at the end of the newly-agreed term of years (see <i>Jenkin R Lewis Ltd v Kerman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20Ch%20477" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 Ch 477</a>, 496 and the discussion of this case in <i>Take Harvest Ltd v Liu</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20AC%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] AC 552</a>, where the Privy Council held at 565H-566F that the court could not invoke the fiction of a new tenancy for a term of just 21 dayswhen the parties never contemplated it).  On Mr Chanâs submission that the Extension Ordinance operated as a surrender and regrant,the surrender would have occurred on the operative date of s.6 (25 April 1988) and a fresh grant given for a term <i>commencing</i> <i>from that date</i> (25 April 1988) to 30 June 2047.  However, the Extension Ordinance does not confer a single term of years from 25 April 1988 to 30June 2047.  Instead s.6 provides that the term is âextended <i>from the date</i> <i>on which it would, apart from this Ordinance, expire...</i>â, thus acknowledging the continuous existence of the original lease.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  I do not think it is necessary to go further.  In my view, the analysis that the Extension Ordinance operated as a surrender andregrant is incorrect for the reasons discussed above.  Accordingly, it is not necessary in this appeal to seek an answer to the interestingproblem posed regarding the validity of a surrender by and regrant to a lessee (whose title has been extinguished by a squatterâsadverse possession) for the purpose of overturning the squatterâs right to possession as against the lessee, and how such a devicemight be invalidated by, amongst other grounds, invoking the tort of conspiracy to injure: see Wade, âLandlord, Tenant and Squatterâ <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%2078%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 78 LQR 541</a> referred to by Lord Nicholls in <i>Chung Ping Kwan v Lam Island Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 38</a>, 47 as a powerful critique of <i>Fairweather v St Marylebone Property Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20AC%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] AC 510</a>, where Lord Denning (at 547) thought that there was âno way of preventingâ the destruction of the squatterâs right to possession.</p>    <p class="heading">Reversionary Lease</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  I then turn to Mr Chanâs submission that the Extension Ordinance operated as the grant of a reversionary lease by the Lessor tothe Lessee. </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Again, I would first set out my understanding of what is meant by a reversionary lease.  (As a matter of completeness, I would note,with much respect to the trial judge, that a reversionary lease is not synonymous with a concurrent lease; a concurrent lease ishowever synonymous with a lease of the reversion: see the discussion on the alignment of leasehold relationships in Gray and Gray,Elements of Land Law, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. 387-391; Megarry &amp; Wade, Â§14-061 esp fn.31, and Â§14-103).</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Say a lease of land for a term of 10 years has been granted by a lessor L to a lessee T.  After say, 3 years of this lease haverun, L can secure a future letting of the land to R to take effect immediately upon the expiry of Tâs lease in 7 years time.  Sucha lease to R is called a reversionary lease. </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  It is no less a reversionary lease if after 3 years of Tâs lease have run, L agrees to lease the land to T to take effect uponthe expiry of his present term (<i>Jenkin R Lewis v Kerman</i>, 496).  L is free to decide if he wishes to grant a reversionary lease to R or to T (or not at all).  By contrast, if L is undera specifically enforceable obligation under the lease to let the land to T upon the expiry of his present term for a further periodof time at Tâs option, what T has is not a reversionary lease but a lease with a right to renew for a further term of years. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  As discussed above, the Extension Ordinance gave every existing lessee of the relevant leases a right to extend the lease from itsexpiry date under the existing lease to 30 June 2047: sections 5 and 6.  The lessee could opt-out of the extension by registeringa memorandum within the 2 month period from 26 February 1988 to 25 April 1988: section 5.  However the lessor (and at risk of repeatingmyself, the Government is to be treated in its lease dealings as a private landlord) could <i>not</i> opt-out of the extension.  It had no freedom to choose whether to let the land upon the expiry of the present term of years to theexisting lessee or to another (perhaps better) lessee.  Therefore, in my view, the analysis that the Extension Ordinance operatedas a reversionary lease is also incorrect. </p>    <p class="heading">Right of renewal conferred by statute</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  As I see it, by the Extension Ordinance, the legislature wrote into the existing leases an additional right of renewal, under whichthe existing lessees were given the right to enforce a further term of years against the lessor for the time being, i.e. the BritishHong Kong Government and then the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  It is interesting to note in this regardthat the Chinese term â<span>çºæ</span>â is used for both ârenewalâ in the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/152" class="autolink_findacts">New Territories (Renewable Government Leases) Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/152">Cap.152</a> and for âextensionâ in the Extension Ordinance.  The fact that the option to renew was deemed by statute to be exercisedunless a lessee gave notice to opt-out within the given period makes no difference to the nature of the right.</p>    <p class="heading">Effect on squattersâ rights against dispossessed lessees</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  On this analysis, does the Extension Ordinance affect a squatterâs rights as against a lessee whose title he had extinguishedunder s.17 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>?

In the present case, the legislature conferredan additional right of renewal in the lease.  I do not see anything in the authorities which dictates that the âpre-existing rightto the [new] estateâ must be one which had been in the lease from Day 1.  In my view, the crucial point is that the seed of thenew legal estate from 1997 to 2047 was planted <i>as part of the lesseeâs interest in the land under the existing lease during its currency. </i> The question is simply whether the new estate was or was not a ânew right unconnected with [the lesseeâs] prior interestâ aslessee under the original lease (<i>Bree v Scott</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281904%29%2029%20VLR%20692" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1904) 29 VLR 692</a>, 713).  In my view, the new estate from 1997 to 2047 was clearly connected with the lesseeâs prior interest, because the rightto it had been conferred on him as part of his bundle of rights as lessee under the original lease and only by virtue of that interest.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  On this analysis, the rationale of the Privy Councilâs decision in <i>Chung v Lam Island,</i> regarding a squatterâs position where the lessee has a new lease pursuant to a right of renewal, is directly applicable.  LordNicholls held (48 D-F) that the lessor had no right to eject the squatter even at the expiry of the original term.  That was becausethe lessee had a specifically enforceable right under the original lease (in our case, imposed on the lessor by statute) which hecould enforce against the lessor.  The lessor was consequently not entitled to enter into possession of the land at the expiry ofthe original term, because the pre-existing right of the lessee to possession under the renewal stood in the lessorâs way.  Thelessor therefore had no right to eject the squatter.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Further, as Lord Nicholls explained (49G-H), the lesseeâs claim in right of the new lease was not a claim to an estate or interestin reversion under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a> (1), because the lesseeâs right to the new lease was a right he already had as lessee.  However, as the lessee had slept on hisrights <i>vis-a-vis</i> the squatter, the new legal estate does not enable him to eject the squatter, because he acquired that new legal estate by virtueonly of a pre-existing right included (in our case, by statute) in the lease, his title to which has been extinguished as againstthe squatter (48 F-H). </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In my view, that result accords not only with the recognised policy of the limitation legislation, but also with the intention expressedin the Joint Declaration and the ensuing legislation that all rights in property (albeit the somewhat tenuous rights of squattersas against dispossessed lessees) should continue to be recognised and protected, or at least not abrogated without clear wording,of which there is none in any of the legislation referred to this court.  As with the Renewal Ordinance, the Extension Ordinanceleaves the squatter in no better and no worse position.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>    <p>Hon Rogers VP:</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  There will therefore be an order as set out in paragraph 22 above.</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Anthony Rogers)</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Doreen Le Pichon)</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Maria Yuen)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Vice-President</td>            <td width="34%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Andrew Mak, instructed by Messrs Adrian Yeung &amp; Cheng, for the Plaintiff/Respondent</p>        <p>Mr Edward Chan SC and Ms Anita Ma, instructed by Messrs Yeung &amp; Chan, for the Defendants/Appellants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <appeal>Appeal allowed: see FACV7/2005 dated 5 January 2006</appeal>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2004/348.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
