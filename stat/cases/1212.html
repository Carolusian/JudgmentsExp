I will therefore only summarize those facts which are necessary for anunderstanding of the grounds of appeal and this judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiff was a client of the Defendant, the sole proprietor of a solicitorâs firm.  To avoid confusion with the parties inanother action with which this action is closely connected, I will refer to the Plaintiff in this action as "the Client" and theDefendant as "the Solicitor".</p>    <p class="heading">"Promissory Note"</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  A Mr Chung Shau Ching (â<u>Mr Chung</u>â) used to work for the Client and the two had become friends with the Client helping out Mr Chung financially. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 1 March 1989, Mr Chung signed a document (which has been referred to as â<u>the Promissory Note</u>â) acknowledging that he had borrowed from the Client a sum of $700,000 which he undertook to repay on demand and that until repaymentin full, he would pay interest at 9% p.a., the interest to be offset by rentals to be received from a company in England, where MrChung had moved.</p>    <p class="heading">Events <i>in 1992</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In February 1992, Mr Chung stopped making repayments.  This led to demands from the Clientâs solicitors in England.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 8 August 1992, Mr Chung wrote to the Clientâs solicitors in England denying that he owed the Client any money.  He requiredthe Client to list the payments and interest claimed and said that if any balance was owing he would settle the outstanding amountas soon as possible.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 23 September 1992, the Clientâs solicitors in England sent a letter of demand to Mr Chung.  No payment was forthcoming.</p>    <p class="heading">Consulting the Solicitor</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In May 1998, the Client consulted the Solicitor with a view to suing Mr Chung for the money owed under the Promissory Note. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Shortly afterwards, on 11 May 1998 Verdi Kwan, an assistant solicitor then in the Solicitorâs employ, perused the documents providedby the Client (including those I have referred to in paras. 6, 8 and 9) and wrote a note to the Solicitor. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In this note, Mr Kwan referred to the document of 1 March 1989 as a Promissory Note, but concluded that because the sum was repayableon demand, the action was not yet time-barred as the  demand had been made only in September 1992.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It is now conceded that that conclusion was wrong as the law is well-established that with regard to promissory notes payable ondemand, time under the statute of limitations runs from the making of the note (1 March 1989) and not from the date of demand (23September 1992).</p>    <p class="heading">Issue of Writ and Statement of Claim <i>against Chung</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 26 May 1998, the Solicitor issued a writ against Mr Chung for the sum of $700,000 together with interest at 9% p.a. from 1 March1989 and costs.  He did not advise the Client of the time bar defence.  </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Statement of Claim contained only one cause of action - a claim on a promissory note.</p>    <p class="heading">Chungâs response</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr Chung was served in England.  He instructed solicitors in England  but not in Hong Kong.  The solicitors in England purportedto acknowledge service in Hong Kong and filed a Defence admitting that Mr Chung had signed the Promissory Note but that he had repaid$780,000 to the Client in 1991.  The Defence did <i>not</i> plead the time bar. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The solicitors in England also purported to take part in the proceedings through correspondence.  The Solicitor raised no objectionto that, nor apparently did the masters who gave directions in respect of the proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">Default judgment</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Mr Chung did not comply with some of those directions, as a result of which default judgment was given against him on 27 May 1999.</p>    <p class="heading">Chungâs application to set aside judgment, raising the time bar</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  About a year later in May 2000, Mr Chung applied to set aside the default  judgment.  In support of his application, he raised thetime bar as a defence.</p>    <p class="heading">Counselâs advice</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The Solicitor advised the Client to instruct counsel.  Mr Leo Remedios was instructed.  Mr Remedios advised that there was a goodchance of resisting Mr Chungâs application to set aside the default judgment on the ground that his failure to comply with directionshad been contumelious, but he also advised that the time bar would be a complete defence to the Clientâs claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Opposing the application to set aside default judgment</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The Client opposed Mr Chungâs application to set aside the default judgment.  It should be noted that the Solicitor did not advisethe Client of the alternative option of conceding Mr Chungâs application and recovering the costs he (the Client) had expendedin the litigation from the Solicitor himself.</p>    <p class="heading">Result of application to set aside default judgment</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Clientâs opposition was successful before the Registrar and (on Mr Chungâs appeal) before Tong J. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  However on 15 June 2001, this court (Rogers V-P and Le Pichon JA) allowed the appeal and set aside the default judgment.   The Clientwas ordered to bear the costs before Tong J and before the Court of Appeal. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  An application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal was lodged on behalf of the Client.  It was dismissed by the Courtof Appeal on 18 September 2001 and by the Court of Final Appeal on 24 December 2001 with costs to be paid by the Client.  In themeantime, further costs had also been incurred in instructing a number of other counsel for advice and appearances in court.  Atno stage did the Solicitor advise the Client that an alternative option was to discontinue the proceedings against Mr Chung and torecover the wasted expenses from him (the Solicitor).</p>    <p class="heading">Attempt to amend claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  By then it had become obvious that Mr Chungâs next step would be to apply to strike out the claim on the time-bar ground.  TheSolicitor approached yet some other counsel, including Mr Jose-Antonio Maurellet. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  On 18 May 2002, Mr Maurellet advised that it was arguable that the document hitherto referred to as the Promissory Note did notconstitute a promissory note, but could be âconstrued as a loan contract evidenced by the Documentâ.  In this respect, the judgefound that no prior attempt had been made by the Solicitor to explore the possibility of including a cause of action based on anunderlying loan contract (para. 37).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  On 12 July 2002, as forewarned, Mr Chung issued a summons to strike out the claim on the ground that it was time-barred. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  On 25 July 2002, the Solicitor issued on behalf of the Client a summons for leave to amend the claim deleting all references toa promissory note and pleading instead that commencing 1988, there had been a number of loans from the Client to Mr Chung, but thatthere was an oral agreement (â<u>the oral agreement</u>â) varying the previous loan agreements to the effect that Mr Chung was liable to repay the sum of $700,000 to the Client but onlyon demand, which demand was later made on 23 September 1992.  The document of 1 March 1989 hitherto referred to as the PromissoryNote was now pleaded as an acknowledgment that by that date, Mr Chung had borrowed $700,000 from the Client.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  On 17 October 2002, the master refused leave to amend and struck out the Clientâs claim.  A Notice of Appeal was filed on behalfof the Client.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  However on 19 November 2002, Mr Jat Sew-tong SC was consulted by the Client and he advised that the application for leave to amendwas bound to fail.  Having considered the draft Amended Statement of Claim, I agree with the view taken by Mr Jat, the master andthe judge that the proposed amendment did not meet the demands of Order 20 rule 5(5). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Jat also advised the Client that he had a cause of action against the Solicitor for negligence in having failed to advise thatthe action on the Promissory Note had been time-barred when the writ was issued.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Shortly after receiving Mr Jatâs written advice, the Client changed solicitors, discontinued the proceedings against Mr Chungand issued the writ in the present action against the Solicitor.</p>    <p class="heading">Trial</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  At the trial, the Client and the Solicitor, amongst others, gave evidence.  In a detailed judgment, the judge found that the claimwas time-barred (paras.33-35) and that the Solicitor had been negligent in failing to so advise the Client (paras.36-40).  The judgealso held that the proposed amendment to plead an oral agreement for a loan payable on demand was doomed to failure for non-compliancewith Order 20 rule 5(5). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The judge also found as a fact that had the Client been advised that  the time bar was available to Mr Chung as a defence, he wouldnot have instituted the proceedings at all (paras.56-57), and that the steps taken by the Client after being made aware of the time-bar- first in July 2000 (in opposing Mr Chungâs application to set aside default judgment) and then in July 2002 (in applying to amendthe claim) - were reasonable attempts made to extricate himself from a difficulty that he had been placed in due to the Solicitorâsnegligent advice (para.64) and that the Clientâs position was âakinâ to that of a would-be plaintiff under a duty to mitigateloss (para. 65).</p>    <p class="heading">Appeal</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The Solicitor appealed.  A number of grounds were set out in the Notice of Appeal but all but one (ground 6) were abandoned at orbefore the hearing of the appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On appeal, Sir John Swaine SC, leading counsel for the Solicitor, conceded that the Solicitor was liable for part of the costs expendedby the Client but he argued that once the Client became aware of the time-bar when he received Mr Remediosâ advice on the pointin July 2000, his decision to carry on with the proceedings (and the costs incurred as a result) were not attributable to the Solicitorâsnegligence.  It was argued that Mr Remediosâ advice constituted a <i>novus actus interveniens</i>, breaking the chain of causation before and after that advice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  It was argued that accordingly the Solicitor should only be liable for the costs incurred prior to that date (which Sir John Swainecalled Stage I) but not those incurred in opposing the application to set aside (which was called Stage II) or those incurred afterthe application to set aside was finally determined by the Court of Final Appealâs refusal to grant leave to appeal including thecosts incurred for the application for leave to amend the claim (which was called Stage III).   </p>    <p class="heading">Discussion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  With respect, I do not agree with that analysis.  It is clear that the âbut forâ test of factual causation does not of itselfnecessarily lead to liability and I do not think the judge made that the basis of his finding of liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The issue is did counselâs advice on time-bar in July 2000 break the chain of causation between the negligent act (the adviceto start the action on the basis that it was not time-barred) and the damage (costs expended in that action)? </p>    <p class="heading">Principles of novus actus interveniens</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  It may be helpful to go back to first principles.  As the learned editors of Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts put it, to break thechain of causation, the <i>novus actus</i> must constitute an event of such impact that it âobliteratesâ the wrongdoing of the defendant (Â§2-78).  There are two broadapproaches - the causation approach and the fault (or foreseeability) approach (Â§2-79). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The causation approach asks whether the intervening act was reasonable in the circumstances (with the courts tending to ask if theintervening act was voluntary or was a forced response).  The less voluntary the act, or to put it the other way, the more forcedthe response, the more reasonable it was, and hence the less it eclipsed the defendantâs wrongdoing.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The fault (or foreseeability) approach asks whether the intervening act was foreseeable.  The nature of the defendantâs duty isrelevant because if the duty was to prevent the very intervention that occurred, he cannot complain that the intervention broke thecausal link.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Whichever approach is applied to the present case, I take the view that the learned judge was clearly correct in finding that therewas no break in the chain of causation.        </p>    <p class="heading">Clientâs reasonable responses were forced by Solicitorâs negligent advice</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I deal first with the causation approach.  It must first be noted that this was a case where the Solicitor had given negligent adviceto institute proceedings, not merely negligently provided information.  In <i>Banque Bruxelles S.A. v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd</i> (on appeal, <i>South Australia Asset Management Corporation v York Montague and others</i>)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 191</a>, Lord Hoffmann held (214 E-F):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe principle thus stated distinguishes between a duty to <i>provide information</i> for the purpose of enabling someone else to decide upon a course of action and a duty to <i>advise</i> someone as to what course of action he should take.  If the duty is to advise whether or not a course of action should be taken,the adviser must take reasonable care to consider all the potential consequences of that course of action.  If he is negligent, hewill therefore be responsible for all the foreseeable loss which is a consequence of that course of action having been taken.â  <i> </i>  </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Having embarked on the proceedings due to the Solicitorâs negligent advice, the Client was forced to respond when Mr Chung tooksteps in those proceedings, first to set aside the default judgment (Stage II) and then to strike out the proceedings (Stage III). Sir John Swaine referred to those steps as âsatellite litigationâ.  With respect, I do not think that label is appropriate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  When a litigant starts an action, it is for the purpose of obtaining judgment.  If default judgment is obtained, defending it becomesthe very core of the litigation.  If the default judgment were set aside and the very existence of the action is then threatenedby a strike-out application, then salvaging the viability of the action becomes vital.  I do not see how it can be said that thesesteps constituted satellite litigation in the sense suggested. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In my view, where the negligent act of a solicitor is the giving of advice leading to the instituting of proceedings, the defenceof a default judgment obtained in those proceedings (Stage II) and the protection of the very existence of the action (Stage III)are responses most certainly forced upon the client by the negligent advice (assuming of course that those responses are reasonable). Here it was the Solicitorâs negligent advice that placed the Client in that position and to adopt Lord Hoffmannâs words in <i>Banque Bruxelles</i>, the Clientâs âreasonable attempt to cope with the consequences of the [Solicitorâs] breach of duty does not negative the causalconnection between that breach of duty and the ultimate lossâ (219A).   The costs involved in proffering those responses forcedupon the Client were thus naturally causally related to the Solicitorâs advice to commence those proceedings and are damages directlyand naturally flowing from his breach of duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  It is accepted on behalf of the Solicitor that it was reasonable for the Client to have taken the steps he did, first to defendthe judgment and then to seek to amend the claim so as to resist the strike-out.  That is clearly correct. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In any event I do not see how it could lie in the Solicitorâs mouth to say that those steps were unreasonable when, despite beingin a conflicted position, he remained the Clientâs legal advisor throughout, advising him to take those steps (<i>cf. Lloyds and Scottish Finance Ltd v Modern Cars and Caravans (Kingston) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%201%20QB%20765" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 1 QB 765</a>, 783) and <i>not</i> advising him that there was an alternative option - that of conceding Mr Chungâs applications, discontinuing the proceedings andrecovering the costs he (the Client) had expended in the litigation from the Solicitor himself.  Nor was there any evidence thatthe Solicitor cautioned the Client against incurring further costs in seeking to take the setting-aside application to the Courtof Final Appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  <i>If</i> the Solicitor had advised the Client that he had the alternative option of discontinuing the proceedings and recovering costs fromhimself, and the Client had nevertheless decided to proceed with the steps he took, then there may be an argument that the Clienthad failed to mitigate his loss.  But there was no advice from the Solicitor on the alternative option.  Therefore no question oftrue mitigation arises. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  On the causation approach therefore, when the judge said that âMr Li had to extricate himself from a difficult position that hehad been placed in due to bad advice from HHLâ (para. 64), he was clearly correct to hold that the Client was forced to respondbecause the Solicitorâs negligent advice had led him to institute proceedings which were being imperilled, and that it was reasonablefor the Client to have sought to oppose Mr Chungâs application in the light of advice from counsel (Mr Remedios for Stage II -para. 63, and Mr K.M. Chong, Mr Maurellet and Mr Lawrence Ng for Stage III - para. 73).  For those reasons, the judge did not acceptthe argument of <i>novus actus interveniens</i> whether in respect of Stage II (para. 69) or Stage III (para. 72).  </p>    <p class="heading">Attempts to resist application to set aside default judgment and strike-out were reasonably foreseeable</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  As for the fault (or foreseeability) approach, when proceedings are instituted outside the limitation period, then it must be reasonablyforeseeable that there is a risk that the other party would come to court to set them aside - as Mr Chung did, albeit belatedly. When that occurs, then it must also be reasonably foreseeable that the client would act on legal advice to resist his proceedingsbeing set aside - as the Client did, albeit unsuccessfully.  The intervening acts in this case are therefore clearly reasonably foreseeableconsequences once the proceedings were instituted on the Solicitorâs negligent advice.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The Solicitor has not suggested that the Clientâs attempts to defend his judgment and to resist the strike-out were irresponsibleactions.  On the evidence, he could not do so.  As I have discussed previously, the Solicitor remained the Clientâs legal adviserthroughout and actively sought the advice of a number of counsel in an effort to make the proceedings viable.  In contrast, thereis no evidence that he ever attempted to explain to the Client the pros and cons of the alternative option of laying down arms andlooking to himself for recovery of wasted expenses. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  To adopt the analogy the Client used at trial, it may be that the Client was a willing and enthusiastic passenger, but even as anintelligent layman, he was not qualified to navigate.  The Solicitor was throughout âthe captain of the shipâ, trying to reacha destination that was not reachable, but not advising the passenger of the option of returning to shore with his fare refunded. When eventually Mr Jat informed the Client of that option in November 2002, he accepted it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In the circumstances, I agree with the learned judge that there was no break in the chain of causation, whether at Stage II or atStage III.  I should add however that I cannot with respect agree with the judge when he held that the Solicitorâs failure to informthe Client of the futility of the proposed amendment was another instance of the Solicitorâs lack of care in advising the Client(para. 73).  In my view, that criticism was a little harsh of a solicitor when Mr Maurellet had advised (para. 23) that Order 20rule 5(5) would not be an impediment to the proposed amendment and Mr Ng was (at least initially) of the same opinion.  But in anyevent, the Solicitor would have been liable for Stage III as there was no break in the chain of causation. </p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with an order nisi that the costs of the appeal be paid by the Defendant (the Appellant)to the Plaintiff (the Respondent).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p><b>Hon.
