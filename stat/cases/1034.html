He became a director with Mid-Green since its incorporation in 1980. Mid-Green operateda restaurant business at the said Premises under a lease entered into with Ching Hing on 19th May, 1980. The business was not satisfactoryand Mid-Green decided to offer the restaurant for sale. Sea Bead was introduced by his co-director Cheng Kiu. After several discussions,the entire restaurant including decorations, tools of trade and equipments were sold at $1.23 million. When Man Nin first startedin 1980, Mid-Green spent a total of roughly $1.1 million to decorate the restaurant and to pay for its various equipments. He referredto the 7 items listed in the Schedule to the Agreement and pointed out that they comprised only part of the subject matters sold.He accepted that those 7 items would amount approximately to between $400,000 and $500,000. Before the sale to Sea Bead it was "reflected"to Ching Hing that business of the restaurant was not good and Mid-Green intended to sell the business. Mid-Green sought Ching Hing'sconsent. With Ching Hing's consent, Mid-Green located the intended purchasers. One of Mid-Green's shareholders promised to introduceSea Bead to Ching Hing and the lease between Ching Hing and Sea Bead was negotiated exclusively between them. After signing the agreementSea Bead paid 29 instalments of $9,000 each. That ceased in March 1986 with 41 instalments unpaid. He denied any misrepresentationbeing made by Mr. Wong at the signing of the agreement. He pointed out that Mr. Wong was only the Secretary of the company and wasin no position to make the alleged representation. In cross-examination he did not accept that Mid-Green was controlled by the IpFamily. He pointed out that there were two sides, each holding 50% of the shares of Mid-Green. He admitted that in September 1983,Mid-Green managed restaurants in properties owned by Ching Hing. Despite being pressed, he maintained that he did not know that ChingHing was controlled by the Ip Family. He indicated that it was Cheng Kiu who introduced Sea Bead to the deal. After the introduction,Mr. Lee was the main negotiator on behalf of Mid-Green. He denied that the first meeting took place at Man Nin. He further deniedthat he or Mr. Lee named $900,000 as their first opening price. He accepted that the rental under the lease between Ching Hing andMid-Green was very cheap. He cannot remember telling the Defendants that they had a special relationship with Ching Hing and couldobtain favourable terms for Sea Bead. He denied that no introduction was ever made of Ching Hing to the Defendants. He thought thatsuch introduction should have taken place after the deal was struck between Sea Bead and Mid-Green. He denied that Mr. Lee actedas assistant to Roseanna Ip but accepted that Mr. Lee worked in the past for Wong Miu Shim. He accepted that without Mid-Green'ssurrender of its lease to Ching Hing, Sea Bead would not be able to obtain a lease from Ching Hing. He denied that he asked for $9,000per month being rent to Mid-Green. He further denied that Ching Hing did not know about $9,000 as those payments were clearly statedin Mid-Green's ledger. He had a vague recollection of going to Messrs. Lo Wing Sum &amp; Co., solicitors acting for the Defendantsin relation to the purchase of the restaurant. He denied knowledge that Lo Wing Sum became upset when told that $600,000 was considerationfor the purchase and $9,000 was payment to Mid-Green. He could not remember whether Roseanna Ip was present at Directors' Meetingof Mid-Green to discuss sale of the business but he pointed out that Roseanna Ip was not there for most of the time. He denied thatthe sum of $9,000 was discussed as monthly payment to Mid-Green or that the same should have been rental payable to Ching Hing.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The second witness for the Plaintiff was Mr. Wong He was the Company Secretary of Mid-Green since its incorporation. He was presentwhen the Agreement of 6th September, 1983 was signed at Messrs. Leonard Heung &amp; Co. When asked whether there was any conversationwith Lau SHing and Chung Yat Fai at the signing of the agreement he said he "didn't say anything". In cross-examination he acceptedthat Wong Miu Shim was the major shareholder of Mid-Green. Wong Miu Shim would chair meetings of the company prior to her death on2nd May, 1981. After her death, Roseanna Ip would chair the meetings. He recalled that Mid-Green had a meeting to discuss the saleof Man Nin prior to signing of the agreement at Messrs. Leonard Heung's office on 6th September, 1983. He accepted that $600,000was mentioned at that meeting as consideration not only for sale of the restaurant but for sale of its tool of trade. The $600,000would include "Everything. Decoration. Tools of trade. Everything." He was not aware of the circumstances whereby Messrs. LeonardHeung &amp; Co. acted for both the vendors and the purchasers. At Messrs. Leonard Heung's office, the Agreement was explained toLau SHing and Chung Yat Fai. He denied that he told the two Defendants that "its mere formality. Nothing would result." He admittedthat he knew that Ching Hing belonged to Wong Min Shim. He had no idea whether the lease between Ching Hing and Sea Bead was arrangedby Roseanna Ip. He had no idea whether the Defendants were introduced to Ching Hing. He denied that Mid-Green obtained a lease fromChing Hing for Sea Bead. In re-examination he accepted that the sum of $9,000 was mentioned at the Directors' meeting of Mid-Green.When asked what that sum was for, he indicated that the amount of $9,000 was "recorded as income of the company". On that answerbeing given, the Plaintiffs sought to adduce in reply minutes of the meetings of Mid-Green. Mr. Wong then further amplified his statementthat $9,000 was income to Mid-Green. He said he meant "The monies were paid by instalments". He was then further cross-examined onthe minutes. He pointed out that Roseanna Ip was not present at Mid-Green's meeting resolving the sale of Man Nin. Her signatureon the minutes was appended "belatedly" after her return from abroad. Roseanna Ip had by then tendered her resignation by letteras Chairman of Mid-Green. That resignation, according to the written minutes of an extra-ordinary general meeting of Mid-Green, wasaccepted at that meeting.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> For the Defence, the 2nd Defendant Chung Yat Fat ["Mr. Chung") gave evidence. He said he met Cheng Kiu in 1983 and was told thatthe bosses of Man Nin did not have the heart to run that restaurant. He was told by Cheng Kiu that the rent was cheap with many floorsand location was good. During negotiations, a sum of $900,000 was mentioned as the consideration. He was told that Ching Hing wasthe Landlord of the premises. He was aware of Ching Hing in the restaurant trade. He was told by Mr. Lee that he was very familiarwith Ching Hing and with Roseanna Ip in particular. The $900,000 was to include decorations, tools of trade, transfer of lease andlicence. He was further told that the lease between Ching Hing and Mid-Green had 70 months to go. Both sides eventually agreed toa price of $600,000 for transfer of furnitures etc. The Man Nin side then pointed out that as the lease was at cheap rent and ifMan Nin did not get any benefit it would be unfair to let Sea Bead have a lease at low rent. It was pointed out that Mid-Green wouldbe willing to transfer the lease to Sea Bead if a sum of $9,000 per month be paid as rent. Mr. Lee expressly said that Ching Hingshould not know about $9,000. Mr. Man and Cheng Kiu were also present. After these terms were agreed, he instructed solicitor Mr.Lo Wing Sum to represent his side. Messrs. Leonard K.L. Heung &amp; Co. was instructed by Mid-Green and was responsible for draftingthe agreement. A meeting took place at the office of Mr. Lo Wing Sum. Mr. Lee and Mr. Man were present at that meeting. Mr. Lo WingSum was told the terms of the agreement and said that he would not process that kind of agreement for sale. Mr. Lo Wing Sum explainedthat there was an element of fraud in that kind of agreement. The objectionable element was the sum of $9,000 as rent. Mr. Lo WingSum advised Sea Bead not to carry on with it. Mr. Man then commented that Mr. Lo Wing Sum was an upright person. After this meeting,Mr. Lee suggested that Messrs. Leonard Heung &amp; Co. be appointed to represent Sea Bead as well. The Agreement was explained bystaff of Mr. Heung. Mr. Ching found the guarantee not reasonable. Mr. Lee, Mr. Man and Mr. Wong explained that its only a formalityand that if everything were to be carried out properly no firm of solicitors would be willing to process the Agreement. After signingthe 6th September, 1983 Agreement, he was not introduced to Ching Hing despite the promise of Mr. Lee during negotiations. Mr. Leeand Mr. Man accompanied him to Messrs. Gallant Y.T. Ho &amp; Co. to sign the lease with Ching Hing. Mr. Lee negotiated those termswith Ching Hing. Ching Hing (through Henrietta Ip and Marion Ip) executed the tenancy on a separate occasion. After taking over thepremises from Man Nin, instead of a seafood restaurant, Sea Bead operated a restaurant selling snacks and noodles in the name of"Fu Kai Shiu Chiu." The decorations of Man Nin were not useful to Fu Kai Shiu Chiu. In 1986, he wanted to close down his business.He went to see Henrietta Ip of Ching Hing. Henrietta Ip found out about the $9,000 and said it was unreasonable for the middlemanto get a benefit out of rents when Sea Bead rented the premises from Ching Hing. In cross-examination, he pointed out that gettinga benefit out of rent was one matter and the consideration of $600,000 was another matter. Mid-Green indicated that since they wereable to get a lease at low rent Mid-Green ought to get some benefit. Mid-Green insisted that the sum of $9,000 per month should bedescribed as part of the consideration for taking over the business of Man Nin. He repeated that Mr. Lo Wing Sum advised that therewas fraud involved in the said Agreement. Despite his understanding that there was a fraud, he eventually signed the said Agreement.He refused to accept the suggestion that Sea Bead was not in a position in 1983 to pay $1.23 million in one go.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The Defence tendered the 1st Defendant for cross-examination. Mr. Lin declined that offer on behalf of Mid-Green.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><u>THE FINDINGS</u> :-</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I have no hestitation in preferring the evidence of Mr. Chung to the evidence of Mr. Man. Mr. Man was particularly evasive in relationto his knowledge of the status of Ching Hing and his participation at the office of Messrs. Lo Wing Sum &amp; Co. As far as Mr. Wongis concerned, I find his evidence as a whole more favourable to the Defendants than to Mid-Green.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I hold that the sum of $630,000 was wholly unrelated to the decorations, furnitures, fixtures and chattels of Mid-Green at the saidPremises. Mr. Man himself admitted that Mid-Green spent only $1.1 million in decorating Man Nin at the inception of the Mid-GreenTenancy in May 1980. 3 years elapsed since then. Furthermore, Mr. Wong also admitted, in cross-examination that the sum of $9,000constituted income of Mid-Green. I am not persuaded by the attempts in re-examination to mitigate the damage arising from this pieceof Mr. Wong's evidence.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> I accept Mr. Chung evidence that Mid-Green through Mr. Lee and Mr. Man sought to obtain a benefit for Mid-Green wholly unrelatedto the decorations, furnitures and fixtures of Man Nin. Mid-Green was to secure a tenancy from Ching Hing to Sea Bead. Vis-a-visChing Hing, Mid-Green was to surrender the Mid-Green Tenancy so as to facilitate the grant of the Sea Bead Tenancy. As part of theconsideration for the aforesaid, Sea Bead was to pay Mid-Green $9,000 per month. As laymen the parties used the term "rental" asthe monthly payments were tied to the residue of the Mid-Green Tenancy. Sea Bead was notionally treated by them as the sub-tenantof Mid-Green.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> By virtue of the true nature of such monthly payments and the role of Roseanna Ip in Mid-Green, it was vital for Mid-Green to concealthe true purpose of such payment. As far as Ching Hing was concerned, Mid-Green had voluntarily surrendered its tenancy derivingthereafter no benefit therefrom. Mr. Wong admitted that Roseanna Ip signed the two minutes of 30th July, 1983 belatedly. From theminutes, she would not be able to detact that Mid-Green was going to obtain financial benefits arising from the surrender which benefitswere wholly unrelated to the decorations of Man Nin.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I further find that the parties explained the true bargain to solicitor Mr. Lo Wing Sum. I accept what Mr. Chung said in relationto the reaction of Mr. Lo Wing Sum. He was of the view that the scheme was a dishonest one. The dishonesty comprised of representingto Ching Hing that save for sale of the decorations, furnitures and fixtures, there was a clean break by Mid-Green when in truthMid-Green was deriving additional benefits arising from the grant of the Sea Bead Tenancy.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Very little authority was cited to me on the issue of illegality. Mr. Cheng for the Defendants cited to me Chitty on Contracts [25thEdition] and Cheshire &amp; Fifoot Law of Contract [11th Edition]. Page 346 of Cheshire &amp; Fifoot states .</p>    <table border="0" width="88%">        <tr>            <td width="8%"></td>            <td width="76%" style="text-align:center">                <p align="left" class="quote">"... an agreement is illegal and void if its object, direct or indirect, is the commission of a crime or a tort. ...

He was content to confine himselfin arguing that on the facts I should be slow to make any finding that the said Agreement is illegal with the object of deceivingChing Hing. Mr. Lin made no serious challenge to Mr. Cheng's contention that if the agreement was made with the object of deceivingChing Hing, the Court should not then enforce the Guarantee. I was rightly reminded by Mr. Lin that such finding of fact is a seriousmatter. I have also borne in mind the somewhat convoluted pleadings between the parties. However Mr. Lin himself drew my attentionto page 375 of Cheshire s Fifoot which reads :</p>    <table border="0" width="88%">        <tr>            <td width="7%"></td>            <td width="77%" style="text-align:center">                <p align="left" class="quote">"The rules of evidence that governed the proof of illegality, whether the contract is illegal by statute or at common law, may besummarised as follows: Firstly, when the contract is ex facie illegal, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact and refuses toenforce the contract, even though its illegality has not been pleaded by the Defendant. Secondly, when the contract is ex facie lawful,evidence of external circumstances showing that it is in fact illegal will not be admitted unless those circumstances have been pleaded.Thirdly, when the contract is ex facie lawful, but facts came to light in the course of the trial tending to show that it has anillegal purpose, the Court takes judicial notice of the illegality notwithstanding that these facts have not been pleaded. It mustbe clear that all the relevant circumstances are before the Court."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Having warned myself the implications of making such findings, I am of the clear view that the true agreement between Mid-Green andSea Bead was to deceive Ching Hing in the manner as I outlined above. I find the matter sufficiently pleaded in the pleadings andadequately put to witnesses for Mid-Green. Even if I be wrong on this, I rely on the passage cited to me by Mr. Lin quoted above.Mr. Lin has not drawn my attention to any other circumstances which might be of relevance as to prevent me from making the aforesaidfindings.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> For these reasons, I refuse to enforce the said Agreement which the Guarantee forms part. I therefore dismiss the Plaintiff's claim.As far as the question of costs is concerned, Mr. Chung himself candidly admitted that he was fully aware of the fraud involved.The Defendants participated in the illegality. I would exercise my discretion to deprive the Defendants of the costs of these proceedingsto signify the Court's disapproval of such participation. I therefore make an order nisi that there be no order as to costs in relationto this Action. In the absence of any application to argue before me the question of costs within 7 days from the date of this Judgment,such order for costs be made absolute.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Kenny C.P.
