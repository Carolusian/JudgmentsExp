This case originally was intituled HCA 1806 of 2007, but was transferred into the Commercial Courtby consent.  In order to place this application into context, I should perhaps say a few words about the background to this claimas now mounted in this court.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The plaintiff contends that in May 2007 a binding contract was concluded between itself and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant wherein the plaintiff agreed to sell and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to buy a total of 360,000 metric tones of scrap metal consisting of used rails.  The rails were to be delivered in 12 monthlyconsignments, each consignment comprising 30,000 metric tonnes; the price of the rails was agreed at US$218 per metric tonne, thusmaking the total contract price US$78,480,000.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Under this contract the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was required to provide an unconditional Standby Letter of Credit (âthe standby creditâ) to cover the value of 30,000metric tonnes of used rails in the sum of US$6,540,000.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> However, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did <i>not</i> provide the credit, the plaintiff contending that such non-provision amounted to a repudiation of the contract, which repudiationwas accepted by the plaintiff, which now sues for damages for breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The damages alleged to have been suffered are substantial: a variety of figures are pleaded in the alternative at paragraph 21 <i>et</i> <i>seq</i> in the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, and range from the sum of US$31.39 million to US$105 million.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> For its part the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant contends that no binding contract was concluded between the parties, in particular relying upon Clause 2.1 of the contract,which provides that the contract is to become operative when the buyer and seller both have initialled and signed the contract andappendices, and maintaining that it neither had initialled or signed Appendix 1.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also relies upon various other contractual provisions, and further denies that the plaintiff is entitled to damages asalleged or at all, and in any event maintains that the plaintiff failed to mitigate its loss by failing to seek alternative buyersfor the used rails.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> The plaintiff alleges that the issue of whether there is a binding contract is to be decided according to the law of Texas â underwhich the contract is to be regarded as binding irrespective of whether the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant initialled and signed Appendix 1 â and further replies that, by reason of the conduct of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is barred by waiver and/or is estopped from contending that the contract is not binding.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The foregoing, of course, represents no more than a very broad account of the nature of the dispute, albeit for present purposesthere probably is no necessity to condescend to greater detail.</p>    <p class="heading">âSplit trialâ: established principles</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> I apprehend that there is no difference between counsel as to the principles which have been laid down governing the courtâs powerto order what is colloquially referred to as a âsplit trialâ, although there is a chasm dividing the parties in terms of itsdesirability in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> <i>Order 33 rule 4(2), RHC,</i> provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn any â¦action different questions or issues may be ordered to be tried at different places or by different modes of trial andone or more questions or issues may be ordered to be tried before the others.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The commentary in the 2008 edition of Hong Kong Civil Procedure â at <i>MN 33/4/11</i>, at page 603 â reflects the fact that ânormal procedureâ requires the trial of liability and damages together, although theeditors note that the court should be ready to order separate trials of the issues of liability and damages where it is âjust andconvenient to do soâ, and further emphasise that the order to separate trials of liability and damages âis only to be made inexceptional cases where there was a clear line of demarcation between the issues of liability and quantumâ.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> In a personal injuries action, <i>Coenen v.

Lobley Co. Ltd,</i> unrep., HCA No A8145 of 1992, judgment dated 23 February 1995, Mr Justice Findlay embarked upon a review of the principles upon whicha court may order that issues of liability and quantum be separately tried, and adopted the approach of Lord Denning and Stamp LJin <i>Coenen v. Payne, op cit</i>.:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI take it, therefore, as the guiding principle that I should not order the issues to be tried separately unless it is just andconvenient to do so; by âjustâ I mean fair to both sides, without one side or the other gaining an undue advantage by a separation,and by âconvenientâ I mean convenient to both sides and advantageous from the point of view of costsâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In <i>Telford Development Ltd v. Shui On Construction Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20HKC%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] HKC 110</a>, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in an appeal against an order at first instance ordering the trial of four preliminaryissues, Bokhary J (as he then was) observed as follows, at 117:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe general rule is that all the issues in a case are to be tried at one and the same time.  There is power to order that differentissues in a case be tried at different times.  But that departure from the general rule is ordered only if it is just and convenient. And it is, of course, for the party who seeks such a departure to demonstrate that it is indeed just and convenient.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">We do not think that circumstances as they existed when this matter was before Mayo J or as they stand now, demonstrate that the trialas preliminary issues of the issues which have been ordered to be so tried is just or convenient.  The estimates as to how long thetrial of the action as a whole, on the one hand, and the trial of the preliminary issues ordered, on the other hand, would take arevague in the extreme.  So on any view, it is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy how much time and costs would besaved if the preliminary issues determined the Telford action.  And this is even ignoring the possibility that the result of theMTR action would render the whole of the Telford action unnecessary.  Then there are the other considerationsâ¦which point awayfrom the idea that it is just and convenient to order the trial of the preliminary issues sought by Shui On.  Here, we have in mindamong other things: (i) the need to proof and call witnesses (who, it might be added, might have to be proofed and called again whenthe main trial takes place); and (ii) the delay to the main trial which may be occasioned if the result of the trial of the preliminaryissue is appealed to this court and possibly even beyondâ¦â  </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Finally, and more recently, the Court of Appeal in <i>Mai Gou v. Mak Chik Lun</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%203%20HKLRD%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 3 HKLRD 248</a> re-emphasised the general rule that all issues arising in an action should be tried together, and that an order for the separatetrial of separate issues should only be made in exceptional circumstances or on special grounds, and that therefore the court shouldbe âextremely cautiousâ before acceding to pleas for making such orders, Le Pichon JA in this case taking the opportunity toreview in some detail the applicable principles underpinning any order for the trial of preliminary issues.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Whilst it is readily appreciated that there is a conceptual distinction between the order of a trial of a preliminary issue and theorder for a âsplit trialâ of the issues of liability and damages â and that, if anything, the court should be even more carefulbefore ordering a preliminary issue under <i>Order 33, RHC</i> â nevertheless it is clear that both concepts share the common theme that as a general principle the trial should take the formof a cohesive whole, and that unless it is clear that it is âjust and convenientâ, in the preliminary issue context, for a specificmatter to be âhived offâ from the general issue, or, within the âsplit trialâ context, for the question of liability to beseparated from issues of consequential loss/damage, the court ought not to accede to applications therefor.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> In short, the benchmark must be one of judicial caution before sanctioning a departure from the general procedural rule, and withthat in mind I turn to the manner in which this particular application was framed.</p>    <p class="heading">The argument</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> The parameters of the plaintiffâs application for a split trial are set out in terms on the face of the summons dated 21 April2008, the terms of which have required minor amendment consequent upon the recent filing of the Defence to the claim, it being saidby the plaintiff that it remains unclear if the defendant in fact accepts that it is Texas law which should govern the issue of contractualformation.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Accordingly, as amended, the Order for which the plaintiff now contends is that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1.

Subject to the determination of the issue of liability in favour of the plaintiff, the issue of damages be tried subsequentlyin such manner as may be directed by the Commercial Judge.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> For the purpose of this judgment I am assuming that the foregoing encapsulates all of the issues of liability as raised on the pleadings,notwithstanding that the carriage to the Order sought is couched in terms of âthe following issues of liabilityâ. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Certainly Mr Strachan, who moved this application on behalf of the plaintiff, did not indicate otherwise, and for present purposes,therefore, I approach this application on the basis that that which now is sought is a âsplit trialâ in the ordinarily acceptedsense, and thus that there are no âhangingâ issues of liability outwith the rubric as set out on the face of the summons.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The nub of Mr Strachanâs argument was that the circumstances of this case made it very clear that the âjust and convenientâcourse for the court to adopt towards this litigation was to try the relatively straightforward issue(s) of liability as thus analysed,before commencing to judge the far more complex issues of the quantum of damage.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> This was, as he attractively observed, a case with âa short head of liability and a long tail of damagesâ, by which he meantthat there was a comparative simplicity in the liability analysis when compared with the question of damages, which contained withinit some difficult points in terms of causation and remoteness, and indeed in terms of pure quantum, including the issue of mitigationof damage.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The trial of these âtightâ and âneatly containedâ liability issues would, he said, take 3-4 days at most, with relativelyfew witnesses being required on either side.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> By contrast, Mr Strachan referred to the manner in which the damages issues variously are pleaded within the âLoss and Damageâhead within paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, noting that as presently pleaded the damages issues are âcuriouslyextensiveâ, and suggested that if and in so far as the damages issue was to be tried with that of liability, the parties and thecourt were most certainly looking at a multi-week trial.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Thus, Mr Strachan submitted, a âsplit trialâ of this case, in the manner as now mooted by the plaintiff, would serve to savevery considerable sums in costs on both sides if the court were to be against the plaintiff on liability, thereby rendering otiosethe issue of quantum.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> This most certainly was not a purely tactical application, he said, given that it had been taken out prior to the outstanding applicationfor discovery as issued by the defendant.  The fact that, potentially at least, witnesses on both sides would, or may have to be,called twice should this litigation thus be âsplitâ should not be a consideration which should carry undue weight â it wasfrequently the case, said Mr Strachan, that when an order was made for a split trial that one or more witnesses would have to becalled twice.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Accordingly, in the present case it was envisaged that Mr Utley of the plaintiff would give his evidence at the liability stage,and thereafter, at the damages trial, if such be necessary, he would give evidence in respect of the various matters which arosein relation to the plaintiffâs claim.  By contrast, however, it was highly unlikely that any, or any significant, evidence wouldhave to be given by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs personnel in respect of his clientâs damages claim, which inevitably would require evidence from the plaintiff andthe plaintiffâs supplier of these used rails.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> As to the foreign law element, Mr Strachan submitted that experts on Texas law equally would have to give evidence at both the liabilityand quantum trials if, absent agreement between the parties, there were to be issues as to principles of Texas law about first, theintention to contract, and second, as to recoverable heads of damage.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> However, notwithstanding the potential calling of evidence from certain witnesses on two separate occasions, the fact remained, counselsaid, that the liability and damages issues were clearly distinct, and should be regarded as such in terms of the manner in whichthis case is brought to trial.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> As to the position of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, Mr Chu Kin Wah, a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, who now was the only other defendant in the proceedings as constituted post-amendment â at the outset of this litigationthere had been 5 defendants but the original 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants had been deleted at the stage of the first amendment of the plaintiffâs claim â Mr Strachan noted that this was anaspect of the case which had concerned the court at the first hearing of this application prior to its adjournment.  In this regardhe said that he now was able to state on behalf of his client that whilst the plaintiff had a viable claim against Mr Chu in thetort of deceit (<i>vide</i> paragraph 37 of the pleading), nevertheless it was recognized that the main claim lay against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant company, and that should there be an order for a split trial as against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant it was not an attractive prospect to invite the court thus to leave alive and outstanding the entirety of the claim againstthe 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Accordingly, counsel said, in the event that an order for a split trial were to be made by the court on this application, the plaintiffwould undertake to withdraw its claim against the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.  Conversely, however, it would be unsatisfactory for the plaintiff to abandon its claim against the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant <i>irrespective</i> of the outcome of this application, and thus if it were held to be inappropriate to order a split trial on the issues of liabilityand damages as against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the plaintiff would maintain its present claim against the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> In opposition to this application by the plaintiff, Mr Ronny Tong SC, on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, took a firm and uncompromising stand.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The essence of his submission was that whilst he had no difficulty in accepting the relevant principles applicable to this debate,he had every difficulty in accepting Mr Strachanâs primary thesis that there was, and is, a clear line of demarcation between theissues of liability and quantum in terms of the plaintiffâs case against his client.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> To the contrary, he said.  Far from being a clear and recognizable delineation, thereby permitting a convenient separation of liabilityand quantum, from his side of the bar table the perception was that these issues were inextricably connected.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Mr Tong made no secret of his clientâs considerable scepticism about the merit of the plaintiffâs claim, and at the outset ofhis address observed that this was the first occasion he could remember when an application of this nature had emanated from a <i>plaintiff</i>, as opposed to a defendant; could it be, he asked rhetorically, that this application constituted implicit recognition by the plaintiffof the tenuous nature of the claim as now mounted against his client, and that there was a clear agenda at work in terms of a potentialsaving in costs if all did not go accordingly to plan upon the liability issue?</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> He suggested that the court should be careful indeed before acceding to the considerable charm of Mr Strachanâs submissions, andhe struck a note of immediate discord in expressing his disagreement with the suggestion that this case represented but a âshortliability exerciseâ.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> His client would say that, contrary to the plaintiffâs claim as now asserted, the plaintiff never had had any supply contract forthese rails, and that the reason that no standby credit had been opened was because of the very real fear of his client that theplaintiff was not worth powder and shot, and that if the credit were to be wrongly drawn down, his client would not be able to recoverwhat was a considerable sum of money.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> He further suggested that <i>if</i> there was a supply contract as alleged, nevertheless in substance this was as much a liability issue as a quantum issue, and thatit was perfectly possible that the binding nature or otherwise of such contract would be a matter of Argentinian law, which potentiallywould introduce another disparate element into the foreign law equation.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Moreover, said Mr Tong, when the plaintiffâs estoppel plea was specifically considered, the drawing of a clear-cut line betweenliability and quantum issues would be very difficult, and in any event his client did not share the plaintiffâs optimism that onthe liability issue few witnesses from the 1<sup>st </sup>defendant would be necessary â and even were this to be the case, which was disputed, his client saw no reason why potentially itswitnesses may be required to give evidence on two separate occasions, with commensurate waste in terms of executive time and costs.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> At the end of the day, concluded Mr Tong, the highest that this application can be put is that the case for a split trial is âarguableat bestâ, and in a case wherein there were, in his submission, a âmultitude of overlapping and contraversial issuesâ, the argumentas now made on behalf of the applicant simply failed to meet the benchmark of âthe exceptional caseâ wherein it clearly is âjustand convenientâ to accede to an application of this type.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Finally, noted Mr Tong, if and in so far as this application represented a genuine attempt to save costs, which he doubted, the furtherrationale, as floated by the plaintiff in counselâs skeleton argument, to the effect that an initial liability finding in favourof the plaintiff may serve to stimulate a settlement with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was simply empty rhetoric as far as his client was concerned â this just âwas not going to happenâ.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> So persuasively did the respective advocates do their jobs that I have taken several days to reflect on this matter, and more particularlyto take the opportunity to read the case papers in greater detail.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> At the end of the day, and notwithstanding Mr Strachanâs cogent submissions, I have come to the conclusion Mr Tong is correct,and that to be persuaded to order a âsplit trialâ in the present case would be to venture into dangerous waters.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> In fact, as the prospective trial judge, I would go further and express the view that a bifurcation of the trial in the manner forwhich the plaintiff now contends may well prove a recipe for acute procedural problems, in terms both of further interlocutory applicationsand of the conduct of the trial of such âliability issue(s)â.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> For my part, should this dispute be dealt with as the plaintiff now wishes, I can foresee repeated arguments as to the correct characterizationof disparate issues, and whether such are to be regarded as questions of âliabilityâ or of âquantumâ. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> In this regard, for example, Mr Tong took the court to the forthcoming discovery application on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant â the hearing of which, I gather, now is scheduled for 8 July â in which he demonstrated, with reference to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs âSchedule of Discoveryâ, that is, the categories of documents which it now was sought to obtain by way of discoveryfrom the plaintiff, that there was a marked divergence of view: whilst the plaintiff apparently saw this as discovery relating solelyto quantum, so far as Mr Tong was concerned, 11 of the 12 documentary categories specifically went to the issue of liability, withthe remaining item a mixture of the two. </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> The court thus immediately is confronted with an example of starkly differing views within the context of an imminent discovery application,and, with respect, I can foresee this scenario repeating itself in other contexts, albeit discovery is an obvious candidate for disagreementof this type.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The relevance of this latter point is emphasised by the case of <i>Baldock v. Allison &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20WLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 WLR 158</a>, a copyright action wherein a split trial of the issues of liability and damages had been ordered, and wherein the defendants hadsubmitted on the hearing of a summons for directions that discovery should be limited to the issue of liability.  This contentionwas not accepted by the Master hearing the summons, and in allowing the defendantâs appeal therefrom Lightman J held that whilstthe ambit of the courtâs powers to order discovery extended to âmatters in question in the actionâ, the court should in allordinary cases of a split trial, and in the absence of special circumstances, exercise its discretion in favour of <i>limiting</i> discovery to the issue of liability, and that the decision in any particular case involved balancing, on the basis of evidence, theinterests of the parties, how impelling the need for information was, and how expensive and intrusive such discovery would be.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> This narrow approach appears to have been followed in principle by the English Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Millett and Sir BrianNeill) in <i>Kapur v. JW Francis and Co and Another</i>, unrep., a short abstract of which appears in The Times of 4 March 1998, wherein the court held that in ordering the separate trialof liability and quantum, a judge had a discretion whether and to what extent discovery should be ordered, but, <i>prima facie</i>, no discovery should be ordered of matters on an issue which might never be tried.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> These decisions strike me as correct (although for present purposes it is unnecessary to express any final view), and in my viewthey serve to emphasise the necessity to be able easily and fairly to differentiate an issue of liability from an issue soundingpurely to quantum.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Nor are potential interlocutory problems the sole consideration.  At any trial of liability alone, for example, I am inclined toagree with Mr Tong that the difficulty of easily âpigeonholingâ issues into those of liability on the one hand and quantum onthe other may well produce problems in the conduct of the trial both for counsel and the bench, and in cross-examination in particularin terms, for example, of whether a line of questioning is relevant and well-founded.  And if and in so far as the âlineâ isblurred between the two concepts, and the questioning proceeds, the evidence so garnered may require to be identified and marshalledat a subsequent hearing on quantum, if such transpires to be necessary. </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Forensic difficulties can, of course, always be overcome, but for my part, and save in the most obvious case wherein the advantageof separation of the dispute into liability and quantum is plain â and in this regard clearly every case is âfact-sensitiveââ I see no merit in unnecessarily creating potential problems in terms of the conduct of a trial, nor, for that matter, of effectivelytying the hands of the court at the outset by thus restricting the inquiry and the ambit of the evidence of any particular witnessin a case of this relatively complex nature.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Looked at in the round, therefore, it strikes me that however optimistically the plaintiff and its advisers may perceive this litigationin terms of âcleanâ and immediately recognizable issues susceptible to neat (and hopefully quick) resolution, the overwhelmingprobability is that dispute is <i>not</i> going to turn out to be âclear-cutâ, and is likely to be redolent with disputed issues of fact wherein the issue of whether thereis a valid and binding contract between these parties is, or will be seen to be, irrevocably intertwined with disputed facts in thearea of quantum â and not least when, as here, matters of causation and remoteness also are in play.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> At the end of the day, interference with procedural rules/procedural approaches which have stood the test of time â and which areenshrined in that repository of learning colloquially known as the âWhite Bookâ â are to be varied only with considerable hesitation,hence the principle that whilst exceptional cases occasionally may warrant a departure from the norm, the general rule is that allthe issues in a case are, as a matter of primary principle, to be decided at the same time.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> In my judgment, and doing the best that I can on the necessarily limited state of my current knowledge of this dispute, my instincttells me that the present case is <i>not</i> such an exceptional case; indeed, I am tempted to surmise that, when eventually one has the benefit of hindsight, this case may proveto have been a paradigm example of when <i>not</i> to embark upon such a liability/quantum separation.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> I further take the firm view that any such division of a case into the distinct elements of liability and quantum also must be recognizedto be worth the ever-present risk of any initial liability judgment being appealed up the âcourt chainâ, with that first instancejudgment eventually being returned to sender and either confirmed or set aside or varied â in which case the quantum issue, whichon this hypothesis has lain dormant whilst liability alone has been decided and thereafter appealed, potentially may be requiredto be determined long after the initial trial on liability, and at a time when it may no longer be in the ability of the partiesconveniently to assemble the necessary evidence for the proper disposition of this issue.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Hence the necessity for the exercise of considerable caution before being persuaded to depart from the normal rule, caution whichin my view is well-founded in this particular instance.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> It follows from the foregoing that the order of this court on the plaintiffâs application for a âsplit trialâ is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>1.   The plaintiffâs application by summons dated 21 April 2008 is dismissed;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2.
