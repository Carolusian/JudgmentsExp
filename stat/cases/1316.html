The Plaintiffs claim that because the Defendant by applying to open an account on Mr. Xuâs behalf, shehad agreed to be liable for Mr. Xuâs account.  For this reason, the Defendant confirmed in writing to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff on 10 February 2003 admitting her liability for the unauthorised sales and agreeing to pay for the said air tickets shouldMr. Xu fail to settle the outstanding charges within 3 months.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Defendant paid the Plaintiffs the sum of $136,245 between February and May 2003.

Upon the incorporation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff in 2003 which took over the Wholesale Travel Division of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and the Defendant entered into a second employment agreement.  The Defendant signed the agreement on 27 March 2003 (âthe2<sup>nd</sup> agreement)(see p.71 â 72 of the bundle).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It is the submission of Mr. Lam, counsel of the Defendant, that because the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff transferred its Wholesale Travel Division to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff in March 2003 including all chose in action, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff has no locus standi in these proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr. Wong, counsel for the Plaintiff, denied that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff transferred its right to sue the Defendant to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.  He maintained that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was the employer of the Defendant at the relevant period in August 2002 to January 2003, has a right to sue the Defendantunder the 1<sup>st</sup> agreement.  While the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff as her subsequent employer also possesses the right to sue the Defendant under the 2<sup>nd</sup> agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr. Lam further queried the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs status, he claimed it is the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs duty to show it is a going concern and had not been wound up.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  By querying if the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff is a going concern, Mr. Lam is in effect questioning if the solicitor of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff had been properly instructed by the board of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to represent its client.  As the Defendant failed to put the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs solvency in issue in her re-amended defence, the burden is not on the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to show it is not in liquidation.  It must be assumed that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs solicitor had full and proper instructions to take up these proceedings unless there is evidence to the contrary becauseall winding up proceedings are advertised and are within the realm of public knowledge.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  I accept Mr. Wongâs  submission that after the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff joined in these proceedings, the Plaintiffs have the right to sue the Defendant under the two employment agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Mr. Xuâs account with the Plaintiffs</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It is not disputed that Mr. Xu had been purchasing air-tickets in cash from the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff since April 2002 through the Defendant (âMiss Choiâ) as his ticketing agent.  It is Miss Choiâs evidence that Mr.Xu asked her to find out if he could open an account at the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff so that he would have a record of the tickets purchased by him on behalf of his friends and colleagues.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  At the request of Mr. Xu, in or about July 2002, Miss Choi asked Mr. Yuen, the general manager of the Wholesale Travel Divisionof the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff if Mr. Xu could open an account with the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  Mr. Yuen agreed and instructed Miss Choi to leave Mr. Xuâs address and contact particulars with the accounts department. Since Mr. Xu had no address or phone number in Hong Kong, Miss Choi used her own name and her office address as the contact addressfor Mr. Xuâs account.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It is Mr. Yuenâs evidence that when he approved Miss Choiâs application for an account to be set up for Mr. Xu, he had approvedit as a COD (cash on delivery) account which meant the client would be eligible to settle payment for air tickets issued by chequesfor ticket orders of under $50,000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  It is, however, Miss Choiâs evidence that so far as she understood, all client accounts with the Plaintiffs are credit accountsand all clients with an account would be entitled to purchase tickets on credit.  In which case, the accounts department would bein charge of collecting payments from all clients with accounts at the Plaintiffs.  She claimed she knew nothing about the existenceof a COD account.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Ticket sale procedures at the Plaintiffs</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Miss Choi claimed that for clients with an account at the Plaintiffs, she would only be required to issue a ticket ordered by theclient by operating the ticketing machine using either the Abacus or Galileo system and hand over the ticket and passenger receiptto the client.  The agent coupon issued together with the ticket and passenger receipt would be kept by her in a tray placed on acounter behind her.  If the client paid in cash, she would type a sales order into the computer system linked to the accounts department,an invoice would then be issued and printed.  She would then submit the cash payment received together with the agent coupon andthe sales order to the accounts department for record.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Miss Choi claimed that for clients with an account at the Plaintiffs she was not be required to issue an invoice until the clientsettled payments, consequently, no entries would be made by her in the Plaintiffsâ âSales Record Systemsâ by recording thesales orders into the Plaintiffâs computer system.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">25.</a>  Miss Choiâs</a> evidence is disputed by the Plaintiffs.  According to Mr. Yuen, all sales orders whether cash sales or credit sales have to be recordedin the Plaintiffsâ Sales Record Systems.  The system is linked to the accounts departmentâs record so that the accounts departmentwould have an immediate record of all the air tickets sold through the Plaintiffsâ ticketing agents.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It is Mr. Yuenâs evidence that if the sale was in cash to a client without credit the sales order would be entered in a cash file. For individual clients who have an account, the entry would be made in the file of the individual client accessible by enteringhis name and account number.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Further, all ticketing agents are required to access the companyâs client files, the details on the computer files would discloseif a particular clientâs account was a COD account or a credit account.  The information on the file would state the âcreditdateâ.  If the credit date is âOâ, it means the account is a COD account.  It is Mr Yuenâs evidence that all of the Plaintiffâscredit account customers were and are corporate customers.  Individuals were and are only entitled to set up COD accounts.  Therefore,the ticketing agent who sold an air ticket to an individual customer is responsible for the collection of payment for the ticketsold by him or her from the individual customer with or without an account.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr. Yuen claimed that for clients with credit accounts, the ticketing agent is required to check the particular clientâs creditstatus by accessing the clientâs file before issuing the air ticket.  Should he/she find that the client had exceeded its creditlimit, he/she is required to inform the client of it and to issue the ticket only after outstanding payments have been settled.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Based on the evidence of Mr. Yuen which I find to be consistent and credible I am satisfied that the Plaintiffs had at the materialtime, a sales record system that required all their ticketing agents to record all sales orders into the Plaintiffâs computer recordat the time of ticket issuance whether the customer paid in cash or purchased on credit.  It would be impossible for the Plaintiffsâaccounts department to locate records of tickets sold by their ticketing agents otherwise.  This is particular so since the Plaintiffshad 4 branches in Hong Kong and Kowloon at the relevant period and its accounts department was located at the Causeway Bay office. It would be unreasonable to expect the accounts department to visit each of the 4 branches on a regular basis in order to compilea record of all air tickets sold.  It makes better sense for the ticketing agents in all of the 4 branches to enter all sales ordersin the computer sales record systems which was linked to the accounts department in the Causeway Bay office.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Duty to demand payments from customers</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Miss Choi claimed it was the responsibility of the accounts department to demand payments from credit customers.  She claimed furtherthat the accounts department would received a BSP report from the airlines against which the accounts department would check withthe Plaintiffsâ own record of tickets sold before settling payments to the airlines.  Consequently, it is the duty of the accountsdepartment to check the BSP report against the agent coupons for all tickets issued by ticketing agents.  The accounts departmentwould then be required to demand payments for outstanding payments from customers with credit accounts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr. Yuen and the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs former accounts clerk Mr. Law Wai Yip (PW1) both agreed that the accounts department has the duty to demand paymentsfrom customers with credit accounts.  They, however, disagreed that the only record of sales would be the agent coupons placed inthe tray on the ticketing agentsâ counter.  It was Mr. Lawâs evidence that the record of sales orders should appear in the computerentry made by the ticketing agents in the Plaintiffsâ sales record systems.  When Mr. Law found in October 2002, that the numberof tickets issued recorded in the BSP report did not tally with the entries in the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs sales record systems, he asked Miss Choi to follow it up.  At the time, he believed Miss Choi had failed to keep upwith the entry of sales orders and collection for payments.  Miss Choi agreed to follow the matter up.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  It is Mr. Lawâs evidence that Miss Choi had failed to inform him the progress of her follow up action in the weeks that followed. He began to remind Miss Choi on a weekly basis that she should be collecting payments from customers for the outstanding accounts. On each occasion, Miss Choi told him she was following it up.  Mr. Law claimed that Miss Choi admitted to him the outstanding paymentswere for tickets issued by her and promised him that she would be able to procure settlement of all outstanding payments by the endof 2002.  She asked him not to inform his supervisor of it.  He agreed that Miss Choi did obtain payments for part of the outstandingsum but when she failed to obtain full settlement of the entire outstanding sum in early January 2003, he reported the matter toMiss Ng, the senior accounting supervisor.  Subsequently, the matter was taken over by Mr. Yuen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I find Mr. Law to be an honest witness.  Mr. Law was dismissed in January 2003 by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff for his failure to report the matter as soon as he discovered the discrepancies in the sales record systems and the BSP. Mr. Law gave evidence as an independent witness with little to gain.  It is not disputed that Mr. Law and Miss Choi were on goodterms while they were both employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  Miss Choi admitted her friendship with Mr. Law.  She claimed that she agreed to follow up the outstanding payments asa favour to Mr. Law.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I do not accept Miss Choiâs evidence that she agreed to follow up Mr. Xuâs outstanding account as a favour to Mr. Law.  Sheadmitted she alone had the contact details of Mr. Xu and she had been in daily contact with Mr. Xu during the relevant period oftime.  Furthermore, she admitted Mr. Xu had entrusted her with a cheque book, with 8 â 10 of the cheques signed by Mr. Xu in blank. She further admitted that she would only issue cheque payments to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff after she received instructions from Mr. Xu that he had money in his bank account.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I find Miss Choiâs evidence to be self-serving and exculpatory.  Her evidence on the responsibility in making entries in the Plaintiffsâsales record systems only arose when cash payment was received by her was completely unreliable.  It defies reasons or logic fora travel agency to allow its ticketing agents to make no record of sales whether by hand written notes or computer entries of salesorders when air tickets were sold.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Furthermore, I do not accept the evidence of Miss Choi that she had no access to the particulars of Mr. Xuâs account recordinghis credit status as â0â days credit or her ignorance that all of Plaintiffsâ credit account customers were corporations, andall individual customer accounts were COD accounts.  She had 7 years experience in the travel agency business, she had 1Â½ yearsexperience as a ticketing agent before joining the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in March 2001.  Even Mr. Chan (DW2) a witness called by the Defence, who had worked for 2 months in 2002 for the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff possessed the knowledge that all credit account holders at the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff were corporations and no individual had a credit account with the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  It follows that Miss Choi who had worked for almost 2 years at the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as a ticketing agent should be ignorant of the Plaintiffâs ticketing procedures.  It is certainly contrary to the evidenceof Mr. Law and Mr. Yuen for Miss Choi to claim she had not been trained to operate the ticket sales procedures of the Plaintiffs. It is unimaginable for Miss Choi who was employed as an experienced ticketing agent to be able to maintain her employment for 2years with the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff without possessing the most basic knowledge of air ticket sales that all sales required the recording of sale orders beit a handwritten record or computer entry whether the ticket had been paid in cash or not.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> There are a number of discrepancies between Miss Choiâs evidence in Court and her witness statements.  She admitted in her witnessstatement that after Mr. Xuâs account was set up at the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, whenever Mr. Xu purchased an air ticket, the ticketing agent would debit the sale in Mr. Xuâs account (see para. 4 atp. 52 of the bundle).  Yet in her cross-examinations, she claimed she meant she had merely put the agent coupon, recording Mr. Xuâsaccount number and the PNR (passenger name register) in the tray on the counter, and it was up to the accounts department to checkthis record.  From the documents exhibited, a PNR code appeared on each agent coupon issued (see p. 98 â 139 of the bundle).  Iassume Miss Choi meant the PNR code on the agent coupon would identify each ticket issued.  But this does not explain the changesin her evidence that the ticketing agent would debit each sale on Mr. Xuâs account.  It is exactly this step that Mr. Law foundshe failed to take in October 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Did Miss Choi procure Mr. Law to conceal the failure to keep a record of the sale of tickets to Mr. Xu?</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> Based on Mr. Lawâs evidence and also based on Miss Choiâs own report of 6 February 2003 (Exh. D1), Miss Choi admitted that Mr.Law did question her about the failure to make ticket sales entries in the system.  Miss Choi had asked Mr. Law to give Mr. Xu untilthe end of the year to settle the outstanding account because Mr. Xuâs creditors failed to make payments and he had liquidity problems.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> In this report, she further admitted that Mr. Law did repeatedly asked her about the ticket sales and settlement of payments by Mr.Xu.  Her report of 6 February 2003 is consistent with the evidence of Mr. Law.  I am satisfied the report of 6 February 2003 wascloser to the truth than either her witness statements or evidence in Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Based on the evidence of Mr. Law and on a balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that she did procure Mr. Law to conceal the outstandingpayments of Mr. Xu from the senior management of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>The 10 February 2003 Confirmation Report</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> It is unlikely that the 10 February 2003 confirmation was signed under duress.  Miss Choi admitted she typed out this document athome after she was instructed by Mr. Yuen to write a report on Mr. Xuâs account.  She admitted she composed it at home and printedit out at the office the next day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> At the time, with Mr. Xuâs signed blank cheques in her possession, she confirmed and agreed to go to Mr. Xu for full settlementof all outstanding payments within 3 months.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> The Plaintiff denied that it had put any undue pressure on the Defendant to write the report of 10 February 2003.  Mr. Yuenâs evidencewas the 10 February 2003 confirmation report was written by the Defendant after she agreed that if the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs Wholesale Travel Division did not go to the police or take up legal action against her and Mr. Xu, she would procureMr. Xu to pay up all outstanding payments within 3 months.  She further confirmed that if Mr. Xu failed to settle all outstandingpayments within the time, she would be responsible for the payment herself.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> I am satisfied, based on the evidence adduced, the Defendantâs two confirmation reports were written on the Defendantâs own volition. They were both written by her on the computer.  She admitted she had written the 10 February 2003 report at home on her computer,saved it on a floppy disc and printed it the next day in the office.  This demonstrated that she had ample time to reflect her ownposition and the circumstances and to talk to Mr. Xu.  The early report of 6 February 2003 I find was a true reflection of the circumstancesand contained facts known to the Defendant at the time.  I accept this report to be truthful.  I reject her subsequent self-servingevidence that Mr. Law did not approach her until January 2003.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> I am satisfied that Miss Choi did ask for time for Mr. Xu to settle the payments.  In spite of the unpaid air-tickets issued up toOctober 2002 for which she was warned by Mr. Law, she continued to issue tickets on Mr. Xuâs instructions in November, December2002 and January 2003 without demanding settlement from him for all the previously issued tickets purchased by him.  By continuingto issue tickets to Mr. Xu without demanding immediately payments in spite of repeated reminders from Mr. Law, she failed to protectthe Plaintiffâs interests.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Based on the evidence of the Plaintiffâs witnesses, on a balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that Miss Choi was duty boundto enter the sales orders in the Plaintiffâs record.  Miss Choi had failed to make entries of sale orders in the Plaintiffâssales record systems because she knew Mr. Xu was not able to settle the payments for the tickets issued at the time from her dailytelephone contacts with him.  I accept Mr. Yuen and Mr. Lawâs evidence that Miss Choi as a ticketing agent could and should accessthe Plaintiffâs file on Mr. Xu which would show that Mr. Xuâs account was a COD account and she was required to enter each andeveryone of the sales in his file so that both the ticketing agent and the accounts department would know of Mr. Xuâs outstandingbalance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> I am also satisfied that Miss Choi had concealed Mr. Xuâs outstanding payments from the Plaintiffs by her failure to enter thesales orders of tickets issued to Mr. Xu in the Plaintiffsâ sales records systems and procured Mr. Law not to inform senior managementof the sale of the said 121 tickets to Mr. Xu between September 2002 and January 2003.  Her conduct had therefore caused the Plaintiffsto suffer loss and damage. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Miss Choi knew the effects of her deliberate failure to make entries of the sales of the said 121 air-tickets.  She admitted shehad all along kept 8-10 blank cheques signed by Mr. Xu but would only issue them to the Plaintiffs upon the instructions of Mr. Xu. She had clearly placed Mr. Xuâs interests before that of her employer in breach of her contractual duty and fiduciary duty asa ticketing agent employed by the Plaintiffs.    </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Waiver and Estoppel</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Mr. Lam submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff could have discovered the malpractice of Miss Choi within 2 weeks when the airlines delivered the BSP reports for the Plaintiffsâsettlement of payments.  He submitted it was the accounts departmentâs duty to check the ticketing agentsâ counter tray for thesales records of air-tickets.  By their failure to discover the missing entries, and to notice the discrepancies between the BSPand their own sales records and by failing to conduct constant checking of the ticketing agentsâ tray, the Plaintiffs have waivedtheir rights and are estopped from claiming against the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> I am satisfied that if Miss Choi had followed proper procedures in entering sales orders of each ticket promptly, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs accounts department would have discovered Mr. Xuâs account had been outstanding within 2 weeks of each sale or sooner. Unfortunately, Miss Choi failed to follow the proper procedures in Mr. Xuâs account.  When Mr. Law approached her, she requestedMr. Law to give Mr. Xu time to pay up.  Clearly, Miss Choi had failed her duty to follow up payments for all tickets sold by herto cash and COD account customers.  It was her duty to know that the accounts department was only responsible for issuing monthlystatements to corporate credit account customers and to demand payments from them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">51.</a> Miss Choiâs</a> conduct in failing to report tickets sales to Mr. Xu and procuring Mr. Law not to alert the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs senior management of the outstanding account of Mr. Xu while continued to issue tickets without demanding paymentsfrom Mr. Xu clearly constituted a breach of duty of care amounting to fraudulent conduct. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> I was referred by Mr. Lam to the judgment of Shaw J. in Bremer B Handelsgesellschaft mbH v.

In fact, this offer was made after the Plaintiffs through Miss Choi gave Mr. Xu 3 months to settle all outstandingpayments.  Up to May 2003, Mr. Xu had only settled $136,245 between 20 January and 15 May 2003 in spite of the promises he made tothe Plaintiffs through Miss Choi.  Mr. Yuen said in Court that after repeatedly failing to honour his words, he could no longer acceptMr. Xuâs offer of payment by a monthly installment of $50,000 to settle the outstanding $747,199.20.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> If Mr. Xu had honoured his debts, he would have settled the outstanding debts whether it be before or after the Plaintiffsâ presentproceedings against Miss Choi commenced on 11 June 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Miss Choi admitted that all along she alone had Mr. Xuâs contact address and telephone number in China.
