Chan acceded to an application by the defendant, Alastair ElliotMurray (âMr Murrayâ), to strike out the statement of claim, dismiss the action and vacate the registration of the amended writof summons from the Land Registry.   He concluded this was the third time Mr Murray had been vexed by the same subject matter andthat the action was an abuse of the courtâs process.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  This is the appeal by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs, Healthy Living Products International Limited (âHealthy Livingâ) and Chan Yu Sang Zarrina (âMadam Chanâ) respectively,against that Decision.</p>    <p class="heading">Background facts</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The underlying property transaction</u></p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The action concerns a dispute in respect of a property, namely Lot No. 215 in Demarcation District 219, 56 Hing Keng Shek, Sai Kung,New Territories (âthe Propertyâ).</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Healthy Living was the registered owner of the Property.  The directors of Healthy Living are Madam Chan and her son Jawid IqbalKhan (âMr Khanâ).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  By a provisional agreement dated 14 June 2003 (âthe Provisional Agreementâ), Healthy Living agreed to sell the Property to MrMurray for HK$8,830,000. The Provisional Agreement was signed by Madam Chan and Mr Khan for Healthy Living.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 26 June 2003, Madam Chan, acting on behalf of Healthy Living, signed a formal sale and purchase agreement with Mr Murray (âtheFormal Agreementâ).  Completion of the agreement was to take place on 25 August 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  It became evident that Healthy Living would prefer not to proceed with the transaction.  On 21 July 2003, Healthy Livingâs solicitorsinformed Mr Murrayâs solicitors of the existence of illegal structures in the Property but this did not deter Mr Murray from goingahead.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Then, on 6 August 2003, Healthy Livingâs solicitors wrote to Mr Murrayâs solicitors alleging that a company called Nu Life InternationalLimited (âNu Life Internationalâ) had paid the down payment and mortgage instalments for the purchase of the property by HealthyLiving so that it was the beneficial owner of the Property.  Healthy Livingâs solicitors suggested cancelling the Formal Agreementbut Mr Murray refused to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 12 August 2003, another firm of solicitors, acting on behalf of a company called Nu Life International (Hong Kong) Limited (âNuLife HKâ), wrote to Mr Murrayâs solicitors alleging that Nu Life HK had transferred money from time to time into Healthy Livingâsaccount to meet the monthly mortgage instalments.  Hence, it was alleged, Nu Life HK had an equitable interest in the Property andobjected to its sale to Mr Murray.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The 2003 Action</u></p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Healthy Living did not complete on 25 August 2003 and Mr Murray therefore issued proceedings against Healthy Living in HCA 3202/2203(âthe 2003 Actionâ) the following day.  Nu Life HK and Mr Khan were added as 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants to that action on 7 November 2003.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The pleaded case of Healthy Living, Nu Life HK and Mr Khan in the First Action was that Nu Life HK was the beneficial owner of theProperty and that Healthy Living was holding the Property on trust for Nu Life HK.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  On 23 January 2006, shortly before the trial of the 2003 Action was due to commence, Healthy Living and Mr Khan sought to amendtheir defences and to file further evidence (including two medical reports of Dr Benjamin Lai, a psychiatrist, dated 3 January 2006and 10 January 2006) to advance the argument that, when she signed the Provisional Agreement, Madam Chan had been the subject ofduress and undue influence and that she was of unsound mind and not fit to give her consent when she signed the Provisional and FormalAgreements.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The trial judge, Deputy High Court Judge Gill, refused leave to amend and this was affirmed by the Court of Appeal (in CACV 40/2006)on 24 February 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 6 March 2006, the trial of the 2003 Action commenced.  Madam Chan, although not a party, made a witness statement on behalf ofHealthy Living and gave oral evidence at the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 19 April 2006, Deputy Judge Gill gave judgment in the 2003 Action in favour of Mr Murray.  He found that Nu Life HK had no beneficialinterest in the Property and ordered specific performance of the agreement for sale and purchase of the Property, with completionfixed for 30 May 2006, and damages.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 11 May 2006, Healthy Living and Nu Life HK filed a notice of appeal against the judgment in the 2003 Action in CACV 168/2006. However, this appeal was not pursued and was eventually dismissed by consent on 2 April 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In the meantime, on 16 May 2006, Healthy Living and Nu Life HK applied for a stay of execution of the judgment in the 2003 Actionbut this was dismissed on 18 May 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  On 12 July 2006, Healthy Living applied in the 2003 Action for a declaration that the Formal Agreement had been validly annulledand an order to postpone completion until after the determination of HCA 1157/2006 (which I shall address below).  This applicationwas dismissed on 19 July 2006.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On 2 August 2006, Healthy Living assigned the Property to Mr Murray. Madam Chan was one of the signatories on behalf of HealthyLiving.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The 2006 Action</u></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 29 May 2006, the day before completion fixed under the judgment in the 2003 Action, Nu Life International issued proceedingsagainst Healthy Living and Mr Murray in HCA 1157/2006 (âthe 2006 Actionâ) claiming a beneficial interest in the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr Murray applied to strike out the 2006 Action on the ground that it was frivolous or vexatious and/or an abuse of the processof the court.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  By his judgment dated 12 September 2007, Deputy Judge Gill acceded to Mr Murrayâs application and struck out the 2006 Action. The Deputy Judge considered the close relationship amongst the two Nu Life companies, Healthy Living and Mr Khan and found that,in the 2003 Action, those in control of the two Nu Life companies, with the support of Healthy Living and Mr Khan, had embarked ona considered strategy to use Nu Life HK to claim a beneficial interest in the Property and deliberately chose not to have Nu LifeInternational joined in the proceedings. </p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Present Proceedings</u></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Healthy Living and Madam Chan commenced this action, HCA 1463/2009, on 23 June 2009 but it was only on 20 April 2010 that the statementof claim was filed.  The proceedings were not served on Mr Murray until after the amendment of the writ on 26 April 2010.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  By this action, Healthy Living seeks a declaration that the Formal Agreement is invalid and unenforceable, a declaration that ithad rescinded the Formal Agreement and damages for breach and repudiation of the Formal Agreement.  For her part, Madam Chan seeksdamages for mental anxiety and the tort of intentional and/or reckless infliction of emotional distress.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The statement of claim is a lengthy and somewhat discursive pleading.  It is pleaded that the Property was purchased under HealthyLivingâs name for Madam Chanâs family, the directors and shareholders of Nu Life International and Madam Chan and her daughter.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It is alleged that immediately before the signing of the Formal Agreement, Mr Murray was told through his wife that Madam Chan hadno authority to sign the Formal Agreement singly on behalf of Healthy Living.  It is therefore pleaded that the Formal Agreementwas not binding on Healthy Living.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is further alleged that Mr Murray disregard an oral promise given to Madam Chanâs daughter on 21 June 2003 to back out fromthe transaction and, without waiting for the return of Mr Khan to participate in the matter, procured the registration of the FormalAgreement at the Land Registry.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Healthy Living and Madam Chan plead that, at the material time, Madam Chan was in frail physical condition and did not have thenecessary mental capacity to enter into the Formal Agreement and that Mr Murray was fully aware of her condition.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It is also pleaded that Madam Chan entered into the Formal Agreement as a result of misrepresentations made to her by the estateagent, a Miss Lau, acting on behalf of Mr Murray. These were to the effect that Madam Chanâs signature would not make the FormalAgreement valid or binding and that Mr Murray would not register this agreement with the Land Registry before it was signed by MrKhan.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  These matters are alleged to constitute the exercise by Mr Murray of undue influence on Madam Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Healthy Living and Madam Chan then plead that Mr Murray breached the Formal Agreement in failing to tender the balance of the purchaseprice of HK$7,947,000 on 25 August 2003 and that Mr Murrayâs repudiation of the Formal Agreement was accepted by Healthy Living.</p>    <p class="heading">The decision below</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The Deputy Judge referred to the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> in the wider sense as described in the speech of Lord Kilbrandon in <i>Yat Tung Investment Co. Limited v Dao Heng Bank Limited</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> by which it is an abuse of process to raise in subsequent proceedings matters which could and therefore should have been litigatedin earlier proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  He cited the judgment of Cheung JA in <i>Ngai Few Fung v Cheung Kwai Heung</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%202%20HKC%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 2 HKC 111</a> at Â§Â§16 and 17 addressing the rationale of the principle of abuse of process in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> as explained by the House of Lords in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co.</i> <i>(a firm)</i>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Applying that principle, the Deputy Judge struck out the claims of Healthy Living and Madam Chan for the various declarations andfor the return of the Property to Healthy Living and damages.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  He also struck out Madam Chanâs claims for damages.  He held, applying <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co. (a firm)</i> at pp.37B-38E, that there could be no claim for damages for frustration, mental anxiety, emotional distress, physical discomfortor inconvenience caused by an alleged breach of a contract like the subject contract for the sale and purchase of the Property. He also held that, since Mr Murray had succeeded in the First Action and obtained the conveyance of the Property pursuant to theFormal Agreement, there was no basis for the claim for damages for the tort of intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Accordingly, he dismissed the action and ordered that the registration of the amended writ of summons against the Property in theLand Registry be vacated.</p>    <p class="heading">The grounds of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  On this appeal, the submissions of Mr Adrian Bell SC, leading counsel for Healthy Living and Madam Chan, addressed the followingtwo issues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)   First, whether the Deputy Judge should have held that this action is an abuse of process and that the claims raised in it shouldhave been included in the 2003 Action; and</p>        <p>(2)   Secondly, whether there are special circumstances that should permit Madam Chan to run her case in this action.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  On the first issue, Mr Bell contended that the Deputy Judge should have but failed to consider the reasons behind Madam Chanâsfailure to apply to be joined as a defendant in the 2003 Action.  It was submitted that the Deputy Judge failed to consider the impactof Madam Chanâs psychiatric illnesses as supported by Dr Laiâs two medical reports and should have found that her psychiatricillnesses explained her failure to apply to be joined as a defendant in the 2003 Action.  Mr Bell therefore challenged the DeputyJudgeâs conclusion that Madam Chan made a deliberate decision not to apply to be joined in the 2003 Action so that this actionwas an abuse.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  On the second issue, it was contended that the Deputy Judge failed to take into account the special circumstances of the presentaction.  It was submitted that the Deputy Judge was wrong to draw the inference that Madam Chan must have âbeen taken care of byher son and her sonâs legal advisersâ and failed to take into account her mental condition at the time of the 2003 Action, asa result of which she would not have been reasonably capable to receive or comprehend any legal advice, even if given, nor to takean active role in the 2003 Action.</p>    <p class="heading">The legal principles</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  It was not disputed that the Deputy Judge correctly identified the relevant legal principles engaged.  As noted above, the DeputyJudge cited the judgment of this court in <i>Ngai Few Fung v Cheung Kwai Heung</i> at Â§16 in which Cheung JA set out the rationale of the <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> principle as explained by Lord Bingham in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (a firm)</i>, namely:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(1) The principle is to serve public interest in that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twicevexed in the same matter.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) This is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy on the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the partiesand the public as a whole.</p>        <p class="quote">(3) The onus is on the party alleging abuse.</p>        <p class="quote">(4) The bringing of a claim or the raising of the defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court issatisfied that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all.</p>        <p class="quote">(5) It is, however, not necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional elements such as a collateral attack on aprevious decision or some dishonesty. But where those elements are present, the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive.</p>        <p class="quote">(6) There will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of aparty.</p>        <p class="quote">Per Lord Bingham of Cornhill at p 90.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The Deputy Judge also cited Cheung JAâs reference (in <i>Ngai Few Fung v Cheung Kwai Heung</i> at Â§17) to the emphasis in Lord Binghamâs speech in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (a firm)</i> which was that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â â<i>It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so far as torender the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in myopinion be a broad, merits based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes accountof all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing orabusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.</i> As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether,on given facts, abuse is to be found or not.â â</p>        <p class="quote">[Emphasis in italics in Cheung JAâs judgment]</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  As Mr Bell pointed out, that emphasis is also reflected in Lord Millettâs speech in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (a firm)</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> where he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is one thing to refuse to allow a party to relitigate a question which has already been decided; it is quite another to denyhim the opportunity of litigating for the first time a question which has not previously been adjudicated upon. This latter (thoughnot the former) is prima facie a denial of the citizenâs right of access to the court conferred by the common law and guaranteedby article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953).</p>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>        <p class="quote">In so far as the so-called rule in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> suggests that there is a presumption against the bringing of successive actions, I consider that it is a distortion of the true position. The burden should always rest upon the defendant to establish that it is oppressive or an abuse of process for him to be subjectedto the second action.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Mr Bell also referred to <i>Ngai Few Fung v Cheung Kwai Heung</i> at Â§22, where Cheung JA noted that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the true basis of the <i>Henderson</i> or <i>Yat Tung</i> principle is based on abuse of process. This being the true basis of the principle then one can see immediately that it is not permissibleto adopt a mechanistic approach by simply saying that since the cause of action or defence could have been raised in an earlier proceedingsthen it should have been so raised so that the subsequent raising of those issues in the later proceedings will necessarily becomeabusive.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Is the present action an abuse?</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  There can clearly be no question that the claims Healthy Living and Madam Chan now seek to raise in this action could have beenraised in the 2003 Action.  Healthy Living was a party to that action and could have amended its defence to raise the issues nowsought to be litigated by it in this action.  (Indeed, the particular contention that Mr Murray repudiated the Formal Agreement byfailing to complete on 25 August 2003 so that Healthy Living was entitled to rescission of that agreement was actually raised inthe 2003 Action and rejected.)  So far as Madam Chan is concerned, she could have applied to be joined as a defendant to the 2003Action to raise the claims she now seeks to advance in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The question is whether this action is an abuse because the claims of Healthy Living and Madam Chan should (rather than simply could)have been raised in the 2003 Action.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Mr Bell submitted that the Deputy Judgeâs conclusion that this action is an abuse of process was one arrived at by applying theprohibited mechanistic approach of simply saying that, because the issues could have been raised in the 2003 Action, it was an abuseto raise them in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Mr Bellâs starting point as to why this action is not an abuse was that the issues sought to be raised by Healthy Living and MadamChan have not previously been adjudicated upon.  Healthy Living had attempted to raise them but was prevented from doing so by thecourtâs refusal of leave.  Therefore, this was not a case of a party seeking to re-litigate matters that have already been determinedby a court and the onus, which he submitted was a heavy one, lay on Mr Murray to justify the striking out of the action as an abuseof the process of the court.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  So far as Madam Chan was concerned, Mr Bell submitted that it was unrealistic and unfair to criticise her for not applying to jointhe 2003 Action as a defendant because the medical evidence in Dr Laiâs reports clearly demonstrated that she was in ill healthbetween 2003 and 2006 and still suffering from significant mental impairment in January 2006.  She was not legally represented atthe time and, even if she had been, it is doubtful she would have been able to understand legal advice and to conduct litigationas a party.  In Dr Laiâs report dated 3 January 2006, he concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn my opinion Madam Chan is suffering from psychiatric illnesses in addition to her physical illnesses. The illnesses include anadjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed symptoms, and a delusion. She also exhibits some features of impairment of cognitivefunctioning.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In my view, Healthy Livingâs attempt to re-litigate the issues it sought to raise by amendment in the 2003 Action is clearly anabuse of process of the court.  Unlike the position of Madam Chan, whose position I shall address below, there is no evidence toexplain why Healthy Living did not advance in the 2003 Action all its arguments as to why the sale of the Property to Mr Murray shouldnot be specifically enforced.  Madam Chanâs health cannot justify delay on the part of Healthy Living, which is a separate legalpersonality.  The evidence shows that Mr Khan was the director of Healthy Living having the conduct of the litigation for the company. The company was legally represented and no good reason has been demonstrated as to why it did not raise all its defences in goodtime. </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  It is true that the courtâs refusal of leave to amend in the 2003 Action means that those issues have not been adjudicated upon. But that cannot be a conclusive consideration on an application seeking to invoke the wider principle of <i>res judicata</i>.  If it were, attempts to re-litigate matters that should have been litigated in earlier proceedings would never be struck out asan abuse of the courtâs process.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  On the contrary, in my view, the failed attempt by Healthy Living to amend in the 2003 Action is a weighty factor in support ofthe conclusion that its present action is an abuse of process.  It is relevant, when looking at the question of abuse, to considerthe consequences to a defendant of allowing issues to be re-litigated.  In this context, the 2003 Action proceeded to trial and MrMurray was entitled to think, after the trial of that action, that his ownership of the Property, so far as Healthy Living was concerned,was conclusively determined. This belief would reasonably have been reinforced by the subsequent events of: (i) the dismissal ofthe application for a stay of execution of the judgment in the 2003 Action, (ii) the dismissal of the application that the FormalAgreement had been annulled and for an order postponing completion until after the determination of the 2006 Action, (iii) the dismissalof the appeal in CACV 168/2006 against the judgment in the 2003 Action, (iv) the execution of the formal assignment of the Propertyto Mr Murray pursuant to the order for specific performance, and (v) the striking out, as an abuse of process, of the 2006 Actionseeking to advance a claim by a different but closely related party, Nu Life International, to a beneficial interest in the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In all these circumstances, the institution of this action by Healthy Living was, in my opinion, clearly an abuse of process.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I turn then to consider the position of Madam Chan.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Despite Mr Bellâs submissions to the contrary, I consider the Deputy Judge was right in Â§42 of the Decision where he held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ there is certainly a sufficient degree of identification between her and Healthy Living so that the decision in the first actionshould be binding on her in this action.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  It is clear, in my judgment, that Madam Chan played an active role in the sale of the Property.  She signed both the ProvisionalAgreement and the Formal Agreement for Healthy Living.  She is and was at all material times a director of Healthy Living.  Althoughit appears she did not become a shareholder of the company until November 2006, the shares she acquired then were transferred toher by her two sons.  It was clearly a family-owned company.  In addition, Madam Chan gave a witness statement for Healthy Livingin the 2003 Action and gave evidence on its behalf at the trial of that action.  And after judgment in the 2003 Action, she signedthe assignment of the Property giving effect to the order for specific performance in favour of Mr Murray.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Although Mr Bell sought to minimise the role played by Madam Chan in these matters and submitted that she could not have been thedirecting mind of Healthy Living for the 2003 Action, the fact remains that the claim in that action concerned matters with whichshe had been closely involved.  Healthy Living was a family company and, on his own evidence, her son, Mr Khan, was conducting thelitigation on its behalf.  It beggars belief that Mr Khan and his solicitors (who were also representing Healthy Living) would nothave kept Madam Chan fully informed of the status of the litigation. They would clearly have been in a position to advise her onall necessary steps to be taken to advance her interests in respect of the Property, so far as they were not already being advancedby Healthy Living, and to arrange for those steps to be taken.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  As for the medical reports, although these were based on examinations of Madam Chan in December 2005, the evidence is directed atthe mental capacity of Madam Chan when she signed the Provisional and Formal Agreements in June 2003.  Dr Lai opines as to MadamChanâs mental capacity to manage and administer her assets and affairs in June 2003 but does not say that, throughout the timewhen the 2003 Action was being litigated, Madam Chanâs health prevented her from applying to be joined as a party to that action.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In these circumstances, despite the evidence of Madam Chanâs physical and mental illnesses as disclosed in Dr Laiâs reports,I am not persuaded that there was any reasonable excuse for Madam Chan not applying to be joined in the 2003 Action and to raisein that action the issues she now wishes to ventilate in this action.  There is no suggestion the facts on which the allegationsof duress and undue influence Madam Chan now seeks to advance were not known at the outset of the 2003 Action by Mr Khan (who wasrunning the litigation).  An application by Madam Chan to join as a party to the 2003 Action would not have been an onerous or undulydifficult exercise. There is no reason why Healthy Livingâs legal advisers, who also acted in the 2003 Action for Mr Khan, couldnot have acted for her as well.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  It follows that I consider the Deputy Judge was justified in drawing the inference, notwithstanding the medical evidence reliedupon, that Madam Chanâs decision not to join in the 2003 Action was âobviously her considered decisionâ.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> </p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  In my judgment, the institution of this action by Healthy Living and Madam Chan was an abuse of process within the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> in its wider sense and it was therefore open to the Deputy Judge to exercise his discretion to strike it out.  This convenientlyleads to the next issue to be considered.</p>    <p class="heading">Are there special circumstances to justify this action?</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Mr Bell submitted that the Deputy Judge failed to take into account the special circumstances of the case which were that MadamChan did not have legal advice in the 2003 Action and that her physical and mental health was such that she was not capable of engagingactively in that action.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Since these are the same arguments relied on by Mr Bell in support of his submission that the present action by Madam Chan is notan abuse of process, the analysis above applies equally here.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The Deputy Judge clearly had the medical evidence concerning Madam Chan in mind when he was considering the application before himsince he referred, at paragraph 43 of the Decision, to the argument advanced on behalf of Madam Chan below:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ that the defendants in the first action could not have amended their defence to plead duress and undue influence on Chan andto adduce the two medical reports by Dr Benjamin Lai on Chan dated 3 January and 10 January 2006. Dr Lai in these reports was ofthe opinion that Chan was mentally not competent to sign the formal agreement.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  And at paragraph 45, he described the special circumstances urged on him by counsel then appearing for Healthy Living and MadamChan<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a> as being:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ She was not legally represented and had not obtained legal advice. She also had a long history of medical problems as detailedin the medical reports. Account should also be taken of whether she could have expressed herself and described what had happenedin the sale and purchase of the property.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  I therefore do not accept that Mr Bell was correct in submitting that the Deputy Judge considered Madam Chanâs medical conditiononly in the context of whether that issue could only be raised in the 2003 Action and not in the context of whether that medicalcondition had affected her ability to make an application to join the 2003 Action in the period from its commencement in 2003 until2006.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  So far as the special circumstances were concerned, the Deputy Judge did not accept that these justified the bringing of this actionby Madam Chan.  At paragraph 48 of the Decision, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âRegarding the argument that Chan had no legal advice, this ignores the fact that her son and her company, Healthy Living, wereall along legally represented. She had also given evidence as a witness in the first action. The sale and purchase of the propertywas a matter that she and her son had tremendous interests in. She was not a distant or independent party to the matter. I do notaccept that she was so ignorant and had not been taken care of by her son and her sonâs advisers.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  For the reasons I have already set out above, I agree with the Deputy Judgeâs conclusion that the special circumstances do notjustify Madam Chan in maintaining this action against Mr Murray.</p>    <p class="heading">Madam Chanâs claims not viable in any event</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  As noted above, as regards Madam Chanâs claims for damages, the Deputy Judge held that these did not give rise to any legallyviable claim for damages for mental anxiety, emotional distress, physical discomfort or inconvenience caused by an alleged breachof contract (Decision Â§51) and also that these did not give rise to any legal viable claim for damages for the tort of intentionalinfliction of emotional distress (Decision Â§52).  He accordingly struck out these claims.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  There is no appeal against his holdings in this regard and so those claims could not be restored in any event.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  For the above reasons, I do not consider there is any material error vitiating the Deputy Judgeâs exercise of discretion to strikeout this action as an abuse of process and I would dismiss this appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  On the question of costs, the Deputy Judge awarded costs to Mr Murray on an indemnity basis since he held that this was the thirdtime Mr Murray had been vexed with the same subject matter.  There was no appeal against the Deputy Judgeâs decision on costs independentof the appeal itself and so his costs order must stand. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  So far as the costs of the appeal are concerned, these must follow the event.  Mr Bell submitted that there was no reason thesecosts should be taxed on a higher scale unless the court were to take the view that the appeal was itself abusive.  However, sincethe outcome of the appeal is that this Court agrees with the Deputy Judge that the institution of this action constitutes an unjustharassment of Mr Murray, I consider that the costs of the appeal should also be taxed on an indemnity basis, if not agreed.</p>	<p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Bharwaney J:</b></p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  I agree with the judgment of Fok JA and with the proposed orders.</p>	<p> </p>		<p> </p>	        <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%" valign="top">                (Joseph Fok)<br />                Justice of Appeal</td>                <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%" valign="top">                (Mohan Bharwaney)<br />                Judge of the<br />                Court of First Instance</td>            </tr>        </table>		<p> </p>		<!--sino section representation --><representation>		<p>Mr Adrian Bell SC &amp; Mr James Wong, instructed by Messrs Huen &amp; Partners, for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs/Appellants</p>		<p>Mr Lee Tung Ming, instructed by Messrs Wong, Hui &amp; Co., for the Defendant/Respondent</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->		<p> </p>    <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="" id="_ftn1"><b>[1]</b></a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 581</a> at 590.</p>    <p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="" id="_ftn2"><b>[2]</b></a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%203%20Hare%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a> at 115.</p>    <p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="" id="_ftn3"><b>[3]</b></a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 1.</a></p>    <p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="" id="_ftn4"><b>[4]</b></a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 1</a> at 59C-E and 59H-60A.</p>    <p><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="" id="_ftn5"><b>[5]</b></a> Decision Â§37.</p>    <p><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="" id="_ftn6"><b>[6]</b></a> Not Mr Bell.</p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2011/246.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
