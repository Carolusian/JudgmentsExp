On 23rd June 1989 a writ was issued against them by the three plaintiffs. The writwas indorsed with a Statement of Claim which begins by stating the following. The 1st plaintiff, C.S. Low Investment Limited, isa company incorporated in Hong Kong. The 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs, Mr. Low Chung Song and Mr. Low Chung Seng ("the Lows") are directorsof the company and own 55% of its share capital. The 1st plaintiff company owned over 40% of the issued share capital in the Ka WahBank Limited until June 1986 when, as a result of a restructuring of the Bank, that shareholding was substantially reduced. The Lowswere executive directors of the Bank until 1st March 1986 and directors of the Bank thereafter until 23rd June 1986.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The Statement of Claim goes on to plead that between January 1986 and June 1987 the plaintiffs retained Freshrields as their solicitors,inter alia, in relation to the matters set out in a Schedule. By virtue of that retainer, Freshfields owed them a duty in contractand at common law to exercise reasonable care and skill in rendering legal advice and other professional services.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The Schedule refers to advice as to the extent of the statutory powers and duties of the Commissioner of Banking; concerning theresignation of the Lows as executive directors of the Ka Wah Bank, and on their liability on certain personal guarantees given infavour of the Hongkong Bank. Freshfields were also to advise upon, and represent the plaintiffs in respect of, the negotiation ofcapital reduction of the Ka Wah Bank and the proposed purchase of shares in that Bank by the China International Trust and InvestmentCorporation ("CITIC"); to attend and vote at meetings on the plaintiffs' behalf at an EGM of the Ka wan Bank; and to advise on thedrafts of an audit report dated 31st December 1985 prepared by Touche Ross, as well as the terms of the representation letter tobe sighed by the directors of the Ka Wah Bank.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The Schedule then states that Freshfields were to prepare a full statement concerning the involvement of all the plaintiffs in theKa Wah Bank. The instructions for the preparation of the Statement included, it is said, the following matters:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="5%" valign="top">                        <p style="text-align:right" class="quote">"</p>                    </td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(1)</td>                    <td width="88%" class="quote">                        Involvement of David Li, the Managing Director of East Asia Warburg  Limited ("E.A.W."), in discussions concerningCITIC and a Secret memo concerning E.A.W.                        <p class="quote"> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(2)</td>                    <td width="88%" class="quote">                        The role of David Li in the AMRO/Amev/Kaihin negotiations.                        <p class="quote"> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(3)</td>                    <td width="88%" class="quote">                        The actions of the Hong Kong Bank in connection with Ka Wah.                        <p class="quote"> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(4)</td>                    <td width="88%" class="quote">                        The actions of the Commissioner in connection with Ka Wah.                        <p class="quote"> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(5)</td>                    <td width="88%" class="quote">The involvement of Scnroders in the AMRO/Amev/Kaihin negotiations, including the interests of Paul Banner of Cambridge Financial ServicesLtd."</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> According to the Schedule, Freshfields were retained also to advise on possible clams by the shareholders of the Ka Wah Bank, andon other civil and criminal proceedings which might be brought against the plaintiffs; on deeds of indemnity signed, and monies depositedby them in the Ka Wah Bank; on any possible counterclaims they might have and generally to advise the Lows as former directors ofthe Ka Wah Bank.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Schedule goes on to say that Freshfields were also to prepare a Memorandum of Advice on the basis of the statement earlier referredto as to any potential claims the plaintiffs might have against the Commissioner and his advisers, the Hongkong Bank, East Asia Warburg,Michael Clark, W.C.

The Schedule concludes with the following statement: "The said Memorandum of Advicewas completed and was to the effect that the plaintiffs have no possible claim against any of the proposed defendants."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Returning to the body of the Statement of Claim, I have to confess that try as I might I have found it impossible adequately to summariseall that follows the introductory paragraphs.

The relief sought, under paragraphs (b), (c) and(d) of O.18, r. 19(1) and the inherent jurisdiction, was that the following parts of the Statement of Claim be struck out :</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="8%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">(i)</td>                    <td width="6%"></td>                    <td width="87%">                        the words "or might be" in paragraph 6(1);                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="8%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">(ii)</td>                    <td width="6%"></td>                    <td width="87%">                        the second sentence of paragraph 6(3);                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="8%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">(iii)</td>                    <td width="6%"></td>                    <td width="87%">                        paragraphs 7 to 12 inclusive; and                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="8%" style="text-align:right" valign="top">(iv)</td>                    <td width="6%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="87%">paragraphs (1) to (5) inclusive of the prayer for relief.</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The summons was supported by an affidavit dated 5th October 1989 sworn by Mr Mark Freeman, the senior partner of Freshfields' HongKong Office. He has been a partner since 1974. He stated that the Lows were referred to him in January 1986 by the then senior partnerof Slaughter &amp; way (Hong Kong Office) acting for the Ka Wah Bank who felt that the Lows should have separate representation inthe negotiations then taking place for CITIC to acquire the Bank, in the light of their substantial shareholding, through the 1stplaintiff, in the Bank. He was told that they also required advice in their capacity as directors of the Bank. Mr. Freeman said heunderstood that Slaughter &amp; May would continue to act for and advise the Bank, as they had done.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> When Mr. Freeman met the Lows, according to his affidavit, he was told that the matter upon which they needed immediate advice waswhether the Commissioner of Banking of the day had the powers he had purported to exercise under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/155/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/155" class="autolink_findacts">Banking Ordinance</a> in indirectly requiring the executive directors of the Ka Wah Bank (as we know, the Lows were such) to make themselves availablein Hong Kong unless given permission by the Commissioner to go abroad.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr. Freeman's affidavit continues by saying that Fresnfields had, upon the instructions of the Lows, given them advice and had actedfor them, in connection with a number of matters arising out of the restructuring of the Ka Wah Bank and their position as directorsand indirect shareholders of the Bank. They had also given advice and acted for the Lows in various libel proceedings. In respectof the matters referred to in the Statement of Claim, Freshfields had ceased to act on 14th July 1987 by which date criminal proceedingshad been instituted against the Lows in Hong Kong.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr. Freeman categorically denies that Freshfields ever acted for the following parties named in subparagraphs (1) to (5) of paragraph7 of the Statement of Claim:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="3%"></td>                    <td width="8%" valign="top">(a)</td>                    <td width="89%">                        the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Bank;                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%"></td>                    <td width="8%" valign="top">(b)</td>                    <td width="89%">                        the Hong Kong Government;                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%"></td>                    <td width="8%" valign="top">(c) </td>                    <td width="89%">                        Mr. David Li (personally or in any other capacity) ;                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%"></td>                    <td width="8%" valign="top">(d)</td>                    <td width="89%">The Hang Lung Bank.</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> About the Overseas Trust Bank Ltd. ("OTB") mentioned in paragraph 7(1), Mr. Freeman states that the fact that Freshfields were actingfor OTB (advice which went back to December 1985) was well known to the Lows. He was "almost certain" that they were told about thisin January 1986. He asserts that the fact that Freshfields continued to act for OTB in a claim against its former auditors in noway conflicted with their duties to the plaintiffs. Mr. Freeman refers to various file notes, letters, etc., copies of which areexhibited - which, he says, show that the plaintiffs were fully aware of Freshfields involvement with OTB, and he said he recalledthat "there was no sense of embarrassment or awkwardness at our position following an enquiry from another firm of solicitors actingfor OTB in other matters."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Regarding East Asia Waroburg, Mr. Freeman says that Freshfields acted for them in a small matter in August 1986 when they gave adviceabout the placing of a block of shares conferring control in a Hong Kong listed company to a number of independent investors without"triggering" the mandatory bid provisions of the Takeover Code. Although this matter was not mentioned to the plaintiffs, Mr. Freemansaid, he did not believe that there was any possible conflict of interest between involvement in that transaction and advising theplaintiffs about a possible claim against East Asia warburg.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> As regards S.G. Warburg and the Bank of England, Mr. Freeman acknowledges that Freshfields, through their London office, acted forthem during the period covered by their retainer from the plaintiffs. He said that Freshfields had acted for the Bank of Englandsince 1743 and worked extensively for S.G. Warburg in London. Mr. Freeman named the three other persons in his Hong Kong office whohad advised the plaintiffs in relation to the matters referred to in the Statement of Claim and stated that none of them was involvedin advising or acting for S.G. Warburg (or the bank of England) in London.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In respect of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Mr. Freeman states that Freshfields had done some work for the Bank,"mostly in Singapore, but also some in London, and one matter, and two small pieces of advice in Hong Kong."</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Mr. Freeman also states that Freshfields did not act for any of the parties named in connection with the restructuring of the KaWah Bank as alleged in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim and firmly denies that his firm received secret fees, profits and benefitsfrom any of them. We have seen that that paragraph has now been abandoned.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> It is, I think, necessary to emphasize here that none of the facts averred in Mr. Freeman's affidavit, sworn now some 8 months ago,has been challenged or otherwise controverted in any particular.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In his extempore judgment given at the conclusion of the hearing which spread over two days, the learned judge said this, aster abrief introduction:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">            "Mr. Thomas for the plaintiffs submitted that they had made out a sufficient claim for breach of fiduciary duty in thestatement of claim.

The sufficiency or otherwiseof this part of the pleading was not canvassed before the judge because the summons dated 11th September 1989 taken out by Freshfieldsmade no mention of it. However, in the light of the preliminary views we had formed about the averments of negligence at an earlystage of the hearing of this appeal we invited argument on the question whether paragraph 5 should be allowed to stand.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> When a client alleges that a solicitor acting for him has been negligent by, say, failing to issue a writ within the relevant limitationperiod, or by omitting to give notice of an assignment so that he suffers loss, pleading the negligence is relatively simple. Wherethe claim against a solicitor is that negligent advice was given the matter becomes more complicated, but the pleader is not excusedof his obligations under the rules relating to pleadings. It is surely well established that it is simply not enough for a plaintiffin effect merely to allege that the defendant has acted negligently and thereby caused him damage. He must set out all the materialfacts which show precisely in what respect the defendant was negligent so that the defendant knows what case he has to meet. Onehas only to look at subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) of paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim to see now lacking in the necessary particularsthey are. There are averments which indicate under what heads the negligence claims are put forward but no facts are pleaded to foundthe allegation of negligence with which each subparagraph begins. If a surgeon is being sued for his negligent treatment of a patient,a pleading which merely avers that the surgeon negligently treated the patient, without particulars being given of the negligenceand lack of skill complained of, will obviously fall short of what is required and fail to disclose a cause of action. If someonesues his stockbroker for negligently advising that he should buy certain shares, without more, his pleading will be defective.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> As to paragraph 6(4) of the Statement of Claim, an affidavit (which was not before the judge but parts of which were placed beforeus without objection from Mr. Martin Tomas) sworn by Mr. Hugh Stubbs, another partner of Freshfields, draws attention to the avermentsin the Statement of Claim about the alleged failure of Freshfields to instruct leading counsel. He states that the plaintiffs firstput forward the possibility of obtaining legal advice from leading counsel in London at a meeting he held with them in Taipei onthe 26th and 27th September 1986. On 22nd October 1986, the 2nd plaintiff had told him on the telephone that he would be visitingLondon and had asked whether it would be appropriate for him to pay a courtesy call at Freshfield's London Office and also to discussthe matter with leading counsel. Mr. Stubbs says that he repeated advice he had earlier given that the suggestion was not practicalsince it would probably not be possible to brief leading counsel properly before the visit. The advice was repeated to the otherMr. Low in a telephone conversation on 25th October 1986 and in a fax message of 27th October, which is exhibited. Mr. Stubbs statesthat no further mention of instructing leaning counsel was made until he wrote to the Lows on 19th November enclosing a Memorandumof Advice on potential claims available to the 1st plaintiff company in connection with events surrounding the restructuring of theKa Wah Bank. That letter is also exhibited. I think it is as well to read relevant extracts from the two fax messages, and the letter:</p>    <p> </p>    <p class="quote">                    "[Fax dated 10th October 1986]</p>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">I suggest that in order to provide you with the advice we should proceed as follows:-</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">1.</td>                    <td width="90%" class="quote">                        Identify the issues on which we should provide advice.                        <p class="quote"> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">2.</td>                    <td width="90%" class="quote">                        Provide you with a written memorandum of advice.                        <p class="quote"> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%" valign="top" class="quote"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">3.</td>                    <td width="90%" class="quote">Discuss with you which issues advice from a London QC should be obtained on and recommend a QC accordingly."</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p class="quote">                    "[Fax dated 27th October 1986]</p>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">We thus expect to be in a position by Monday November 17 to have a set of papers with which a QC can be properly briefed.

I mean no disrespect to Mr. Thomas when I say(using the language of O.19, r.18) that on the material before us this averment, in whatever form, is frivolous as being groundlessand fanciful.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> I now refer to paragraph 5(5) of the Statement of Claim ("Negligently failing to instruct counsel to give independent advice.....")merely (but with all due respect) to express surprise that such an averment featured in the pleading arid was then supported beforeus.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Towards the end of his submissions, Mr. Thomas withdrew all the averments, made implicitly, but clearly enough, that Freshfieldshad not acted impartially in the services they rendered to the plaintiffs (see paragraphs 5(5), 6(2), 8 and 12 of the Statement ofClaim).</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Mr. Thomas also withdrew the whole of paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim with its allegations regarding "secret fees, profits"etc. "in connection with or arising from the said restructuring of Ka Wah", as well as other references to secret fees and profitsin paragraph 6(4) and in paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) of the prayer for relief. It became perfectly clear during argument that thesevery serious allegations against a well-known firm of solicitors were totally without foundation. Quite apart from their duty totheir client, taking a secret profit might be a criminal offence and will certainly amount to professional misconduct. Had counselsettled the pleading he would have been obliged to sign it; here counsel did not and so it was signed by the plaintiffs' solicitors(O.18, r.6(5)). The notes in paragraphs 18/6/1 of the white Book cite from the judgment of a case decided well over 100 years agowhere it was said that the signature of counsel "to which the court [pays] the greater possible respect, is to that extent a voucherthat the case is not a mere fiction." I hope it will not be thought impertinent if I ask whether solicitors signing a pleading wouldwish to be judged by any lesser standard of responsibility. It was an appalling error of judgment in the circumstances of the caseto include paragraph 10 in the Statement of Claim. Solicitors must not allow themselves to be the instrument of their clients tosettle a pleading containing groundless allegations of that sort.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> As the claim was originally pleaded, it was no part of the plaintiffs' case that the matters in respect of which Freshfields acted,or continued to act, for the parties mentioned in paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim were matters which in view of the natureof the retainers put Freshfields in a position where their duties respectively to those parties and to the plaintiffs were in conflict.The averment was that simply by acting or continuing to act for those parties Freshfields were in breach of their fiduciary dutiesto the plaintiffs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> When one turns to paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim (without paragraph(1) of the particulars which was added during the hearingbefore Mayo J.) as we have seen, the paragraph begins with an averment that because Freshfields acted or continued to act for theparties named in paragraph 7 in the course of the plaintiffs' retainer Freshfields were "in possession of a substantial amount ofinformation, known to the plaintiffs, which had or might have a bearing on the instructions." Particulars were promised after discovery.During the strike out application, particulars were added which in reality founds what remains of the claim against Freshfields -the failure to disclose to the plaintiffs that they were acting for the parties referred to in paragraph 7.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> If I understood correctly the contentions advanced by Mr. Thomas in support of the judge's decision, as he developed them after considerablereformulation during the hearing of the appeal, they were to this effect. The solicitor/client relationship is a fiduciary one. Oneof the fiduciary duties owed to a client is that there be full disclosure to him of all material facts. It is a material fact thatany member of the solicitor's firm working in an office at home or abroad has accepted instructions from a party when they were instructedby the client to advise whether he had a cause of action against that party. It is a material fact because it might affect the client'sdecision whether or not to retain, or continue to retain, the solicitor. If there is non-disclosure, then, whether or not there wasa real conflict of duty and duty, or duty and interest, in relation to the client and the other party, an actionable breach of dutyhas occurred for which equity will grant relief by way of compensation. The proper measure of compensation on the facts here is forthe client to recover either the fees he has paid to the solicitor who has failed in his duty or to recover the expenses he has hadto meet in paying for other legal advice which he had to seek because the breach of duty destroyed his confidence in the advice hehad earlier received, without any enquiry as to the nature, extent and timing of the professional services rendered to the otherparty. All this does not depend upon whether or not the advice first given is proves to be sound or not, or whether any loss in thereal sense has resulted.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> I do not think it can be doubted that Cordery on Solicitors (8th Edition) pp.64-65 sets out the true position as established by theauthorities. I set out the "general rule":</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"A solicitor who has been retained by a client is under an absolute duty not to disclose any information of a confidential naturewhich has come to his knowledge by virtue of the retainer, and to exercise the utmost good faith towards his client hot only forso long as the retainer lasts but even after the termination of the retainer, in respect of any information acquired during the courseof and by virtue of the retainer; and the court will restrain the solicitor by injunction from any breach likely to injure the client,and award damages for breach. There is no absolute rule prohibiting a solicitor who has acted for one client in a matter subsequentlyacting for an opposite party in the same matter, but where a solicitor owes a duty to a third party which conflicts with his dutyto a particular client he is not relieved of his duty to that client.</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>                <p class="quote">            As a general rule a solicitor should not accept instructions to act for persons whose interests are or are likely to bein conflict; if he does so he acts at his peril, and the onus of showing that the conflicting interests did hot prevent him fromdoing his duty to both clients must rest firmly on the solicitor. A conflict of interest does not invalidate the authority of thesolicitor under his retainer out he should not act for a party in a transaction in which he has an adverse interest."</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> Paragraph 133 of Halsbury (4th Edition) Vol.44, is to much the same effect. The authors of both works rely, inter alia, on <u>Rakusen</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Ellis, Munday and Clarke</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%201%20Ch%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] 1 Ch. 831</a> for the propositions most important to the issues before us. I take the facts from the headnote:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"M. and C were the only partners in a firm of solicitors named E.M. &amp; C. and were in the habit of doing business separately andwithout any knowledge of each other's clients. R. consulted M. with reference to an action for wrongful dismissal which he desiredto commence against a company. He then changed his solicitors and issued his writ, and the matter was referred to arbitration, theproceedings in which were still in progress. C. was away at the time and knew nothing of the consultations between R. and M., andwhilst the arbitration was going oh he was appointed under the name of &amp; C. to act as solicitor for the company in the arbitration.R.. applied for an injunction to restrain E.M. &amp; C. from acting for the Company: -"</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> At first instance, Warrington J. held that the principle which had been laid down was that a solicitor, having once been employedto act for a man, should not act against him in the same matter; although there was no imputation against the firm of solicitorsconcerned and no danger of anything improper being done, they would be restrained by injunction (undertakings having been offeredto the court and refused) from acting as the company's solicitors in the arbitration proceedings.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The Court of Appeal held that there was no such general rule (rather of the kind suggested by Mr. Thomas). Cozens-Hardy M.R. said,at p.835:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"I do not doubt for a moment that the circumstances may be such that a solicitor ought not to be allowed to put himself in such aposition that, human nature being what it is, he cannot clear his mind from the information which he has confidentially obtainedfrom his former client; but in my view we must treat each of these cases, not as a matter of form, not as a matter to be decidedon the mere proof of a former acting for a client, but as a matter of substance, before we allow the special jurisdiction over solicitorsto be invoked, We must be satisfied that real mischief and real prejudice will in all human probability result if the solicitor isallowed to act."</p>                <p> </p>                <p>At p.842, Buckley L.J. said this:</p>                <p> </p>                <p class="quote">"There is a general principle, applicable not to solicitors only but to confidential agents of all kinds, that confidential informationshall not be used against the principal from whom, or for whom, and in whose employment, it has been obtained. There is no generalrule that a solicitor who has acted in a particular matter for one party shall not under any circumstances subsequently act in thatmatter for his opponent. Whether he will be restrained from so acting or not depends on the particular circumstances ..........."</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>And at p.843, he had this to say:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"Mr. Cave has asserted this general principle, which he says is to be found in the authorities - that when a solicitor has acted fora client in a particular matter he or his partners, cannot act against that client in anything relating to that matter, and thatthis is true irrespective of the particular circumstances of the case. I am of opinion that there is no such principle. There isno law that because a solicitor has acted for a person he may not afterwards act against him in the same matter. It depends on circumstanceswhether he shall be allowed to act or not."</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> For Freshfields, Mr. Newman, who did not appear in the court below, relied heavily on that authority for the general principles itlays down. Mr. Thomas acknowledged that the case was against him, but submitted that the law had been developed by a number of Canadiancases which he cited to us. For my part, I did not find any assistance in those cases and I do not read them as affecting the principlesapplied in the <u>Rakusen</u> case. I have no doubt that we should follow that autnority which has stood for so long, and not attempt to extend the well-establishedresponsibilities of solicitors when acting for opposing interests, to the confusion of the profession and the courts and withoutany legitimate benefit accruing to clients.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> It seems to me clear that the plaintiffs did not have a cause of action based on breach of fiduciary duty unless they were able toplead (and later prove) an actual conflict of duty and not merely a theoretical one, with resulting loss. I accept Mr. Newman's submissionthat if they are to have a valid cause of action, they must plead, which they do not, a causal connection between the matters inrespect of which Freshfields were retained to act for the plaintiffs and the matters in respect of which they were retained to actfor the other parties. The plaintiffs made no attempt to identify the duties and interest alleged to be in conflict (they say thisis irrelevant). All that is as a matter of pleading. As to facts, Mr. Freeman's affidavit (and there is nothing contra) shows thatthere would be ho substance in any allegations of actual conflict of interest or of any detriment whatever being suffered by theplaintiffs, if such were to be made.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> As his judgment shows, the learned judge relied upon <u>Nocton</u> v. <u>Ashburton</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1914%5d%20AC%20932" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1914] A.C. 932.</a> That case is, of course, of high authority for the principles it re-states. It makes it clear, inter alia, that an action may lieagainst a solicitor for loss suffered by his client through a misrepresentation made to him in breach of the solicitor's duty (toexercise due care and skill in the management of his affairs) without any fraudulent intent in the common law sense. There is alsoLord Haldane's valuable account of breaches of duty to which equity attaches its sanction. As well, the case shows, that due to thefiduciary relationship involved, a solicitor may incur liability for failure to fulfil his duty to make full disclosure to his clienteven though his conduct may fall short of negligence at common law. But in my judgment, neither that case, nor the Canadian authorityalso relied upon by the judge, <u>Jacks</u> v. <u>Davis</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=141%20DLR%20%283d%29%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">141 D.L.R. (3d.) 355</a> help to resolve the issues raised by Freshfields' summons.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> With very great respect to tae judge who took a different view, in my judgment a proper evaluation of the pleading and the othermaterial before the court makes it plain and obvious that the entire pleading is incurably bad; indeed I go so far as to say thatall the defects enumerated in subparagraphs (a) to (d) of O.19, r.18(1) are present.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The claims as formulated are quite hopeless and are wound to fail. No answers to requests for particulars will save a pleading whichhis so fundamentally bad. No application has been made to amend the Statement of Claim and, in my view, it is not capable of legitimateamendment, however radical, for it is wholly misconceived.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> The averments regarding secret profits and those which imply a failure to give impartial advice, all rightly, albeit rather belatedly,abandoned; the unparticularised allegations of negligence; the absence of a plea of what I will call a real conflict of interest,with resulting loss, all point, I am sorry to have to say, to a serious abuse of the process of the court.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> An appellate court can only interfere with the discretion of a judge on well known principles which I will not re-state here. Again,with very great respect to the judge, I entertain no doubt that a discretion properly exercised in this case could only have beenexercised in one way.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> I would therefore allow the appeal and have no hesitation in proposing that the whole Statement of Claim be struck out even thoughthe entire pleading was not sought to be struck out on the application before the judge. That we have the inherent power to do thisis made plain, for example, by <u>Huntly</u> v. <u>Gaskell</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%202%20Ch%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] 2 Ch. 656.</a> We cannot allow the machinery of the court to be used as a means of vexatious oppression. These were proceedings which should neverhave been launched and which have been allowed to remain alive for too long as it is.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The order I would make, therefore, is that the appeal be allowed, the Statement of Claim in its entirety (together with the writupon which it is indorsed) be struck out and that judgment be entered for the defendants dismissing the action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Hunter J.A. :</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> I agree, and would only add some words of my own by reason of the unusual nature of these proceedings and of this appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> I am satisfied that these proceedings constitute the plainest abuse of the process of this court which this court of its own motionshould bring to an end. My reasons for so concluding are as follows.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> First, "the particulars of negligence" pleaded are totally hollow and lacking in substance. Particulars (1), (2) and (3) are simplyheads of complaint which lack every essential allegation of fact. Particular (4) was accepted as insupportable in fact as it stands.The suggested substitution that the defendants were negligent in advising the plaintiffs not to instruct leading counsel was equallyunparticularised and untenable. Particular (5) is insupportable without a particularised allegation that the defendants had authorityexpress or implied to instruct junior counsel.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> Secondly, until half-way through the argument in this court, the Statement of Claim contained two very serious allegations againstthe defendants calculated to cause them the greatest concern. The first was the overt insinuation that the advice they tendered tothe plaintiffs was partial, without a single fact alleged in support of it. The second was the alleged receipt of "secret fees, profitsand benefits" in circumstances which had no connection even with the earlier allegations of breach of duty. The plaintiffs properlysubmitted to the striking out of these allegations. But when a party makes allegations of this nature in this way, and then circulatesthe pleading very widely from the safety of Taiwan, he cannot complain if a court draws adverse conclusions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Thirdly, the rump of the Statement of Claim can be seen to be devoid of substance both in its original form and as later amendedand explained in argument. The original formulation of principle in paragraph 6(1) was in part correct when it emphasised the requirementof conflict between interest and duty or duty and duty, and the risk of conflict which arises where interests are adverse. As thedecision in <u>Rakusen v Ellis Munday and Clarke</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%201%20Ch%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] 1 Ch 831</a> shows, the relevant principle is part of the law of confidential relationships which applies with particular force to solicitors.As Buckley LJ emphasised at pps 643, 645, the solicitor's basic duty is "not to communicate confidential information", and when therisk of this is sufficiently proved the court will interfere quia timet by way of injunction. But the court rejected the broad technicalprinciple formulated by Warrington J that the court would not even enquire into the facts and that the creation of any risk of conflictsufficed. As Cozens-Hardy MR observed: -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p class="quote">"Many busy solicitors in this country would find it impossible to carry on their business at all if that was the true rule" p 839.</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> The court made it clear that the question in every case is one of fact. Taking by way of illustration the example or a solicitorwho is acting for A but is then invited to act for B, this necessarily involves consideration of the relationship between the termsand nature of the retainer from A and to the confidential information received from him, with the terms and nature of the retaineroffered from B and to the nature of the confidential information likely to follows its acceptance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> It sees to me that the problem can be analysed thus: -</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="3%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top">(1)</td>                    <td width="90%">                        If investigation of B's proposed retainer reveals that it is quite unconnected with the relevant affairsof A, or if there appears to be no prospect of conflict, the solicitor may safely act for B.                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top">(2)</td>                    <td width="90%">                        If on the other hand a potential risk of conflict is revealed, the solicitor accepts instructions from Bat his peril, but does not by his act of acceptance reach his fiducary duty to either.                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top">(3)</td>                    <td width="90%">                        The solicitor only commits a breach of this duty to either client if the position of conflict leads him togive defective advice or to fail to give proper advice or information to either client.                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%" valign="top"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top">(4)</td>                    <td width="90%">If in consequence of such behaviour either client suffers damage, his cause of action whether for compensation in equity or for damagesis complete.</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> This analysis snows that if A wishes to complain of his solicitor's conduct in relation to B, he must be in a position to plead andprove facts which show</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <table border="0" width="90%">                <tr>                    <td width="3%"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top">(i)</td>                    <td width="90%">                        Actual conflict;                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top">(ii)</td>                    <td width="90%">                        Breach of duty;                        <p> </p>                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td width="3%"></td>                    <td width="7%" valign="top">(iii)</td>                    <td width="90%">Consequential loss or damage.</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> This Statement of Claim does none of these things, and indeed it is denied that they are necessary. It is fundamentally defective.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Mr Martin Thomas, QC sought to justify these omissions by recourse to a quite different duty from that pleaded originally or thenhinted at by way of amendment, to the effect, in the example I have taken, that the solicitor committee a breach of his duty to Aif without A's informed consent he accepted instructions of any Kind from any person who is the subject matter of the solicitor'sadvice to A and might become a defendant in proceeding by A. In this case, for example, it was said that the defendants should nothave accepted instructions to act for Bast Asia warburg (EAW) even in respect of a non-contentious matter in no way  connected withany possible claim which might be made by the plaintiffs against EAW, without informing the plaintiffs so that the plaintiffs hada free choice whether to continue to retain the defendants' services. A corresponding parallel duty to inform EAW before acceptingits instructions was also said to arise.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Such a duty is wholly unsupported by authority and would be unworkable in practice. The performance of this alleged duty of disclosure,would require the solicitors to do that which, it is quite clear, they cannot do, namely, to reveal to either client the nature oftheir instructions and the confidential information received from the other. The suggestion that before accepting instructions toact for EAW in this case on an unconnected non-contentious matter, the solicitors should have warned EAW that they were then actingfor the plaintiffs and were advising the plaintiffs about prospective proceedings against EAW, has only to be stated to be rejected.The concept of informed choice is untenable. As the above analysis shows the problem is one which the solicitor cannot snare butmust solve for himself.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Penlington J.A.:</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> I have seen in draft the judgments of Fuad, V.-P. and Hunter, J.A. with which I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> I also have no doubt that this whole action should be struck out. Mr. Thomas  has endeavoured to show that the principles set outin <u>Rakusen</u> should now he looked at in the light of the more recent Canadian cases which he suggests apply a more stringent standard. It is howeverclear that those cases all concern injunctive relies where there was a possible danger of conflict. They do no wore than re-statethe fundamental principle that if a solicitor has received confidential information from client A he must not disclose it to anyother person. If he then acts for client B he also has a duty to him to disclose any relevant information he has. If he cannot maintainthose two positions he must not act for both clients.
