The plaintiff company is a manufacturer of plastic goods and the defendant companyis one set up as a vendor of detergent. On or about 20th September 1971 as a result of some verbal negotiation the defendant companyordered 34,000 plastic bottles with printed letters thereon and of specific design at the price of 36Â¢ each plus 120 cartons at$1.20 each from the plaintiff to be used as containers of detergent for sale. The defendant company provided the label and designfor the bottles from which moulds were made by the plaintiff company at the expense of the defendant company for the production ofthe plastic bottles. By the latter part of December 1971 some of the goods were maie. Between 21st December 1971 and 18th January1972 there had been four deliveries to the defendant company totalling 10,440 printed bottles at 32Â¢ each and 435 cartons at $1.20each. Part payments for the printed bottles and cartons delivered had been made from time to time up to 8th February 1972. After18th January 1972, however, delivery was stopped at the request of the defendant company which refused to accept further delivery.These are the common grounds between the parties according to their pleadings and the evidence before me. For these reasons the plaintiffcompany claim the balance of payment for 4,848 printed bottles at 36Â¢ each, 15,640 unprinted bottles at 16Â¢ each and 982 cartonsat $1.20 each (all of which had been made and ready for delivery), totalling $11,170 less $3,000 paid by the defendants resultingin the sum of $8,170.80 claimed by the plaintiff company.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The defendant company's case is that the bottles are defective in that the bottles do not retain the lettering printed on the exteriorof the bottles after they were filled with detergent. Such lettering on the exterior of the bottles will wipe off when handled. Thebottles are unable to retain that lettering and that the bottles bleed. There is a further defence that the defendant company neverordered any unprinted bottles.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The defendant company also counterclaim for a loss of profit in the sum of $170,294, expenses incurred for this order totalling approximately$68,286, the return of money paid for complete failure of the consideration, the return of the moulds paid for by the defendant companyor their equivalent value.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> It is alleged by the defendant company that the reason why it did not refuse delivery until 18th January 1972 was because the plaintiffcompany constantly promised improvement and admitted that the defects were caused by insufficient torching of the bottles. The defendantcompany was in desperate need of the bottles and at that time it had no other source of supply.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> As a result of the plaintiffs' breach of contract and refusal to deliver back the moulds to the defendant company the latter wasunable to find bottles for marketing their detergent until some time in May 1972. As a result the defendant company had to find substitutebottles of different design to market their detergent at a reduced price after diluting the proper concentration of their detergent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In reply to the defence and counterclaim the plaintiff company contend that there is no defect in any of the bottles. They furthercontend that the lettering on the face of the bottle came off because of defendant company's careless method of filling the bottles,causing an excessive volume of concentrated detergent to overflow on the face of the bottles. The plaintiff company further allegethat the defendant company requested stoppage of delivery in January because the latter was moving its factory to another place.The plaintiff company never informed the defendant company that the lettering came off because of insufficient torching and, in anyevent, the defendant company made no complaint until February 1972.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The plaintiff company admit that they refused to return the moulds but plead that there is a custom in the trade that moulds of suchnature are not returnable until the whole contract had been fulfilled. Alternatively the plaintiff company allege that the defendantcompany agreed the moulds should be retained by the plaintiffs as a form of deposit for the purchase price of the bottles.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> While admitting that the defendant company did not order unprinted bottles the plaintiff company allege that such unprinted bottleswere manufactured at the order of the defendant company and the plaintiff company are at all time willing, able and ready to printand deliver the said bottles.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Finally the plaintiff company deny that the defendant company suffered the alleged damages as set out in their counterclaim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Having regard to the aforesaid it appears that the issues between the parties are as follows. (1) Whether the bottles delivered bythe plaintiff company are defective as alleged by the defendant company. (2) If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative,whether such defect is one of manufacture or was caused by the mishandling of the bottles by the defendant company. (3) If it isfound that the defect in the bottles is one of manufacture, whether the damages set out in the bottles is one of manufacture, whetherthe damages set out in the counterclaim by the defendant company are the responsibility of the plaintiff company. Pausing at thisstage it is pertinent to observe that there has been no denial of the contract of sale.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The defence case is founded on their counterclaim. As such, the burden of proof is on the defendant company. The fact that the plaintiffcompany opened their case first is immaterial. Indeed, learned counsel for the plaintiff company was quite prepared to open the case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> A lot of evidence has been adduced by both parties relating to the first issue. Some of them are not directly related to the questionwhether the bottles are defective. Some of these are exaggerations given by the witness for the plaintiff company, Mr. Young, andthe witness for the defendant company, Mr. McDougald, presumably with a hope to strengthen their respective cases. Mr. Kenneth Young,who gives evidence for the plaintiff company, says that there is no defect in the bottles. In any event no complaint had been madeuntil 4th February 1972 when Mr. McDougald wrote on behalf of the defendant company complaining about the lettering coming off thebottles - in Exhibit 8. In any event there had been four prior deliveries dated 21st and 31st December 1971, 3rd and 18th January1972. Prior to any of the bottles being delivered a scotch tape test had been conducted in the presence of Mr. McDougald. After thewritten complaint in Exhibit 8 a submersion test was also performed together with Mr. McDougald by submerging the bottles into diluteddetergent. The test was a successful one. None of the lettering came off. Mr. Young's only explanation for the lettering coming offis excessive exposure to concentrated detergent which was caused by the crude process of filling the bottles by the defendant company.Mr. Young tells of what he observed on one occasion when he visited the factory of the defendant company soon after the first deliveryof the bottles in the latter part of December 1971. This has not been denied by the defence witness, Mr. McDougald. Mr. Young saysthat on that occasion he saw only a few workers in the defendant company's factory filling the empty bottles with detergent witha ladle. As a result a lot of concentrated detergent was spilt over both sides of the bottles. He suggested to Mr. McDougald to changethis very crude method of bottling. As regards that paragraph of the letter written by Mr. McDougald in Exhibit 8B which reads asfollows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"A sample of the pigment and the printing ink used in the production of the holiday bottles has been given to ICI China Ltd. alongwith information concerning the polyesterlene, the detergent and the method of application. The information and items will be forwardedto their laboratory in England for test. The result of these tests should be received in ten days. Hopefully we will find out thereason for the defective printing".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Mr. Young explains that the sample pigment had nothing whatever to do with the complaint about the defect of the bottles. The testreferred to was only at the request of Mr. McDougald to experiment for a new type of bottle for another contract. He produces tworeports of the tests conducted by the General Superintendence Co. (H.K.) Ltd. (Exhibits 20 and 21). Exhibit 20 is the report of atest conducted on 21st February 1973. It was a test conducted on the bottles still in possession of the plaintiff company and notyet delivered, chosen at random and submerged into various forms of diluted detergent. As shown in that report none of the letteringcame off. Exhibit 21 is the report of a test conducted on 30th October 1972. It is indeed only a visual inspection of the bottlesalready delivered and stored by the defendant company in No.2 Tai Yuen Terrace. As a result of this visual inspection Mr. Brockbankof the General Superintendence Co. (H.K.) Ltd. came to the following conclusion:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was noted that the majority of the plastic bottles had at some time contained concentrated detergent. The majority of the bottlesfound was in complete missing printing were found to be sticky on the outside showing that the detergent had spilt on the outside,indicating that a crude or unsatisfactory method of filling had been employed. We are of the opinion that the printing was adequatebut not proved against concentrated detergent".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Mr. Young says that at no time had he or any of his officers ever told the defendant company or their officers that there was a defectwhich was due to insufficient torching. He says that in fact the torching would have been done at an early stage of the process ofmanufacture.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Mr. McDougald, the managing director of the defendant company, gives evidence that the defect in the form of lettering coming offand colour of the bottles coming off was discovered soon after the first delivery dated 21st December 1971. He admits the crude methodof filling of the bottles at an early stage of the delivery and he admits that Mr. Young warned him of this crude method of filling.As a result he made some remedy to the method of filling and also instructed his staff that after filling all the bottles shouldbe wiped clean before packing. He says that he complained to Mr. Young about the defect in the bottles before 31st December 1971.He was promised by Mr. Young of improvement. Mr. Young said that the defect was due to insufficient torching of the bottles. IndeedMr. McDougald says that even before 31st December 1971 he had threatened cancellation of the entire contract. He accepted furtherdelivery in January because he was in desperate need of bottles to market his detergent and also because Mr. Young had promised himimprovement. He says that since early in January constant tests were made of the bottles and he was never satisfied with the resultsand he made constant complaints to Mr. Young. After the 18th January 1972 Mr. McDougald refused further delivery of the bottles becauseof the defect, not because that he was moving his factory to the Boundary Street address.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Further corroborative evidence about the defect is given by Mr. Bell who is a freelance broker. He says that at one time he triedto market the defendant company's product to various department stores and supermarkets. He says that he received certain complaintsabout the lettering coming off from one or two stores and he himself saw some of the defects from the bottles lying on the shelvesof the Park'n Shop and Oceanway Supermarket when he visited these stores in January 1972. Mr. Riddle, the then manager of the OceanwaySupermarket says that he received some of the bottled detergent from the defendant company. He says that he also observed similardefects. However, he was busy at the time around Christmas and he had not had time to ask the defendant company to take the goodsaway before the defendant company did so. Mr. Henry Steiner of Graphic Communications Ltd. also alleges that he had seen similardefect as well as colour bleeding of the bottles. Finally the defence called witness, Mr. Lau Wan-kam, who is the senior technicalofficer of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, who conducted a test on the bottles. Although the report (Exhibit 23) was signedby the Technical Director, Mr. Lau was the person who conducted the test on 28th April 1972 of the bottles chosen at random fromthose in the defendant company's possession. His test consisted of the application of various types of detergent, both in dilutedand concentrated form, on the outside of the bottles. His conclusion in Exhibit 23 is that it showed that the adhesion of the printedmatter to the sample was affected by the presence of alkali and could not stand chemical attack by alkaline substance. In his evidence,however, he says that he found that the detergent marketed by the defendant company was not alkaline based but acetic. He says thatthe yellow printing came off due to attack of detergent in the sample bottle or attack of alkaline substance or the bleeding of thegreen pigments and/or the combination of all three factors. He also gives evidence of the colour bleeding test on the bottles inaccordance with the British standard methods. The conclusion of this colour bleeding test is that the green colour bleeded out possiblybecause of the incompatibility of the green pigments in the plastic used for the bottles. He says that both the detergent and thecolour bleeding could have caused the prints to come off the bottles.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Having considered the evidence as a whole I accept the plaintiff's evidence to the extent that no complaint had been made by Mr.McDougald until after 24th January 1972 when he wrote Exhibit 7. Mr. McDougald could not have complained with a threatened cancellationof the contract in December 1971 otherwise he would not have filled his bottles with detergent and forwarded them to the distributorshowever anxious he was to market his product. Had Mr. McDougald so threatened Mr. Young of the plaintiff company would not have writtenin the terms as in Exhibit 5 which is dated 3rd January 1972. In this letter Mr. Young wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In starting the year of 1972 let me express my pleasure of having the privilege of doing business with you, and I sincerely hopethat this will mark the beginning of a pleasant relationship which will prove profitable for both of us."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Then in the concluding paragraph Mr. Young wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Your advice that no further delivery will be made until your new filling premises are ready for operation is noted and shall actaccordingly."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Further Mr. McDougald accepted delivery on 3rd January and 18th January. There is no contradiction in writing by Mr. McDougald tothe last paragraph in Exhibit 5A. If the defects were discovered as early as the latter part of December 1971 Mr. McDougald wouldnot have taken further delivery in January. Indeed he would have ordered his own test much earlier than he did. Even as late as 24thJanuary Mr. Young wrote to Mr. McDougald in Exhibit 7A in these terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Over a hundred cartons of bottles with white holiday printing and white caps are ready for delivery. Kindly let me know whether wecan start sending them to your Boundary Street depot sometime this week."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Mr. McDougald did not contradict this paragraph in writing either. For this reason I further find that there is substance in Mr. Young'sallegation that the small number of bottles delivered to the defendant company up to January not because the plaintiff company wasinefficient or that there had been any complaint about defects in the bottles but at the request of the defendant company and thestoppage of delivery was due to the moving of the defendant company to the Boundary Street address. This is strengthened by the factthat on Mr. McDougald's admission as late as December 1971 all he employed in the factory for filling the bottles were only two girls.The plaintiff company was a going concern and there would be no difficulty in effecting production of the bottles if there was anydesperate need on the part of the defendant company. Nor do I find that the delay in stopping delivery by Mr. McDougald was due toany promise by the plaintiff of improvement and of further torching the bottles. However, that does not mean that I do not find thatthere are defects in the bottles and that the complaints were not made before the 4th February 1972. In view of the contents of theparagraph in the letter in Exhibit 8B which I referred to earlier it is obvious that prier complaints had been made to the plaintiffcompany about the defects in the bottles. A sample of pigments as produced by Mr. McDougald as being the one supplied by the plaintiffcompany for the purposes of conducting a test. Had the test been for the purpose of manufacturing other types of bottles the sampleof old pigments would not have been supplied. Another paragraph in Exhibit 8B, immediately following the paragraph I have referred,reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Meanwhile we have agreed to experiment with the new pigment which is a product of the ICI Ltd. and purchased through Rainbow Plasticof Hong Kong and also a different printing ink from Coats Brothers Hong Kong Ltd. Please advise me as to how much time it will berequired before the result of the first experiment will be known."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Reading these paragraphs together it appears that what the defendant company asked for was first a test on the existing bottles andan experiment for new bottles. The plaintiff company's reply in Exhibit 9 dealt with only the experiment in which he says:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"With the approaching of the Chinese New Year which gives about five days of holiday and the fact that our machines are currentlybusy on their other production run I am afraid that the experiment with the polyuthene green white base and a brighter yellow printingink will have to wait."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">No reply had been given about the test of the existing bottles or about the tests that were to be conducted by ICI in England. Thetest by ICI could only refer to the test of the bottles delivered to the defendant. Hence in the last paragraph of Exhibit 8B Mr.McDougald wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I sincerely appreciate the effort and consideration shown by you in the past two weeks in assisting me to find a solution to thisproblem."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I find as a fact that this problem can only mean the problem about the printing and lettering coming off the bottles. There is evidenceby Mr. Riddle that the bottles of detergent were delivered around Christmas and the New Year. He was busy but they were taken backabout three or four weeks later. What would be some time the latter part of January. By this time the defects would have been discoveredby the defendant company.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The defence witness, Mr Lau, has given his opinion that the printing on the bottles cannot withstand the attack of detergent or colourbleeding. The cause of attack by alkaline agent must be excluded because the defendant company's detergent is not alkaline based.Indeed, this opinion is partially supported by the finding of Mr. Brockbank of the General Superintendence Co. (H.K.) Ltd. who saysthat the bottles cannot stand the attack of concentrated detergent. In view of the expert evidence and the evidence before me I amof the opinion that the bottles are not fit for the purpose for which they were sold. They were sold for the purposes of containingdetergent, concentrated detergent and not diluted detergent. For this reason it must be envisaged that there must be some form ofexposure of the bottles to concentrated detergent. This was known to the plaintiff company. If the plaintiff company was in doubtthey should have obtained a sample of the detergent from the defendant company to test on their printing and their sample bottlefirst. That had not been done. I further find as a fact that such defect is a latent defect of the bottles not readily visible tothe naked eye on the inspection of the samples. Hence the defects were not detected and not complained of until about one month afterdelivery of the bottles to the defendant company. Nonetheless these are defects which renderod the bottles not fit for the purposefor which they were sold.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The question in the second issue is whether such defect was one of manufacture or caused by the mishandling or misuse of the defendantcompany. For the reasons I have said earlier the burden of proof that such defects were caused entirely by the manufacture of theplaintiff company is on the defendant company. In this connection I follow the dictum of Devlin J., as he then. was, in the caseof <u>Kemp Ltd.</u> v. <u>Tolland</u> <sup>(1)</sup>. In that case the plaintiff company sued for the prices of peaches sold to the defendants. The defence in that case was that thepeaches had been condemned by the proper authority as being unfit for human consumption. At p.685 Devlin J. said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In those circumstances, the burden that is put upon the defendants is necessarily rather a heavy one. Where any loss occurs, whetherit is a loss resulting from a tortious act or a loss resulting from a breach of contract, the primary burden that rests upon theplaintiff in the case, or whoever has the burden, is to establish first of all what the cause of the loss was, and, having establishedwhat the cause of the loss was, to show that, under the terms of the contract, or under the relevant principle of law, the defendantis responsible for the loss so caused. That does not mean that if the plaintiff cannot establish the particular cause, it is necessarilyfatal. If he can show that it must have been one of a number of causes, he may succeed, but the burden upon him becomes correspondinglygreater, because he must show, if he cannot differentiate between the causes, that all those causes which might have been the causeof the loss are all matters for which the defendant is responsible."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I understand this to mean that if the defendants cannot isolate the cause then he must show that whatever the causes which might havebeen the cause of the loss such causes are all matters for which the plaintiff company is responsible. It is common ground that thisis a sale by description and by sample and that the defendant relied on the plaintiff's skill in manufacture of the bottles thatthey are fit for the purpose, namely, as containers for concentrated detergent. I have found as a fact that the bottles are unfitfor the purpose because the lettering comes off due to the fact that the bottles cannot stand up to the attack of concentrated detergentand because of the colour bleeding of the bottles. What then caused the colour bleeding. In this connection I accept Mr. Lau Wan-kam'sevidence that such was caused by the incompatibility of the green pigments or excessive green pigments in the plastic as two of theonly causes. Mr. Lau did not analyse the ink. Nor did he analyse the plastic. But in his evidence in cross-examination he said thatthese causes were referred to in standard textbooks of technology. The colour bleeding as such could only be due to manufacture.I further accept Mr. Lau's evidence that the lettering of the bottle come off as a result of attack by alkaline, or by detergentand colour bleeding or any combination of these three factors. He has also found that the detergent used by the defendant companyis of acetic base. There leaves two causes: the attack of concentrated detergent and colour bleeding. Having decided that colourbleeding is one of the causes it leaves me to determine whether it is also due to an attack by the detergent. In this point the timeelement may be important. The plaintiffs' evidence is that the exposure to concentrated detergent is due to the crude method of fillingthe bottles used by the defendant company. This evidence was admitted by Mr. McDougald but he explained that such crude method wasproperly rectified after Mr. Young gave him certain suggestions. One of its remedies is to introduce a wooden board to cover thebottles from the neck down. Another remedy is to wipe the bottles clean after they had been filled. I accept Mr. McDougald's evidencethat such remedies were introduced and the bottles were wiped clean before packing. No prudent wholesaler or vendor of any commoditywould deliver goods in a dirty state. If such bottles were not wiped clean and dry they would spoil not only the bottles but alsothe cartons and the packings. I do not feel that much importance should be attached to the lack of mechanised filling in the defendantcompany. A witness by the plaintiff company, Mr. So, said that in his own company they use mechanised filling and even this methodwould sometimes cause detergent to be spilt over the sides of the bottles which would have to be cleansed. That is why I said earlier,and I repeat now, that whatever way the bottles might be filled it must be expected that, in the course of filling, concentrateddetergent might come into contact with the outside of the bottles to a certain extent. Having regard to the evidence by Mr. Lau Ifind as a fact that the lettering on the bottles cannot stand up to attack by concentrated detergent for a reasonable length of time,namely, 24 hours. According to the opinion of Mr. Brockbank on a visual test the lettering can only stand up to the attack of diluteddetergent. For these reasons I find as a fact that the lettering of the bottles come off because at one time or another they hadbeen exposed to concentrated detergent, and also because of the colour bleeding of the bottles or because of both. I find that suchdefects were not caused by misuse or mishandling. In view of this the plaintiff must fail in his action and the plaintiff company'sclaim must be dismissed with costs.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> I now consider the third issue which relates to the defendant company's counterclaim which I have mentioned earlier.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> At the close of the evidence a fair number of authorities were cited to me by learned counsel for both parties including <u>Horne</u> v. <u>Midland</u> <u>Railway Co.</u> <sup>(2)</sup>, <u>Simon</u> v. <u>Pawson and Leafs, Ltd.</u> <sup>(3)</sup>, <u>Victoria Laundry Ltd.</u> v. <u>Newman Industries Ltd.</u> <sup>(4)</sup>, <u>Czarnikow</u> <u>Ltd.</u> v. <u>Koufos</u> <sup>(5)</sup>, <u>Vacwell Engineering Co., Ltd.</u> v. <u>B.D.H.

First is the rule that in a claim for breach of contract one cannot combine the loss of profit and the loss of capital. Secondis the rule in <u>Hadley</u> v. <u>Baxendale</u> <sup>(11)</sup> as applied in the <u>Victoria Laundry</u> case and considered by the <u>Czarnikow</u> case. In <u>Cullinane's</u> case the Court of Appeal held that where a person obtained a machine which was mechanically in accordance with the order given butwas unable to perform a particular function which it was warranted to perform he might adopt one of two courses. He might eitherrecover the capital cost incurred less anything obtained by disposing of the material that he got or made his claim on the basisof the profit he had lost because the machine fell short of its warranted performance. At p.1261 Evershed, M.R., said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "It seems to me, as a matter of principle, that the claim for damages, as pleaded, was not sustainable, in so far as theplaintiff sought to recover both the whole of his original capital loss and also the whole of the profit which he would have made.That, I think, as a proposition is self-evident, because a claim for loss of profits could only be founded on the footing that thecapital expenditure had been incurred. As I have said, however, there was a deduction in respect of depreciation at ten per cent.,and if the life of the plant is taken at ten years, it follows that during the period of ten years in which profits must be assumedto have been earned, the whole of the capital cost would have been written off".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Later he went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "As a matter of principle again, it seems to me that a person who has obtained a machine such as the plaintiff here obtained,which was mechanically in exact accordance with the order given, but was unable to perform a particular function which it was warrantedto perform, may adopt one of two courses. He may, when he discovered its incapacity and that it is not what he wanted and is uselessto him, claim to recover the capital cost he has incurred less anything he can obtain by disposing of the material that he got. Aclaim of that kind puts the plaintiff in the same position as though he had never made the contract at all. He is, in other words,back where he started, and, if it were shown that the profit-earning capacity was, in fact, very small, the plaintiff would probablyelect so to base his claim. Alternatively, he may, where the warranty in question relates to performance, make his claim on the basisof the profit he has lost, because the machine as delivered fell short in its performance of that which it was warranted to do. Ifhe chooses to base his claim on that footing, depreciation has nothing whatever to do with it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">The rule of <u>Hadley</u> v. <u>Baxendale</u> <sup>(11)</sup> as repeated in the judgment of Asquith, L.J. (as he then was) in the <u>Victoria</u> <u>Laundry</u> <sup>(4)</sup> case in which the learned Lord Justice said in p.537:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "Three of the authorities call for more detailed examination.

Familiar though it is, we should first recall the memorable sentence in which the main principles laid down in this caseare enshrined: 'Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receivein respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered as either arising naturally, i.e.according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have beenin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it'."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In the <u>Czarnikow</u> <sup>(5)</sup> case it was held that the sole rule as to the measure of damages for any kind of breach of any kind of contract was that the aggrievedparty was entitled to recover such part of the damage actually caused by the breach as the defaulting party should reasonably havecontemplated would flow from the breach. Lord Reid in his judgment at p.388 considered the case of <u>Victoria Laundry Ltd.</u> <sup>(4)</sup>. He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"But then it has been said that the liability of defendants has been further extended by <u>Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd.</u> v. <u>Newman Industries Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%202%20KB%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] 2 K.B. 528.</a> I do not think so. The plaintiffs bought a large boiler from the defendants and the defendants were aware of the general nature ofthe plaintiffs' business and of the plaintiffs' intention to put the boiler into use as soon as possible. Delivery of the boilerwas delayed in breach of contract and the plaintiffs claimed as damages loss of profit caused by the delay. A large part of the profitsclaimed would have resulted from some specially lucrative contracts which the plaintiffs could have completed if they had had theboiler: that was rightly disallowed because the defendants had no knowledge of these contracts. But Asquith L.J. then said ([1949] <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20KB%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 K.B. 528</a>, 543):</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          'It does not, however, follow that the plaintiffs are precluded from recovering some general (and perhaps conjectural) sumfor loss of business in respect of dyeing contracts to be reasonably expected, any more than in respect of laundering contracts tobe reasonably expected.'</p>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          It appears to me that this was well justified on the earlier authorities. It was certainly not unlikely on the informationwhich the defendants had when making the contract that delay in delivering the boiler would result in loss of business: indeed itwould seem that that was more than an even chance. And there was nothing new in holding that damages should be estimated on a conjecturalbasis. This House had approved of that as early as 1813 in <u>Hall</u> v. <u>Ross</u> (1813) 1 Dow. 201, H.L.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">          But what is said to create a 'landmark' is the statement of principles by Asquith L.J.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%202%20KB%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] 2 K.B. 528</a>, 539, 540. This does to some extent go beyond the older authorities and in so far as it does so, I do not agree with it. In paragraph(2) it is said (Ibid. 539) that the plaintiff is entitled to recover 'such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the timeof the contract reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach.' To bring in reasonable foreseeability appears to meto be confusing measure of damages in contract with measure of damages in tort. A great many extremely unlikely results are reasonablyforeseeable: it is true that Lord Asquith may have meant foreseeable as a likely result, and if that is all he meant I would notobject further than to say that I think that the phrase is liable to be misunderstood. For the same reason I would take exceptionto the phrase (Ibid. 540) 'liable to result' in paragraph (5). Liable is a very vague word but I think that one would usually saythat when a person foresees a very improbable result he foresees that it is liable to happen."</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">Later he said (p.390):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I certainly could not understand any court deciding that, on the information available to the carrier in that case, the stoppageof the carrier in that case, the stoppage of the mill was neither a serious possibility nor a real danger.

Ltd.</u> <sup>(6)</sup> is an action on breach of contract for sale of goods, breach of implied term as to fitness of purpose by the sale of chemical withoutwarning. However, when it comes to assessment for the quantum of damages, the learned trial judge seemed to assess damages on thebasis of breach of duty in the nature of negligence which is a tort. Thus, he seemed to apply the foreseeability test on the questionof remoteness of damage. It is a case where the defendants supplied a chemical contained in glass ampoules to the plaintiffs andfailed to warn the plaintiffs that if such chemical should come into contact with water a minor explosion would result. In the courseof its use such chemical was allowed to be in contact with water by accident, as a result, a much greater explosion occurred thanexpected, and the plaintiffs suffered much heavier damage than could be expected from a minor explosion. It was held that an explosionof a minor kind was reasonably foresecable as a result of the defendants' breach of contract, and although an explosion of the magnitudewhich in fact occurred was not reasonably foreseeable, it was the direct result of the defendants' breach of contract in supplyingboron tribromide without an adequate warning label that the defendants were negligent and in breach of their duty to take reasonablecare to ascertain the major industrial hazards of chemicals marketed by them and to give warning of such hazards to their customers:the explosion and the type of damage being foreseeable, it was irrelevant that the magnitude of the former and the extent of thelatter were not. In his judgment, Rees J., at p.945, said:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="10%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%" class="quote">"Vacwell finally base their claim upon the tort of negligence.

I find that the duty to take reasonable care as stated above is the duty which rested upon B.D.H. in thecircumstances of this case. I have already reviewed the evidence in relation to this aspect of the matter and I need not repeat it.I am satisfied that B.D.H. failed to comply with their duty in two respects: first, they failed to provide and maintain a systemfor carrying out an adequate research into scientific literature to ascertain known hazards; secondly, by Mr. Hill and Dr. Muir,they failed to carry out an adequate research into the scientific literature available to them in order to discover the industrialhazards of a new, or little known, chemical.

In my judgment the explosionand the type of damage being foreseeable, it matters not in the law that the magnitude of the former and the extent of the latterwere not."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The basis upon which the defendant company found their claim for their loss of profit is this: Had the plaintiff company been ableto deliver properly manufactured bottles they would be able to sell at least 400 cases of detergent in the month of January at $5.50per bottle. As each case contained 24 bottles the selling price was $132 per case. They would be able to sell another 600 cases inthe month of February 1972, 800 cases in March 1972, 800 cases in April 1972, and between 1st May and 22nd May another 558 cases.The $132 would be reduced by a 42% commission to the distributers and by the cost of $22.80 per case for detergent and perfume. Theselling price of $132 minus the 42% of $55.44 and the cost of the bottles, etc. of $22.80 per case, would give a profit of $53.76per case. The defendant company also claim for the loss of expenses incurred. The expenses incurred include the sum total of $33,897paid to the Far East Marketing, Ltd. and the Far East Advertising, Ltd. for the marketing research and advertisement relating tothe sale of the detergent, plus the sum of $2,454 due to the Far East Advertising, Ltd.; another sum of $18,149 paid to the GraphicCommunication, Ltd. for the design and the logo for the bottles to be ordered from the plaintiff company; legal fees of $627 andloss on the sale of furniture of $13,159 making a total of some $68,286. The defendant company also claim for the return of the mouldsor $6,000 in lieu. Finally the defendant company claim repayment of the amount paid by the defendant to the plaintiff of $2,330 referredto as being payment made wholly without consideration.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Evidence in support of the claim for the loss of profit and expenses incurred is to be found in that of Mr. McDougald, Managing Directorof the defendant company. He says that before he embarked upon the project which is a new project he engaged the Far East Marketing,Ltd. to do some marketing research for him. Such research was done on three basic factors. The first one was that there was a firmby the name of B.C.I. which sold detergents at the price of $12.50 per bottle and the sale had been successful. Secondly, in HongKong there were at the time three leading companies in the same business selling their detergents at $1.80 per bottle. The leadingfirm sold about 25,000 cases of detergent each month. Thirdly, on this basis and on a conservative estimate it was reckoned at leastthe defendant company could have sold 800 cases of their detergent per month. The reason for this estimate was that the defendantcompany was selling at less than half the price of the B.C.I. and he was selling the detergent as a multi-purpose detergent in contrastto the detergents vended by the other leading detergent companies but similar to these sold by the B.C.I. He says that before thebottles were delivered to him he had already orders for 1,000 cases from various leading department stores and supermarkets. He turnedthese orders to his distributors. Although no date of delivery for the bottles was agreed upon, however, he understood by Novemberthat the plaintiff company was ready and able to deliver at least 400 cases to him in the month of December. As a result he wroteto various department stores and supermarkets to scale down the rate of delivery. At the same time all the advertisement for thesale of the product was geared to the sale in January that the product will be sold in the market. When he found that there weredefects in the bottles he could not market the product any more. He asked for the return of the moulds in February, 1972 so thathe could appoint somebody else to make the bottles of the same design for him, but the plaintiff company refused. In the end thedefendant company had to obtain bottles of different design and colour from another source in order to market their detergent. Suchbottles were not available until the 22nd May 1972. Because of this the benefit of the marketing research was completely wasted,the advertising gear for the sale in January of the original product in the original bottles were also wasted. He had to dilute theoriginal detergent to a much weaker strength to fill up the bottles ordered in substitute and sold them at the rate of $1.50 perbottle as from 22nd May 1972. By that time the defendant company had spent a lot of money, and was not in a sound financial state.Legal fees in the sum of $627 was paid to effect a guarantee for the defendant company's bank overdraft. In the and the defendanthad to close down its main office at Old Bailey Street, and sold its furniture at a loss of $13,159. He had three distributors, eachwith 10 selling outlets. Mr. Bell was one.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Bell also gives evidence in support of the defendant company. He says that he has no less than 10 outlets for the sale of thedetergent. On Mr. Bell's estimate he expects to sell at least one case a day in each outlet, thereby making a total of 300 casesper month. However, he only delivered one or two cases to each of the six or seven outlets.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Mr. Riddle who gives evidence for the defendant company says that he agreed to put the detergent on sale in the supermarket he wasin charge at the time. He reckoned that such detergent would sell at the price of $5.50 per bottle with the aggressive advertisementthat was undertaken by the defendant company.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> From such evidence three points are quite apparent and I find them as facts. The first point is that the estimated sales are entirelyspeculative. The second point is that the advertising and marketing expenses incurred was solely incurred for promoting the saleof the detergent. And thirdly, the legal fees involved and the selling out of the properties of the defendant company was entirelydue to the impecunious condition of the defendant company. The defendant company is a newly established company starting a new businesson a new venture. There is no previous business record upon which to found its estimate of sale except a marketing research by comparisonwith one of the leading detergent vendors. Apart from this Mr. McDougald's optimism and confidence is founded on the fact that theB.C.I. used to sell a multi-purpose detergent at the rate of $12.50 a bottle and was doing good business. However, in his own wordsthe B.C.I. product was a complete fraud which was discovered by him. In calculating his profits Mr. McDougald only gave allowancefor the cost of the detergent, the bottles, the packing and the discount he would give to his distributors. He has completely ignoredthe factor of staff salary, office rental and expenses in advertisement in the promotion of sale of such product without which orany of which the product will never be on any firm footing in the market. After all there is evidence that the detergent businessis a very competitive business. When all these expenses are taken into consideration (and such expenses are all recurring expenses)I am of the opinion that the profit per case of his detergent is nothing near the figure of $55.76 per case. In this connection Ihave also to observe that he was proposing to sell his detergent at $5.50 per bottle, $3.70 more than the price of an average bottleof detergent of slightly weaker strength. The success and failure of this business venture depends also how gullible the consumersare in paying more, much more, for a bottle of slightly stronger detergent. I cannot accept Mr. McDougald's evidence that in themonth of November 1971 he had obtained orders for a thousand cases of the defendant company's detergent. There is not one scintillaof documentary evidence in support of this contention. Had the defendant company any firm offer of such Mr. McDougald would not havekept the date of delivery and the rate of delivery open and left it to the discretion of the plaintiff company. He would certainlyhave not employed only two girls in his make-shift factory in Tai Wor Ping to will up the bottles delivered to the defendant companyin December 1971. Despite the optimism and confidence of Mr. Bell who said that he expected to sell a case a day in each of his tenoutlets he had so far delivered one or two cases to his selling outlets. Mr. Bell's evidence is one of opinion rather than a statementof fact. The highest one can put it is that Mr. McDougald might have contacted sufficient number of shops and stores who might bewilling to put his detergent on a market on a consignment basis. The success in vending up to 800 cases per month of the defendantcompany's detergent can only be described as a fervent hope on the part of Mr. McDougald.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Apart from the aforesaid there is also one very significant point relating to the claim for the loss of profit. It will be observedthat the defendant company only ordered 34,000 bottles from the plaintiff company making a total of 1,416? cases of 24 bottles each.But the defendant company claimed for the lost profit on the basis that the plaintiff company would deliver 3,168 cases in all. Thisis a grossly exaggerated claim and goes far beyond the contractual relationship between the parties. When I consider the defendantcompany's claim for the loss of profit I have not lost sight of the decision in the case of <u>Victoria Laundry Ltd.</u> v. <u>Newman Industries Ltd.</u> <sup>(4)</sup> in which it was held that in a claim for damages for loss of profit in a breach of contract a conjectural loss might be taken intoconsideration. But that case is founded on very different facts. That was a case where a laundryman sued for loss of profit for thedelay in the delivery of a boiler which he required and ordered to be delivered at a certain date in order to expand his business.It was held that as a result of the delay in delivery of the boiler the laundryman would not be able to expand his business in timeand some loss of profit must be within the contemplation of the parties. Accordingly loss of profit was allowed as an item of damages.In that case the laundryman had an existing boiler. The boiler that was ordered was an additional one to expand his business. Thuswhatever loss of profit for being deprived the use of the additional boiler could be estimated on the basis of his previous earningswith a single boiler. It also happened at a time immediately after the European War and laundry services were in great demand. Inthe present case there is no existing business on the part of the defendant company to form the basis of any estimate except speculationand hope. There is evidence that detergent vending is a keenly competitive business in Hong Kong. The marginal profit is low. Inview of the aforesaid I find that there is no sufficient evidence to substantiate the defendant company's claim for loss of profits.Failingthis the defendant company can only recover capital expenses connecting thereto which are within the contemplation of the partiesat the time of the contract.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I now come to consider the defendant company's claim for expenses. Having regard to the evidence of Mr. McDougald, Mr. Steiner, andthe corroborative evidence in Exhibits 1 and 2, the fact that the defendant company had spent money for the design and the labelfor the bottles to be manufactured by the plaintiff company must be within the contemplation of the parties in this contract. Inany event the bottles are of a new design and with a new logo. It is reasonable to expect that the parties knew at the time of thecontract that money has been spent on that item. However, I find that the huge expenditure involved in the marketing research aswell as advertisement need not be within the contemplation of the plaintiff company. Such research and advertisement are to promotethe sale of detergent not necessarily the bottles. There is no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff company knew of the intensivemarketing research and the aggressive advertisement. Further, the expenditure in legal fees in arranging a guarantee for an overdraft,and the loss on the sale of furniture by the defendant company are entirely due to the impecunious condition of the defendant companywhich cannot be within the contemplation or knowledge of the plaintiff company.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> As regards the defendant company's claim for the moulds. I find that the plaintiff company cannot justify their retention by customof the trade. Nor do I find the cases of <u>Leopold Walford</u> <sup>(9)</sup> in 1919 and <u>London Export Corporation Ltd.</u> <sup>(10)</sup> in 1958 relevant. There has been no written contract and there is nothing inconsistent with the custom of the trade. Yet I do notfind that there is any substance in the contention that the plaintiff company can rely on a custom, if any, which is clearly unreasonable.If such a custom exists it purports to force the defendant company to accept a breach of contract by buying all the defective goodsin order to recover the moulds. Similarly I cannot accept the argument by Mr. Wei, learned counsel for the plaintiff company, thatone way of mitigating the loss on the part of the defendant company was to pay for the contract in full so as to regain the mouldsand then sue for damages. I find in the circumstances that it was reasonable for the defendant company to reject the defective bottlesand demand for the return of the moulds. Nor do I accept the evidence of Mr. Kenneth Young for the plaintiff company to the effectthat the defendant company agreed to the moulds being used as security for the down payment of the bottles to be supplied by theplaintiff company. This is evident because in Exhibit 4 dated 11th December 1971 the defendant company wrote in these words:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">          "This letter will verify the conversation we had on December 10. I agree to pay the balance of $2,000 for the moulds whichyour company is preparing, also I agree to make a down payment of $2,000 for the initial order of 34,000 bottles and 1,400 cardboardcartons. The balance will be paid within 30 days."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Then in Exhibit 5A, B and C the plaintiff company gave an account clearly giving receipt for the payment of $6,000 for the mouldsplus whatever bottles that had been then delivered, giving the defendant company a credit balance of $303.92. There is no mentionwhatever of using the moulds as the deposit for the down payment of bottles to be delivered subsequently.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In view of the facts as I find as proved and applying the principle relating to damages in a breach of contract I find as follows.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> By the 3rd January 1972 the defendant company had already paid to the plaintiff company $8,264 - Exhibit 5A. On the 18th January1972 the defendant company paid another $1,000 in cash making a total of $9,264. With the exception of $230 which were paid for 20oz. bottles (Exhibit 6B) and for changing the wordings (Exhibit 7C) the balance of 9,034 was capital expenditure paid by the defendantcompany to the plaintiff company for a consideration which completely failed by virtue of the breach of contract on the part of theplaintiff company. The defendant company is entitled to recover this sum in lieu of loss of profit. The defendant company is furtherentitled to the sum of $12,000 which was paid for the design of the bottles and the logo as capital expenditure plus the sum of $1,680.75paid or payable to the Graphic Communications Ltd. in connection with the Kleenall bottles. I arrive at this sum from Exhibit 39after striking off all items of charges not connected with the design for the bottles viz., $120 in invoice No.2121, $50.50 in invoiceNo.2026, $50.25 in invoice No.2122, $90.00 in invoice No.2123, $1,120.00 in invoice No.2025 and $250.00 in invoice No.2027.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> As to the moulds, the plaintiff company must return them to the defendant company as claimed or in lieu thereof the sum of $6,000.In addition the defendant company is entitled to recover the difference in cost for the substituted bottles it had to obtain fromother source if it is more than 36 Â¢ per bottle to the extent of 34,000 bottles. There is no evidence as to any difference in cost.But any difference is the direct result of the plaintiff company retaining the moulds and such result is foreseeable.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In short the plaintiff company's claim is dismissed with costs. The defendant company's counterclaim is allowed to the extent of$22,714.75. Return of the moulds or $6,000 in lieu. The difference in cost for up to 34,000 bottles if it is beyond 36Â¢ each tobe proved before the Registrar.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="50%">(Simon F.S.
