Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The Plaintiff is âBowardley Enterprises Limited (â<u>BEL</u>â) suing on behalf of itself and all other members of the Hong Kong Badminton Association (â<u>HKBA</u>â)â (â<u>P</u>â) pursuant to Order 15 rule 12 of the Rules of District Court (â<u>RDC</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Subject to the defences raised by the Defendant (â<u>D</u>â), there is no dispute that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) HKBA is an unincorporated association having the right to hold an annual badminton event, ie âThe Hong Kong Openâ (â<u>Event</u>â). Mr Tong Yun Kai (â<u>Tong</u>â) was/is HKBAâs president.</p>        <p>(b) By a sponsorship agreement dated 9<sup>th</sup> August 1997 (â<u>Contract Date</u>â) which appears on its face to be made between Tong on HKBAâs behalf and D (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> Agreement</u>â), D agreed to become a non-exclusive title sponsor. Pursuant to Clause 3 of 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement, D undertook to pay HKBA for each Event to be held in 1997 and 1998 (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Events</u>â) respectively as follows : (i) US$170,000.00 in prize money (at the time of the signing of 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement and on/before 1<sup>st</sup> April 1998) and (ii) HK$180,000.00 in organisation fees (on/before 6<sup>th</sup> October 1997 and on/before 6<sup>th</sup> October 1998). The sums payable for 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Events are called â<u>1997 and 1998 Sums</u>â below.</p>        <p>(c) HKBA duly held 1<sup>st</sup> Event. D paid 1997 Sums to HKBA.</p>        <p>(d) By a letter dated 7<sup>th</sup> September 1998, HKBA demanded D to pay 1998 Sums. By a letter dated 10<sup>th</sup> September 1998 (â<u>10/9/98 Letter</u>â), D informed BEL its cash flow was tight due to the 1997 financial crisis. D did not pay 1998 Sums to HKBA.</p>        <p>(e) HKBA entered into a sponsorship agreement dated 28<sup>th</sup> September 1998 with Dâs subsidiary, Worldwide Golden Leaf Ltd (â<u>WGLL</u>â) (â<u>2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement</u>â). Pursuant to Clause 3 of 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement, WGLL undertook to pay HKBA 1998 Sums with the prize money and organisation fees payable at the signing of 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement and on/before 1<sup>st</sup> November 1998 respectively.</p>        <p>(f) HKBA duly held 2<sup>nd</sup> Event.</p>        <p>(g) By a letter dated 27<sup>th</sup> March 2002 to BEL, D claimed that due to serious loss incurred WGLL had closed its business and had been liquidated.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>II. Pâs pleaded claim</u></p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> P claims that D was in repudiatory breach of 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement, which P was entitled to accept. In mitigation of loss and on Dâs introduction, P entered into 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement with WGLL for sponsorship of 2<sup>nd</sup> Event. When P was unable to recover 1998 Sums from WGLL, it continued to press D for payment. It was eventually agreed that D wouldpay P US$300,000.00 (or HK$2,325,000.00) (â<u>Reduced Sum</u>â) by instalments (â<u>3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement</u>â). D received a total sum of HK$1,575,000.00 in respect of 1998 Sums. P claims for damages for breach of contract being the outstandingbalance of HK$750,000.00 (â<u>Balance</u>â).</p>    <p class="heading"><u>III. Dâs pleaded claim</u></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> D does not admit Pâs capacity to sue on behalf of itself and all other members of HKBA (â<u>Members</u>â) and denies HKBAâs capacity as an unincorporated association to enter into 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement or any agreement. Subject to the aforesaid, 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement was a novation agreement amongstP, D and WGLL, so that D ceased to be and WGLL became solely responsible for 1998 Sums.Further, the consideration for 1998 Sums has totally failed since WGLL (and not D) received the benefit under 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement for 2<sup>nd</sup> Event. D is therefore not liable for 1998 Sums/Balance.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>IV. Present applications</u></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> There are two summonses before me : (a) Pâs summons for leave to amend its Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim under Order 20rule 5 and Order 15 rule 6 of RDC (â<u>Amendment Summons</u>â), and (b) Dâs summons for specific discovery under Order 24 rule 7 of RDC (â<u>Discovery Summons</u>â).</p>    <p class="heading"><u>V. Amendment Summons</u></p>    <p class="heading"><u>(a) Draft amendments</u></p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> On the first day of the hearing on 23<sup>rd</sup> February 2005 (â<u>Hearing Date</u>â), Mr Yip, counsel for P, applied twice to amend the draft Amended Statement of Claim annexed to Amendment Summons. Without objectionfrom Mr Pao, counsel for D, I granted P leave to do so. The proposed amendments to Pâs pleadings (â<u>Amendments</u>â) include <i>inter alia</i> the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) P is to be renamed â[BEL] suing on behalf of itself and all other members of [HKBA] as on 9<sup>th</sup> August 1997 (â<u>9/8/97 Members</u>â)â (â<u>Members Amendment</u>â).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) Tong is to be added as a 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff in these proceedings (â<u>Tong Amendment</u>â).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c) Tong signed 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreements (collectively, â<u>Agreements</u>â) on behalf of 9/8/97 Members, so that Agreements were made between 9/8/97 Members and D or, alternatively, between Tong personallyand D (â<u>Contract Amendment</u>â). 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement was made on/about 20<sup>th</sup> November 1998 (â<u>3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement Date</u>â).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) There were other consequential amendments to change references from P to HKBA or to 9/8/97 Members as appropriate.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><u>(b) Pâs case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> <u>Members Amendment</u>  Members Amendment is to make clear that P sues on behalf of 9/8/97 Members who were the party to 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement. As at Contract Date, HKBA had 44 full and 53 affiliated members, so it is desirable for P to sue on behalf of 9/8/97 Members.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> <u>Tong Amendmen</u><u>t and 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement</u>  Tong has been HKBAâs president since 1970-1971. It has been customary for HKBAâs president to sign sponsorship agreements onbehalf of Members.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> HKBAâs Executive Committee (â<u>ExCo</u>â) managed HKBAâs affairs. Rule 4A of the rules of HKBA (July 1997 revised edition) applicable as atContract Date (â<u>Rules</u>â) provides that (a) HKBAâs affairs should be handled by the executive members of ExCo comprising, amongst others, HKBAâs presidentand (b) ExCo has authority to do any legal act to achieve HKBAâs aims (which are to promote interest in badminton activity andto organise badminton competitions in Hong Kong).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> The minutes of Excoâs meeting held on 18<sup>th</sup> August 1997 (â<u>18/8/97</u> <u>Minutes</u>â) confirm that Tong as HKBAâs president was authorised to negotiate and sign sponsorship agreements for 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Events. 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement on its face shows that Tong signed on HKBAâs behalf as its duly authorised representative, so to all intents and purposeshe contracted on behalf of 9/8/97 Members. As Tong had authority from all/some Members, such Members can enforce 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement under the ordinary principles of agency. But if it is found that Tong signed 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement without authority, as a matter of law he may be held to have signed it personally, so Tong Amendment is necessary. Tonghas consented to be added as a 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> <u>2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement</u>  Before Tong signed 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement on behalf of 9/8/97 Members to mitigate loss, Dâs director/chairman, Mr Kwong Chi Shing (â<u>Kwong</u>â), told him <i>inter alia</i> that D would continue to pay as usual. Pursuant to 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement, WGLL paid HK$775,000.00 (or US$100,000.00) by cheque dated 16<sup>th</sup> November 1998 drawn on World Seal Limited (â<u>WSL</u>â) for which HKBA issued a receipt (â<u>Receipt</u>â). At Kwongâs request, Tong agreed to change the title of 2<sup>nd</sup> Event to âHong Ta Cupâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> <u>3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement</u>  When WGLL defaulted under 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement, Tong chased Kwong for 1998 Sums following his promise to pay as usual. At a lunch meeting with Tong (most probably on3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement Date and with Dâs director, Dr Hung Tak Lung (â<u>Hung</u>â)), Kwong on Dâs behalf agreed to pay (and HKBA agreed to accept) Reduced Sum by instalments of HK$100,000.00 each payable everytwo months (ie 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> By 18<sup>th</sup> December 1998, only the aforesaid US$100,000.00 hadbeen paid,so Excoâs minutes on that date recorded that Tong reported the outstandingbalance of 1998 Sums was reduced to US$200,000.00. On/about 22<sup>nd</sup> March 1999, Hung requested HKBA to amend Receipt to address it to WGLL. Consequently, HKBA cancelled Receipt and issued a replacementreceipt to WGLL.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Pursuant to 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement, D paid HK$200,000.00 by cheque dated 19<sup>th</sup> March 1999 for the first two instalments due on 20<sup>th</sup> January and 20<sup>th</sup> March 1999 and HKBA issued a receipt to D. D madevarious cheque payments totalling HK$800,000.00 (â<u>Payments</u>â) for which HKBA issued corresponding receipts to D (â<u>Payment Receipts</u>â).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> HKBA issued various invoices to D from 11<sup>th</sup> December 1999 to 2<sup>nd</sup> November 2001 for the outstanding balance of Reduced Sum (â<u>Invoices</u>â). The detailed description on each Invoice sets out the agreed sponsor fee for 2<sup>nd</sup> Event (ie Reduced Sum) and the amount of sponsor fee received (listing out each Payment and the corresponding date of payment) toarrive at the then outstanding amount (â<u>Invoice Format</u>â). Each Invoice was signed for and on behalf of HKBA. The printed words âPlease make cheque payable to [HKBA]â (â<u>Invoice Demand</u>â) are found at the bottom of each Invoice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> There is no documentary evidence to suggest that D acted as WGLLâs payment agent in making Payments. WGLL (BVI company) could haveopened a Hong Kong bank account or could have paid by other means, eg cashier order or WSLâs cheque. Further, Hung/D did not requestfor invoices/receipts to be issued to WGLL or to âcorrectâ Invoices/Payment Receipts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Since WGLLâs default, Tong never discussed the outstanding payment with Hung. On/about 29<sup>th</sup> September 2000, Kwong requested reduction of the outstanding balance of Reduced Sum to around HK$300,000.00 but Tong rejected therequest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(c) Dâs case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> D argues that Amendment Summons should be dismissed :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) Tong and Contract Amendments are vexatious and an abuse of process since(i) Tong claims he has all along acted on HKBAâs behalfand (ii) P still refuses to disclose the list of Members to verify whether there has been any change in HKBAâs membership betweenContract Date and the date of issuance of the Writ of Summons (â<u>Writ Date</u>â); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) if Amendments are allowed, D will be prejudiced by the circumvention of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a> (â<u>Ordinance</u>â).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> <u>2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement</u>  Around the time when D sent 10/9/98 Letter to Tong as HKBAâs president, Tong agreed for Kwong to find another sponsor to replaceD for 2<sup>nd</sup> Event. Kwong later introduced Hung, WGLLâs director/representative, to Tong. At a meeting amongst Tong, Hung and Kwong representingHKBA, WGLL and D respectively, it was agreed that in consideration of D procuring WGLL to sign 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement, D shall be released from any and all liabilities arising from 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Tong purportedly on HKBAâs behalf and Hung on WGLLâs behalf signed 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement whereby WGLL replaced D as sponsor for 2<sup>nd</sup> Event. Consequently, the title of 2<sup>nd</sup> Event was changed from âMillennium Cupâ(name for 1<sup>st</sup> Event) to âHong Ta Cupâ, Hong Ta being the brand name of the cigarettes distributed by WGLL. Kwong denied that he told Tong Dwould continue to pay as usual. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Kwong understood that WGLLâs first payment of HK$775,000.00 was made via the bank account of Hungâs private company (WSL) becauseWGLL was a BVI company with no bank account in Hong Kong. So Hung asked for Receipt to be made out to WGLL even though it was paidby WSLâs cheque. HKBA complied with such request.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> <u>3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement</u>  Kwong denied3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement or that he had lunch with Tong as alleged. Since WGLL did not have any Hong Kong bank account, Kwong arranged to makevariousPayments totalling HK$800,000.00 as and when instructed by WGLL. D only acted as WGLLâs payment agent.

Mr Yip submits that since 9/8/97 Members are the contracting party to 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement and there is no assignment of their rights and obligations under 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement, they are necessarily also the contracting party to 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement which compromised the subject matter of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreements. D plainly knew this all along and has not been prejudiced, mistaken or misled by Members Amendment. This is illustratedby Dâs application for disclosure of a list of all 9/8/97 Members (â<u>Item A</u>â).

Eve J at pp.135-136 said âI assume that theyare members of the society, and are suing on behalf of themselves and the other members of the society.  That means on behalf ofmembers who were members at the date when the writ was issued.

Mr Pao submits that as a matterof law it must be taken to refer to HKBAâs members as at the date of issuance of the Writ of Summons (â<u>Writ Date Members</u>â). P appears to have implicitly conceded this by seeking Members Amendment and by accepting the need to define the persons representedby P by reference to the date on which the cause of action arose. Consequently, by Members Amendment P is in fact fundamentally andsubstantially altering its case by substituting a new party, ie 9/8/97 Members, for Writ Date Members as the party on whose behalfthese proceedings are purportedly brought. There is presently no evidence that HKBAâs membership remained constant between Contractand Writ Dates. If there is any fluctuation during this period (which is likely to be the case given the lapse of time), P will haveno entitlement to sue and the present proceedings will be improperly constituted.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> <u>Analysis</u>  In my view, Members Amendment amounts to a substitution of a new party since Pâs description refers (as a matter of law) to BELrepresenting Writ Date Members but Pâs proposed amended description refers to BEL representing 9/8/97 Members.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> <b>Carlton</b>âs case and <b>Jarrot</b>âs case make it quite plain that Members Amendment is not simply a matter of clarification. These cases are analogous in that theydraw a distinction between the members of the club/society at the time of the purported agreement and the party described in theclaim (ie the members of the club/society without qualifying such membership by reference to a particular date). As a matter of law,the latter description refers to members as at the date of issuance of the writ of summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> I am not persuaded by Mr Yipâs submission that D well knew that Pâs present description refers to BEL representing 9/8/97 Membersand that D has not been mistaken or misled as to Pâs identity.

In <b>Campbell</b>âs case, no application had been made by the plaintiff under the then rules of court to allow the named defendants to be sued intheir representative capacity. The plaintiff with the full support of the defendants invited the court to make a representation order,and conceded that if a representation order was to be made, the named defendants would have to be restricted to represent the properparty, ie the members of the club as at the date of the fall. <b>Campbell</b>âs case is therefore concerned with the propriety of making a representation order and the proper naming of the defendants pursuantthereto and not with the meaning of the description of a party to the proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(3) Limitation issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Mr Pao submits that no person should be added or substituted as a plaintiff after the expiry of the time limit. Since the relevantlimitation period for Members Amendment has expired, such amendment falls foul of Ordinance (also see discussion on Order 15 rule6 and Order 20 rule 5 of RDC below). Mr Yip, on the other hand, submits that Members Amendment has been made within the relevantlimitation period.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> <u>Relevant date for considering limitation period</u>  Pâs claim is for damages for breach of 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement. The basic limitation period applicable to claims based on breach of contract is six years.

While both cases make it clear that the date of the issue of the original writ isnot the determinative date, they do not discuss or decide what should be the position when the relevant limitation period has notexpired when the summons applying for leave to add a party has been taken out, but has expired by the time the application comeson for hearing or the court announces its decision.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">There is, perhaps, some measure of support for the submission that proposition (a) is sounder in law than proposition (b) in a decisionof this court: <i>Wo Fung Paper Making Factory Ltd v Sappi Kraft (Pty) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20HKLR%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 HKLR 346.</a> However we take the view, in the absence of clear legislative provision or of binding authority, that the appropriate date for aconsideration of limitation questions in circumstances such as the present must be the date the application is made (in the sensethat it is filed in court) for reasons which seem to us too obvious to elaborate. We would mention only the anomalies which couldarise if proposition (b) were the true position in law. As Miss Yuen fairly asks, what if the application is part-heard within thelimitation period, but concluded after the period has expired? And could the right of a plaintiff seeking to add a defendant be dependentupon whether the judge gives an extempore judgment within the limitation period, or reserves judgment to a date outside that period?Of course, if an application is made before the limitation period has expired, and the applicant himself drags his heels in movingthe court or in taking any necessary steps, then the court will consider whether the exercise of its discretion should be affectedby the resultant delay.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> <u>Dâs case</u>  Mr Pao submits that subsequent to our Court of Appealâs decision in <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case<b>,</b> a line of English authorities came to a contrary conclusion.

Glidewell LJ in <b>Welsh Development Agency</b>âs case said at pp.1420-1421 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦â¦ Mr. Keating argues that the relevant date for this period is the date at which the application to leave is made.

If this were not so, the plaintiffsâ right to amend would depend on purely arbitrary factors, such as when the court couldhear the application for leave or how long it took the court to deliver judgment after hearing the application.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>In our judgment the judgeâs decision on this issue was entirely correct.  The wording of section 35(3) of the Act of 1980 â neitherthe High Court nor any county court shall allow a new claim â¦ to be made in the course of any action after the expiry of any timelimit under this Act â¦â is so clear as to admit of only one interpretation.  That is that the relevant date is the date at whichthe amendment is actually made, which by definition must be no earlier than the date at which leave is granted to make the amendment.

Mr Pao refers to Peter Wesley-Smith, <b>The Sources of Hong Kong Law</b> at p.62 where the learned author said â[it] can be said, in summary, that as a general rule a decision can properly be labelledas per incuriam only when these conditions are satisfied : (1) there was a binding rule of law (contained in a statute, subordinatelegislation or judicial decision) which, if taken into account, would have affected the result of the case; â¦â¦â (<b>Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co, Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1944%5d%20KB%20718" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1944] KB 718</a> and <b>Morelle Ld v Wakeling &amp; anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%202%20QB%20379" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] 2 QB 379).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> In <b>Morelle</b>âs case, Lord Evershed MR said at p.406 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">ââ¦â¦ As a general rule the only cases in which decisions should be held to have been given per incuriam are those of decisionsgiven in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or of some authority binding on the court concerned: so that in such cases some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found, on that account, tobe demonstrably wrong. This definition is not necessarily exhaustive, but cases not strictly within it which can properly be heldto have been decided per incuriam must, in our judgment, consistently with the stare decisis rule which is an essential feature ofour law, be, in the language of Lord Greene M.R., of the rarest occurrence. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> In my view, the <b>Welsh</b> line of authorities does not render <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case <i>per incuriam</i>.  Not only were they decided after <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case, they are not authorities binding on our Court of Appeal. I have referred the parties to <b>LCHY v CWF &amp; ors</b> HCMP5231/2001, Deputy High Court Judge Lam  (as he then was) (unreported, 10<sup>th</sup> December 2001) where the learned judge said : âthe omission of any reference by the Court of Appeal to the relevant authoritiesoverseas â¦â¦ does not render the decision per incuriamâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Mr Pao next argues that although Fuad VP did expressly refer to sections 35(1) and (2) of Ordinance and section 35(5) of Act (inthe same form as section 35(6) of Ordinance), his statement at p.209 (ie âthe absence of clear legislative provision or of bindingauthorityâ) shows that the Court of Appeal in <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case did not consider the express wording of section 35(3) of Ordinance and such case is therefore not an authority on the meaningor interpretation of that section. In such circumstances, there is no binding authority on such subject and this court is free toconsider for itself the meaning of section 35(3) of Ordinance with the assistance of the <b>Welsh</b> line of authorities.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> I do not agree with Mr Paoâs submission. When one considers whether a court is bound to follow a case or bound by a decision, itmeans that the judge is under an obligation to apply a particular <i>ratio decidendi</i> to the facts before him in the absence of a reasonable legal distinction between the facts in the case before him and the facts towhich the <i>ratio</i> was applied in the previous case. I cannot see how the decision on Relevant Date in <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case can be distinguishable or how I am free from the authority of that case. The doctrine of binding precedent is not concernedwith interpretation of legislative provision but with <i>rationes decidendi</i> of superior courts which apply to all within their scope.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Mr Pao alternatively argues that our Court of Appeal has failed to consider the binding provision in section 35(3) of Ordinance and<b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case is therefore <i>per incuriam</i>. He submits that this court is then free to consider the meaning of section 35(3) of Ordinance and follow the <b>Welsh</b> line of authorities. The plain and literal meaning of section 35(3) in not allowing âa new claim â¦â¦ to be madeâ after theexpiry of the time limit is that the court must consider the question of amendment at the time when it is allowed by the court forit is not until then that a new claim is in fact made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Mr Yip, on the other hand, argues that the references in Fuad VPâs judgment to <b>Leicester Wholesale Fruit Market Ltd</b>âs case and <b>Grimsby Cold Stores Ltd</b>âs case and to section 35 of Ordinance/Act necessarily suggest that our Court of Appeal must have considered the issue of relationback of amendments to the date of the issuance of the writ of summons. Indeed, Fuad VP at p.207 said â[counsel for the defendant]confirmed that the Master had heard full argument on the issue of limitation before he rejected the defendantâs submission thatthe action against the proposed additional defendants was barred by limitationâ. Fuad VP further noted on the same page that thejudge below observed there was a passage in the 1991 Supreme Court Practice âon O 15 r 6 which set out the procedure to be adoptedwhen the action against the proposed added party was plainly time-barred and did not come within the condition described in s 35(5)of the Limitation Act â¦â¦â (ie equivalent to section 35(6) of Ordinance).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Mr Yip submits that sections 35(1), (3), (5) and (6) of Ordinance are interrelated. Since section 35(6) of Ordinance (equivalentto section 35(5) of Act which was considered by the Court of Appeal) flows from section 35(5) which in turns flows from section 35(3)(the effect of which is related to section 35(1), which provision was also considered by the Court of Appeal), the Court of Appealmust have considered the import of section 35(3) of Ordinance in <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case. Hence, the decision was not <i>per incuriam</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> I do not agree that <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case was decided <i>per incuriam</i>.  The Court of Appeal in that case was not in ignorance of the problem; it was aware of the impact of its determination of RelevantDate on any limitation defence. It did not fail to face the issue and its decision to favour the date when the amendment applicationwas filed over the hearing date of such application cannot be regarded as having been given <i>per incuriam</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Since the issue in the present case on its face cannot be distinguished from that in <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case, why should it not be followed? Mr Paoâs submission is that if the Court of Appeal had been referred to section 35(3)of Ordinance and had considered such section it would have appreciated that Relevant Date is the date when the court granted theamendment. What then is the significance of section 35(3)? It is said that it provides that the time-bar is to be determined by thedate when a new claim is âto be madeâ, which necessarily means the date when the amendment was granted. However, in <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case, although section 35(3) of Ordinance was not expressly mentioned in the judgment of Fuad VP, it is plain that the Courtof Appeal had section 35(3)very much in mind. I refer to Fuad VPâs judgment at p.209 where he said that âthe appropriate datefor a consideration of limitation questions in circumstances such as the present must be <i>the date the application is made</i> (in the sense that it is filed in court) â¦â¦â There is no statutory provision on what the phrase âto be madeâ means andMr Pao has not referred me to any binding authority which the Court of Appeal has failed to consider when it interpreted the datewhen the application to amend was âmadeâ as the date when it was filed. In the circumstances, there is nothing to suggest thatFuad VP was incorrect in saying that there was an absence of clear legislative provision or of binding authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Given the aforesaid analysis, particularly in light of the Court of Appealâs consideration of section 35 of Ordinance generallyand the fact that the Court of Appeal was plainly alive to the import of section 35(1) of Ordinance (ie the provision for relationback of amendments to the date of the original writ) which was expressly referred to in the judgment, I am not persuaded that <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case was decided <i>per incuriam</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> It is not sufficient to say that a particular legislative provision has not been expressly referred to in the judgment to rendera decision <i>per incuriam</i>. I have referred the parties to <b>Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20AC%20443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] AC 443</a> and <b>China Overseas Grand Gain Property Development Limited v Mok Yuen Fun and Persons Unknown</b> HCMP968/1999, Suffiad J (unreported, 15<sup>th</sup> April 2005). In <b>Miliangos</b>â case, Lord Simon said at p.477 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">âA previous decision of the same appellate court is not binding if it is given per incuriam: <i>Young v.

A court should only hold a judgment to have been given per incuriam if it is satisfied, first, that such judgment wasgiven in inadvertence to some authority (judge-made, statutory or regulatory) apparently binding on the court giving such judgmentand, secondly, that, if the court giving such judgment had been advertent to such authority, it would have decided otherwise thanit did â would, in fact, have applied the authority.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> In <b>China Overseas Grand Gain Property Development Limited</b>âs case, Suffiad J found that particular points taken by the defendant in that case had been decided in an earlier Court of Appealdecision which he was bound to follow. In the context of that case, the learned judge rejected the suggestion that a failure to referto a particular legislative provision in the earlier Court of Appeal decision made such decision <i>per incuriam</i>. The learned judge pointed out that the Court of Appeal was fully aware of the conflicting earlier cases which were decided on thewording of the relevant legislation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Mr Pao submits that the learned judge in <b>LCHY</b>âs case said if it could be shown plainly that the Court of Appeal had wrongly interpreted the Hague Convention, it was his duty(even though he was a lower court judge) to apply the plain meaning of the Convention instead of following the Court of Appeal. Insupport of this proposition, he cited <b>Farrell v Alexander</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20QB%20345" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 QB 345</a>, 359 where Lord Denning MR said â[no] court is entitled to throw over the plain words of a statute by referring to a previous judicialdecision.

The majority held that the earlier Court of Appeal decisionunder discussion did not come within the <i>per incuriam</i> doctrine. Lord Scarman has the following to say in respect of Lord Denningâs approach at p.371 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">âI decline to accept his lead only because I think it damaging to the law in the long term â though it would undoubtedly do justicein the present case. To some it will appear that justice is being denied by a timid, conservative adherence to judicial precedent.They would be wrong.

I am not persuaded that Lord Denningâs view forms a sufficient basis for extendingthe exceptions to the <i>per incuriam</i> rule or for upsetting the precedent doctrine.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> However, in deference to counselâs arguments and in case I am wrong, for completeness I now proceed to discuss the next question,namely, whether I am bound by <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case even if it were decided <i>per incuriam</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Mr Pao refers to <b>The Sources of Hong Kong Law</b> at pp.32-33 which confirms that (a) every court is bound by decisions of courts which are superior to itself in the same hierarchyand (b) a previous decision is incapable of binding effect if it has been declared <i>per incuriam</i>. He submits that the broad principles in <b>Young</b>âs case and <b>Morelle</b>âs case encompass the proposition that the lower courts are not bound to follow Court of Appeal decisions that are decided <i>per incuriam</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Mr Yip submits that <b>Young</b>âs case and <b>Morelle</b>âs case only deal with the issue whether the Court of Appeal can depart from its own decisions and there is no suggestion in thosecases that the <i>per incuriam</i> exception applies to the lower courts. He therefore argues that I am not entitled to declare <b>Lin Ban Thoon</b>âs case <i>per incuriam</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Apart from the above authorities, I have subsequent to the hearing invited further written submissions from the parties on <i>inter alia</i> <b>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd &amp; anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 1027</a> and <b>Hughes v Kingston upon Hull City Council</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20All%20ER%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 2 All ER 49.</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> The English Court of Appeal in <b>Broome</b>âs case held that an earlier House of Lords decision was wrong on the circumstances in which exemplary damages could be awarded.On appeal, Lord Hailsham rebuked Lord Denning MR and his colleagues at p.1054 : ââ¦â¦ even if [the Court of Appeal did not agreewith the House of Lordsâ earlier decision], it is not open to the Court of Appeal to give gratuitous advice to judges of firstinstance to ignore decisions of the House of Lords in this way â¦â¦ The fact is, and I hope it will never be necessary to say soagain, that, in the hierarchical system of courts which exists in this country, it is necessary for each lower tier, including theCourt of Appeal, to accept loyally the decisions of the higher tiersâ (also <i>per</i> Lord Diplock at p.1131).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> The English Court of Appeal in <b>Miliangos</b>â case again declined to follow a clear House of Lords decision that was contrary to its views. On appeal the House of Lords agreedwith the Court of Appealâs conclusion but held that it adopted a wrong approach. Lord Wilberforce said at p.459 that â[it] hasto be re-affirmed that the only judicial means by which decisions of this House can be reconsidered is by this House itself underthe declaration of 1996â (also <i>per</i> Lord Simon at p.479).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The learned judge in <b>LCHY</b>âs case also confirmed that âI cannot choose to prefer overseas authorities over our Court of Appeal decision even in the settingof the Hague Convention. It is not for me to say whether the Court of Appeal was right in adopting a different approach.

But again the precedent doctrine was not discussed at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> The issue eventually reached the Court of Appeal in <b>Awwad v Geraghty &amp; Co (a firm)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20QB%20570" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] QB 570.</a> The Court of Appeal found the criticisms made of <b>Thai Trading Co</b>âs case justified and decided not to follow its own decision in <b>Thai Trading Co</b>âs case. Still, Schiemann LJ said at p.587 that : ââ¦â¦ In that state of the recent authorities in my judgment while this courtis <i>bound</i> by the <i>Swain</i> case we are not bound to follow either the <i>Thai Trading</i> case or the <i>Mohamed</i> case. â¦â¦â (my emphasis).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The English Court of Appeal in <b>Awward</b>âs case affirmed the precedent doctrine, namely, that as a lower court it was bound by a decision of the House of Lords.

Order 20 rule 5(1) of RDC permits the court to grantsuch amendment without any particular requirementbeing satisfied. However, the court retains a discretion, the exercise of which will be discussed below.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> In case I am wrong, for completeness I now proceed to consider counselâs arguments on the actual accrual of Pâs cause of actionand any postponement thereof.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> <u>Accrual and postponement of the cause of action</u>  Mr Yip submits that without Assumption, Pâs cause of action vis-Ã -vis 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement actually would not have accrued on 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement Date. Pâs affirmation evidence says that by 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement D agreed to pay by instalments of HK$100,000.00 each every two months, so the contractual date for payment of the lastinstalment would have been some time in September 2002. Mr Yip says there is no contractual provision for acceleration of paymentof the whole outstanding balance of Reduced Sum upon default of any instalment on its due date (â<u>Acceleration</u>â). None has been pleaded or referred to in the affirmation evidence, so Pâs cause of action for the full amount of Balance onlyaccrued some time in 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> On the other hand, Mr Pao argues that even if Payments were payments made under 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement (which D disagrees â see below), Acceleration is an implied term of 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement such that upon Dâs default in payment of the first instalment on its due date of 20<sup>th</sup> January 1999, the then outstanding balance of Reduced Sum would become immediately due and payable. In such circumstances, the basicsix-year limitation period would have expired by 20<sup>th</sup> January 2005, ie after Summons Date but before Hearing Date. However, to succeed on this argument, D still has to pray in aid the<b>Welsh</b> line of authorities, which argument I have rejected. In case I am wrong, I will consider Dâs arguments for completeness.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> I note there is no dispute between the parties that Payments were made and Invoices were issued/received. Each Invoice not only statesthe then outstanding amount of Reduced Sum by Invoice Format but also makes Invoice Demand on its face. Thus each Invoice as addressedto D on its face plainly demands payment of the whole outstanding amount of Reduced Sum and not just the accrued instalments. Pâsaffirmation evidence also states that âpursuant to [3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement], HKBA issued [Invoices] to [D]â and â[despite] repeated demands through [Invoices], [D] defaulted in making payment.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Mr Yip submits that Invoice Format merely states the then total outstanding amount of each Invoice for reference. Such submissionis not supported by Pâs affirmation evidence and appears to fly against the plain wording of Invoices. In light of the objectiveevidence referred to above and even on Pâs case as presented before me (ie demands for the outstanding balance of Reduced Sum byInvoices long before September 2002), I find it probable that Acceleration is implicit for 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> On such basis, I agree with the following general proposition drawn from <b>Halsburyâs Law of Hong Kong</b> Vol.17(2) 2004 Reissue para.245.042 at p.405 cited by Mr Pao :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â If in an agreement for the repayment of an existing debt by instalments it is provided that on default of payment of any instalmentthe whole debt is to be recoverable, time runs as to the whole debt from the time of the first default in payment of an instalment.â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Therefore, under normal circumstances, Acceleration would have caused Pâs cause of action to accrue on 20<sup>th</sup> January 1999. The question is whether such accrual has been postponed by Payments subsequent to such date.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Section 23(3) of Ordinance provides <i>inter alia</i> that where any right of action has accrued to recover any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim and the person liable thereforemakes any payment in respect thereof, the right shall be deemed to have accrued on and not before the date of the last payment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> Mr Yip argues that by reason of Dâs late payment of various instalmentsmade under or in respect of 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement (eg the first instalment of HK$100,000.00 due on 20<sup>th</sup> January 1999 was paid on 22<sup>nd</sup> March 1999) which were accepted by HKBA (ie by its acceptance of Payments), the accrual of Pâs cause of action was postponed to1<sup>st</sup> November 2001 (ie the date of Dâs last Payment).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Mr Pao submits there are several aspects to this issue : (a) the nature of Payments, ie whether they are payments under 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement, (b) their relevance to the accrual of the cause of action under 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement and (c) whether section 23(3) of Ordinance is applicable to Pâs claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> In respect of (a), the court will look at the act and intention of the debtor to see whether the payment was made âin respect ofa particular debtâ. The court is concerned with the actual position as understood by the parties at the time of payment ratherthan the legal analysis placed on that payment. <b>Halsburyâs Laws of England</b> 4<sup>th</sup> ed, Vol.28, para.1104 at p.564 states as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">âThe payment must be âin respect ofâ the debt or claim. The debtorâs express declarations at the time of the payment are conclusive,but assertions made by him subsequent to the payment are not.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">   The nature of a payment may be inferred from the nature of similar payments made at other times; and, although the plaintiff mustin all cases give some evidence that the payment relied on was made in respect of some debt, the circumstances attending the payment,even without any direct evidence, may be such as to render it improbable that the payment could be made for any other purpose. Whenit is once established that the payment was made in respect of some debt and no other debt than the one sued for then existed, theinference may be drawn that the payment was in respect of the debt sued for â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> Mr Pao submits there is evidence that Payments were made on WGLLâs behalf, so Payments are not made in respect of 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement. However, I note that Payments were made by Dâs cheques and Payment Receipts were issued to D and not WGLL. Further,HKBA by Invoice Format treated Payments as payments in reduction of the outstanding balance of Reduced Sum. There is no suggestionon the evidence before me that D objected to Invoices (addressed to D) and D in fact continued to issue cheques for Payments. AlthoughD claimed it was merely WGLLâs payment agent and Payment Receipts should have been issued to WGLL, there is no evidence that D/Kwongobjected to Payment Receipts made out to D. In my view, on the evidence before me at this stage, given the objective facts outlinedabove, it is probable that Payments were in respect of 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement/Reduced Sum and, subject to satisfying the other requirements of section 23(3) of Ordinance, such part Payments are sufficientto start time running afresh (<b>Halsburyâs Laws of England</b> 4<sup>th</sup> ed, Vol.28, para.1083 at p.553).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> In respect of (b), Mr Pao suggests that since Payments were made by D on WGLLâs behalf, they do not have the effect of postponingthe accrual of Pâs cause of action. However, in light of my conclusion on (a), I am not with Mr Pao on this argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> In respect of (c), Mr Pao submits that Pâs claim is for damages for breach of contract and not for payment of a debt (see distinctionin <b>Chitty on Contracts</b> 29<sup>th</sup> ed. (2004), Vol.1, para.26-009 at pp.1428-1429). I note that part payment does not postpone the limitation period in relation tounliquidated claims (section 25(6) of Ordinance and McGee, <b>Limitation Periods</b> 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (2002) para.18.005 at p.317). McGee, <b>Limitation Periods</b>, para.18.006 at p.318 goes on to say as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â[The meaning of âliquidated claimâ] is a matter which has received very little judicial attention. In <i>Amantilla v. Telefusion</i> the claim was for a <i>quantum meruit</i>, and it became necessary to decide whether this was a liquidated claim. It was held that it was, the claim having a sufficientlycertain contractual description for the amount to be ascertainable by the court. This should not be regarded as a decision that all<i>quantum meruit</i> claims are liquidated claims for this purpose. Rather, it is a question of fact in each case whether the particular claim is sufficientlycertain. In <i>Byatt v. Nash</i> it was held that a solicitorâs claim for unpaid fees is a liquidated claim in this context.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> In the present case, Pâs claim is obviously pecuniary in nature. But is Pâs claim liquidated? In both <b>Amantilla</b>âs case and <b>Byatt</b>âs case referred to above, the claimants claimed for monies due under the contracts. Here Pâs claim is for damages for breachof contract. Since the amount of damages has to be assessed by the court, I am of the view that Pâs claim is not a liquidated claimeven though the amount of damages is quantifiable. I refer to <b>Alco International Limited v Akai Electronic Co, Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%203%20HKC%20724" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 3 HKC 724</a> where the court was concerned with <i>inter alia</i> a claim for damages for breach of contract, namely, loss of profits. Suffiad J said at p.730 that â[as] for the defendantâs claimfor loss of profits in the amount of US$20,922 â¦â¦ and US$4,680 â¦â¦, the amount of loss of profit in these two transactions,although quantified by the defendant, are not liquidated claims but must be assessed by the court â¦â¦â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> In the circumstances, Pâs claim is not a liquidated pecuniary claim within the meaning of section 25(6) of Ordinance. Hence, theaccrual of Pâs cause of action has not been postponed and if I am wrong in relying on <b>Lim Ban Thoon</b>âs case, the actual basic limitation period for Pâs claim would have expired on 20<sup>th</sup> January 2005 before Hearing Date or the date of this decision.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(4) Order 20 rule 5 of RDC</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> Assuming that the relevant period of limitation for Members Amendment has expired (which I disagree), I will next consider the effectof Order 20 rule 5 of RDC for completeness. Order 20 rule 5 of RDC provides <i>inter alia</i> that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â(1) Subject to Order 15, rules 6, 7 and 8 and this rule, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amendhis writ, or any party to amend his pleadings, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any)as it may direct.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) Where an application to the Court for leave to make the amendment mentioned in paragraph (3), (4) or (5) is made after any relevantperiod of limitation current at the date of issue of the writ has expired, the Court may nevertheless grant such leave in the circumstancesmentioned in those paragraphs if it thinks it just to do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) An amendment to correct the name of a party may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding that it is alleged that the effectof the amendment will be to substitute a new party if the Court is satisfied that the mistake sought to be corrected was a genuinemistake and was not misleading or such as to cause any reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intending to sue or, asthe case may be, intended to be sued. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> Mr Yip suggests that even if the effect of Members Amendment is to substitute a new party and the relevant limitation period hasexpired, Members Amendment is still permissible under Order 20 rule 5(2) and (3) of RDC (see also section 35(5), (6) and (7) of Ordinance).He refers to <b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> Vol.1, para.20/8/19 at p.355 which states as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">âThe word âmistakeâ in r.5(3) should not be narrowly construed to mean error without fault (<i>per</i> Russell L.J. in <i>Mitchell v.

He submits that other than a bare assertion in Pâsaffirmation evidence, there is no primary evidence for the court to infer that the âmistakeâ is genuine. Further, the âmistakeâis misleading. As a matter of law (see above) and it is Dâs belief (as evidenced by the solicitorsâ correspondence and DiscoverySummons) that Pâs present description refers to BEL acting on behalf of Writ Date Members. Indeed, D sought specific discoveryof Items A and B with a view to bring a striking out application if such documents reveal there is fluctuation in HKBAâs membershipduring that period.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> Neither counsel cites any case authority on the interpretation of Order 20 rule 5(3) of RDC. However, I note that the Court of Appealin <b>Kutex International Ltd v Shui Hing Investment Co Ltd &amp; anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20HKC%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 HKC 192</a> reminded that in applying Order 20 rule 5(3), it was important to bear in mind the distinction between suing A in the mistaken beliefthat A was the party who was responsible for the matters complained of and seeking to sue B, but mistakenly describing and naminghim as A and thereby ending up suing A instead of B. The rule was designed to correct the latter and not the former category of mistake.Which category was involved in any particular case depended upon the intentions of the persons making the mistake and they had tobe determined on the evidence in light of all the circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> In my view, as noted by Mr Pao, there is sparse primary evidence for me to consider whether BEL has all along intended to act for9/8/97 Members but mistakenly described and named âMembersâ in the Writ of Summons or whether, as asserted in the affirmationof Pâs director Mr Kam Kwok Fong, Members Amendment was to âmake clearâ BEL is suing on behalf of 9/8/97 Members and âtoput this matter beyond doubtâ. However, Members Amendment was only made after Dâs solicitors sought specific discovery of HKBAâsmembership lists via correspondence. Plainly, Members Amendment is a reaction to the request for specific discovery. I am doubtfulwhether there is any genuine mistake.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> Further, even if the âmistakeâ is a genuine one, based on my analysis in paragraphs 25-35 above, I rather think the âmistakeâis misleading in that Pâs present description has been understood by D to refer to BEL acting on behalf of Writ Date Members (assupported by the law elicited from <b>Carlton</b>âs case and <b>Jarrot</b>âs case). In the circumstances, I doubt whether the âmistakeâ is of the permissible category envisaged in <b>Kutex</b>âs case. I do not think Order 20 rule 5 of RDC is of assistance to P.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(</u><i><u>5</u></i><i><u>) Order 15 rule 6 of RDC</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> However, Order 20 rule 5(1) of RDC provides that it is subject to Order 15 rule 6, which provides <i>inter alia</i> that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â(5) No person shall be added or substituted as a party after the expiry of any relevant period of limitation unless either-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)           the relevant period was current at the date when proceedings were commenced and it is necessary for the determinationof the action that the new party should be added, or substituted; or â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>In this paragraph, "any relevant period of limitation" (ä»»ä½æéçæææ) means a time limit under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a>).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6) The addition or substitution of a new party shall be treated as necessary for the purposes of paragraph (5)(a) if, and only if,the Court is satisfied that-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)           the new party is a necessary party to the action in that property is vested in him at law or in equity and the plaintiff'sclaim in respect of an equitable interest in that property is liable to be defeated unless the new party is joined; or â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Order 15 rule 6 of RDC sets out the exceptions to the prohibition in section 35(3) of Ordinance against allowing any new claim (includingthe addition or substitution of a new party) in a pending action after the expiry of the current period of limitation (see also section35(6) and (7) of Ordinance). Both counsel cite <b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> Vol.1, para.15/6/3 at p.208 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â There are however, three exceptions to the general rule stated above.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">First, where the relevant period was current at the date when the new proceedings were commenced and it is necessary for the determinationof the action that the new party should be added or substituted (see para. 5(a), and s.35(6) and (7) of the Ordinance). For thispurpose, the addition or substitution of a new party will be treated as ânecessaryâ if the court is satisfied that one of thefollowing conditions is fulfilled:</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">(a) the new party is a necessary party to the action, in that property is vested in him at law or in equity and the plaintiffsâclaim in respect of an equitable interest in that property is liable to be defeated unless the new party is joined (para. 6(a) above)and see <i>Asia Wide Properties Ltd. &amp; Another v.

It is also Dâscase that Members Amendment involves a substitution of a new party. The question is whether there is any âpropertyâ vested in9/8/97 Members such that the joinder of 9/8/97 Members is necessary for the determination of the action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> Mr Yip submits that the contractual rights under 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement being the subject matter of the present proceedings are intangible property rights vested in P falling within Order 15rule 6(6)(a) of RDC. He argues that an unduly restrictive interpretation will rob the relevant rules of their usefulness.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> Mr Pao submits that Order 15 rule 6(5) and (6) of RDC deal with the situation when the plaintiffâs claim is not completely constituted.Here, Pâs case is completely constituted unto its own and there is no suggestion that Pâs claim is liable to be defeated in respectof any equitable interest in property vested in 9/8/97 Members. This does not sit well with Dâs professed intention of possiblybringing an application to strike out Pâs claim. Next, Mr Pao says âpropertyâ cannot be interpreted to mean choses in actionsuch as contractual rights and cites <b>Asia Wide Properties Ltd</b>âs case in support where Yam J said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âSince there is no property vested in the proposed 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants in law or in equity, the joinder cannot be said to be necessary for the determination of the action. It cannot be saidthat the action would be defeated unless the proposed 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants are joined.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I am not persuaded that this case is of assistance because on the facts the intended defendants to be joined were only nominee directorsfor the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and there is no evidence that any property was vested in them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> In my view, to answer the aforesaid question, the court has to determine whether (a) there is âpropertyâ vested in law or equityin 9/8/97 Members and (b) Pâs claim in respect of an equitable interest in that property is liable to be defeated unless 9/8/97Members are joined.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> I am not with Mr Pao when he suggests that âpropertyâ does not include choses in action or contractual rights. He has not citedany authority or legislative provision for his proposition. I note that âpropertyâ is defined in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap.1</a> as follows (applicable pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2(1)</a> of such ordinance) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">ââpropertyâ includes â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) money, goods, choses in action and land; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) obligations, easements and every description of estate, interest and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, arisingout of or incident to property as defined in paragraph (a) of this definition; â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> There is no dispute that members of an unincorporated association may become bound on contracts entered into on their behalf by anagent and they also have a right to enforce it (see paragraph 23 above). In such circumstances, on Pâs case, the contractual rightsunder 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement (which agreement amounts to a compromise of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreements) are vested in 9/8/97 Members and Pâs claim is liable to be defeated unless 9/8/97 Members are named and joined as aparty. This is apparent from <b>Carlton</b>âs case and <b>Jarrot</b>âs case cited by Mr Pao. Therefore, even if the relevant limitation period has expired (which I disagree), Members Amendment stillfalls within Order 15 rule 6(5) and (6) of RDC to enable the court to exercise its discretion to allow such amendment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(6) Timing of Members Amendment</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> Mr Pao submits that Members Amendment insofar as it relates to the claim for damages based on breach of 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement (ie Contract Amendment) has been unclear until clarification by further amendment of the draft Amended Statement of Claimat Hearing Date. Mr Pao queries whether Members Amendment was in fact applied for at Summons Date or at Hearing Date.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> In my view, Amendments should be read realistically in its context. I find it is quite plain even from the original draft AmendedStatement of Claim annexed to Amendment Summons that the proposed Members Amendment refers <i>inter alia</i> to an amendment of Pâs description to read as BEL acting for and on behalf of 9/8/97 Members in place of Writ Date Members in thecontext of Pâs claim for damages for breach of 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement. I do not see any confusion or uncertainty as to the purport of Members Amendment irrespective of Contract Amendment soughtat Hearing Date. In any event, Contract Amendment is not a new claim that attracts limitation considerations.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(e)</u> <i><u>Analysis of Tong Amendment</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> Both counsel repeat their arguments in relation to Members Amendment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(1) Timing of Tong Amendment</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> Mr Pao suggests that Tong Amendment is only perfected at Hearing Date as a result of Contract Amendment. He therefore argues thatby such time the relevant limitation period has expired. I repeat paragraphs 112-113 above, which are also applicable <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to Tong Amendment, and reject such argument. It is plain from the original draft Amended Statement of Claim annexed to AmendmentSummons that the purport of Tong Amendment was for an alternative plea as a matter of law in case the court finds that Tong did notcontract on behalf of 9/8/97 Members.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(2) Conflict with Tongâs primary position</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> Mr Pao submits that Tong Amendment should not be allowed because Tong has affirmed that he contracted on HKBAâs behalf. He suggeststhat there is no evidence to demonstrate that Tong contracted in his personal capacity. I do not agree with such submission. It hasalways been Pâs primary stance that Tong contracted on behalf of HKBA or 9/8/97 Members. Tong Amendment is to cater for the situationif the court finds against Pâs primary stance, in which case Tong having signed Agreements may be held as a matter of law to havecontracted personally (<b>Chitty on Contracts</b> 29<sup>th</sup> ed (2004) Vol.1, para.9-068 at p.653). I do not see any conflict as suggested by Mr Pao.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(3) Failure of consideration</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> Mr Pao informs me that he will not pursue the argument that there is no demonstrable consideration for Tong to enter into Agreementsfor the purpose of Amendment Summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(4) Limitation issue</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> On Pâs case, Tongâs cause of action against D turns on the courtâs eventual finding on his legal capacity (ie whether as agentor principal) in entering into Agreements. If he did so without authority, he may be held to have contracted personally. If he hadthe authority, express or implied, of all or some 9/8/97 Members to contract on their behalf, such Members as co-principals may enforce3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement by the ordinary rules of agency.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> Hence the accrual of Tongâs cause of action and any limitation issue arising therefrom turn on the same analysis as those for MembersAmendment. However, since Tong is not mentioned in the original Statement of Claim, there can be no dispute that Tong Amendment isan application for addition of a new party to the present action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> Mr Pao fairly accepts that if I am not with him on his arguments on the limitation issues, D will likely fail in its opposition againstTong Amendment. As seen from the above analysis, I am indeed not with Mr Pao on his contentions. But if I am wrong, I will for completenessconsider the question whether Order 15 rule 6 and Order 20 rule 5 of RDC are applicable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(5) Order 15 rule 6 of RDC</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> I have no hesitation in concluding that Order 15 rule 6(5)(a) and 6(a) of RDC (see also section 35(6) and (7) of Ordinance) are notapplicable. Although the relevant limitation period was current as at Writ Date, the addition of Tong as a party is not necessaryfor the determination of the action. Pâs claim (with Members Amendment) is fully constituted by itself and does not require theaddition of Tong to perfect it. In short, Pâs claim is not liable to be defeated if Tong is not joined as a co-plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(6) Order 20 rule 5(5) of RDC</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> Mr Yip suggests that Tong Amendment can be allowed under Order 20 rule 5(5) of RDC (see also section 35(6) of Ordinance) since itarose out of the same or substantially the same facts as the cause already pleaded. Indeed, both counsel accept that the factualbasis that underlies the cause of action under Tong Amendment is no different from that of Pâs claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> <b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> Vol.1, para.20/8/8 at pp.348-349 summarises the effect of section 35(5) of Ordinance and Order 20 rule 5(5) of RDC as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â[S.35 of Ordinance] seems to emphasise that the principle underlying the provisions in s.35 and of the rules made thereunder isrestrictive.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">In relation to a claim involving a new cause of action the conditions which the rules of court must satisfy are specified in s.35(6)(a),which provides as follows:</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">â(a) in the case of a claim involving a new cause of action, if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantiallythe same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leaveto make the amendment.â</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">These words are substantially the same as the words in r.5(5). Accordingly, the power to allow the addition or substitution of a newcause of action after the expiry of the relevant period of limitation is now to be derived from r.5(5), as if it were made underthe powers to make rules of court specified in s.35(5), and the cases decided under this rule before the Ordinance are to be regardedas binding and in full force.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> Mr Yip further refers to <b>Leung Kin Fook &amp; ors v Eastern Worldwide Co Ltd (No. 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20HKC%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 HKC 524.</a> In that case, the plaintiff intended to add <i>inter alia</i> further claims for breach of contract and tort to the original claim based on breach of bailment. The contractual duties arose outof the same contractual arrangements as already pleaded and the duty of care also arose from the relationship of owner and chartereras pleaded. Liu JA held that there is a significant overlap of the factual matrix and the words in Order 20 rule 5(5) should be givena broad and liberal interpretation to attain the objective of the rules. He also applied <b>Welsh Development Agency</b>âs case to say that whether there was overlapping of facts was âsubstantially a matter of impressionâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> In my view, Tong Amendment plainly arises from the same facts or substantially the same facts as Pâs cause of action. It is onlya matter of interpretation of Tongâs legal capacity at the time of the execution of 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement that will determine whether 9/8/97 Members or Tong was the proper party to and/or has the right to sue on such agreement.However, satisfying the requirements under Order 20 rule 5(5) of RDC is not sufficient because Order 20 rule 5(1) of RDC specificallyprovides that it is subject to <i>inter alia</i> Order 15 rule 6. Order 15 rule 6(5) of RDC specifically provides that no person shall be added as a party after the expiry of therelevant time limit unless the requirements therein are satisfied. Since Tong Amendment does not satisfy such requirements, Tongcannot be added as a 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff if the relevant limitation period has expired.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>(f)</u> <i><u>Conclusion on Amendment Summons</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> Both counsel accept the following broad principles :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) generally amendments in pleadings ought to be made for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy or for correctingany defect/error in any proceedings;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b) there is no kind of error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the court ought not to correct, if itcan be done without injustice to the other party;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c) Order 15 rule 6 of RDC should be construed so as to bring all parties to disputes relating to one subject matter before the courtat the same time so that the disputes may be determined without delay, inconvenience and expense of separate actions and trials;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d) amendments are allowed to add a plaintiff whose presence is necessary to enable the question at issue to be properly determined.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In light of such principles and my aforesaid analysis, I consider it appropriate to exercise my discretion to allow Amendments soughtby P.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>VI. Discovery Summons</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> By Discovery Summons, D sought specific discovery of the following documents against P : (a) Item A, (b) Item B, (c) the bylaws and/orrules and regulations of HKBA applicable on Contract Date (â<u>Item C</u>â) and (d) all documents, letters or memorandum pertaining to the due authorisation of BEL to act on behalf of itself and all otherMembers in this action.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> At Hearing Date, I granted leave to P to amend the request in sub-paragraph (d) of the above paragraph to read as âall documents,letters or memoranda pertaining to any objection or disapproval indicated by any member of HKBA (as at [Contract or Writ Date]) inrelation to BEL acting as a representative plaintiff in this actionâ (â<u>Item D</u>â). Pâs solicitors confirmed by letter dated 1<sup>st</sup> March 2005 to Dâs solicitors that P did not have Item D in its possession, custody or power. Mr Pao confirms that D will not pursueItem D.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> After the issuance of Discovery Summons, P filed a supplemental list of documents to disclose copy Rules and later confirmed thatRules have not been amended as at Contract Date. Mr Pao again confirms that D will not pursue Item C save as to costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> Mr Pao also concedes that D will not pursue Item B if I allow Amendments. Since I have allowed Amendments, Item B becomes irrelevant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> That leaves Item A. P disclosed the following documents in its supplemental list of documents filed on 1<sup>st</sup> September 2004 : (a) copy 18/8/97 Minutes, (b) copy Rules, (c) copies of invoices and receipts issued by HKBA in respect of membershipfee (from 1995 to 2002/03) evidencing that BEL was as at Contract Date and still is a Member of HKBA and (d) copy of BELâs annualreturn dated 1<sup>st</sup> May 2004 showing that it was a company owned and controlled by Tong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> P explained that Hong Kong Badminton Association Limited (â<u>HKBAL</u>â) was incorporated on 23<sup>rd</sup> April 2001. Members who paid annual membership fee to HKBAL were no longer required to pay membership fee to HKBA. BEL continuedto pay membership fee to HKBAL for 2003/04 as evidenced by a receipt dated 15<sup>th</sup> May 2004 issued by HKBAL in BELâs favour.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> Mr Pao submits that no issue has been taken as to whether Item A was within Pâs possession, custody or power. Since BEL took outrepresentative proceedings, it must have access to information and documents relevant to the present claim against D. As an unincorporatedassociation, HKBA must keep proper records of its membership at all material times for the purpose of its operations. HKBA shouldtherefore have Item A in its possession.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> Mr Pao submits that Item A is relevant to the following issues : (a) Pâs capacity to contract and to sue, (b) whether Members werenumerous and (c) whether BEL was/is Member at the relevant time.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> I am not persuaded that issue (a) is still relevant. D by its Defence challenged (i) whether P as described in the original pleadingsis a proper party having capacity to sue for and on behalf of Members, and (ii) whether 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement was entered into on Contract Date with the authority of all Members such that it constituted a binding contract existingbetween Members and D. Dâs original purpose in seeking Items A and B is to ascertain whether there is any change in HKBAâs membershipbetween Contract and Writ Dates, and if there is, given that Pâs description in the original pleadings refers to BEL acting forand on behalf of Writ Date Members and not 9/8/97 Members (ie the contracting party), Pâs claim is wrongly constituted and liableto be struck out. However, as I have allowed Members Amendment and D has consequently abandoned Item B, the purpose of the proposedexercise is now spent.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> Mr Yip further submits that in any event, Item A is irrelevant as regards Pâs capacity to sue. He refers to <b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> Vol.1, para.15/12/7 at pp.235-236 which states that â[a] person or persons claiming to represent numerous other persons havingthe same interest may begin an action as the representative plaintiff or plaintiffs â¦â¦ Representative plaintiffs may be self-elected:the consent of those represented is not necessary in choosing representatives (<i>Sung Sheung-hong v Leung Wong Soo-ching</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20HKLR%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] H.K.L.R. 602).â</a> The learned editors also say in para.6/5/9 at p.61 that â[where] a person sues on behalf of himself and others in a representativeaction under O.15, r.12, he is the sole plaintiff, and the others are not plaintiffs, and the names and addresses cannot be obtained(see <i>Leathley v McAndrew</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1875%5d%20WN%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1875] W.N. 275).â</a> In <b>Markt &amp; Co, Ltd v Knight Steamship Co, Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1910%5d%202%20KB%201021" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1910] 2 KB 1021</a>, 1039, Fletcher Moulton LJ said â[in] representative actions it is wholly different.  The plaintiff is the self-elected representativeof the others.  He has not to obtain their consent.  â¦â¦â Mr Yip submits that BEL being a Member as at Contract Date and asat all material times was/is bound by Agreements and shares a common interest with each and every 9/8/97 Member. As D is not entitledto the names of 9/8/97 Members and BEL can be self-elected, D cannot seek Item A.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> As regards Pâs capacity to contract, Mr Yip submits that the documents as disclosed in Pâs supplemental lists of document andaffirmation evidence clearly establish that Exco is authorised under Rules to act on behalf of Members. Exco in turn authorised Tongto enter into 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement.  Pâs affirmation evidence also confirms that it is customary for Tong as HKBAâs president to negotiate the terms ofand to sign sponsorship agreements on Membersâ behalf.  Therefore, Tong was duly authorised to sign 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreements and to enter into 3<sup>rd</sup> Agreement on behalf of 9/8/97 Members. Item A is irrelevant on this issue since it has never been Pâs case that Tong had authorityfrom each and every 9/8/97 Member to contract. P does not even contend that all 9/8/97 Members or that 9/8/97 Members in meetingformally ratified the authorisation given to Tong by Exco.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> I accept Mr Yipâs submissions. On the above analysis, I am not prepared to grant discovery of Item A for issue (a).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> As regards issue (b), Mr Pao submits that it is an essential requirement for representative proceedings under Order 15 rule 12 ofRDC for the representative plaintiff to act for ânumerous personsâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> Mr Yip reminds that Tong has already affirmed that as at Contract Date there were 44 full and 53 affiliated Members, so it is quiteplain that 9/8/97 Members were numerous. Further, even if D is entitled to seek discovery of Item A for this issue, Mr Yip says thenames of 9/8/97 Members are irrelevant and should be expurgated from the register/list to be disclosed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> Mr Pao argues that in respect of issue (c), it is necessary to ascertain whether BEL was a Member of HKBA as at Contract Date otherwiseit does not have the right to sue on behalf of 9/8/97 Members. Mr Pao argues that the disclosure of receipts of annual subscriptionfees issued by HKBA to BEL does not sufficiently address Dâs request for Item A. The proper method of proof is by HKBAâs registerof members, which is a relevant document that ought to be discovered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> Mr Yip on the other hand argues that the invoices and receipts in relation to BELâs payment of membership fees to HKBA and HKBALsufficiently show BELâs status as HKBAâs Member.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> The principles in this area of the law are well-established and helpfully summarised in <b>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2004</b> Vol.1, para.24/7/1 at pp.435-436 as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) There is no jurisdiction to make an order under Order 24 rule 7 for production of documents unless (i) there is sufficient evidencethat the documents exist which the other party has not disclosed, (ii) the document(s) relate to matters in issue in the action,and (iii) there is sufficient evidence that the documents are in the possession, custody and power of the other party.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) When it is established that those three prerequisites for jurisdiction do exist, the court has a discretion whether or not toorder disclosure.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) The order must identify with precision the document(s) or category(ies) which are required to be disclosed, for otherwise theperson making the list may find himself in serious trouble for swearing to a false affidavit, even though doing his best to givean honest disclosure.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> Under Order 24 rule 8 of RDC, the court if satisfied that discovery is not necessary or not necessary at that stage of the causeor matter may dismiss or adjourn the application and not make the specific discovery order if and so far as it is of the opinionthat discovery is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. The burden of establishingthat a document is not necessary falls on the respondent opposing discovery (<b>The Secretary for Justice v Wembley International (HK) Limited &amp; anor</b> HCA8518/1998 Deputy High Court Judge Gill (unreported, 15<sup>th</sup> January 2002)).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> In my view and on the authorities cited by Mr Yip, I am not persuaded that D is entitled to the names and addresses of all 9/8/97Members. Such information is irrelevant to the contested issues between the parties. Next, is Item A necessary for issues (b) and(c)? As regards issue (b), Tong has gone on affirmation to confirm the number of full and affiliated Members as at Contract Date.Little purpose is served is allowing discovery of Item A just to confirm the number of 9/8/97 Members with their names and addressesexpurgated. Order 24 rule 8 of RDC reminds that even if the documents requested are relevant, the discovery must be refused if itis not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. So where the issue will become sufficientlyclear from evidence or documents placed or to be placed before the court, additional discovery requested should not be ordered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> As regards issue (c), I am prepared to allow specific discovery of the extract page of HKBAâs register or list of Members as atContract Date that shows BEL as Member but with the names and addresses of other Members expurgated. This will satisfy the discoveryrequirement over the issue as to whether BEL was a Member as at Contract Date.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>VII. Conclusion</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> In respect of Amendment Summons, I make the following orders :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) P be at liberty to amend its Writ of Summons as shown in red on the copy attached to Amendment Summons and to amend its Statementof Claim as shown in red on the copy attached to Amendment Summons and as further amended pursuant to my orders made at Hearing Date;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) service of the Amended Writ of Summons be dispensed with;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) leave to P to file and serve the Amended Statement of Claim within 7 days from the date hereof;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d) leave to D to file and serve its Amended Defence within 14 days thereafter.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> In respect of costs of Amendment Summons, I grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that costs of and occasioned by the application for amendment be paid by P to D, including the costs of Pâs two oral applicationson Hearing Date for further amendment of the draft Amended Statement of Claim annexed to Amendment Summons (apportioned as half anhour of the hearing time to assist the taxing master), but the costs of and occasioned by Dâs opposition of Amendment Summons (includingcosts relating to the affirmations in opposition and reply, the costs of the hearing of such application before me, the costs ofthe further written submissions and all costs reserved in respect of Amendment Summons (if any)) be paid by D to P. The aforesaidcosts are to be taxed if not agreed with certificate for counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> In respect of Discovery Summons, I order that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) P do within 14 days from the date hereof make and file an affirmation stating whether it has or had at any time in its possession,custody or power any document falling within the description of âextract page of HKBAâs register or list of Members as at ContractDate showing BEL as Member but with the names and addresses other Members expurgatedâ, and if the said document has been but isnot now in its possession, custody or power stating when it parted with the same and what has become of the same;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) there be inspection of the said expurgated document within 7 days after the filing and service of the affirmation referred toin (a) above (if applicable).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> For its requests for specific discovery, D was successful to a limited extent in relation to Item A and unsuccessful vis-Ã -vis ItemB. Item C was resolved by disclosure of Rules in Pâs supplemental list of documents. Given Pâs voluntary discovery of copy Rulesand its reliance on Rules and Excoâs resolutions to support Tongâs authority to enter into 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement on behalf of 9/8/97 Members, D is justified in requesting Item C. Item D was resolved at the hearing before me throughcompromise between the parties by D amending the wording of its request and P responding to the amended request by way of solicitorsâcorrespondence. In the circumstances, since both parties are successful to some extent in their respective contentions, I considerthat the appropriate order for Discovery Summons (including the costs of Dâs oral application at the Hearing Date to amend DiscoverySummons) is no order as to costs. I grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> to such effect accordingly.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> For the convenience of the taxing master, I apportion two-thirds of the hearing time before me for Amendment Summons and one-thirdfor Discovery Summons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>VIII.</u> <i><u>Publication of this</u></i> <i><u>decision</u></i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> Pursuant to Practice Direction 25.1, I request the parties to make written representations on the release of this decision for publicationwithin the next 7 days.
