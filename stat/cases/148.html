Introduction</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The trial of the Action and the Counterclaim was set down for 5 days from 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> January 2009.  The Defendant who was acting in person did not appear.  This was also the case for the 2 Pre-trial Reviews, and noticeof the hearing dates for the trial was sent to the Defendantâs last known address by ordinary and registered post.  At the endof the hearing on 6 January, I gave judgment for the Plaintiff on her claim, dismissed the Defendantâs counterclaim, and awardedcosts of and occasioned by the claim to the Plaintiff to be taxed under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/91" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Ordinance</a> and Regulations, with costs of the Counterclaim to be payable by the Defendant.  I now give my reasons.</p>    <p class="heading">II. Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The undisputed background facts are as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The parties have been acquainted since 2001.  This case concerns arrangements whereby the Plaintiff was to act as the Defendantâssole agent in the marketing and sale of several Chinese paintings (âthe Paintingsâ), and the Defendant was to and did receivea loan of HK$3 million from the Plaintiff.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  By a Loan Agreement dated 19.8.2005 (âthe Loan Agreementâ), the Plaintiff lent the Defendant HK$3 million.  According tothe terms, the loan was to be repaid on or before 18.9.2005 (Clause 4.2).  If repayment was not effected by that date, interest wouldbe payable in the sum of HK$60,000 on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of each calendar month (Clause 3.1).  This reflected the 2% interest rate under Clause 1.3 of the loan agreement.  Any interestpayments not made when due would be regarded as an advance, and would be deemed part of the Loan to which the provisions of Clause3 would apply (Clause 3.2). </p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The parties entered into to an Agency Agreement on the same date 19.8.2005 (âthe Agency Agreementâ), whereby the Plaintiffwas appointed as the Defendantâs sole and exclusive worldwide agent for the marketing and sale of certain paintings (Clause 1). The duration of the Agreement was 1 year (Clause 3).  The Plaintiff would receive commission of 1 per cent of the sale price ofeach Painting (Clause 4). </p>        <p class="quote">(4)  As to the loan, it is undisputed that except for a sum of HK$60,000 paid on about 20.9.2005, the Defendant has not repaid theprincipal amount, nor interest.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  As to the agency for marketing and sale of the Paintings, it is also undisputed that the Defendant ultimately appointed Christiesto sell 22 of the 31 Paintings.  14 of those Paintings were eventually sold at auction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">III. Partiesâ main Contentions</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Consolidated Statement of Claim dated 5.3.2007 (âCSOCâ) pleads :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  2 implied terms in the Agency Agreement; reasonable access to show the Paintings; and that the Defendant would not do any actsto hinder or frustrate the Plaintiffâs efforts as agent.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  Rectification of the Loan Agreement as the parties had intended to delete Clause 3.2, instead of Clause 4.1.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The Defendantâs breach of the Agency Agreement by approaching and engaging Christies on about 22.8.2005 to sell the Paintingswithout the Plaintiffâs knowledge or consent; by refusing to sell or stipulate counter-offers; and/or by refusing access to thePlaintiff to show potential clients the Paintings since 22.8.2005.  As a result, loss and damage was suffered.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  The Defendant has not paid any principal or interest due and owing, except the sole payment of HK$60,000 on 20.9.2005.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Defendantâs Consolidated Defence and Counterclaim (âD&amp;CCâ) pleads :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The Defendant was not the owner of the Paintings and never held himself out as such.  He was however, entrusted with the possessionof and entitled to utilise the proceeds derived from the sale of the Paintings.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  As to the Agency Agreement, he maintains there were oral and written terms, inter alia, the Plaintiff :-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">a.  had the knowhow and expertise in ascertaining the genuineness and true value of the Paintings;</p>            <p class="quote">b.  had the expertise and connections, and would use all due care and skill to ensure the Paintings would be sold at the best price;</p>            <p class="quote">c.  had a duty to introduce purchasers who were genuinely interested to purchase the Paintings, and that she would use her best endeavoursto sell at the best possible price.</p>            <p class="quote">d.  had a duty of care in similar terms.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  As to the Loan Agreement, that the loan was to last for <i>1 year</i> until 18.8.2006, rather than at the maturity date of 18.9.2005. </p>        <p class="quote">(4)  He denies the Agreement should be rectified. </p>        <p class="quote">(5)  He alleges that the loan is void, unenforceable, and/or not binding as the Plaintiff was a money lender without licence; and/orthe loan was illegal as compound interest was provided for in Clause 3.2.  Alternatively, the Loan is only enforceable to such extentas the Court considers equitable.</p>        <p class="quote">(6)  As to the Agency Agreement, he alleges the Plaintiff was in breach and/or negligent because she :-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">a.  advised to sell the whole lot of paintings for HK$3 million (and later HK$2.5 million), when 4 of the paintings drawn by ZhangDaqian were worth HK$5.66 million;</p>            <p class="quote">b.  failed and/or refused to properly advise the true value of the Paintings when she knew he was relying on her expertise;</p>            <p class="quote">c.  claimed the paintings by Zhang Daqian were fakes and attempted to induce him to sell on such basis.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(7)  He also alleges fraud as an alternative to negligence.</p>        <p class="quote">(8)  He alleges the Agency Agreement was terminated by reason of the above on 21.8.2005, and that in order to mitigate his loss, heappointed Christies to sell 22 of the 31 Paintings after such date.</p>        <p class="quote">(9)  He therefore :-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">a.  denies liability to repay the principal and/or interest.</p>            <p class="quote">b.  counterclaims for HK$433,660 in damages being the difference between the amount of commission he would have paid had the paintingsbeen sold, and the amount of commission actually paid to Christies; and interest.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  By a Reply and Defence to Counterclaim dated 19.3.2007 (âR&amp;Dâ), the Plaintiff pleads :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The Defendant is estopped from denying ownership of the Paintings because of clear statements in the Agency Agreement that hewas the owner.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  There were no oral terms in the Agency and/or Loan Agreements.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The Plaintiff is not a money lender nor carrying on such business or in any way caught by the provisions of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163" class="autolink_findacts">Money Lenders Ordinance</a></i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>.  Even if she is, the Court could exercise its powers under <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a></i> to enforce the Loan Agreement.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  The Plaintiff did not repudiate the Agency Agreement, nor advise or persuade him to sell the Paintings at HK$3 million or HK$2.5million.  Rather, she informed him of offers by possible buyers.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  The Plaintiff never alleged that all the Paintings by Zhang Daqian were fakes.  The queries as to authenticity were limited andspecific, and were statements made by third parties.  It was reasonable for her to relay those statements to him. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  As stated in the Answers to 2 sets of Interrogatories on the Plaintiff, she contends that she :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  never lent substantial sums of money to anyone else, nor entered into agreements such as the ones in the present case.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  never traded in drawings, antiques or art, but has a profound interest in art, and is well connected in the circle of collectorsand art dealers.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  has no qualifications regarding the authenticity and fineness of Chinese paintings, nor been engaged in the business of marketingand sale of these paintings.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Agreements</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The relevant clauses in the Loan Agreement are important :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  âSubject to clause 4 below, the Loan shall be repaid by the Borrower at such time together with interest at a fixed and flatrate of 2% per month.â (Clause 1.3)</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  âThe Borrower shall enter into a Sole and Exclusive Agency Agreement in the form as attached with the Lender.â (Clause 2.1)</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  âInterest on the Loan in the sum of HK$60,000.00 shall be payable by the Borrower to the Lender on the <i>1st day of each</i> <i>calendar month</i> until and unless the whole amount of the Loan shall have been repaid on the Maturity Date as defined in Clause 4.2.â (Clause 3.1)</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  âAny interest which the Borrower fails to pay when due shall be regarded as an advance made by the Lender and be <i>deemed as part of the Loan to</i> which the provisions of this Clause 3 on interest shall apply.â (Clause 3.2) (emphasis added)</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  âIf any of the following events occurs :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i)  The Borrower fails to pay any sum due under this Agreement on the due date;

(Clause 4.1(i)â(iii))</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(6)  âThe Borrower may repay the whole of the Loan without penalty at any time provided that :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i)  the repayment must be made on or before 18 September 2005 (the âMaturity Dateâ) and</p>            <p class="quote">(ii)  all outstanding interest on the Loan must be discharged at the same time of early repayment.â (Clause 4.2, emphasis added)</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Agency Agreement provided :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  âTU CHRISTOPHER of Room 1834 Block 6 of Parkview, Tai Tam, Hong Kong (hereinafter called â<i>the Owner</i>â) of the one partâ (Preamble, emphasis added)</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  WHEREAS the Owner is <i>the owner</i> of the paintings more particularly described and shown in the photographs printed in the Schedule hereto (hereinafter called âthePaintingsâ) and it is intended that the Paintings marketed and sold and the parties hereto have agreed to the appointment of theAgent as the sole and exclusive marketing agent of the Paintings in the world upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinaftercontained.â (3<sup>rd</sup> Preamble, emphasis added)</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  âAs sole and exclusive agent for the marketing and sale of the Paintings the Agent shall use her <i>reasonable commercial endeavours to promote and market</i> the Paintings, including but not limited to approach to potential purchasers.â (Clause 3)</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  âThe agency of the Agent hereby granted shall be for a period of <i>one year</i> from the date hereof during which time the Owner shall <i>not authorise any other party to market and/or sell the</i> Paintings in any part of the world.â (Clause 3, emphasis added)</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  âThe Owner shall supply <i>all information and materials necessary</i> for the Agent to <i>effectively market and sell</i> the Paintings.â (Clause 5, emphasis added)</p>        <p class="quote">(6)  âThe Agent shall market and sell the Paintings at <i>prices stipulated by the Owner</i>.

Discussion</p>    <p class="heading">(A) The Claim</p>    <p class="heading">Main issue 1 : Money lenders defences</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  It is common ground the loan of HK$3 million was advanced in August 2005, that no part of the principal has been repaid, nor anyinterest (except for 1 instalment of HK$60,000).</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Defendant was therefore in plain breach of the Loan Agreement.  Principal and interest were payable on demand, subject to themoney lenders defences.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In my view, the Plaintiff was not a money lender for these reasons :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  Her evidence which I accept, is that she operated a restaurant at the relevant time, and was not and had never been engaged inthe business of money lending.  Her ordinary course of business did not involve lending money, whether at the material time or atall.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  The Defendant has not adduced any evidence, whether in his witness statement or otherwise, to show the Plaintiff was engagedin the money lending business.  Instead, he accepts has no knowledge about her business or background (his witness statement, Â§2-3).</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  In these circumstances, there is simply no evidence to support the allegation the Plaintiff is a money lender.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Even if I am wrong and the Plaintiff was somehow a money lender, I would still exercise my discretion under s.23 to enforce theLoan Agreement for principal and outstanding interest at 2% per month to be payable until Judgment, having regard to all the circumstancesand facts of the case as it would be inequitable not to recover such principal and interest :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  It is undisputed that the principal of $3 million and interest (save for HK$60,000) has not been repaid.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  On the evidence, this is a substantial sum for a person in her position.  She is a single mother with 2 children to support;she lent out of friendship a substantial part of her savings expecting speedy repayment.  She even borrowed HK$1m from her friendsto lend to the Defendant.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The Defendant is a self-professed merchant and stock investor â and apparently, a person of some means (Â§2 of his statement).</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  He gained a considerable amount from auctioning the Paintings at Christies.  As pleaded, he was and is entitled to the use ofthe sale proceeds â irrespective of who was the true owner.</p>        <p class="quote">On the other hand, on the evidence the Plaintiff is impecunious and suffering financial difficulty, at least partially owing to thislitigation and the loan which remains unpaid.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  All in all, it would be inequitable for the Defendant simply to be allowed to take the loan and not repay any sum.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Compound interest; rectification</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  As to the pleading regarding the charging of compound interest :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The Plaintiff has pleaded rectification of the Loan Agreement by deletion of Clause 3.2, the clause concerning compound interest.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  Even if such rectification was not granted, this clause of itself would not invalidate or render the Loan Agreement unenforceable. This is because under <i>s.22(1)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a> the only agreements which are strictly âillegalâ by virtue of charging compound interest are those made â<i>for the loan of money by a money lender</i>â.  So long as the Court is convinced the Plaintiff is not a money lender, this section does not apply.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  Further, even if I considered that <i>s.22(1)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a> is applicable, it states provision may be made that if default is made in payment upon the due date of any sum payable tothe money lender under the agreement, the money lender shall be entitled to charge simple interest on that sum from the date of defaultuntil the sum is paid at an effective rate not exceeding the effective rate payable in respect of the principal apart from any default,and that any interest so charged shall not be reckoned as interest charged in respect of the loan.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  Moreover, the Court has the discretion to permit enforcement of the agreement if the court considers it inequitable not to doso (<i>s.22(2)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The evidence in support of the Plaintiffâs claim is as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>Rectification</i></p>        <p class="quote">(1)  The Plaintiff has provided the reasoning and explanation for the circumstances in which the parties agreed to delete Clause 3.2.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  Both parties signed the agreement at the Defendantâs Parkview apartment, after consultation with their respective solicitors.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  I note that whilst he denies he consulted with or involved his solicitors (âRobertsonsâ), this is contradicted by the contemporaneousdocumentary evidence.  As can be seen, the Plaintiffâs then solicitors faxed the relevant draft agreements to Robertsons.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  Robertsons was also the receiving party of the HK$2.5 million, as evidenced by the transfer document itself, and the confirmatoryreceipt faxed to them on 22.8.2005.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  In my view, the Plaintiff was honest and forthcoming regarding the rectification sought. She stands to <i>lose</i> rather than <i>gain</i> anything in this manner, as the calculation of the interest would be lowered if the contract was on the basis of simple interest. Nonetheless, she sought rectification as reflective of the true state of affairs.</p>        <p class="quote"><i>Alternative to rectification</i></p>        <p class="quote">(6)  As explained above, the evidence does not support the bare allegation the Plaintiff is a money lender. Hence, the loan does notfall within <i>s.22</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>.</p>        <p class="quote">(7)  Even if the Court considers the provision applicable, it is apparent that the manner in which the Loan Agreement operates (particularlyClauses 1.3, 3.1 and 3.2 therein) are in direct compliance with the passage which allows for charging of <i>simple interest</i> in event of default on any sum due.</p>        <p class="quote">(8)  I rely on the factors in para 14 above in support of the Courtâs discretion to rely on <i>s.22(2)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a> to enforce an agreement when it considers it would be inequitable not to do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Whether extortionate transaction</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Although not strictly necessary for my decision, pursuant to <i>s.25</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a> the Court has the discretion to reopen certain transactions which it considers âextortionateâ (in any event, this isnot pleaded by the Defendant) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  For the purposes of <i>s.25</i>, a transaction is extortionate in circumstances where the debtor must make grossly exorbitant payments; or where the agreement otherwisecontravenes ordinary principles of fair-dealing (<i>s.25(2)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>).</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  Under <i>s.25(3)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a> there is a rebuttable presumption that an agreement is extortionate if the effective interest rate is greater than <i>48%</i> per annum.  The presumption can be rebutted upon consideration of all the circumstances of the agreement where it is shown the rateis not unreasonable nor unfair.  This includes considering the prevailing interest rate at the time the agreement was made (<i>s.25(4)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>), personal circumstances of the debtor and the financial pressures he was under (<i>s.25(5)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>), the degree of risk accepted by the lender, the relation between the parties, and whether there was any specious cash price(<i>s.25(6)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>). Each case must depend on its own facts.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  On the evidence, the transaction involved a reasonable interest rate per annum calculated on the basis of <i>Schedule 2</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a> â certainly nowhere near the <i>48%</i> mark specified in <i>s.25(3)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>.  In these circumstances, there is no need nor reason for this Court to reopen the transaction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The evidencein relation to <i>s.25</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a> and the interest rate is as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  On the Plaintiffâs primary case (i.e. rectification succeeds and Clause 3.2 is not operative), the interest payments wouldbe HK$60,000 per month.  The annual interest would thus be HK$720,000.  The per annum rate of interest on this calculation is <i>24%</i> of HK$3 million (i.e HK$720,000 / HK$3,000,000 x 100 = 24%).</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  Even if this Court did not accept the case on rectification, the effective interest rate is calculated under <i>Schedule  2</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a>, and would be <i>26.82%</i>.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  On either of these alternatives, this is a reasonable interest rate, agreed between the parties.  There is <i>no</i> reason why this Court should not enforce an agreement freely entered into by the Defendant.  The interest rate is certainly nowherenear the <i>48%</i> mark specified in <i>s.25(3)</i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/163">Cap 163</a> whereby the presumption would take effect.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  In any event, the factors cited in para 14 above would also point to the fact this agreement was not extortionate.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Other reasons to enforce payment of loan and interest</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The evidence regarding the Loan Agreement is as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The maturity date expressly specified in Clause 4.2 was 18.9.2005.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  Contrary to the Defendantâs allegation, there is <i>no</i> provision in the Loan Agreement that the loan would <i>only</i> be repaid after 1 year.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The mere fact the Agency Agreement was for a period of 1 year is neither nor there. It does not and cannot automatically meanthe loan was for 1 year.  The Agreements are separate, even if related.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  The Plaintiffâs evidence which I accept, was that the parties agreed to early or speedy repayment of the loan amount.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  This is consistent with <i>both</i> partiesâ evidence that the loan was required in order to allow the Defendant to take advantage of a property transaction whichwould soon be completed.</p>        <p class="quote">(6)  The Defendantâs suggestion that Clause 4.1(i) was deleted in order to render the maturity date to be 1 year from 19.8.2005is simply not borne out by the document and surrounding circumstances.  <i>If</i> the parties really wanted to extend the maturity date, they would have amended Clause 4.2.</p>        <p class="quote">(7)  The more reasonable construction of the Loan and Agency Agreements consistent with the factual matrix, and taking into accountthe separate and operative functions of the agreements, is that the agency was to last for 1 year (as specified in the Agency Agreement),but the loan was a temporary and short-term arrangement (as per Clause 4.2).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Main issue 2 : whether Defendant in breach of Agency Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  There is no doubt that on the proper construction of the Agency Agreement, the Defendant was in plain breach in arranging for thePaintings to be sold through Christies, and preventing reasonable access to the Plaintiff :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  Under the Agency Agreement, the Plaintiff was the â<i>sole and exclusive agent</i>â for the worldwide marketing and sale (Clauses 2, 3) â and <i>no</i> other person was authorized to market and sell the Paintings.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  The Agency Agreement was for â<i>1 year</i>â (Clause 3).</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The Defendant plainly failed to provide the Plaintiff all necessary information and material (Clause 5).  Such information wouldof course, include basic information such as the Paintingsâ whereabouts. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  As to the evidence concerning breach :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  It is undisputed that 22 of the Paintings were consigned to Christies at the very latest on 24.8.2005 â only shortly afterthe Agency Agreement dated 19.8.05.  14 Paintings were sold within the 1 year period of the agency.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  On consideration of Christies Schedules of Property, it is striking they were able to provide definite and exact reserve andauction estimates for such a large number of Paintings.  It is therefore reasonable to assume the Defendant provided them accessto the Paintings on or <i>before</i> 24.8.2005 â in order to conduct these valuations.  This refutes his case the Paintings were first sent to Christies on 24.8.2005.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The Defendant has adduced <i>no</i> evidence to support the case that the Plaintiff first breached the agreement, and that it had been terminated by 21.8.2005.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  In any event, his case is inconsistent with the documentary evidence.  Had the Agency Agreement been terminated on 21.8.2005(as he alleges) and the parties fallen out, they would not be on amicable terms and consequently, would not have arranged for theproof of the transfer to be faxed to Robertsons on 22.8.2005.  That day was a Monday, presumably the first opportunity following19.8.2005 for the solicitor to release the Plaintiffâs funds to the Defendant.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  The Plaintiffâs evidence clearly states the Defendant called her on 22.8.2005 to ask her to fax proof of her transfer of theHK$2.5 million into Robertsonsâ account.  Such fax was duly arranged, and is evidenced by clear documentary proof.</p>        <p class="quote">(6)  The Defendant admits that since 22.8.2005, he did not allow her access to the Paintings.</p>        <p class="quote">(7)  In the circumstances, this Court is inclined to accept the Plaintiffâs case that once the Defendant had his temporary cashflow alleviated by receipt of her money, he was no longer keen to sell the Paintings quickly.  He thus chose to have his cake andeat it : to then breach the Agency Agreement â in order to get a higher price for the Paintings at public auction.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Therefore, unless the Defendant can show the Agency Agreement was validly terminated prior to his conduct above, he has no defenceto the Claim.  For reasons below, he has not shown any good ground for termination.  </p>    <p class="heading">Ownership of Paintings</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The Defence case is that the paintings were owned by his grandmother, and he was simply acting as her agent.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  This is unsupported by the evidence :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  He did not so state or represent to the Plaintiff.  On the contrary, his evidence shows he held himself out as the owner.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  There is <i>no</i> documentary evidence before the Court indicating he was not the owner.  He has not produced for example, any documents relating toprobate or administration of his grandfatherâs estate or the like.  His grandmother has not given any evidence to support his case.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The Agency Agreement expressly identified him twice as the owner.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  Even if his grandmother was the true owner, she would have been an undisclosed principal.  It is trite that when a principalis undisclosed at the time of contracting, the contract is made with the agent : <i>Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency</i>, 18th ed., <i>Â§9-012</i>.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  It is also trite that with a written contract, the Court will look to the terms to consider whether upon its true construction,the agent was the contracting party.  Generally, if the contract is signed by the agent in his own name <i>without</i> qualification, he is deemed to have contracted personally, unless a contrary intention plainly appears from other parts of the document: <i>Bowstead &amp; Reynolds</i>, <i>Â§Â§9-036 â 9-037</i>; <i>The Transcontinental Underwriting Agency SRL v Grand Union Insurance Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 2 Ll Rep 409</a> at 413(2).</p>        <p class="quote">(6)  Defendant clearly signed the Agency Agreement in his own name.  There are <i>no</i> other indicators that he was not the owner or that he was contracting on behalf of anyone else.</p>        <p class="quote">(7)  Further, he pleaded that he was entitled to the use of the sale proceeds.  The more reasonable interpretation of the contractualrelations is that he was the party benefiting from the agreements (both in obtaining the loan and the eventual outcome of the saleof the Paintings).</p>        <p class="quote">(8)  For the reasons in sub-paragraphs (1) to (7) above, I also consider he is estopped by his own representation and conduct, fromnow asserting this allegation.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(B) Counterclaim</p>    <p class="heading">Main issue (1) : Plaintiffâs duties in contract and tort</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Plaintiffâs contractual duties are clear from the Agency Agreement :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  To provide and market the Paintings, using her reasonable commercial endeavours (Clause 2).</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  As to the prices, the Plaintiff was to market and sell at prices stipulated by the owner (Clause 6). </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is clear from the Agency Agreement there is <i>no</i> express contractual duty on the Plaintiff to advise or possess knowledge and expertise concerning : (1) the valuation of the Paintings;and (2) their authenticity.  Since the Agency Agreement is silent on these matters, the question arises whether any such duties areimplied.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  There is no room for any such implication :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  The test for implication of terms is essentially one of <i>necessity</i>, i.e. without such a term the contract will not work.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  There is no necessity to imply into the contract terms pertaining to knowledge and/or expertise concerning authenticity and value. The terms of the Agency Agreement are clear and relate to marketing and sale.  Such services do not necessarily involve expertiseconcerning authenticity and value.  There is a distinction to be drawn between expertise as to authenticity and value, as opposedto good connections and marketing skills.  The contractual scope and ambit of the Plaintiffâs duties concern the latter.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  As to the factual matrix, on the evidence :-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">a.  The Defendant himself acknowledged the Plaintiff âknows quite a lot of peopleâ. (Â§2 his statement)</p>            <p class="quote">b.  She was able to bring numerous potential buyers to his residence at Parkview, to view the Paintings at short notice. This is notdisputed.</p>            <p class="quote">c.  She never represented nor held herself out to be any expert, let alone on authenticity or valuation.  <i>If</i> she had, one would expect this to appear in the Agency Agreement.  She was simply running a restaurant.  This had nothing to do withvaluation and authenticity of artwork.</p>            <p class="quote">d.  The parties were friends.  They had not met via business relating to art or artwork authenticity or valuation.  They had neverbeen engaged in any sort of business deals prior to the loan and agency arrangements.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)  It is clear the contractual arrangement allowed the Defendant access to cash at short notice â for him to alleviate his cashflow problems and enter into a property transaction.  The Agency Agreement also allowed him to use the Plaintiffâs connections.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  The above is underscored by the terms of the Agency Agreement set out above.  In essence, upon a proper construction of the AgencyAgreement, the Defendant wished to use the Plaintiffâs connections to sell the Paintings as part of a private deal.</p>        <p class="quote">(6)  I also note that any purported termination did not comply with Clause 10 of the Agency Agreement.</p>        <p class="quote">(7)  On the evidence, the Defendant was anxious to receive a loan of HK$3 million, and timing was important for his property transaction. Obviously, Christies would not be providing a loan of HK$3 million, unlike the Plaintiff.  Further, there is no good ground to challengeor set aside the Agency Agreement as somehow not binding, or as manifestly to the Defendantâs disadvantage.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  No duty of care arose in tort to advise the Defendant concerning the valuation and authenticity of the Paintings :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  In law, there may in certain cases be concurrent rights and duties in contract and tort : <i>Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20AC%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] AC 80</a> [P.C.], at 107; <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] AC 145</a> [H.L.], at 178B-181F &amp; 193G-194B).  In order for any duty in tort to be established, there must be : (a) an assumption of responsibility,(b) recognition that the party assuming such responsibility has âspecial skillsâ, and (c) which the complainant relies on.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  The evidence shows :-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a)  The Plaintiff did not assume any such responsibility.  The partiesâ relationship was governed by their contracts.  In general,any duties in tort cannot exceed or go beyond those prescribed in contract.</p>            <p class="quote">(b)  Even if there were such assumption, there was no special skill in relation to expertise or knowledge on authenticity or valuewhich the Plaintiff professed to have and which formed part of her duties.</p>            <p class="quote">(c)  The Defendant relied on the Plaintiffâs connections, as opposed to any special skills.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)  On the facts, no duty of care in tort is established.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  In any event, she denies she ever made the representation that all of Zhang Daqinâs paintings were fake.  She simply communicatedrelevant offers and information from potential buyers.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  The Defendantâs own evidence shows that it was âDavidâ (and not the Plaintiff) â who related to him that 1 of Qi Bashiâspaintings, 2 of Tangâs paintings, and the âDunHuangâ painting by Zhang was problematic.  (Defendantâs statement Â§10).  Moreover,this information was conveyed to him <i>before</i> he signed the Agency Agreement on 19.8.2005.  In short, it appears he went into the contracts with the Plaintiff with his eyes openon the possibility there were certain paintings with problematic authenticity and value.</p>        <p class="quote">(6)  Moreover, it is odd why only <i>22</i> of the 31 Paintings were consigned to Christies.  The âDunHuangâ painting which had been queried was <i>not</i> consigned to Christies.  This indicates the Defendant may have had knowledge of some authenticity issues.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Nor am I prepared to find fraud, in the absence of proper evidence.  It is trite fraud must be clearly proved :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made: (1) <i>knowingly</i>; or (2) <i>without belief</i> in its truth; or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false.â (<i>Derry v Peek</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20AC%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 14 App. Cas. 337</a>, per Lord Herschell, cited in <i>Chitty</i>, Â§6-043).</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">(2) Issue 2 : whether Plaintiff in breach of duty</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  It follows from the above that the Plaintiff was not in breach of any contractual or tortious duty to provide advice or possessknowledge concerning the value and authenticity of the Paintings.  No question of breach of duty arises, nor of serious or fundamentalbreach to give rise to a repudiatory breach which the Defendant could accept.  Since a repudiatory breach is the foundation of theDefendantâs case for arranging sale through Christies and refusing access to the Plaintiff, it follows there is no defence to theclaim nor any good counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  On the evidence, there was no written notice of termination, pursuant to Clause 10.  Nor has any such notice been pleaded.  Evenif (which do not accept), an oral as opposed to written notice was sufficient, there is no evidence before me of any sound basisfor termination.</p>    <p class="heading">Issue 3 : loss and damage</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  It follows the Plaintiff is not liable for any loss and damage suffered (if any) by the Defendant.</p>    <p class="heading">(C) Evidence</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I also find the Plaintiffâs evidence is credible, and largely consistent with the contemporaneous documents. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Since the Defendant was absent, I attach little significance to his witness statement which was not subject to cross examination. I also find the Defendantâs case is less credible and less consistent with the contemporaneous documents.  A few examples :- </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  In the Agency Agreement, the Preamble states twice that the Defendant is â<i>the owner</i>â of the Paintings.  However, he denies this in his witness statement (at Â§6).  I give more weight to the contemporaneous documents.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  He contends in his witness statement (at Â§13) that he did not obtain legal advice prior to signing the Loan and Agency Agreements. However, his evidence is inconsistent with the contemporaneous documents : the Plaintiffâs solicitorsâ fax dated 19.08.05 attachedthe draft Agency and Loan Agreements to the Defendantâs solicitors Robertsons for their comments.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  The Defendant maintains that under the Loan Agreement, the term of the loan was 1 year (witness statement Â§26 and 29).  However,any such case is unsupported by the Loan Agreement.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Where there is any inconsistency between the cases and evidence of the parties, I prefer the Plaintiffâs evidence and case onthe balance of probabilities.</p>    <p class="heading">VII. Conclusion  </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  I therefore made the following orders on the Claim :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)  There be judgment for the Plaintiff in the sum of HK$3 million.</p>        <p class="quote">(2)  There be contractual interest at 2% per month from 1 October 2005, the month following the interest instalment paid, until judgmenton 6<sup>th</sup> January 2009, and thereafter interest at the judgment rate until full payment.</p>        <p class="quote">(3)  Damages for breach of the Agency Agreement to be assessed.</p>        <p class="quote">(4)  The Loan Agreement dated 19.08.05 be rectified by deleting Clause 3.2 and reinstating clauses 4, 4.1, and sub paragraph (i) thereto.</p>        <p class="quote">(5)  Costs of the Action be to the Plaintiff to be taxed on a party and party basis, with the Plaintiffâs own costs to be taxedin accordance with the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a></i>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/91">Cap. 91</a>.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  For all the reasons above, I dismissed the Counterclaim and ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiffâs costs of the Counterclaimto be taxed on a party and party basis. </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(G.H.
