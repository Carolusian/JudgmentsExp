He was taken to Queen Mary Hospital where he was put on traction for 5 days. He underwentan operation in which he had a metal pin inserted into his broken leg. He was hospitalized for a fortnight. He was on crutches, andthereafter he had the double misfortune of two falls, one in the bath in December of the same year and another in March the followingyear on ice when he was in school in England. He was put on stronger and stronger analgesics after each fall. His recovery was delayed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Having come of age, the plaintiff now sues the defendants for damages. The 1st defendant company was the owner of the accident carand the 2nd defendant was its driver at the material time.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> I will deal with the alleged negligence first. The 2nd defendant, Mr. Daswani, was travelling along Robinson Road towards Central.He had been living in Hong Kong since 1964 and was well acquainted with that locality. He had been the holder of a Hong Kong drivinglicence for 9 years with a clear record.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> At the time of the accident, it was drizzling but the road condition and visibility were both good. The vehicle was satisfactorilyfunctional and only "moderate damage to near side front mudguard" was detected after the accident.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In essence, the allegations were that the 2nd defendant was driving too fast in the circumstances, that he failed to keep any properlookout, that he failed to notice the activities of both youths in preparation for boarding a taxi across the road, that he did notslow down and/or cover his brake and that he did not hoot his horn.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The 2nd defendant told the Court that he was coming up an incline along that stretch of Robinson Road. At the top, he observed twopeople standing on the pavement at a distance of about 50 yards. He was then travelling at about 15-20 m.p.h., and he continued withthat same speed on automatic "Drive" until the left front bumper of his Holden Premier collided with the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In the 2nd defendant's statement to the police after the accident, he explained that because he was badly shaken up, the mentionof the sighting of these people standing on the pavement at a distance of 50 yards was inadvertently omitted. At the end of his statementto the police, the 2nd defendant further said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"When I first saw the victim, he was already in the middle of the road southwards to get a taxi. There was almost no distance. I realize(sic) I tried to turn my car away from him but he was just there".</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p> </p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The plaintiff described the 2nd defendant as looking distraught.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The 2nd defendant testified that he did not see the plaintiff summoning a taxi. He had not noticed what the plaintiff and his friendstanding or the pavement were doing before the impact, but he saw them standing there while he was travelling that 50 yards. He didnot notice, so Mr. Daswani elaborated, any movement or gesture from these two on the pavement suggesting that they were all set tocross the road. Hence, he did not expect them to step off the pavement. There was nothing in the circumstances to warrant the soundingof his horn or decelerate. Therefore, he drove on with his speed of 15/20 m.p.h. Capital was sought to be made of Mr. Daswani's evidenceon the sequence of events immediately before the accident. But, a fair reading of it gives, in my view, a reasonably consistent account,viz. that the 2nd defendant did not see how the plaintiff came to be in front of his car, that the first time he noticed the presenceof the plaintiff was when he was about 3-7 feet ahead before his left front bumper hit him and that he never saw the plaintiff "inthe road" until after the accident. It all happened so suddenly. In the words of Mr. Daswani: "One of the youngsters jumped in frontof my car as I drew closer".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It is common ground that immediately after the accident, the plaintiff told the driver "Don't worry, it is O.K. It was my fault".Counsel for the plaintiff conceded a minor degree of contributory negligence on the part of his client. The 2nd defendant was notprosecuted for any driving offences as a result of this accident.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> If Mr. Daswani's viva voce evidence in Court were wholly accepted, the Court would be driven to the conclusions that he was not drivingtoo fast, that his attention was appropriately divided between the traffic condition and the pedestrians on the pavement for thewhole distance of those 50 yards after the plaintiff and Mr. Simpson had come into view, that there was no reason for him to expectany attempt to be made by these two to cross the road, that there was nothing to call for deceleration or the sounding of his hornand that the accident could not have been avoided although he did attempt to swerve to the right. Moreover, the plaintiff immediatelyowned up to his own negligence after the accident. In the version of Mr. Daswani's, the plaintiff was entirely to blame.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Both the plaintiff and his friend, Mr. Simpson gave evidence. After their stay in the Jewish Recreation Club, they came up to theRobinson Road for a taxi. It had been drizzling for some time in an overcast. They had been waiting for about 15/20 minutes. Theplaintiff became quite anxious although Mr. Simpson was only prepared to say that they were frustrated. They both shared a child'sumbrella of a diameter of <strong>2Â½</strong> feet, which was used to shield them both at an angle.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> According to the plaintiff, the traffic in the opposite lane was slow with a taxi travelling in the midst of it. In examination-in-chief, he simply said he flagged the taxi down, but in cross-examination, he maintained that he kept on flagging the taxi with hisleft arm virtually until the moment when he stepped out.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The plaintiff also told the Court that he raised his umbrella and looked to the right for about 2-3 seconds. He did not feel freeto concede that the small umbrella had been obstructing his vision, but there was no explanation offered as to why it was necessaryto raise his umbrella to look to the right. The plaintiff would have the Court believe that the umbrella was sufficiently raisedto enable him to look for any likely oncoming traffic from the right. But when he was asked in cross-examination whether it was possiblethat he hadn't raised the umbrella high up enough to have an unobstructed view to the right, his answer was far from being direct.His reply was: "I don't think so". In his statement to the police, however, he described the umbrella as having been raised "slightly".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The look to the right was admittedly brief. His friend, Mr. Simpson was taller than he was, but the plaintiff claimed to be standingslightly ahead of him. It's improbable that he could have stood too far away from Mr. Simpson with the two sharing the same smallumbrella. The plaintiff did, however, also say that his friend was then bending down.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The plaintiff gave an estimate of a further 4/5 seconds before he stepped out onto the road. He also described this time lag as being"a small period of time". In cross-examination, he gave his impression of the whole incident as happening "extremely quickly".</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> According to Mr. Simpson, it was about 2 seconds for him to gather himself and bend "slightly" down to get his two plastic bags.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The plaintiff's overall estimate was 7 seconds or less. Mr. Simpson gave a further 6-7 seconds before the plaintiff was hit by thecar, in all 8-9 seconds. During that latter time, he said he was looking across the road and also down at the bags, but he said hedid not notice what the plaintiff was doing. If the plaintiff had been flagging down the taxi virtually up to the last moment, itwould have been inconceivable that that could altogether escape Mr. Simpson's attention.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> The Holden Premier stopped about 6-8 yards after the lamp- post according to Mr. Simpson. From the sketch, it is 9 metres from theleft front of the car to the lamp- post, but with the body of the car at an angle to the kerb the left front was further ahead. Mr.Simpson told the Court that they were standing about 1-2 yards to the right of the lamppost. Therefore the vehicle driven by the2nd defendant must have been brought to a halt in a distance of about 10 yards/11 yards or metres. Thinking distance and brakingdistance (i.e. stopping distance) for a speed of 20 m.p.h. as giving in the Highway Code is 40 feet. It is suggested that on a wetroad, it would be considerably more. Much can be said in favour of Mr. Pirie's contention that on the figures in the Highway Codeformulated in 1958, allowance must be given to the motor mechanical advancement all through these years. On a drizzling day, witha wet road surface and with only estimated but not dead accurate stopping distance, the approximate speed given by Mr. Daswani hasnot been demonstrated to be erroneous. On the contrary, all seems to corroborate his estimate.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The speed of 30/40 m. p. h. given by Mr. Simpson does not carry much weight. He was very unsure, and he only obliged counsel withan answer. Moreover, Mr. Simpson only saw the car a short time after impact. At the time, he was himself a non-driver.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> At 20 m. p. h., it is 29.33 feet per second; at 15 m.p.h., it is 22 feet per second.   Taking an average of 25 feet per second arbitrarily,it would take 6 seconds to cover 50 yards. Mr. Simpson estimated the same distance as being 75-100 feet. I prefer Mr. Daswani's estimatefor his age, experience and his familiarity with the locality.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Even on the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr. Simpson alone, it was quite probable that at the time when they took a quick look tothe right, the 2nd defendant's car had not reached the top of the incline. According to the plaintiff, after the look to the rightfor 2-3 seconds, it took him 4-5 seconds to turn back to the centre and step off the kerb. Altogether, it could well be about 8 secondsalthough the plaintiff did mention at one time that it was 7 seconds or less. Mr. Simpson's version gave a further 6-7 seconds afterhe had bent down slightly to pick up his bags. As I have said, the Holden Premier would reach them in about 6 seconds. Even in theseversions of and on behalf of the plaintiff, it was likely that when Mr. Daswani's car came over the top of the incline, Mr. Simpsonhad by then stood up and the umbrella had by then been lowered again. The traffic on the opposite side was slow moving, and thereseemed to be little doubt that the taxi driver must have clearly seen the signal. The plaintiff himself was aware of it as he toldhis friend right at the beginning that he had got a taxi. There was no need for him to continue to flag the taxi down. Mr. Simpsonalso did not notice the alleged flagging. One of the plaintiff's answers was quite telling:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <blockquote>                    <blockquote>                        <p> </p>                    </blockquote>                </blockquote>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="91%">        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="9%" valign="top" class="quote">"Q.</td>            <td width="82%" valign="top" class="quote">                So you say you didn't look because you were relying on Mr. Simpson."                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="12%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="9%" valign="top" class="quote">"A.</td>            <td width="82%" valign="top" class="quote">Not fully. The fact that I had already stopped the taxi, I looked...... The time I looked at the right, spoke to Mr. Simpson, lookedforward and stepped out for the taxi, there was no particular need to look to my right again."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Therefore, even in these versions, it was quite probable that there was no sign warning Mr. Daswani of any of these two youths intendingto cross the road.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The plaintiff had not checked the traffic on his side of the road again before he stepped out. As a matter of fact, his right footwas caught by the bumper of the car before he had even set it down.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The plaintiff admitted that he told Mr. Daswani, that he was the author of his own misfortune. The plaintiff explained that Mr. Daswaniappeared to be distraught, shaking and he was very concerned. The plaintiff further explained that he was just saying anything whichfirst came into his head as the result of a previous conversation with the father of his then girl-friend. The plaintiff retainedhis composure after the accident. I agree with counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff's explanations were, to say the least,curious.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr. Daswani was an impressive witness. I have no hesitation, in direct or inferential conflicts, in preferring his narrative beforethe Court. I accept his evidence. He was, I find, in no way negligent oh the 29th September 1978. In my view, the plaintiff was whollyto blame.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> It is not strictly necessary for me to go further in the light of my conclusion. But I should, however, record my findings on theclaims of the plaintiff. The plaintiff fell in the bathtub in December of the same year and on ice in England in March the next year.The plaintiff had bathed unaided previously. Both falls were probably due to his own negligence, and I so find. In fact, it was neversuggested that any of the falls was an unavoidable accident. Therefore the further injury and/or interference with the existing onedid not arise from any supervening illness or other non-tortious event. The effect of the injury sustained in the traffic accidentwas never submerged in or obliterated by any of these two falls. In fact, none of these subsequent falls was said to have causedany greater degree of incapacity. Strictly speaking, we are also not dealing here with a consequence of successive torts as the fallswere caused by the plaintiff's own negligence. Hence, it is not on all fours with the case of <u>Jobling v. Associated</u> <u>Dairies Ltd.</u> <i>[</i>1981<i>]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20All%20ER%20752" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 AER 752</a> or <u>Baker v. Willoughby</u> <i>[</i>1970<i>]</i> A.C. 467.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I must accord due recognition to two basic principles: The first is, the Courts should take into account the reality that a plaintiff'sclaim of loss in his earnings may be diminished by any independent cause happening in the vicissitudes of life; the second is, theCourts should not speculate any event which is known. "Cases of cumulative causation of damage can present problems of great complexity"per Lord Edmund-Davis in <u>Jobling v. Associated Dairies Ltd.</u>, ante 759 d. If there was any loss of income in this case, I take the view that since the plaintiff himself negligently caused thetwo subsequent falls, the further injury or disturbance of the existing one should be his sole responsibility. The condition of theplaintiff was worsened not so much in the sense of gravity but in the process of his recovery. Therefore, delay in his recuperationshould be no concern of Mr. Daswani's.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> After his fall in England in March 1979, the plaintiff was not advised to take an X-ray. He was given stronger analgesics by hisschool doctor whose description was indorsed by another doctor. However, in the summer when the plaintiff returned to Hong Kong,Professor Yau had his wound X-rayed and found "a crack on the point of healing" on his right femur. The Professor discussed withthe plaintiff two possibilities: One was to have a bone graft involving a further operation and the other was to leave the woundalone to heal. The Professor decided on the latter course. There was no evidence, of course, whether or not "the crack" would havebeen sustained, had the plaintiff had a normal healthy leg. In the result, the plaintiff was kept on stronger analgesics. He hadthe dented metal pin replaced in November 1979 when his pain became more tolerable. He had been using two crutches for 6 months andhe still required the aid of one crutch until November 1979. The metal pin was finally removed in October 1982.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The plaintiff's fracture was attended to in Queen Mary Hospital. He was put on traction for five days and had an operation with apin inserted. He was hospitalised for two weeks and he received physiotherapy. He was on crutches for quite a long time. Doctor Wedderburnopined that he would have recovered in seven months and that without any further injury to the wound, the pin would have been readyfor removal after one year. The plaintiff was on milder pain-killing drugs before the two falls. He is now being left with scars,and his right leg is a quarter of an inch shorter than his left.  His total rotation movements are reduced but still comparable witha normal man. He is marginally affected in squash, and he certainly is not as good in competitive sports. Otherwise, his permanentdisabilities are not even noticeable to the plaintiff himself. Dr. Wedderburn assessed a 2% impairment of the wholeman, and the doctorsuggested, with reservations, the maximum of a further 2% for a low, again 2% risk of developing osteo-arthritis. I would not acceptthis additional 2% incapacity as proved. All in all, for pain and suffering and loss of amenities I would not be prepared to awarda sum higher than $30,000 on full liability.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Dr. Wedderburn was adamant that there would not be any loss in earning capacity.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The plaintiff seeks loss of earnings for a year within the pay-structure of an electronic engineer which he claimed to have aspiredto become.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The plaintiff's performance at school was less than satisfactory. There were and will be many imponderables in the avowed pursuitof his ambition. Without the two further falls, one in the bathtub and the other on ice, the traffic accident should not have preventedthe plaintiff from school attendance for more than 4 to 5 weeks. Upon probabilities, the plaintiff's career and his academic attainmentshould not have been significantly hampered by a short leave of absence. I find that the plaintiff's claim for loss of income hasnot been substantiated.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> The partial loss in the refund of his purchased air ticket is obviously too remote, a matter not within the forseeability of thedefendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The other special damages are admitted and I find them proved.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I would also accede to the usual award of interests as suggested by counsel for the plaintiff.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> In conclusion, the plaintiff had only himself to blame for the accident, and his claim for damages against the defendants must thereforebe dismissed with costs. I order accordingly.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="47%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"></td>            <td width="53%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(B.
