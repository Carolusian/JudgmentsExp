It is not, however, anabsolute right.  If law enforcementagencies are unable to carry outcovert surveillance, including the secretinterception of private communications, they are denied what is universallyrecognisedto be an essential tool in combating crime and safeguarding publicsecurity.</p><p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Atension therefore exists between the right of Hong Kong residents to privacyand the duty imposed on the organs of government toensure the safe, honest andorderly running of our society free of the corrosive influence ofcorruption.  The European Court ofHuman Rights, in respect of the European Convention, has struck the balance bysaying :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âPowers of secret surveillance of citizens,characterising as they did the police state, were tolerable under theConvention onlyso far as strictly necessary for safeguarding democraticinstitutions.â  [<i>Klass v.Germany</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%202%20EHRR%20214" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 2 EHRR 214]</a></p></blockquote><p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Thisapplication for judicial review raises constitutional issues going to mattersof covert surveillance, particularly the secretmonitoring of privatecommunications.  The applicants,who challenge the validity of the present legislative and administrativeframeworkauthorising and regulating secret surveillance in all its forms, havestated that they have no wish to hinder Hong Kongâs law enforcementauthoritiesin effectively combating crime and ensuring public security.  As Mr Dykes SC, leading counselfor the second applicantput it, they seek only to ensure that the authoritiescarry out their duties in a manner which respects the constitutionallyprotectedrights of all Hong Kong residents including those reasonablysuspected of having committed a crime.</p><p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Duringthe course of the hearing, on 2 February 2006, this court was informedthat the day before the Administration had filed adetailed set of legislativeproposals with the Security Panel of the Legislative Council.  The proposals are, or will shortly be,supported by a draft bill.  Thebill incorporates what the Administration has said is a comprehensive andworkable legislative regimeproviding for secret surveillance in all its variedforms, a regime that accords with the requirements of the Basic Law.  Althoughthe future of the proposalsrests with the Legislative Council, the Administration has expressed the hopethat within the next sixmonths the proposals will be enacted into law.</p><p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> Inrespect of the new legislative proposals, Mr Dykes has commented that,after so many years, the fact that the Administration isnow proceeding withsome urgency is itself evidence of the success of this application for judicialreview.</p><p class = "heading">The applicants</p><p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> Boththe first and second applicants are political activists.  Both have been arrested and prosecutedfor offences arising out oftheir activism.  For example, the first applicant has been prosecuted forburning the national flag. </p><p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> Neitherapplicant can say for certain that he has been the subject of covertsurveillance or that his private communications withothers have been monitoredby state agencies.  However, havingregard to their shared history of activism, both believe that it ismore likelythan not.</p><p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Inany event, both applicants say that, as Hong Kong residents, they enjoyconstitutionally guaranteed rights of privacy and it wouldbe unacceptable toprevent them from seeking to protect those rights by the simple fact that theyhave been kept unaware of whetherthose rights have in fact been the subject ofinterference.  In thecircumstances, they contend that they have sufficient interestin the mattersto which this application for judicial review relates to permit them to beheard.</p><p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> WhenI granted leave to apply for judicial review, I did so on the basis thatit was certainly arguable that both applicants didhave sufficient standing andI record that their standing has not been contested at the substantivehearing of their application.</p><p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> In<i>Klass v. Germany</i> (<i>supra</i>), the European Court observed that, whena state institutes secret surveillance of individuals, if those individualscould not, byreason of their lack of knowledge of the surveillance, challenge thelawfulness of the manner in which the state carries out secretsurveillancethen the protections afforded under the Convention would largely be rendered anullity.  The court thereforeacceptedthat individuals may, under certain conditions, claim to be victims ofalleged violations of their right to privacy by the mere existenceoflegislation permitting covert measures.</p><p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> I believethat the reasoning in <i>Klass v. Germany</i> is sound enough to be essentiallyself-evident.  On the basis of thatreasoning, especially having regard to their shared backgroundof politicalactivism and confrontations with the authorities, I am satisfied that bothapplicants have shown, for the purposes ofO.53, r.3(7) of the Rules of theHigh Court, that they have sufficient interest in all the matters to which thisapplication relates.</p><p class = "heading">The Executive Order</p><p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> In2005, in the course of two criminal cases heard in the District Court,challenges were made to the lawfulness (and thereby theadmissibility) ofprosecution evidence obtained by law enforcement agencies by way of the secretrecording of private communications.</p><p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Inthe first case, that of <i>HKSAR v. Li Man Tak and Others</i>(DCCC 689/2005), the court held that the secret interception ofcommunications had been inconsistent with the requirements of art.30of theBasic Law and thereby unlawful. The court warned that, in future criminal trials, investigating agenciesmay be held to haveacted in bad faith if they continued the practice of thesecret monitoring of communications without a legislative basis upon whichtodo so.  That warning, of course,came in the wake of a finding that the existing legislation did not meet therequirements ofthe Basic Law or the Bill of Rights.  </p><p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Inthe second case, that of <i>HKSAR v. Shum Chiu and Others</i> (DCCC 687/2004),having found that the secret recording of an accused talking with hissolicitors constituted an abuse of processso profound as to challenge theintegrity of the justice system, the court went on to express the view thatlegislation regulatingthe secret monitoring of private communications shouldbe introduced without delay so that the âguarding of the guardsâ was notleftonly to the courts.</p><p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Inan affirmation dated 13 October 2005, Mr Ying Yiu Hong, PermanentSecretary for Security, said that the judgments in the two DistrictCourt casescaused public concern as to how Hong Kongâs law enforcement agencies couldlawfully conduct covert surveillance. TheAdministration was preparing proposals for legislation to beconsidered by the Legislative Council and recognised that ultimatelycovertsurveillance would have to be regulated by legislative measures.  However, doing the best it could as aninterim measure,the Administration introduced administrative directions toensure that covert surveillance would at least be conducted by all lawenforcement agencies for legitimate purposes only and in accordance withmeasures that ensured transparency and accountability. These directions were made at thehighest level, being contained in an executive order made by the ChiefExecutive pursuant to thepowers vested in him under art.48 of the Basic Law; theorder being the Law Enforcement (Covert Surveillance Procedure) Order (âtheExecutive Orderâ) published on 5 August 2005.</p><p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Inhis affirmation, Mr Ying emphasised that the Executive Order does notpurport to be legislation, it does not purport to createcriminal offences,amend legislation or impose obligations on members of the public.  Mr Ying has also emphasised thetemporary natureof the Executive Order. In this regard, he has said :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âAs explained in the Administrationâs paperdated 5 August 2005 informing LegCo of the Executive Order, theAdministration hasmade clear its firm view that ultimately there should belegislation governing covert surveillance.  However, in the interim, toexpeditiously address publicconcerns in light of the court rulings, the Chief Executive made the ExecutiveOrder â¦â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Itis the applicantsâ case that the Executive Order, while it does not proclaimitself to be a form of legislation, seeks neverthelessto fill a legislativevacuum and thereby take the place of legislation.  As such, it purports, by authorising and regulating covertsurveillance, including the interception of private communications, to havelegislative effect.</p><p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Onbehalf of the Chief Executive, it was said that, while the Executive Order isan administrative order only and is not law, nordoes it purport to be so, itnevertheless constitutes a comprehensive body of âlegal proceduresâ for thepurposes of art.30 ofthe Basic Law. Art.30, while protecting the freedom and privacy of communication,permits law enforcement authorities to interceptprivate communications âinaccordance with legal proceduresâ to meet the needs of public security or theinvestigation of crimes.</p><p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Theapplicants, however, contended that the Executive Order does not constitute abody of âlegal proceduresâ for the purposesof art.30.  Even if it should be held to be a bodyof legal procedures for the purposes of art.30, the applicants contended thatit is still insufficient to meet the requirements of arts.30 and 39 of theBasic Law in that it does not, nor is it capable of, providingthe detailedsafeguards demanded by that Law. That can only be achieved by legislation.  As the applicants put it, the ExecutiveOrder contains noindependent or judicial oversight of decision-making to guard against possibleabuse by the executive nor is thereany civil or criminal remedy for a breachof the Order.</p><p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Inrespect of the Executive Order, the applicants seek the following relief :</p><blockquote><p>â(i)    ADeclaration that the Law Enforcement (Covert Surveillance Procedure) Order (âtheExecutive Orderâ) issued by the ChiefExecutive of the Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region on or about 4 August 2005 violates arts.30 and 39 ofthe Basic Law and art.17of the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights 1966/art.14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/383">Cap. 383</a> andisunconstitutional and of no effect insofar as it purports to authorise orregulate covert surveillance conducted by law enforcementagencies; and</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(ii)    An order of <i>Certiorari</i>to bring up and quash the Executive Order.â</p></blockquote><p class = "heading">The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a></p><p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Atthis time, there is no operative Hong Kong legislation that provides for allforms of court surveillance including the interceptionof privatecommunications.</p><p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Thereare, however, a number of operative statutes which provide for the secretinterception of limited types of private communication.

As theapplicants said,it is an open-ended power and has not, in terms of the statuteitself or any regulations made under it, been made subject to anyrestrictionsor means of independent oversight.</p><p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a> was enacted in 1963.  S.33 of the Ordinance reads :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âWhenever he considers that the publicinterest so requires, the Chief Executive, or any public officer authorized inthat behalfby the Chief Executive either generally or for any particularoccasion, may order that any message or any class of messages broughtfortransmission by telecommunication shall not be transmitted or that any messageor any class of messages brought for transmission,or transmitted or receivedor being transmitted, by telecommunication shall be intercepted or detained ordisclosed to the Governmentor to the public officer specified in the order.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Ina report published in December 1996 entitled âReport on Privacy :Regulating the Interception of Communicationsâ, the LawReform Commissionstated that, in its opinion, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a>, isinconsistent with art.17 of the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights (âthe ICCPRâ), that article being incorporatedinto Hong Kongâs domesticlaw in terms of art.14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.</p><p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Theapplicants contend that the Law Reform Commission was correct.  They go on to contend that, inaddition, s.33 violates arts.30and 39 of the Basic Law.  They therefore seek the followingrelief; namely :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âADeclaration that, insofar as <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a>,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106">Cap. 106</a>, authorises or allows access to or disclosure of the contents ofany message or any class of messages, it is unconstitutional,void and of nolegal effect in that it violates arts.30 and 39 of the Basic Law and art.17 ofthe International Covenant on Civiland Political Rights, 1966/art.14 of theHong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/383">Cap. 383</a>.â</p></blockquote><p class = "heading">The<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/532" class="autolink_findacts">Interception of Communications Ordinance</a></p><p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> TheLaw Reform Commission report published in December 1996 recommended thatall secret interception of communications by state agenciesbe authorised interms of a warrant scheme.  Applications for warrants would have to be made to a judge ofthe High Court who, indeciding whether to grant the warrant, would be obligedto take into account a number of factors such as the immediacy and gravityofthe criminal activity or threat to public security being investigated and thelikelihood of obtaining relevant information byway of the proposed course ofsecret surveillance.  The LawReform Commission further recommended that a supervisory authority, intheperson of a sitting or former judge of the Court of Appeal, be appointedto monitor the warrant system.  </p><p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Inhis affirmation, Mr Ying, the Permanent Secretary for Security, said that,given the complexity of the issues raised in the LawReform Commission reportand their wide-ranging implications, the Administration at the time consideredit necessary to consult interestedparties in the community before seeking tointroduce any legislation to regulate covert surveillance, including the secretinterceptionof communications, by state agencies.  Accordingly, a consultation paper and a white bill (theInterception of Communications Bill)was published in February 1997.  </p><p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> However,concerned apparently that the Administration would not be able to submitproposals for legislation before the coming intoeffect of the Basic Law, inDecember 1996, shortly after the Law Reform Commissionâs report, a memberof the Legislative Councilsubmitted a memberâs bill based extensively on therecommendations contained in the report. The bill was the Interception of CommunicationsBill.</p><p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Thebill was opposed by the Administration. The reasons for this opposition are contained in a letter dated24 June 1997 sent bythe Secretary for Security to members of theLegislative Council.  The lettercommenced :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âHaving carefully studied the Bill and theproposed CSAs [Committee Stage Amendments], we strongly oppose them as theirimplementationwould jeopardize the security of Hong Kong, and pose seriousoperational problems to our law enforcement agencies, particularly intheinvestigation and detection of serious crimes, e.g. kidnapping, smuggling andmoney laundering.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote"> <i>TheBill and the CSAs have been drawn up without prior consultation with our lawenforcement agencies, and hence [are] thoroughlyunworkable.  The Administration will not be in aposition to bring them into operation</i>.  The enactment of such a bill would seriously and adverselyaffect law enforcement work, which would only benefit the criminals. It is important that we should not rushto enact this Bill in this area, without detailed consultation with all partiesaffectedand careful deliberation by the legislature.â  [my emphasis]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Despitethe Administrationâs opposition, the bill was read for a third time and passedon 27 June 1997, just three days beforethe change of sovereignty.  The purpose of the new statute, the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/532" class="autolink_findacts">Interception of Communications Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/532">Cap.532</a> (âthe IOC Ordinanceâ) wasto :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âprovide laws on and in connection with theinterception of communications transmitted by post or by means of atelecommunicationsystem and to repeal section 33 of the TelecommunicationOrdinance.â</p></blockquote><p>The Ordinance, therefore, does not seek toprovide for all forms of invasion of privacy by law enforcementagencies.  It providesonly for the interceptionof communications by way of post or telecommunications.</p><p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Asto the commencement of the IOC Ordinance, the Legislative Council recognisedthat it could not, for sound practical reasons, bebrought into operation onthe day of its publication in the Gazette.  It therefore provided for it to be brought into operation ona later date in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(2)(b)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation and GeneralClauses Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/1">Cap. 1</a>.  Indeferring its commencement date, the IOC Ordinance provides as follows ins.1(2) :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âThisOrdinance shall come into operation on a day to be appointed by the Governor bynotice in the Gazette.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> However,although the IOC Ordinance was enacted more than eight years ago, theChief Executive has not yet determined a day on whichit would be appropriatefor it come into operation.</p><p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Theapplicants contend that the Chief Executive, acting on the advice of theAdministration, has never intended to bring the Ordinanceinto operation.  The result therefore â after morethan eight years â has been that the Chief Executive has effectivelyrepealedlegislation passed by the Legislative Council.  In terms of the Basic Law, however, itis for the legislature, not the executive,to repeal legislation.</p><p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Theapplicants further contend that, in terms of art.48(3) of the Basic Law, theChief Executive has a duty to sign bills passedby the Legislative Council andto promulgate laws.  The ChiefExecutive has no general power to disallow laws.  In terms of arts.49and 50 of the Basic Law, his power islimited to returning bills that, in his view, are not compatible with theinterests of HongKong so that the Legislative Council may reconsiderthem.  The applicants contend that,if the Chief Executive does not employ thepowers given to him under arts.49and 50 to return bills, he must sign them and take such steps as are requiredto bring them intoforce.  In respectof the IOC Ordinance, the Chief Executive has not employed the powers given tohim under those articles.

Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment, ex parte Fire Brigades Union &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2AC 513.</a>  It is a judgment thatrequires close examination.  Thefactual background may be summarised as follows :</p><blockquote><p>(i) In 1964, a non-statutory scheme wasintroduced to compensate victims of violent crime.  In terms of the scheme, a body known asthe CriminalInjuries Compensation Board assessed <i>ex gratia</i> payments on the basisbroadly of what the victim would have been entitled to recover in an action fortort.  In 1978 a royal commissionrecommended that the scheme be put on a statutory basis.  A subsequent working group made thesame recommendation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(ii) In light of this, the Governmentintroduced legislation which was contained in ss.108 to 117 and Schedules 6 and7 to the CriminalJustice Act 1988. In terms of s.171(1) of the 1988 Act, the provisions were to comeinto force â</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <blockquote>    <p class = "quote">âon such day as the Secretary of State may by order made bystatutory instrument appoint â¦â</p>  </blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>(iii) As it was, no commencement day wasappointed by the Secretary of State.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(iv) In 1992, the Secretary of Stateannounced that a new non-statutory scheme would be introduced, fundamentallyaltering the basisof compensation.  As to the statutory scheme contained in the 1988 Act, a governmentwhite paper stated that the provisions in the1988 Act would not be implementedand would be repealed when a suitable legislative opportunity occurred.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(v) The new non-statutory scheme came intooperation in April 1994, the intention being that it would remain a non-statutoryschemeuntil it had time âto settle down and any teething problems have beenresolvedâ after which consideration would be given to puttingit on a statutorybasis.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(vi) The applicants, believing that theirmembers would be significantly disadvantaged under the new non-statutoryscheme, soughtdeclarations that the Secretary of State, by failing to bringthe statutory scheme into effect in terms of s.171(1) of the 1988 Act,and by introducinga new non-statutory scheme, had acted unlawfully in breach of his duty underthe 1988 Act.</p></blockquote><p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Bya majority, Lord Keith and Lord Mustill dissenting, it was held that,while s.171(1) of the 1988 Act did not impose a legallyenforceable duty on theSecretary of State to bring the enacted provisions into force at any particulartime, it did impose a continuingobligation on the Secretary of State toconsider whether to bring them into force.  Accordingly, the Secretary of Stateâs decisionnot to bringss.108 to 117 into force at all and instead to introduce what was in reality apermanent non-statutory scheme had beenunlawful.</p><p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Beforeturning to certain of the speeches, it is necessary to compare the wording ofs.171(1) of the 1988 Act considered by the Houseof Lords with the wording ofs.1(2) of the IOC Ordinance.  S.17(1)directs that provisions of the 1988 Act âshall come into forceon such dayas the Secretary of State may â¦ appoint.â S.1(2) directs simply that the Ordinance âshall come into operationon aday to be appointed by the Chief Executive.â  The use of the word âmayâ in s.171(1) may give a morepermissive colourto the meaning and intent of that section but essentiallyI am satisfied that the two sections have the same meaning andintent.</p><p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Itmust be recognised that commencement provisions of the kind contained ins.171(1) of the 1988 Act and s.1(2) of the IOC Ordinanceare commondevices which bring practical advantages.  In his text, <i>Statutory Interpretation</i> (4<sup>th</sup>Edn) F.A.R. Bennion has described the advantages in the following terms :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âBefore a new Act is brought intooperation, any necessary regulations or other instruments which need to be madeunder it can bedrafted.  Fullconsultations can be held with the interests concerned.  Explanatory material for the guidanceof officials and thepublic can be prepared and absorbed.  <i>Further consideration can be givento the wisdom of any doubtful provisions and, if necessary, amendments to theAct can be soughtfrom Parliament. </i>The matter is under government control, and the government, payingregard to political factors, can choose the most advantageous moment. These are the reasons which cause the commencementorder method to be chosen for a large proportion of modern Acts.â  [my emphasis]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Whatmust also be recognised is that, in deciding when and in what circumstances anOrdinance shall come into operation, the LegislativeCouncil has a number ofchoices open to it.  When the <i>Fire BrigadesUnion</i> case was before the Court of Appeal, Hobhouse LJ (at 536E)explained the position by saying that Parliament â</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ may provide that the relevant Act orpart of the Act shall come into force on a specific day.  Alternatively, Parliament mayleave itto some other person or body to appoint the day.  Another alternative open to Parliament is to leave thechoice of the dayupon which the Act shall come into force to a minister but goon to require that he shall make his appointment by a certain date;that waswhat Parliament did in section 5(2) of the Domestic Violence andMatrimonial Proceedings Act 1976:</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <blockquote>    <p class = "quote">âThisAct shall come into force on such day as the Lord Chancellor may appoint â¦Provided that if any provisions of this Act arenot in force on 1 April1977 the Lord Chancellor shall then make an order â¦ bringing such provisionsinto force.â</p>  </blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">Similar provision was made in the ConsumerCredit Act 1974.  There are a wholenumber of permutations open to Parliament in makingits choice of provision forthe commencement of any statute or part. It has used these variants in the past and it must be takenthatParliament, and Parliamentary draftsmen, are familiar with all those availablechoices of wording.â</p></blockquote><p>Hobhouse LJ went on to observe :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âParliamentwill also be aware that when it has used the words which leave it to a ministerto appoint the day upon which a statutoryprovision shall come into force, thishas meant that, on occasions, the minister has never made any appointment andthe provisionhas never come into force â¦ It is no doubt because Parliament areaware that some parts of statutes may not be brought into forceby the ministerthat they have on occasions used wording such as that used in the DomesticViolence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act1976.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> Inthe present case, it was open to the Legislative Council to restrict thediscretionary duty imposed on the Chief Executive, forexample, by providing ins.1(2) that the Ordinance must be brought into operation within a specifiedperiod of time.  The LegislativeCouncil chose not to do so.</p><p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> Duringthe course of submissions, Mr Dykes emphasised that the Basic Law definesthe limits of the Chief Executiveâs powers inrespect of enacted laws which hedoes not consider to be in Hong Kongâs interests.  That being the case, he has said, this courtshould becareful to avoid carving out some form of âpublic interest exemptionâ whichallows the Chief Executive to side-stepthe limits of his powers under arts.49and 50 of the Basic Law and, by means of that public interest exemption, toeffectively blocklegislation not to the liking of the Administration.  In my judgment, however, whatever theinterpretation of the meaning and intentof the statutory provision containedin s.1(2), it will not act to carve out a form of public interest exemption interms of whichthe Chief Executive is able to side-step the limits of hisconstitutional powers.  I saythat because, in respect of all legislation,it lies squarely within the powerof the Legislative Council, if it chooses to give to the Chief Executive thediscretion to determinewhen a law should become operative, to ensure, by theuse of appropriate language, that the limits of that discretion aredefined. </p><p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Iturn now to consider certain of the speeches in the <i>Fire Brigades Union</i>case.</p><p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Ingiving his speech, one of the majority speeches, Lord Browne-Wilkinsonmade the fundamental observation that s.171(1) of the Act,while it providedfor the coming into force of certain provisions, was itself in force andthereby imposed a statutory duty. Thesame must apply to s.1(2) of the IOC Ordinance.  Upon enactment, it came into force andimposed a statutory duty, albeit a discretionaryone, upon the ChiefExecutive.  The question, ofcourse, is the exact nature of that duty.</p><p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Lord Browne-Wilkinsonset out the opposing interpretations of s.171(1) in the following terms :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âIt is the applicantsâ case that, althoughthe section confers a discretion as to the date on which the statutory schemeis tobe brought into force, it in addition imposes on him a statutory duty tobring the sections into force at some time.  In the crypticformulation of Mr. Elias, the Secretaryof State has a discretion as to when but not whether the sections are to come intoforce. The Lord Advocate, on theother hand, contends that section 171(1) confers on the Secretary of Statean absolute and unfettereddiscretion whether or not to bring the sections intoforce.â  [p.552A-B]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Lord Browne-Wilkinsonrejected the âcryptic formulationâ of the applicants that s.171(1) conferred onthe Secretary of Statea discretion as to <i>when</i> but not <i>whether</i>ss.108 to 117 were to come into force. In this regard he said :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âThe words of section 171(1) are consistentonly with the Secretary of State having some discretion: indeed even theapplicantsconcede that he has a discretion.  What is it then which suggests that there will come a timewhen that discretion is exhausted andthat, whatever the change ofcircumstances since the sections in question were passed by the Queen inParliament, the Secretary ofState becomes bound to bring the sections intoforce?  I can see nothing in theAct which justifies such an implied restriction onthe discretion.  Moreover I can foresee circumstancesin which it would plainly be undesirable for the Secretary of State to be underany such duty.â  [p.550C-D]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> I believes.1(2) of the IOC Ordinance must be approached in the same way.  It would be a misreading of s.1(2) to say thatit givesto the Chief Executive a discretion only as to <i>when</i> but not <i>whether</i>the Ordinance shall come into operation. If s.1(2) was to be read in that restrictive manner, it would mean, asLord Browne-Wilkinsonobserved, that a time would come when the ChiefExecutiveâs discretion would be exhausted and that, whatever the change ofcircumstancessince the enactment of the Ordinance, he would then become boundto bring the Ordinance into force even though to do so would runcontrary tothe interests of Hong Kong, perhaps manifestly so.</p><p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Inany event, as Lord Browne-Wilkinson pointed out, where the legislatureintends to impose a duty on the executive to bring legislationinto forcewithin a specific period of time or in accordance with a specific timetable, itis able to do so by the use of expresslanguage.  S.1(2) of the IOC Ordinance contains no such language.</p><p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> LordLloyd, in his majority speech, came to what may be described as a morerestrictive interpretation of the nature of the statutoryduty imposed bys.171(1) :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ I would read section 171 asproviding that sections 108 and 117 shall come into force when the HomeSecretary chooses, andnot that they may come into force if he chooses.  In other words, section 171 confersa power to say when, but not whether.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">Ifthat is the right construction of section 171, then the intention ofParliament in enacting that section is exactly, and happily,mirrored by thereaction of the hypothetical man on the Clapham omnibus.  The Home Secretary has power to delaythe coming into forceof the statutory provisions in question; but he has nopower to reject them or set them aside, as if they had never been passed.â [570H]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> LordLloyd, however, did not say that a time would therefore come when thediscretion vested in the Secretary of State would be exhaustedand, whateverthe change in circumstances, he would then have to bring the statutoryprovisions into effect.  I havenot read hisspeech as implying any finite timetable.  What he went on to say was this :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âIcan find nothing in section 171 which, on its true construction, justifiesthe Home Secretaryâs refusal to implement the statutoryscheme.  Whether that refusal should be regardedas an abuse of the power which he was given under section 171, or as theexerciseof a power which he has not been given, does not matter.  The result is the same either way.  By renouncing the statutory scheme,theHome Secretary has exceeded his powers, and thereby acted unlawfully.â  [571E]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> AlthoughLord Browne-Wilkinson rejected the contention that s.171(1) gave to theSecretary of State only a limited discretion asto when he brought the relevantprovisions into effect, he also rejected the contention made on behalf of theSecretary of Statethat the Secretary enjoyed an absolute and unfettereddiscretion whether or not to bring the relevant provisions into force atall:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âItdoes not follow that, because the Secretary of State is not under any duty tobring the section into effect, he has an absoluteand unfettered discretionwhether or not to do so.  So tohold would lead to the conclusion that both Houses of Parliament had passedtheBill through all its stages and the Act received the Royal Assent merely toconfer an enabling power on the executive to decideat will whether or not tomake the parliamentary provisions a part of the law.  Such a conclusion â¦ is not only constitutionallydangerousbut flies in the face of common sense. â¦ Surely, it cannot have been theintention of Parliament to leave it in the entirediscretion of the Secretaryof State whether or not to effect such important changes to the criminal law.â  [p.550H]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> LordNicholls came to the same conclusionï¼</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ although he is not under a legal <i>dutyto appoint </i>a commencement day, the Secretary of State is under a legal <i>dutyto consider </i>whether or not to exercise the power and appoint a day.  That is inherent in the powerParliament has entrusted to him. He is undera duty to consider, in good faith, whether he shouldexercise the power.  Further, andthis is the next step, if the Secretary ofState considers the matter anddecides not to exercise the power, that does not end his duty.  The statutory commencement day powercontinues to exist.  The ministercannot abrogate it.  The power, andthe concomitant duty to consider whether to exercise it, willcontinue to existdespite any change in the holders of the office of Secretary of State â¦ Soalthough he has decided not to appointa commencement day for sections 108 to117, the Secretary of State remains under an obligation to keep the matterunder review. This obligation willcease only when the power is exercised or Parliament repeals the legislation.  Until then the duty to keep underreviewwill continue.â  [575P]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Thatagain, I believe, must be a correct interpretation, one that goes equally tothe meaning and intent of s.1(2) of the IOC Ordinance. Whatever the turbulent legislativecircumstances in which the Ordinance was enacted, it did lay down a new andcomprehensive systemfor the manner in which covert surveillance activities byHong Kongâs law enforcement agencies would be regulated, a system whichit wasbelieved would, contrary to the existing legislative and administrativearrangements, meet Hong Kongâs international anddomestic human rightsobligations.  That being the case,it cannot have been the intention of the Legislative Council to leave itto theentire discretion of the Chief Executive whether or not to effect suchimportant changes. </p><p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Inlight of the observations which I have outlined, Lord Browne-Wilkinsonwent on to interpret the meaning and intent of s.171(1)of the 1988 Act asfollows :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âInthe absence of express provisions to the contrary in the Act, the plainintention of Parliament in conferring on the Secretaryof State the power tobring certain sections into force is that such power is to be exercised so asto bring those sections intoforce when it is appropriate and unless there is asubsequent change of circumstances which would render it inappropriate to doso.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Withrespect to the force of the other speeches, it seems to me that those words ofLord Browne-Wilkinson constitute an entirelycorrect interruption of themeaning and intent of s.1(2) of the IOC Ordinance.</p><p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Inrespect of the present case, therefore, the Chief Executive, while not bound byany finite timetable, has at all times remainedunder a statutory duty, to bedischarged in good faith, to actively keep under consideration whether or notan appropriate time hascome to bring the IOC Ordinance into operation.  That duty cannot be abrogated.</p><p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> Equally,for the Chief Executive to procure events to take place which would prevent himfrom discharging his statutory duty wouldamount to an intentional frustrationof that duty and would be an act outside of his powers.</p><p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Howthen, lawfully, is the Chief Executive to discharge the duty imposed upon interms of s.1(2) if, after due consideration, hereaches the view that, evenwith amendments, it would not be in Hong Kongâs best interests to bring theOrdinance into operation? What ishe to do if he concludes that it is simply unworkable?  In his speech, Lord Nichollsdescribed what is, of course, in constitutionalterms, the obvious and commonsense solution (p.577G) :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ pending the exercise of the commencementday power or its repeal the Secretary of State can act only within theconstraintimposed by the duty attendant upon the continuing existence of thatpower.

When considered in the light of theAdministrationâs originalopposition, the applicants have submitted that it isclear, even if acting in good faith, that the Chief Executive has discardedhisduty under the statute.  Thatabrogation, the applicants have said, is unlawful and it is the duty of this courtto declare itso.</p><p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> Forthe Chief Executive, it has been submitted that, since the enactment of theOrdinance in 1997, the Administration has been engagedin a constant process ofreview as to the suitability of the Ordinance for implementation.  In his affirmation, Mr Ying, the PermanentSecretary for Security, denied that the Chief Executive has simply refused tobring the IOC Ordinance into effect, defying the LegislativeCouncil.  He expressed the Administrationâs pastposition as follows :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ the Administration had no intention todefer indefinitely the implementation of the [Ordinance].  However, to implement the[Ordinance]in its current form would pose serious operational difficulties to the Policeand ICAC and thus would be prejudicialto law and order and the security of HongKong.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> Asto the Administrationâs intentions (at the time when he made his affirmation inOctober 2005) Mr Ying said the following :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âIn view of the public concerns, theAdministration is working actively on draft legislation governing bothinterception of communicationsand covert surveillance.  However, the issue is a complex one andthe implications may be wide-reaching and wide-ranging â¦ theAdministration hashad to respond to changing circumstances. The Administration has publicly committed to presenting legislativeproposals to LegCo as soon as possible â¦â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> Inrespect of the âchanging circumstancesâ to which Mr Ying made reference,he spoke in his affirmation of heightened securityconcerns in the âpost 9/11eraâ, the rapid development of technology in the communications field and thefact that, in responseto the threat of terrorism, there have been many changesto legislative regimes in other common law countries.  </p><p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> MrYing spoke of an inter-departmental working group formed in late 1999 and itswork in the area, including visits to Australiaand the United Kingdom, tostudy the legislative regimes there and any proposed changes in thoseregimes.  Mr Ying concluded :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ the review has continued to be activelypursued, and one option which cannot be ruled out at this stage is to bringIOCO intooperation subject to appropriate amendments.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> AsI  understood their arguments, the applicants contended that the searchfor a new form of legislation supports their submissionthat the ChiefExecutive has at all times simply refused to implement the Ordinance and thatit would be artificial to find otherwise.On a study of the history of the matter, however, I am unable toagree.  Further consideration givento the wisdom of doubtful provisionsin the Ordinance and the consideration ofpossible amendments does not, in my view, amount to a refusal to bring thelegislationinto effect at an appropriate time or a refusal to return to theLegislative Council to seek amendments to, or a repeal of, the statute:see the comments of F.A.R. Bennion in <i>Statutory Interpretation </i>(<i>supra</i>).</p><p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Yes,of course, there has been what some may describe as an inordinate delay butequally, as Mr Ying said, there have been rapiddevelopments in thetechnology of communications and the rising up of the threat of globalterrorism.  In the course of hissubmissions,Mr Zervos said the Administration had been working at alltimes against âa moving landscapeâ.  Delay itself therefore, in myview, even taken with theAdministrationâs strong opposition to the IOC Ordinance, does not demonstratethat the Chief Executivehas abandoned his duty under s.1(2) of the IOCOrdinance.</p><p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Inhis speech in the <i>Fire Brigades Union</i> judgment, Lord Nicholls spokeof the infinite range of matters, many political in nature, which may preventor delay the Secretaryof State from implementing the provisions of astatute :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ although the purpose of the commencementday provision is to facilitate bringing legislation into effect, the width ofthediscretion given to the minister ought not to be rigidly or narrowlyconfined.  The common formcommencement day provision is applicableto all manner of legislation and itfalls to be applied in widely differing circumstances.  The range of unexpected happenings isinfinite.  In the course ofdrafting the necessary regulations, a serious flaw in the statute might come tolight.  An economic crisismightarise.  The government mightconsider it was no longer practicable, or politic, to seek to raise orappropriate the money neededto implement the legislation for the timebeing.  In considering whether themoment has come to appoint a day, as a matter of lawthe minister must be ableto take such matters into account. Of particular relevance for present purposes, as a matter of law theminister must be entitled to take financial considerations into account whenconsidering whether to exercise his power and appointa day.  It goes without saying that theminister will be answerable to Parliament for his decision, but that is analtogether differentmatter.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Iturn now to an overview of historical matters.</p><p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Whenthe IOC bill was read for a second time, the then Secretary for Security statedthe Administrationâs opposition in plain terms:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">â[This] bill, drawn up without priorconsultation with the law enforcement agencies, is entirely unworkable and theAdministrationwill not be able to bring it into operation.  It would be irresponsible to rushthrough legislation on this area especially sincethe change to an entirely newsystem is involved.  In otherjurisdictions, changes of this nature take years to work out and to reachabroad consensus on the sensitive aspect of law enforcement.  It would be reckless to passlegislation which would deprive our lawenforcement agencies of a useful toolto safeguard the security of Hong Kong.â</p></blockquote><p>The Secretary of Security concluded :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âLetme make one last point abundantly clear. If the Bill were passed today, the Administration will have no optionbut to seekto repeal it as soon as possible thereafter.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Seekinga repeal of unworkable legislation by coming back to the Legislative Counciland asking to be relieved of the duty of bringingit into operation is not thesame as refusing to discharge a duty, as I have defined that duty, unders.1(2) of the Ordinance.  Indeed,as Lord Nicholls made clear, it is a legitimate procedure.</p><p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> On8 July 1997, shortly after the change of sovereignty, the Chief Executiveordered that the coming into operation of the IOC Ordinanceshould bewithheld.  In a brief to theProvisional Legislative Council, the Chief Executive proposed that theOrdinance should notbe brought into operation âat this timeâ for the followingreasons :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âThe<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/532" class="autolink_findacts">Interception of Communications Ordinance</a> will seriously affect theeffectiveness of the law enforcement agencies in carrying out their dutiesparticularly in the investigationand detection of serious crime, for example,kidnapping, smuggling and money laundering.  The Administration has already publisheda While Bill on thesame subject, and this Bill is being revised by incorporating relevant commentsupon completion of the publicconsultation exercise.  We therefore consider that it is not in the public interestto bring this legislation into operation.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> Thefollowing day, the Chief Secretary for Administration, addressing theProvisional Legislative Council, spoke of conducting areview of the Ordinance(along with other legislation passed in the days before the change ofsovereignty) :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âInthe course of our review, we will also study the impact of the Ordinance â¦which [was] introduced by Members of the previousLegislative Council <i>beforedeciding whether [it] should come into operation</i>.â  [my emphasis]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> MrDykes, for the second applicant, laid emphasis on these comments.  They demonstrated, he said, that theAdministrationâs purposewas not simply to withhold the coming into operationof the Ordinance for the time being but was to decide whether it should comeinto operation at all.  That may beso.  But if the decision wasmade â as it appears now to have been made â that it shouldnot comeinto operation at all, then, it seems to me, it was legitimate for theAdministration to return to the Legislative Council,as it has now done, toseek the repeal of the Ordinance.</p><p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> Asto the progress of the Administrationâs review, in March 2004 a brief wassubmitted by the Administration to the Security Panelof the Legislative Council. The brief advised members of thePanel that, as part of the ongoing review, legislative developmentsin otherjurisdictions had been studied.  Inthis regard, the brief said :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âWe note that a diversity of models areadopted by various overseas authorities and each has to be fully analysedhaving regardto our local circumstances, developments and needs.  <i>In addition, after the â911âincident some overseas countries including the UK and US have introducedlegislative amendments inthis area. This is an important and significant development which the working groupis examining.</i>â  [my emphasis]</p></blockquote><p>The brief concluded :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">â<i>Thereview is still ongoing, and has taken longer than anticipated due to a numberof factors.  </i>First, the reviewcovers highly technical matters. The rapid development of communications technologies over the pastdecade or sohas added to the complexity of the task.  During the review we also need to take into full account thesignificant legislative amendmentsthat have been introduced in otherjurisdictions since the â911â incident. Moreover, the Security Bureau has had to give a higherpriority to othermatters in 2002 and 2003, including the implementation of the requirementsimposed by the United Nations SecurityCouncil resolution on combatingterrorism.â  [my emphasis]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> Ata meeting of the Security Panel held a year later on 10 June 2005, one ofthe members of the Panel put it to the Secretary forSecurity that the Executiveshould not keep deferring the implementation of the Ordinance which had beenpassed by the LegislativeCouncil. In response, the Secretary for Security said that there was no intentionto indefinitely defer the implementation of theOrdinance.  He emphasised, however, that theOrdinance, as it stood, presented a number of difficulties.</p><p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Inanswer to a question from another member of the Panel, the Secretary forSecurity is recorded as saying :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ after the â911â incident, many countrieswere very concerned about terrorist activities.  Australia and New Zealand hadintroduced legislativeamendments in the area of interception of communications.  Countries such as Canada, UK and US hadintroducednew elements in the authorisation for interception ofcommunications.  US had introducedlegislative amendments to provide for theinterception of communications forthe purpose of preventing terrorist activities.  Some countries had strengthened the requirementson andprotection for telecommunication service providers.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> Atthis point, I would record the obvious; namely, that the Chief Executive mustbe entitled, in matters of Hong Kongâs security,to take into accounting thechanging nature and extent of any threats to that security.</p><p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> Duringthe course of submissions before me, reference was made to an article whichappeared in the Hong Kong Daily News on 13 August2005.  In that article, the Secretary forSecurity was reported as saying that the Ordinance would be âabandonedâ.  However,the accuracy of this reporthas been disputed; on the evidence, I believe rightly so.  </p><p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> InAugust 2005, the Chief Executive made the Executive Order.  I shall turn shortly to considerits true nature and effect.  Butwhatever that may be, it cannot be disputed, I think, that it has alwaysbeen intended to be a temporary measure only.  In this importantrespect, the facts of the present case areto be distinguished from those in the <i>Fire Brigades Union</i> case.  In that case, the House of Lords foundthat the Secretary of State had put into effect a non-statutory scheme that wasnotsimply a stop&shy;-gap measure but was intended for the foreseeable future toreplace the scheme that Parliament had embodied inthe Act.  By the introduction of that permanent,alternative scheme, the Secretary of State had effectively prevented himselffromhonouring his statutory obligations in terms of s.171(1) of the 1988 Act.</p><p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> Inconcluding an examination of what Mr Zervos described as the âlong andarduousâ history of the review of the IOC Ordinanceand possible legislativealternatives to it, I was informed during the course of submissions that,on 15 August 2005, the first applicant,himself a member of theLegislative Council, wrote to the Chief Executive condemning the coming intoforce of the Executive Orderand requesting that the IOC Ordinance bebrought into effect.  There was,I am told, no response to this letter.  Whatever the reasonsfor a failure to respond, I do notthink it casts much light on the issue of the Chief Executiveâs continuingadherence to hisduties under s.1(2) of the IOC Ordinance.</p><p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> Inthe final analysis, it seems to me that, if the Chief Executive was to advocatehis position as to the discharge of his statutoryduty under s.1(2) of the IOCOrdinance, he would be able to do so accurately (in fact and law) asfollows : âAfter an in-depthreview, taking into account such matters asthe changing technology of communications and the rise of global terrorism,I have cometo the conclusion that the scheme contained in the Ordinance,which the Administration has always opposed as being unworkable, has,against themoving landscape of recent history, shown itself very definitely to be so.  That being the case, I have nowreturnedto the Legislative Council seeking to be relieved of the statutoryduty imposed upon me in terms of s.1(2) of the Ordinance by askingfor a repealof the Ordinance and its replacement by a new statutory regime.  But these matters will, of course, befor the LegislativeCouncil to determine.â</p><p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Insummary, it has not been demonstrated to me that the Chief Executive, infailing to appoint a date for the implementation of theIOC Ordinance, hasexceeded his powers and thereby acted unlawfully.  I am satisfied he has at all times acted within hispowers. There will be nodeclaration that he has acted unlawfully nor will there be a declaration thathe must forthwith appoint a day forimplementing the IOC Ordinance.  </p><p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> Ofcourse, as to the <i>manner </i>in which the Chief Executive has discharged hisstatutory obligations under s.1(2), that is a matter for the LegislativeCouncil andthe Chief Executive, not this court.</p><p class = "heading">The <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a></p><p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.33</a>of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a> gives the power to the Chief Executive,when he considers it is in the public interest, to order that anytelecommunication messagebe intercepted and its contents examined.  A telecommunications message is onethat is transmitted by means of electromagnetic energy. This includes fixed line and mobiletelephone communication as well as intercourse generated through computersystems, for example,by e-mail.  Tocite it again, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> reads :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âWhenever he considers that the publicinterest so requires, the Chief Executive, or any public officer authorized inthat behalfby the Chief Executive either generally or for any particularoccasion, may order that any message or any class of messages broughtfortransmission by telecommunication shall not be transmitted or that any messageor any class of messages brought for transmission,or transmitted or receivedor being transmitted, by telecommunication shall be intercepted or detained ordisclosed to the Governmentor to the public officer specified in the order.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> Thepower of the Chief Executive to order the interception and examination ofprivate communications under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> is not qualified by any subsidiarylegislation made under the Ordinance nor by any other Hong Kong statute orsubsidiary legislation. AsMr Dykes put it, the power is open-ended and not subject to any judicialor other independent oversight.</p><p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> AsI have said earlier, in late 1996 the Law Reform Commission, havingconsidered existing international jurisprudence, concludedthat <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> isinconsistent with art.17 of the ICCPR. The applicants have adopted the criticisms of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> contained in theCommissionâs report.  In so far as<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> authorises access to and disclosure of the contents of any message orclass of message, the applicants have submitted that it violatesarts.30 and 39of the Basic Law and through art.39, art.17 of the ICCPR.</p><p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> Todetermine whether <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> is inconsistent with arts.30 and 39, the meaning andintent of the two articles must first be determined.  Both articles are, ofcourse, constitutional provisions and,as such, to use the words of the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Ng Ka Ling andOthers v. Director of Immigration</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKC%20291" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKC 291</a>, are expressedin language that is âample and generalâ. As the Court observed, this is usual for constitutions which are livinginstruments intended to meet changing needs and circumstances.  As to the interpretation of this ampleand general language, theCourt defined the approach in the following passage :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âIt is generally accepted that in theinterpretation of a constitution such as the Basic Law a purposive approach isto be applied. The adoption of apurposive approach is necessary because a constitution states generalprinciples and expresses purposes withoutcondescending to particularity anddefinition of terms.  Gaps andambiguities are bound to arise and, in resolving them, the courtsare bound togive effect to the principles and purposes declared in, and to be ascertainedfrom, the constitution and relevant extrinsicmaterials.  So, in ascertaining the true meaning ofthe instrument, the courts must consider the purpose of the instrument and itsrelevant provisions as well as the language of its text in the light of thecontext, context being of particular importance in theinterpretation of aconstitutional instrument.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> Whilethe language in the Basic Law cannot, of course, be given a meaning which itcannot bear, in identifying the meaning of thelanguage, considered in thelight of its context and purpose, too âliteral, technical, narrow or rigidâ anapproach must be avoided.Importantly, in matters going to fundamental constitutional rights thatprotect individual liberties, such as the right to the freedomand privacy ofcommunication, the Court of Final Appeal said that such rights must be given agenerous interpretation.  In <i>LeungKwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%203%20HKLRD%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 3 HKLRD 164</a>, at 178G, theCourt expressed this by saying :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âAs has been emphasized at the outset ofthis judgment, the freedom of peaceful assembly is a fundamental constitutionalright. It is well established in our jurisprudence that the courts mustgive such a fundamental right a generous interpretation so as togiveindividuals its full measure.  <i>Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%202%20HKCFAR%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 2 HKCFAR 4</a> at 28-9.  On the other hand, restrictions on such afundamental right must be narrowly interpreted.  <i>Gurung Kesh Bahadur v.Director of Immigration</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 480</a> at para.24.  Plainly, theburden is on the Government to justify any restriction.  This approach toconstitutional review involvingfundamental rights, which has been adopted bythe Court, is consistent with that followed in many jurisdictions. Needless to say,in a society governed by the rule of law, the courts must bevigilant in the protection of fundamental rights and must rigorouslyexamineany restriction that may be placed on them.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> Onthe basis that both arts.30 and 39 protect fundamental rights and musttherefore be given a generous interpretation, I turn tothe articlesthemselves.  Art.30 (which appearsin Chapter 111, being headed âFundamental Rights and Duties â¦) providesthat:</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âThefreedom and privacy of communication of Hong Kong residents shall be protectedby law.  No department orindividual may, onany grounds, infringe upon the freedom and privacy ofcommunication of residents except that the relevant authorities may inspectcommunication in accordance with legal procedures to meet the needs of publicsecurity or of investigation into criminal offences.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Art.39(which is also set in Chapter 111) provides, in so far as it is relevant,that :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">â(1) The provisions of theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [âICCPRâ] â¦ as applied toHong Kong shallremain in force and shall be implemented through the laws ofthe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">(2) The rightsand freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents shall not be restricted unless asprescribed by law.  Suchrestrictionsshall not contravene the provisions of the preceding paragraph ofthis Article.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> Inaccordance with art.39, the provisions of the ICCPR as applied to HongKong are to be found in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/383">Cap. 383</a>.  Art.14 of the Bill of Rights correspondsexactly to art.17 of the ICCPR. Art.14 provides that :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">â(1) No one shall be subjected toarbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home orcorrespondence, nor to unlawfulattacks on his honour and reputation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">(2) Everyone has the right to theprotection of the law against such interference or attacks.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> Theword âcorrespondenceâ, as used in art.14, incorporates all forms of communication,including intercourse by telecommunication.</p><p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> TheBasic Law therefore requires that the fundamental right to freely and privatelycommunicate with others shall be protected âbylawâ.  First, it does so âdirectlyâ by way of art.30.  Second, it does so, in terms of art.39,by the indirect means of incorporatingthe provisions of the ICCPR, in so faras they have been applied to Hong Kong, thereby giving constitutional recognitionto art.14of the Bill of Rights.</p><p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> Byway of a general observation, I am of the view that, if both articlesprotect the same right, both requiring that the right beprotected by law, theyshould, as far as the language allows, be interpreted so that they complementrather than contradict eachother.</p><p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Art.39(2)states that the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents shall not berestricted unless as prescribed by law.The phrase âas prescribed by lawâ in the article has been judiciallydefined by the Court of Final Appeal and I will turn tothat shortly.  Art.39(2) goes on to state that anyrestrictions that are prescribed by law must not contravene the provisions ofart.39(1).  As the Court of FinalAppeal observed in <i>Leung Kwok Hung and Others (supra)</i>, this means thatany restrictions must not contravene the provisions of the ICCPR as applied toHong Kong; that is, therefore, theprovisions of the Bill of Rights.</p><p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> Concerningthe right to freely and privately communicate with others, art.14(1) of theBill of Rights provides that any interferencewith that right must not be âarbitraryâor âunlawfulâ.  Art.14(2) directsthat Hong Kong residents are entitled to the âprotectionof the law againstsuch interference.  Theconstitutional requirements of art.14, therefore, are :</p><blockquote><p>(i) that any interference must be lawfulin the sense of being in accordance with protections provided by law, and</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(ii) that any interference must bereasonable in the sense of not being arbitrary.</p></blockquote><p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> TheUnited Nations Human Rights Committee has interpreted the requirement ofreasonableness to imply that any interference with theright to privatecommunication must be proportional to the end sought and be necessary in thecircumstances of any given case.</p><p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> Inits âGeneral Comment 16â, the United Nations Committee said that theobligations imposed by art.17 of the ICCPR (art.14 ofthe Bill of Rights)demand the adoption of legislative and other measures to give effect to theprotection of the right.  That, itseems to me, must be correct. First, the article states clearly that the right shall be protected bylaw.  As a qualified right,theenshrinement of it in the article is not of itself sufficient to affordeffective protection.  Second,ascertainable measuresenforceable at law must be in place to allow for aproportionate limitation of the right while at the same time providing adequatesafeguards to prevent executive abuse.</p><p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> Inmatters going to fundamental rights, the principle of proportionality is partof Hong Kong law.  In this regard,in <i>Leung Kwok Hung &amp; Others (supra)</i>, the Court of Final Appeal saidthe that proportionality test should be formulated in these terms :</p><blockquote><p>(a) therestriction must be rationally connected with one or more of the legitimatepurposes; and</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(b) themeans used to impair the right must be no more than was necessary to accomplishthe legitimate purpose in question.</p></blockquote><p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> Determinations under the principle ofproportionality, by their very nature, therefore, demand legal certainty.  Without legal certainty,for example,how else can it be determined that a limitation on a right is no more than isnecessary to accomplish a legitimate purpose? That being the case, it is clear, inmy view, that art.14 of the Bill of Rights incorporates the principle of legalcertainty.</p><p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> Ifthere must be legal certainty, it follows that the right to the protection ofthe law in terms of art.14(2) means that any limitationon the right must be âinaccordance with lawâ or be âprescribed by lawâ, both phrases which Hong Kongjurisprudence confirmsencompasses the principle of legal certainty.  In <i>Shum Kwok Sher v. HKSAR</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 381</a>, at 401J, the Court of Final Appeal observed thatthe phrase âprescribed by lawâ in art.39 was now widely recognised ininternationalhuman rights jurisprudence to mandate the principle of legalcertainty.</p><p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> Thatany interference must be âin accordance with lawâ or âprescribed by lawâ alsoaccords with the qualification containedin art.39(2) of the Basic Law that therights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents under the ICCPR, as appliedto Hong Kong,shall not be restricted unless as âprescribed by lawâ.</p><p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> Beforemoving to the principle of legal certainty, reference should also be made toart.30 of the Basic Law.  Art.30commences bystating that the freedom and privacy of communication of Hong Kongresidents âshall be protected by lawâ. As I have said earlier,art.30 and art.14 of the Bill of Rightstherefore guarantee the same right and both require that the right shall enjoythe protectionof the law.  That beingthe case, it seems to me that the phrases âprotected by lawâ and âtheprotection of the lawâ, asused in the two articles, require, both on a plaincomparative reading and in context, to be interpreted in the same way.</p><p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> Aswith art.17 of the ICCPR (art.14 of the Bill of Rights), art.30 allows for theright to freely and privately communicate withothers to be subject tolimitations.  Indeed, it states thenature and extent of those limitations. As a constitutional provision,however, it does so in broad terms only,allowing ârelevant authoritiesâ to intercept private communications to meet theneedsof âpublic securityâ or to investigate criminal offences provided they doso âin accordance with legal proceduresâ.</p><p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> But,as I have indicated earlier, if the right to privacy guaranteed by art.30 is tobe âprotected by lawâ, how can that protectionbe of any practical value or effectunless the circumstances in which it may be limited are spelt out in detail andunless provisionsare made for preventing abuse by the ârelevant authoritiesâ?  In my view, therefore, as with art.14of the Bill of Rights, art.30incorporates the principle of legal certainty.</p><p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> Art.30does not in specific terms require that any limitation on the right to free andprivate communication must be reasonable.I am satisfied, however, on a purposive reading of the article as awhole, that a protection against arbitrariness is implied. The right after all must be protected bylaw and any interference with that right may only be for certain limitedpurposes.  If theright containedin art.30 is to be protected so that it may be enjoyed in full measure, then âlegalproceduresâ must be adoptedto ensure accessibility and certainty and throughthose characteristics, the avoidance of arbitrary limitations.</p><p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> Whenthe framework of art.30 is considered as a whole, the requirement that theright to freely and privately communicate with othersâshall be protected bylawâ must, in my view, be read as being complemented by the provision that anylimitation of the rightmust be âin accordance with legal proceduresâ.  Those legal procedures, therefore, arenot distinct from but are part and parcelof the protection of the right whichmust be provided by law.</p><p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> Theprotection of the law demanded by both art.30 of the Basic Law and art.14 ofthe Bill of Rights does not mean that legislationonly will be sufficient eventhough legislation invariably is employed.  It is clear to me, however, that purely administrativedirectionswhich are not themselves part of any framework of substantive law,and therefore have no general effect, will not be sufficient. In this regard, the Executive Order,although made pursuant to constitutional power, is no more than a body ofadministrative directionsbinding only on government servants.  </p><p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> Inrespect of art.30, without saying this is decisive, for it is not, I would addthat, interpreting the article purposively andin context, I am satisfiedthat it is also qualified by the provisions of art.39(2).  The article states that âthe rights andfreedomsenjoyed by Hong Kong residents shall not be restricted unless asprescribed by lawâ.  That, it seemsto me, to be a statement ofgeneral application not just to the rightsprotected in art.39(1) but to all rights protected in Chapter 111.</p><p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> Whatthen is encompassed by principle of legal certainty?  In <i>Leung Kwok Hung and Others</i>, the Court of FinalAppeal summarised its earlier findings in <i>Shum Kwok Sher</i> in respect ofthe principle :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âTosatisfy this principle [of legal certainty], certain requirements must bemet.  It must be adequately accessible to the citizenand must beformulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate hisconduct.  As pointed out by Sir Anthony MasonNPJ (at para.63), theexplanation of these requirements in the often quoted passage in the majorityjudgment of the European Courtof Human Rights in <i>Sunday Times v. UnitedKingdom (No.1)</i> <i>(A/130) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%2d1980%29%202%20EHRR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979-1980) 2 EHRR 245</a> (at para.49,p.271), the âthalidomideâ case, is of assistance:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">âFirst, the law must be adequately accessible: the citizen must beable to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstancesof the legalrules applicable to a given case.  Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded asa âlawâ unless it is formulated with sufficientprecision to enable the citizento regulate his conduct : he must be able â if need be with appropriate adviceâ to foresee,to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, theconsequences which a given action may entail.  Those consequences need notbe foreseeable with absolute certainty : experience shows this to beunattainable.  Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable,it may bringin its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pacewith changing circumstances.  Accordingly, manylaws are inevitably couched in terms which,to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation andapplication arequestions of practice.ââ</p></blockquote><p>The Court continued :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âAlaw which confers discretionary powers on public officials, the exercise ofwhich may interfere with fundamental rights, mustgive an adequate indicationof the scope of the discretion.  The degree of precision required of thelaw in this connection willdepend upon the particular subject matter of thediscretion.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> Forthe reasons given, I have concluded that art.30 of the Basic Law and art.14 ofthe Bill of Rights (both as read with art.39(2)of the Basic Law), inprotecting the same fundamental right in essentially the same manner,incorporate into their constitutionalrequirements the need for the existenceof laws which make for legal certainty and require that any limitations on theright, asa characteristic of that legal certainty, be proportionate.  On that basis, I fail to see how it canbe said that s.33 meets therequirements of those constitutional articles uponwhich the applicants have relied.  </p><p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> S.33,as enacted, does not in any detail regulate the scope of the Chief Executiveâsdiscretion or the manner in which it may beexercised.  It is plainly inadequate.  </p><p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> Ithas been argued that I should use the constitutional device of reading into s.33 the safeguardscontained in art.30 of the BasicLaw. By that measure, it has been said, s.33 will then be in conformity withthe Basic Law.  As I understandit, the reading inwould mean that s.33 would have to be read as containing the following two qualifications;first, that the term âpublic interestâwould be restricted to meeting the needsof public security or of investigation of crime and, second, the unfettereddiscretion ofthe Chief Executive in s.33 would be subject to compliance with âlegalproceduresâ.  </p><p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> Thefirst point I make is that the Basic Law, unlike a number of otherconstitutions, does not contain a provision to the effectthat, upon it cominginto force, existing laws are to be construed with all necessary modificationsin order to bring them into conformity.Indeed, art.160 of the Basic Law directs that, if any laws arediscovered to be inconsistent with it, they must be amended or ceaseto haveeffect.  In this regard, art.160(1)reads :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âUpon the establishment of the Hong Kong Special AdministrativeRegion, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall be adoptedas laws ofthe Region except for those which the Standing Committee of the NationalPeopleâs Congress declares to be in contraventionof this Law. If any laws arelater discovered to be in contravention of this Law, they shall be amended orcease to have force inaccordance with the procedure as prescribed by thisLaw.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> Althoughas a constitutional provision, art.160 must be read purposively, withoutdeciding the issue, I doubt whether the referenceto amendment extends to reading in to the extent advocated byMr Zervos which, in my view, requires substantial modification of thetruemeaning and intent of s.33 as enacted.</p><p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> TheCanadian authority of <i>Schacter v. Canada</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20SCR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 SCR 679</a>, 93DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 1 held that reading in would be appropriate only inthe clearest of cases.  Among other considerations, this would meanthat itwould only be appropriate in cases where the modification would beconsistent with the legislative objective of the statutory provision. Remembering that the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">TelecommunicationsOrdinance</a> was brought into effect in 1963, it seems clear to me that thelegislature at the time intended to give an unfettered discretionto the ChiefExecutive which he would exercise, as he saw fit, not only in the interest ofpublic security or investigating crimebut generally in the interests of HongKong.  Accordingly, on this basisalone, I can find no grounds for reading in as advocatedby Mr Zervos.</p><p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> Inany event, I do not see how the reading in suggested by Mr Zervos wouldrender <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> consistent with the requirements of art.30.  I reject the submission that the purelyadministrative directions contained in the ExecutiveOrder are capable, on apurposive reading of art.30, of constituting âlegal proceduresâ for thepurposes of that article.  Thatbeing the case, even if I accede to Mr Zervosâ submission as to readingin, there is no body of detailed law to support the broadand inadequateprovisions contained in s.33.  Bythis I mean there is not sufficient clarity as to the scope of the ChiefExecutiveâsdiscretion nor is there any measure oflegal protection provided to protect against abuse of executive power.  There is certainlyno measure of anyindependent control.</p><p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> Itis plain, I think, on an ordinary reading, that s.33 has not been formulatedwith sufficient precision to enable Hong Kong residents,with legal advice ifnecessary, to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances theconsequences of any telecommunicationintercourse they may have with otherseven if those consequences may not be foreseeable with absolute certainty.</p><p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> Accordingly,I am satisfied that s.33 is inconsistent with the constitutional guaranteescontained in the Basic Law; that is, arts.30and 39 of the Basic Law and,through art.39, art.14 of the Bill of Rights.</p><p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> Even if I was able to make a fine distinction between the meaning,intent and effect of the requirements of art.30 of the Basic Lawand art.14 of theBill of Rights, both are constitutional provisions and the violation of one,even if it is not a violation of theother, will be sufficient to render s.33of no force or effect.</p><p class = "heading">The Executive Order</p><p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> Thepowers and functions of the Chief Executive are defined in art.48 of the BasicLaw.  As the head of the government,while theChief Executive is responsible for the implementation of laws; thatis, for their discharge or execution, he is given no legislativepowershimself.  In terms of art.48(4), hemay, however, issue executive orders.</p><p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> Executiveorders are therefore one of the constitutionally recognised means by which theChief Executive discharges his executivepowers.  As I have earlier indicated, they are directions ofan administrative kind only which are made by the Chief Executive forthepurpose of implementing laws and carrying out government policies.</p><p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> TheExecutive Order itself, published in August 2005, is directed to and bindsofficers of the public service responsible for lawenforcement.  It directs that no exercise in covertsurveillance may be carried out without authorisation.  To this end, s.5 of theOrder statesthat :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">â(1) No officer may, directly or throughany other person, carry out any covert surveillance without an authorizationgranted underthis Order.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">(2) Any officer of any department mayapply to an authorization officer of the department for an authorization forany covert surveillanceto be carried out by or on behalf of any of theofficers of the department.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> Anâofficerâ means any officer of a department whose duties include lawenforcement investigations.  A âdepartmentâmeansany department of the Government which undertakes law enforcementinvestigations and includes the Independent Commission AgainstCorruption.</p><p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> Toprevent a misuse of the system of authorisation, the Executive Order mandatesregular reviews by monitoring authorities.  Thesemonitoring authorities, however, are not independentof Government.  The Order has nosuch reach.  They are instead membersof Government,officers bound by the Order.  In this regard, ss.15 and 16 of the Order state :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">â15. Thehead of any department may designate in writing any officer not below a rankequivalent to that of senior superintendentof police to be an authorizingofficer for the purposes of this Order.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">16.

Itdoes not bind Hong Kong residents generally.  It does not purportto be legislation nor do I see howit can be taken to be legislation.</p><p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> Theapplicants have submitted that the Order seeks to fill a legislative vacuumthereby assuming the place of legislation.  Theycontend that, by authorising and regulating secretsurveillance of all kinds, it purports to have legislative effect.</p><p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> Ido not read the Executive Order that way. It is to be read, I believe, in the way that the Order explainsitself to public servants.I say that because there is an explanatory note to the Order whichreads :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote"> âThisOrder is made by the Chief Executive under Article 48(4) of the Basic Lawto set out the legal procedures in accordance withwhich covert surveillancemay be carried out by or on behalf of officers of Government departments whichundertake law enforcementinvestigations or operations.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> TheExecutive Order, therefore, purports to be a set of âlegal proceduresâ.  It is an unusual description for apurely administrativeorder.  Thephrase of course is drawn from art.30 of the Basic Law which permits theauthorities to intercept private communicationsin order to protect publicsecurity and investigate crime provided it is done in accordance with âlegalproceduresâ.</p><p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> Forthe Chief Executive, Mr Zervos has submitted that, on a properconstruction of art.30 of the Basic Law, the phrase âin accordancewith legalproceduresâ, being broad in its language, includes procedures that are legallyestablished under a statutory or otherlegal power, duty or function and is notto be equated with the phrases âin accordance with lawâ or âprescribed by lawâ. I disagree.  In this regard, I can do no better than repeat what I have said inpara.122 of this judgment; namely that, when theframework of art.30 is considered as a whole, the requirement that the right tofreely and privately communicate with others âshallbe protected by lawâ mustbe read as being complemented by the provision that any limitation of the rightmust be âin accordancewith legal proceduresâ.  Those legal procedures, therefore, are not distinct from butare part and parcel of the protection ofthe right which must be provided bylaw.</p><p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> In support of his submissions, Mr Zervos relied on the observations of KeithJ (as hethen was) in <i>The Association of Expatriate Civil Servants of Hong Kong v.The Chief Executive</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20HKLRD%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 HKLRD 615</a>, at 622.  In looking to this judgment, I acceptof course, just as Keith J accepted, that the phrase âin accordance withlegalproceduresâ is a broad and general phrase and, depending on the context,is capable of different meanings. The phrase appearsseveral times in the Basic Law in differentcontexts.  In his judgment,Keith J observed that the phrase appears in arts.30,48(6),48(7), 73(1) and 74.  Hewas, however, unable to find a common meaning and intent :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âOnthe whole, I have not been assisted by these provisions.  The meaning of a particular provision,whether in an ordinance orin a constitutional instrument such as the BasicLaw, depends very much on its context, and I have not discerned a clear patternas to the rationale behind the use of one phrase and not another in the BasicLaw.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> Inhis judgment, Keith J was required to determine the meaning of the phrase as itappears in art.48(7), that article being to theeffect that the Chief Executiveshall exercise the power to appoint or remove holders of public office inaccordance with legal procedures.Keith J considered the meaning of the phrase in the context notonly of art.48 itself but art.103, an article providing for theappointment, promotion,training, discipline and remuneration of public servants.  In <i>that</i> context, the judgeconcluded that the phrase âin accordance with legal proceduresâ meant âinaccordance with such proceduresas are lawfully established to maintain HongKongâs previous system of recruitment and discipline for the public serviceâ,certainof those procedures being laid down by way of executive orders.</p><p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> Ininterpreting the phrase as it appears in art.48(7), however, as I havesaid, Keith J recognised that it was not necessarily tobe interpreted inthe same manner elsewhere in the Basic Law.  In my judgment, the context in which the phrase is to beinterpretedin art.30 is very different â art.30 for a start goes tofundamental rights guaranteed to all Hong Kong residents â and by reasonof that very different context demands a different interpretation.</p><p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> In my view, it is aformalistic outcome to say that the fundamental right contained in art.30,which the article requires shall beprotected by law, may nevertheless berestricted by a body of purely administrative procedures which are not law andwhich bind onlypublic servants who, in the event of abuse, are subject only tointernal disciplinary proceedings. That, in my view, would derogatesubstantially from the practical andeffective value of the right guaranteed by the article.  That, I am satisfied â giving thearticle agenerous interpretation in order to protect the full measure of the value ofthe right it guarantees â cannot have beenthe intention of those whodrafted the Basic Law.</p><p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> Iam satisfied, therefore, that the use of the phrase âin accordance with legalproceduresâ in art.30 means procedures whichare laid down by law in the sensethat they form part of substantive law, invariably, in order to comply with therequirements oflegal certainty, within legislation, primary and/or secondary.</p><p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> That being the case, having found that the Executive Order does notpurport to be legislation of any kind or to have the effect oflegislation,I am further satisfied that the Executive Order, while it is entirely legitimate and of value asan administrative toolin regulating the internal conduct of law enforcementagencies, is not capable of constituting a set of âlegal proceduresâ forthepurposes of art.30.</p><p class = "heading">The remedy of âtemporary validityâ</p><p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> Ihave determined that a declaration should be made that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> of the<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a>, insofar as it permits the interception andinspection of telecommunication messages, is inconsistent with the BasicLaw.  I havefurtherdetermined that the ExecutiveOrder, while it remains a valid body of administrative directions, is notcapable of constitutinga body of âlegal proceduresâ for the purposes of art.30of the Basic Law.</p><p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a> Ihave been informed that, if I should come to these findings, until a new oramended body of law has been made effective, therewill be no operative body oflaw in place which, in compliance with the Basic Law, regulates covertsurveillance by law enforcementagencies. </p><p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a> Theconsequence of this is as profound as it is stark.  It means that for an extended period of time, probably aboutsix months,it will be unlawful for Hong Kongâs law enforcement agencies toconduct many forms of covert surveillance, certainly the secretinterception oftelecommunication messages.  Thishandicap, said Mr Zervos, could have disastrous results.</p><p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> Thefirst applicant argued that the crisis prophesied by Mr Zervos can easilybe avoided.  There need be novacuum.  If there isto be acrisis, he said, it will be of the administrationâs own making.  Legislation has been enacted regulatingcovert surveillance,including the secret interception of communications.  It is legislation that isconstitutionally acceptable.  Thatlegislation isthe IOC Ordinance. As the first applicant put it, it needs only to be taken down from theshelf, dusted off and put into effectby the Chief Executive for it to comeinto effect.  </p><p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a> Withrespect, that solution ignores the fact that, whether for good reasons or bad,if the IOC Ordinance is to be put into effectin a workable manner considerablemeasures will still have to be put in hand including perhaps the enactment ofsubsidiary legislation. That willtake time.</p><p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a> Inany event, I have determined in this judgment that the decision of the Chief Executivenot to bring the IOC Ordinance into effectis a lawful decision.  I have determined that he is not atthis time, nor has he ever been, in breach of his duties under s.1(2)of theIOC Ordinance.  I have further found that his decision to return to theLegislative Council seeking the repeal of the IOCOrdinance and its replacementby a more effective legislative regime is a lawful process.  It seems to me that if I am now to directthe Chief Executive to bring the Ordinance into effect â despite thefact that there has been a finding that he has no obligationin law to do so â this court willbe encroaching on the executive and political powers of the Chief Executive,powers that arespecifically reserved to him under the Basic Law.  In short, it seems to me that thiscourt, if it was to make such a direction,would itself be in danger of actingunconstitutionally.</p><p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a> Atthis juncture, let me state plainly that I agree with the concerns thatMr Zervos has expressed on behalf of the Administration. Ifthe ability of the police and other agencies to carry out covert surveillanceis to be made unlawful, even if only for a periodof weeks, the well-being ofour civil society will be placed in peril.</p><p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a> Thiscourt has no knowledge of the number and nature of threats facing HongKong.  That they exist, however,can be assured.  HongKong isprosperous, free, open and in equal measure, if its guard is down, it isvunerable.  Rendering covertsurveillance unlawfulcreates an amnesty for conspirators.  No lurid examples are necessary to illustratethe dangers that presents.</p><p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a> Earlierin this judgment, I referred to a remedy advocated by Mr Zervos.  It is admittedly an exceptional remedy,one that has neverbeen used in the relatively short time that Hong Kong hasenjoyed a written constitution.  Iam satisfied, however, for reasons towhich I shall refer, if the needarises to avoid a vacuum of law, that this court has the jurisdiction to employthe remedy.</p><p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a> Theremedy may be stated as follows. If this court is required to declare that a legislative provision isinconsistent with theBasic Law and thereby invalid, it may assume the power topostpone the operation of the declaration of invalidity to allow theAdministrationand the Legislative Council time to enact correctivelegislation.  </p><p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> Canada,like Hong Kong, has a written constitution.  The courts of Canada have on several occasions been forcedto employ the remedy. To myunderstanding, the greatest body of jurisprudence on the subject comes fromthat jurisdiction.  The SupremeCourt of Canadafirst assumed the power to hold that unconstitutional laws wereto be given temporary force and effect in its judgment in <i>Manitoba Language Rights </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%201%20SCR%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 1 SCR 721.</a>  In that case, the legislature of Manitoba had failed toenact laws in French as well as English and had thereby invalidated almosttheentire Manitoba statute book. Although declaring the legislation invalid and of no force and effect,the Supreme Court invokedan inherent jurisdiction based on the principle ofthe rule of law in order to keep the unconstitutional statutes temporarily inforce.  In his text, <i>ConstitutionalLaw of Canada</i>, Professor Peter Hogg has commented that thedecision was at the time a radical exercise of judicial power, a body ofunconstitutionallaw being maintained in force solely by virtue of the order ofthe court.  </p><p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a> Themanner in which the Supreme Court concluded that it had an inherentjurisdiction based on the rule of law needs to be examinedin some detail.  I can do no better than cite extensivelyfrom the findings of the court in this regard :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âInthe present case, declaring the Acts of the Legislature of Manitoba invalid andof no force or effect would, without more, underminethe principle of the ruleof law.  The rule of law, afundamental principle of our <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, must mean at least two things.  First, that the law is supreme overofficials of the government as well as private individuals,and therebypreclusive of the influence of arbitrary power.  Indeed, it is because of the supremacy of law over thegovernment, asestablished in s.23 of the <i>Manitoba Act, 1870</i>, and s.52of the <i><a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Act, 1982</i>, that this court must find theunconstitutional laws of Manitoba to be invalid and of no force and effect.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">Second,the rule of law requires the creation and maintenance of an actual order ofpositive laws which preserves and embodies themore general principle ofnormative order.  Law and order areindispensable elements of civilized life. âThe Rule of Law in thissense implies â¦ simply the existence of publicorder.â  (I.

As John Locke once said, âA governmentwithout laws is, I suppose, a mystery in politics, inconceivableto humancapacity and inconsistent with human societyâ (quoted by Lord Wilberforce in <i>CarlZeiss-Stiftung v.

Accordingto Wade and Phillips, <i>Constitutional Administrative Law</i>, 9<sup>th</sup>ed. (1977), at p. 89:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">â¦ the rule of law expresses a preference for law and order within acommunity rather than anarchy, warfare and constant strife. In this sense, the rule of law is aphilosophical view of society which in the Western tradition is linked withbasic democraticnotions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">Itis this second aspect of the rule of law that is of concern in the presentsituation.  The conclusion that theActs of the Legislatureof Manitoba are invalid and of no force or effect meansthat the positive legal order which has purportedly regulated the affairsofthe citizens of Manitoba since 1890 will be destroyed and the rights,obligations and other effects arising under these laws willbe invalid andunenforceable.  As for the future,since it is reasonable to assume that it will be impossible for the Legislatureof Manitoba to rectify <i>instantaneously</i> the constitutional defect, theActs of the Manitoba Legislature will be invalid and of no force or effectuntil they are translated,re-enacted, printed and published in both languages.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">Suchresults would certainly offend the rule of law.  As we stated in the <i>Patriation Reference, supra</i>, atp. 46 D.L.R., pp. 805-6 S.C.R.:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">The ârule of lawâ isa highly textured expression â¦ conveying, for example, a <i>sense oforderliness, of subjection to known legal rules</i> and of executive accountabilityto legal authority.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">Dr. Raz has said: ââThe rule of lawâ meansliterally what it says: the rule of the law â¦ It has two aspects: (1) thatpeopleshould be ruled by the law and obey it, and (2) that the law should besuch that people will be able to be guided by itâ : <i>The Authority of Law </i>(1979),at pp. 212-3.  The rule of lawsimply cannot be fulfilled in a province that has no positive law.â</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">â¦</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">Theonly appropriate solution for preserving the rights, obligations and othereffects which have arisen under invalid Acts of theLegislature of Manitoba andwhich are not saved by the <i>de facto</i> or other doctrines is to declarethat, in order to uphold the rule of law, these rights, obligations and othereffects have, andwill continue to have, the same force and effect they wouldhave had if they had arisen under valid enactments, for that period oftimeduring which it would be impossible for Manitoba to comply with itsconstitutional duty under s. 23 of the <i>Manitoba Act, 1870</i>.  The Province of Manitoba would be facedwith chaos and anarchy if the legal rights, obligations and other effects whichhave beenrelied upon by the people of Manitoba since 1890 were suddenly opento challenge.  The constitutionalguarantee of rule of law willnot tolerate such chaos and anarchy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">Norwill the constitutional guarantee of rule of law tolerate the Province ofManitoba being without a valid and effectual legal systemfor the present andfuture.  Thus, it will be necessaryto deem temporarily valid and effective the unilingual Acts of the Legislatureof Manitoba which would be currently in force, were it not for theirconstitutional defect, for the period of time during which itwould beimpossible for the Manitoba Legislature to fulfil its constitutional duty.  Since this temporary validation willincludethe legislation under which the Manitoba Legislature is presentlyconstituted, it will be legally able to re-enact, print and publishits laws inconformity with the dictates of the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> once they have beentranslated.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a> TheSupreme Court held that the constitutional status of the Rule of Law in Canadawas beyond question.  The preambleto the constitutionof Canada stated specifically that it had been founded uponprinciples that recongised the rule of law.  In addition, the SupremeCourt held that the principle ofthe rule of law was implicit in the very nature not only of the constitutionbut of constitutionsgenerally : </p><blockquote><p class = "quote">ââ¦ the principle is clearly implicit in thevery nature of a constitution.  The<a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, as the supreme law, must be understood as a purposive ordering ofsocial relations providing a basis upon which an actual orderof positive lawscan be brought into existence.  Thefounders of this nation must have intended, as one of the basic principles ofnation building, that Canada be a society of legal order and normativestructure: one governed by rule of law. While this is notset out in a specific provision, the principle of therule of law is clearly a principle of our Constitution.â</p></blockquote><p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a> Canadian jurisprudence indicates that the radical remedy oftemporary validity is only to be used in situations where danger, disorderordeprivation would be caused by an immediate declaration of invalidity.  I am satisfied that any immediatedeclaration of invalidityin the present case would give rise to theprobability of danger to Hong Kong residents, disorder by way of a threat tothe ruleof law and deprivation to Hong Kong residents generally.</p><p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a> I would add that the remedy of suspending declarations of invalidityhas been recognised by the Strasbourg Court.  In this regard,by way of illustration, in <i>Walden v. Liechtenstein</i> Appno.33916/96 (16 March 2000, unreported), the Court recognised that thetemporary preservation of a law by the domestic courtsof Liechtenstein, eventhough it violated the rights of the applicant served the legitimate aim ofmaintaining legal certainty. </p><p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a> Internationaljurisprudence therefore recognises that, in constitutional matters, lawsdeclared to be in violation of a constitutionmay nevertheless be declaredtemporarily valid.  In my judgment,this court, for the reasons expounded by the Supreme Court of Canada,possessesthe same jurisdiction, one founded on its inherent powers.  An examination of the Basic Law revealsthat the rule of lawlies at its heart. Equally, therefore, the rule of law in Hong Kong has constitutionalstatus.  </p><p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a> Inmy judgment, the time sought by the Administration to put corrective measuresinto effect is proportionate.  Thatperiod is oneof six months.  </p><p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a> Itis to be recognised that the Supreme Court of Canada did not rely <i>directly</i>upon the doctrine of necessity although it treated cases concerning thatdoctrine as supplying an âanalogous supportâ.  ProfessorHogg, in his text, <i>Constitutional Law ofCanada</i>, has observed that the decision could as easily have been framed interms of necessity as of the rule of law. To avoid ambiguity,I confirm that I find the inherentjurisdiction of this court to rest not on the doctrine of necessity but, aswith the Canadiancourts, on the rule of law.</p><p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a> Duringthe course of submissions, while Mr Dykes accepted that the remedy oftemporary validity had a pragmatic attraction.  He argued,however, that, if the Basic Law allowed for sucha provision it would have made specific provision.  In this regard, he made referenceto the South Africanconstitution which provides that the courts there, in deciding a constitutionalmatter, may suspend any declarationof invalidity of a legislative provisionfor any period and on any conditions it sees fit to allow the competentauthorities to enactcorrective legislation.  </p><p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a> Eachand every constitution, however, arises out of its own unique historicalcircumstances.  Those circumstancesare often reflectedin the constitution itself.  Those responsible for drafting the South Africanconstitution had to bear in mind that the courts wouldbe faced with a large bodyof laws which had been enacted during the <i>apartheid</i> era and which would,directly and indirectly, reflect formalised racial prejudice.  If all such provisions were to bestruck down,allowing no time for corrective legislation, chaos would have beenthe result.  Hong Kongâsconstitution, however, was draftedin very different circumstances.  It is a constitution which emphasisescontinuity rather than the abandonment of an old legislativeregime.</p><p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a> Mr Dykeswas concerned that art.160 of the Basic Law, by its specific wording, prohibitsthe assumption by the courts of any powerto declare invalid laws temporarilyvalid.  I do not agree.  Art.160 provides that, if any laws arediscovered to be in contraventionof the Basic Law, they shall be amended orshall cease to have effect in accordance with the procedures prescribed in theBasic Lawitself.  Art.160 issilent on the issue of the result of any legal vacuum that may come intoexistence when laws cease to have effector while they are under a process of amendment.  In terms of art.8, however, the BasicLaw states that the common law and rules ofequity shall remain the law of HongKong.  To my understanding, the inherentjurisdiction identified by the Supreme Court of Canadain <i>Re Manitoba LanguageRights </i>sprung from our common inheritance of the common law.  </p><p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a> Itis important to emphasise that the common law has never been written in stone,a once and for all system of laws and customs rigidin its inability tochange.  In this regard, it is aptto make reference to a recent judgment of the House of Lords in <i>re SpectrumPlus Ltd (in liquidation)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%202%20AC%20680" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 2AC 680.</a>  In that judgment, theHouse considered the circumstances in which, if at all, it would be appropriatefor a court to give a judgmentover ruling what previously the law was thoughtto be without that overruling having any retroactive effect.  The House held thatit would be goingtoo far to say that prospective overruling â as it is termed â could never be justified.  Lord Nicholls notedthat thetraditional approach that judgments as to points of law declare what the lawhas always been had largely emerged out ofthe principle of judicialprecedent.  Judicial precedent was,however, a practice derived from the common law and constitutionally,he said,common law judges have always had the power to modify this practice.  Lord Nichollswent on to emphasise that the strengthof the common law lay in its ability toadapt to changing needs :</p><blockquote><p class = "quote">âInstanceswhere this power has been used in courts elsewhere suggest there could becircumstances in this country where prospectiveoverruling would be necessaryto serve the underlying objective of the courts of this country: to administerjustice fairly and inaccordance with the law.  There could be cases where a decision on an issue of law,whether common law or statute law, was unavoidablebut the decision would havesuch gravely unfair and disruptive consequences for past transactions orhappenings that this House wouldbe compelled to depart from the normalprinciples relating to the retrospective and prospective effect of courtdecisions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class = "quote">If,altogether exceptionally, the House as the countryâs supreme court were tofollow this course I would not regard it as trespassingoutside the functionsproperly to be discharged by the judiciary under this countryâsconstitution.  Rigidity in theoperationof a legal system is a sign of weakness, not strength.  It deprives a legal system of necessaryelasticity.  Far from achieving aconstitutionally exemplary result, it can produce a legal system unable tofunction effectively in changing times. âNever sayneverâ is a wise judicial precept, in the interest of allcitizens of the country.â  [699F]</p></blockquote><p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a> Inthe result, it seems to me that the remedy of temporary validity, whether it isincorporated into the direct language of a constitutionor is employed by acourt as a constitutional remedy, is today a recognised means by which, inadmittedly exceptional circumstancesonly, the provisions of a constitution maybe protected by the striking down of invalid subsidiary laws without thatprocess itselfpulling down the pillars of the constitution upon itself.  </p><p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a> Finally,in respect of covert surveillance generally, excluding the secret interceptionof private communications, Mr Dykes saidthat there is at this time no lawin place and the Administration is therefore no worse of than it was before.  There is, however,a body ofadministrative directions contained in the Executive Order which it has beenargued constitute legal procedures for thepurposes of art.30 of the BasicLaw.  While I have declared thatthose directions do not validly constitute legal procedures forthe purposes ofart.30, I see no reason why that declaration cannot be temporarily suspended. </p><p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a> Iam therefore satisfied that an order of temporary validity for six monthsshould be made.</p><p class = "heading">Conclusion</p><p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a> Forthe reasons given in this judgment, I have come to the following determinations :</p><p class = "heading">(i) TheIOC Ordinance</p><p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a> TheOrdinance was enacted in June 1997. In terms of s.1(2), the Chief Executive has the duty to bring it intoeffect on a day tobe appointed by him. The applicants claim that, by failing to set a day, the Chief Executivehas acted in breach of that duty andtherefore unlawfully.  The applicants have sought adeclaration to that effect together with a declaration that the Chief Executivehas a legal obligation forthwith to appoint a day to bring it into effect inits present form.</p><p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a> Ithas not been demonstrated, however, that the Chief Executive has acted inbreach of his statutory duty nor that he is in breachof it at this time.  The application for declaratory reliefis therefore dismissed.</p><p class = "heading">(ii) The<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/106" class="autolink_findacts">Telecommunications Ordinance</a></p><p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a> S.33of the Ordinance gives the power to the Chief Executive, when he considers itto be in the public interest, to order the interceptionof telecommunicationmessages.  This power is notsubject to any legislative controls. The applicants claim that s.33, in so faras it authorises suchinterception, is inconsistent with arts.30 and 39 of the Basic Law whichguarantee the right to freely andprivately communicate with others.  They claim that s.33 is unconstitutional,void and of no effect.  They have sought adeclarationto that effect.</p><p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a> Iam satisfied that s.33 , in so far as it authorises or allows access to, or thedisclosure of, the contents of telecommunicationmessages is inconsistent witharts.30 and 39 of the Basic Law and, through art.39, with art.14 of the Bill ofRights.  The applicantsare granteda declaration to that effect in the terms of the declaration contained inpara.26 of this judgment.</p><p class = "heading">(iii) TheExecutive Order</p><p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a> TheExecutive Order was made in August 2005 pursuant to the powers of the ChiefExecutive under art.48(4) of the Basic Law.  It isan administrative order having no legislativeeffect.  Its purpose is to lay downâlegal proceduresâ governing all forms of covertsurveillance.  The applicants claim that the Order,insofar as it purports to authorise and regulate covert surveillance by lawenforcementagencies, purports to have legislative effect and in that regard isinconsistent with arts.30 and 39 of the Basic Law and, throughart.39, withart.14 of the Bill of Rights.  Theyhave sought a declaration to that effect together with an order of <i>certiorari</i>to quash the Order.</p><p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a> Iam satisfied that the Executive Order does not purport to have legislativeeffect.  I am satisfied that it isno more than an administrativeorder and, being such, is lawfully made.  </p><p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a> Thatbeing said, however, I am also satisfied that the contention made on behalf ofthe Chief Executive that the Executive Order,in laying down a body of âlegalproceduresâ, complies with the requirements of art.30 of the Basic Law isincorrect.  The ExecutiveOrder, asan administrative order, does not comply with art.30 nor is it capable of doingso.  For the purposes of clarity,therewill be a declaration to this effect.</p><p class = "heading">(iv) Theremedy of temporary validity</p><p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a> I am satisfied that any legal vacuum brought about by the declarationsI make will constitute a real threat to the rule of law inHong Kong if lawenforcement agencies are unable to conduct covert surveillance, including theinterception of private communications,until corrective legislation can be putin place.  I am informed that itmay take six months to put that corrective legislation intoplace.  </p><p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a> That being the case, I order that the effect of the declarationsthat I have made will be suspended for a period of six months. There will therefore be an order interms of the order contained in para.46 of this judgment.</p><p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a> Theorders made under this judgment include an order that there be liberty toapply.</p><p class = "heading">Costs</p><p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a> Consideringthe question of costs, while I accept that all three parties have beenpartially successful and partially unsuccessful,and while this may normally result in an order of no order as to costs,I do not feel able at this time to come to a decision inrespect of costs.  The present proceedings must be viewed,at least to some extent, I think, in light of the fact that, when theapplicationwas first filed, there was no indication that urgent steps were being taken bythe Administration to bring into forcea comprehensive and constitutionallyacceptable body of law governing covert surveillance in all its forms.  Mr Dykes observed duringthecourse of the proceedings that this application has been successful in that, ifnothing else, it has precipitated a move by theAdministration to achieve earlyconstitutional regularity.  If heis correct in this regard, it may be argued that it would not beequitable toeither visit costs on the applicants or deprive them of costs if the reason forthis is to be laid at their feet. Ihave come to no view on the matter.  I simply record it as being of potential relevance in theexercise of my discretion.  In thecircumstances, I will hear from the parties, if they are unable to agreeotherwise, as to costs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">  <tr>    <td width="50%"> </td>    <td width="50%">    <p style="text-align:center">(M.J.Hartmann)<br>    Judge of the Court of First Instance,<br>    High Court</td>  </tr></table><p> </p><!--sino section representation --><representation><p>1<sup>st</sup> Applicant, in person,present</p><p>Mr Philip Dykes, SC leading Mr Hectar Pun, instructedby Messrs K.M.
