The defendant carried on the business of cargo handlingat the wharf and had the use of berth 31. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> On 25 May 2000 the deceased had to operate the shore crane which was situated at the wharf alongside berth 31 to load bundles ofstainless steel on board a mainland coaster âYue Hui 108â (âthe vesselâ) which was alongside berth 31.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The shore crane provided by the defendant to the deceased for the loading of the goods was fixed in position on the shore at thewharf alongside berth 31.  The deceased was required to operate the shore crane to lift up the goods and move them by the shore craneto the cargo hold of the vessel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The vessel was larger than the usual vessels arriving at the wharf for the transport of goods.  The vessel was 58.05 metres longwith a high freeboard and with a walkway extending along the length and breadth of the hatch of the cargo hold.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> At about 4.45 pm on 25 May 2000 the deceased went on board the vessel.  He suddenly fell from the vessel into the sea through a gapbetween the vessel and the wharf.  Divers of the Fire Service Department were called in to rescue him.  The deceased was broughtback to shore from the sea at about 5.12 pm.  He was sent to hospital where unfortunately, he was certified dead.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The plaintiffs are the administratrices of the estate of the deceased.  They have brought this action on behalf of the estate ofthe deceased under the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a>) and on behalf of the dependants of the deceased under the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22" class="autolink_findacts">Fatal Accidents Ordinance</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/22">Cap. 22</a>).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> At the outset of the trial on 26 September 2005 a consent order was made that there be a split trial on the issue of liability andquantum.  This is the trial of the issue of liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> The plaintiffâs case is that the defendant was the occupier of the wharf and the vessel at the material time.  It is the plaintiffâscase that the defendant was in breach of the common duty of care owed to the plaintiff under the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314" class="autolink_findacts">Occupiers Liability Ordinance</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap. 314</a>) (âthe <i>Ordinance</i>â) and that the deceased fell and died as a result of the breach of duty as particularized in the amended statement of claim.

It arrived at the wharf at 14.30 hours.  Another vessel moored in front of the vessel was to be loaded before the vessel.  Therefore,the vessel had to shift to let that vessel moor near the crane.  The vessel finished loading and left the berth at 16.30 hours. Then the vessel went back to moor alongside the wharf.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The stainless steel plates owned by a Mainland company were packed in bundles at the wharf.  A representative of the company wasat the wharf responsible for ensuring the loading of all steel plates to the vessel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The deceased went on board the vessel to check where the steel plates should be loaded while the crew of the vessel were attendingthe mooring ropes.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The Chief Officer of the vessel at midship and the representative of the company at the berth heard a noise like a heavy object fallinginto the sea and they looked around.  They realized that the deceased had fallen into the sea.  They then shouted for help.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The tally clerk and a worker at the wharf came to the waterfront but they couldnât find the deceased.  Divers of the Fire ServicesDepartment arrived at the scene and brought the deceased from the sea to shore at 17.12 hours.  The deceased was admitted to hospitalwhere he was certified dead.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> The plaintiffs also rely on the statements and the evidence given by Kwok Man Pan (âKwokâ) at the Coronerâs inquest.  Kwokdid not give evidence at the trial. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Kwok gave a statement to the Marine Department on 26 May 2000.  He was sent from the Mainland to ensure that the steel plates wereloaded and shipped.  He was waiting at the material time on the wharf for the vessel to be moored.  At about 16.40 hours the vesselmoved near to the outer bank and at the left.  He saw the crew of the vessel fastening the towropes at the front end and at the backof the vessel around the bitts on the shore.  He also assisted in fastening the towropes at the front of the vessel around the bitt.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> He said that he saw the deceased jump over onto the vessel.  The vessel had two decks and he saw the deceased in the lower deck atthe edge of the vessel.  The deceased had jumped over by holding a part of the vessel with one hand and he stretched his leg overit and climbed onto the vessel.  He was standing on the edge of the vessel.  Kwok was at the wharf at the time when he saw that andhe was walking towards one end of the vessel near the cockpit.  He said that the vessel was not moored at that position and as thewaves were very strong at that time he went there to tighten the ropes used in mooring the vessel. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Kwok did not see the deceased fall but he heard a sound âDongâ.  When he turned back to have a look he saw that the deceasedhad fallen down.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Kwok also said in a statement to the police on 25 May 2000 that suddenly the vessel shook violently due to a great wave and he believedthat this was what made the deceased lose his balance and fall down to the sea.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The investigation report also stated that the deceased went on board the vessel when the mooring ropes were still being fastened.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The cause of death as shown in the autopsy report on the deceased showed that the cause of death was drowning.  The autopsy reportalso showed that the deceased had suffered from a head injury possibly by knocking against a hard object during the fall into thesea.  This contributed to the causation of the drowning in an indirect manner.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The Coroner also found that the deceased slipped and fell into the sea when he was on board the vessel.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> I heard evidence from Suen Guixiong, the younger brother of the deceased.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> I also heard evidence from Ho Chui Fai (âHoâ), a director and major shareholder of the defendant, Leung Pun Yuen (âLeungâ)and Yuen Kwok Wah (âYuenâ).  Leung was working as a tally clerk for the defendant at the wharf at the material time.  Yuen washired by the defendant after the accident and was an experienced shore crane operator.  Yuen was hired from 26 May 2000, a day afterthe accident.  I also heard evidence from an independent witness Ng Hoi Cheung (âNgâ), another shore crane operator working ata wharf next to the wharf.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> I have no hesitation in accepting the evidence of Ho, Leung, Yuen and Ng.  I found them to be honest, credible and reliable witnesses. I cannot say the same for Suen Guixiong.  Where his evidence is at variance with the evidence of Ho, Leung and Yuen, I prefer theirevidence to the evidence of Suen Guixiong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The defendantâs business included arranging cargo loading at the wharf onto and from vessels at the berths used by the defendantat the wharf.  At the material time the defendant used berth 31.  The deceased was hired by the defendant as a shore crane operatorto load goods to and from vessels moored at the wharf by means of the shore crane.  It is clear that the deceased was in independentcontractor of the defendant and not an employee at all material times.  Ho gave evidence, which I accept, that the deceased was hiredby the defendant to operate the shore crane since about 1996 when the deceased was qualified to operate a shore crane.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> The evidence of Ho, as supported by the evidence of Leung, who worked for the defendant, is that the deceased would move goods fromthe crane and place them into the cargo hold of vessels at the wharf with the assistance of signalmen from the vessels.  The signalmenwould guide the deceased by hand signals as to where to place the goods in the vessel.  It was, on their evidence, not necessaryfor the deceased, as the shore crane operator, to board any vessel so as to perform his duties.  I accept their evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Ho, Leung and Yuen also gave evidence as to the display of prominent warning notices at the wharf near the shore crane and at thecontainer office of the defendant alongside the wharf.  Notices were placed both at the entrance to and inside the container officewhich was also used by the defendant.  The notice placed by the defendant stated :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âEmbarkation is strictly forbidden. The offender shall be held responsible for all the consequences.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">                                                                                 Sui Kong Wharf  â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This clearly warned persons, including the deceased, that embarkation on vessels was strictly forbidden.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> On the evidence called on behalf of the defendants, which I accept, it is clear that prominent warning notices were placed at thecontainer office which was at the wharf near the shore crane.  At the time of the accident the defendant was using berth 31 and onlymoved to berth 6 in 2001.  From 1988 to 2001 the defendant was using berth 31.  On the evidence of Ho, the container officer andthe warning notice thereat was already there one year prior to the accident and at the time of the accident.  Yuen, who replacedthe deceased as the shore crane operator after his death, started working at berth 31 on 26 May 2000 and he also saw the containeroffice and the warning notice there. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> There was also a warning notice placed on a piece of canvas near the shore crane.  At the time of the accident it seems that thiswas covered up by another piece of canvas to protect it from rain.  But when the other piece of canvas was removed, the notice wasthere.  Yuen said, and I accept, that he was able to see the notice when the piece of canvas covering it was removed about 2 monthsafter he had been hired by the defendant.  This is also supported by the evidence of Leung.  On the evidence, it can be inferredthat the notice had been placed on the canvas covering the crane and had been there for some time prior to the accident.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> I find that the warning notice was prominently displaced at the container office at the time of and before the accident.  I alsofind that the warning notice was placed on the piece of canvas near the shore crane at some time before the accident.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The deceased having worked there since about 1996 would have seen the warning notice at the container office as well as on the canvasnear the shore crane.  He would have known that he was forbidden to embark on the vessel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Ho also said in evidence that prior to the accident a copy of another notice with the heading âSafety Code on Production and Operationon Wharfâ was displayed at the container office.  This included the following provision :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â 8. No embarkation shall be allowed before a vessel berths safely at the wharf.  No embarkation or disembarkation shall be allowedwithout access boards or gangway ladders after the berthing of the vessel at the wharf, otherwise the offenders shall be liable forall the consequences of accidents arising therefrom.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Ho explained in evidence that embarkation was allowed only under special circumstances with the consent of the master or owner ofthe vessel.  He said that this occurred for instance, when it was necessary to go on board the vessel to take photographs of goodsthat were wet or damaged.  However, this was done with the consent of the master or owner of the vessel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> It was plain, however, from his evidence, which I accept, that a shore crane operator was not required and was not permitted to goon board a vessel.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Suen Guixiong, the younger brother of the deceased, gave evidence that he had been to the wharf about a year prior to the accidenton 25 May 2000 as well as a few days after the accident.  He said that he never saw the container office at the wharf.  His evidencesuggests that the container office was not at the wharf when he went there at the time of the accident and also at about the timeof his visit a year prior to the accident.  I do not believe him. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Ng, the independent witness, was also a shore crane operator.  He operated a shore crane for someone else at the wharf next to thedefendantâs wharf and he had more than 20 years experience.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Ng also said that at the wharf where he worked they were also forbidden from embarking on vessels.  He confirmed that there was noneed for a shore crane operator to board a vessel in the course of his work and he had never done so in his many years experience. This included vessels of a similar size to the vessel.  He had also encountered large vessels similar in size to the vessel in thecourse of his work from time to time.  He confirmed that he relied on signalmen on board vessels to assist him in the loading andunloading of goods.  He also said that if no signalman was around to assist him then he would simply knock off work and this hadhappened to him in the past.  I accept his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The plaintiffâs case is that it was necessary for the deceased to go on board the vessel to check the position of the hatchway. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Ms Lau, for the plaintiffs relied on the evidence given by Kwok at the Coronerâs inquest.  She relied in particular on the transcriptof evidence as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âQ. (by the Coroner) : You said that the deceased was standing at the edge of the vessel and observing. Was he observing the conditionin the hold?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">A.: Correct he was checking the position, checking the position.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Q.: That means as to how to lift the cargo, right?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">A.: Right.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Q.: Very often, the crane operation operating the crane-I mean not only on that day, has to do this very often?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">A.: I have seen (that).There is such a situation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The plaintiffs also relied on the following passage in the transcript of Kwokâs evidence before the Coroner : </p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.Is it very often for a crane operator performing operation at the wharf while doing what wassaid before that is while observing the position, to jump onto the vessel like that, and then jump back to the shore?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">A.: The types of vessel are different while the condition of the wharfâs are also different.  As far as this occasion is concernedit was the first time I saw such a situation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> I would observe that the fact that Kwok may have seen that before does not mean that it happens often.  The question framed by theCoroner was not supported by any evidence to the effect that there was a common practice of shore crane operators standing on vesselsto check the position of the hold.  The evidence of Kwok at the inquest does not support this.  This is also contrary to the evidencebefore me, which I accept, called on behalf of the defendants to the effect that there was no need for the deceased to go on boardthe vessel.  I find that although Kwok may have seen a crane operator before standing on a vessel, this was not a common practiceof shore crane operators.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> I find that the deceased was not required to go on board the vessel in the course of his work as a shore crane operator.  I alsofind that it was not necessary for him to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> It is clear from the evidence of Yuen, Leung and Ng that the deceased was not wearing his sports shoes when he climbed on board thevessel. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Leung gave evidence that he saw the deceased shortly before the accident at the container office and the deceased was wearing slippersand white socks instead of sports shoes.  After the accident when he went to the side of the berth, he saw the slippers floatingin the sea.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Ng also said that when he saw the deceased retrieved from the sea he was wearing white socks.  He had also noticed a pair of slippersfloating in the sea.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Suen Guixiong gave evidence that when he went to collect the deceasedâs belongings after the accident he was not given a pair ofthe deceasedâs sports shoes.  This is contrary to the evidence of Ho, Yuen and Leung, whose evidence I accept, that the deceasedâssports shoes were given to Suen Guixiong when he went to collect the deceasedâs belongings after the accident.  The effect of thisis that the deceased had not worn his sports shoes at the time of the accident.  I do not believe Suen Guixiong.  I believe and acceptthe evidence of Ho, Yuen and Leung.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> I find that the deceased ignored the warning notices which warned him and others not to embark on vessels.    </p>    <p> <a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>   I   also   find that wh  ilst  the vessel was being moored   at the wharf   and the ropes were being fastened, the deceased climbedon board the vessel  .  He stood on the edge of the vessel,   probably to check the position of the hatchway of the vessel beforeloading the stainless steel plates   by means of the shore crane   from the wharf onto the vessel.    At the time he was not wearinghis sports shoes but a pair of slippers and white socks.  I find that wh  ilst   he was   on board the vessel he lost his balanceas there was a strong wave which caused the vessel to shake and he fell into the sea in the gap between the vessel and the wharf.     It was also windy at the time.      He probably hit his head when falling down against a hard object and this resulted in hisdrowning.  </p>    <p> <a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>   It is clear, however, and I so find  ,   that when he fell into the sea he was already on the vessel and not on the wharf.  </p>    <p class="heading"> Was the defendant an occupier of the vessel? </p>    <p> <a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> T  he plaintiffâs case i  s  on the basis that the defendant was in breach of its common duty of care under the <i>Ordinance</i>  .  </p>    <p> <a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> As the deceased was on the vessel when he fell,   it is   n  ecessary for the plaintiff  s     to   first   establish that the defendantwas the occupier of the vessel before any liability can be found against the def  endant  . </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> It is the plaintiffâs case that the defendant was the occupier of both the wharf and the vessel.

On the question of who is an occupier, âthe answer in each case depends on the particular facts ofthe case and especially upon the nature and extent of the occupation and control in fact enjoyed or exercised by the defendants overthe premises.â  Accordingly, an occupier is any person who is in actual occupation for the time being or having possession or physicalcontrol, the degree of which need neither be entire or exclusively his, over the premises concerned or over the fixed or the moveablestructures including such things as vessels, vehicles or aircraft.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> It is also stated at para. 10-09 <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 18 th  Edn that a person is likely to be regarded as an occupier if he has a sufficient degree of control over premises to be ableto ensure their safety, and to appreciate that a failure on his part to use care may result in injury to a person coming on to them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> I accept, as is stated at para. 7-17 <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy</i>, that occupation can be by more than one person in which event each is under a duty of care to a visitor, dependent upon the degreeof control he exercises.  However, the deceased was never invited by the defendant to go on board the vessel.  The deceased was notrequired to go on board the vessel for the purpose of the loading work.  The defendant was not in occupation or control of the vesselat any time.  The defendant did not invite the deceased to board the vessel.  It would not have had the right to do so without theconsent of the master or the owner of the vessel.  On the evidence, it is clear that the defendant did not exercise occupation orcontrol of the vessel.  In my judgment the defendant was not an occupier of the vessel at any time.  The plaintiffs have failed toestablish that the defendant was the occupier of the vessel at the time when the deceased boarded it. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> In the circumstances the defendant cannot be liable for breach of the common duty of care to the deceased under the <i>Ordinance</i>.

The defendantâs conduct may havesatisfied the âbut forâ test, in the sense that without his wrongful conduct the damage would not have occurred.  But this, initself, is not determinative of whether he should be held responsible where other causally relevant events have played a role.  Thus,in the majority of cases where a plea of <i>novus actus</i> succeeds, there will have been a prior finding that the original wrongdoing does indeed satisfy the âbut forâ test of factualcausation.  It is <i>a</i> cause of the damage.  On grounds of equity and policy, the court then proceeds to find that in the light of subsequent events, thedefendant should not be held answerable for consequences beyond his control. A <i>novus actus</i> may take three forms :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)   some natural event independent of any human agency;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ii)  an act (or omission) by a third party;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iii)  the conduct of the claimant himself.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> Whatever its form the <i>novus actus</i> must constitute an event of such impact that it obliterates the wrongdoing of the defendant.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> In <i>Home Office</i><i> v</i><i>.

I do not think that a mere foreseeable possibility is or should be sufficient, for then the interveninghuman action can more properly be regarded as a new cause than a consequence of the original wrongdoing.  But if the interveningaction was likely to happen I do not think that it can matter whether that action was innocent or tortuous or criminal.  Unfortunately,tortuous or criminal action by a third party is often âthe very kind of thingâ which is likely to happen as a result of the wrongfulor careless act of the defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Here, the defendantâs case is that the defendantâs act is going over to the vessel was so unforeseeable that the act should beconsidered as a <i>novus actus interveniens</i>.  I agree.  The fact that Kwok may have seen crane operators going over to a vessel before simply means that it may have happenedbefore.  Yuen and Ng are experienced shore crane operators and they said that they have never seen shore crane operators going onboard a vessel to check the cargo hold.  They have said that it was not necessary for shore crane operators to do so.  I accept theirevidence. </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> I find that it was not reasonably foreseeable that the deceased would go over onto the vessel.
