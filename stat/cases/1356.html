It was formerly known as Semi-Tech Global CompanyLimited. At all material times, its shares were listed on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (âHKSEâ). It was orderedto be wound up in Hong Kong on 23 August 2000 and in Bermuda on 29 September 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The defendant bank, Thai Farmers Bank (âTFBâ), carries on the business of banking in Thailand, Hong Kong, and until 2000, inLondon.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Akai was 43% owned by STC Canada, a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 57% of the shares in Akai was owned by the public.Mr James Ting, was the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) of Akai.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  STC was owned as to 45% by Mr Ting and 55% by the public.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  STC owned 50% of the shares in Singer Company NV (âSinger NVâ) which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the balancebeing owned by the public. Singer NV indirectly owned 48% of Singer Thailand (listed on the stock exchange of Thailand).</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Mr Ting was the chairman, president and CEO of the STC. He was the chairman and a director of Singer NV. At the material time, theCEO and President of Singer NV was Mr Stephen Goodman.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  We are concerned with a loan agreement dated 4 December 1998 (âthe Loan Agreementâ), under which Akai was granted a loan facilityof US$30,000,000 by TFB (âAkai Credit Facilityâ), to be secured by a pledge of 56,000,000 shares in Akai Electric Company Limited(âAkai Electricâ) (listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange) which was 70.8% owned by Akai.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  It is common ground that the Akai Credit Facility was made on the basis that the proceeds would be used to repay a loan of US$30,000,000then owing by Singer NV to TFB. The parties have described the arrangement as a Switch Transaction. The Singer NV loan was securedby 6,000,000 shares in Singer Thailand. Under the terms of the Singer NV loan, the value of the loan should not exceed 70% of themarket value of the pledged shares. By October 1998, the value of the Singer Thailand shares covered only 4.2% of Singer NVâs outstandingdebt to TFB.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 4 December 1998, Akai entered into a Share Pledge Agreement under which 56,000,000 shares of Akai Electric were pledged to TFBas security in respect of the Akai Credit Facility. It was a term of the Akai Credit Facility that the value of the loan would notexceed 70% of the market value of the pledged shares. 5.5 million of Akai Electric shares were released to Akai on 30 June 1999 asa result of a positive movement in the Akai Electric share price.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 13 September 1999, Singer NV filed for Chapter 11. On 6 December 1999, Akai defaulted upon the Akai Credit Facility. An eventof default was declared by TFB on 23 December 1999, and in April and May 2000 TFB exercised its rights under the Share Pledge Agreement,sold the remaining security of 50.5 million shares in Akai Electric, and applied the proceeds of US$20,504,295.38 towards paymentof the amount then outstanding under the Akai Credit Facility. A balance of US$13,243,618.38 remained due and owing to TFB, in respectof which TFB sought to prove in the Akai liquidation.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  By Notice of Adjudication of Proof of Debt dated 16 August 2002, the Hong Kong liquidators notified TFB that its claim against Akaihad been adjudicated to be US$13,243,618.38 in the Hong Kong liquidation of Akai, and by Notice of Adjudication of Proof of Debtdated 16 August 2002, the Bermudian liquidators of Akai notified TFB that its claim against Akai in the Bermudian liquidation hadbeen adjudicated to be US$13,402,457.15. These adjudications have been relied on by TPB in its defence of election.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The present proceedings were commenced on 3 December 2004, one day prior to the expiry of the 6 year period after Mr Ting had executedAkaiâs Loan and Share Pledge Agreements with TFB on 4 December 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In this claim, Akai seeks, inter alia, a declaration that TFB held the Akai Electricâs shares as constructive trustee for Akai,a declaration that the Loan Agreement and the Share Pledge Agreement both dated 4 December 1998 are void, and that TFB is liableto Akai for all benefits and profits received by TFB from Akai pursuant to these agreements, and equitable compensation for breachof trust, including compensation for the loss of use of money and available assets, damages, including damages for loss of use ofmoney and assets.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  After a 20-day trial, Stone J dismissed Akaiâs claim essentially on the basis that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â424. â¦ in entering into the Akai Loan and Share Pledge Agreements on 4 December 1998 that TFB was entitled to rely upon the apparentauthority of Mr Ting, whose course of conduct throughout his dealings with TFB, culminating in Akaiâs entry into these Agreements,unequivocally had represented his ability and authority to bind Akai.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and that upon the defendantâs counterclaim, he granted a declaration that Akaiâs Loan and Share Pledge Agreements on 4 December1998 are valid, subsisting and binding, and further that as at October 2000, Akai was indebted to TFB in the sum of US$13,243,618.38,and that TFB is entitled to a distribution within the liquidation of Akai according to the Notices of Adjudication as filed.</p>    <p class="heading">The Appeal</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  This is Akaiâs appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The background facts were set out by the learned judge in paras. 26 to 147 of his 194-page-judgment.

I will refer to this decision in greater detail in due course. For the present purpose,the following passage from the headnotes suffices:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(2)     That, although a knowing recipient would often be found to have acted dishonestly, dishonesty was not a prerequisite toliability under the knowing receipt head; that in order to be liable for knowing receipt the recipient had to have knowledge thatthe assets received were traceable to a breach of trust or of fiduciary duty, the single test for which was whether the recipientâsstate of knowledge was such as to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr Kosmin put knowing receipt at the forefront of his case. He submitted that the principles applicable to knowing receipt willprovide the answer to Akaiâs claim. Lack of apparent authority is his secondary argument.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Richard Snowden QC, for TFB, submitted that Akai is fundamentally wrong to contend that this case is primarily about knowingreceipt. The key issue is that of authority, namely whether Akai was bound by the agreements by reason of Mr Tingâs actual or apparentauthority.</p>    <p class="heading">Authority was key</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Stone J held that authority was the key issue and determinative of Akaiâs claim.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Stone J said knowing receipt:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â450. â¦ would arise only <i>if</i> â contrary to my earlier finding â TFB cannot hold Akai to the Loan and Share Pledge Agreements by virtue of Mr Tingâs actualor apparent authority: see the analysis of Lord Nicholls in <i>Criterion Properties v.

If the directors of A were acting for an improper purpose whenthey entered into the agreement, Aâs ability to have the agreement set aside depends upon the application of familiar principlesof agency and company law. If, applying these principles, the agreement is found to be valid and is therefore not set aside, questionsof âknowing receiptâ by B do not arise. So far as B is concerned there can be no question of Aâs assets having been misapplied.B acquired the assets from A, the legal and beneficial owner of the assets, under a valid agreement made between him and A. If, however,the agreement is set aside, B will be accountable for any benefits he may have received from A under the agreement. A will have aproprietary claim, if B still has the assets. Additionally, and irrespective of whether B still has the assets in question, A willhave a personal claim against B for unjust enrichment, subject always to a defence of change of position. Bâs personal accountabilitywill not be dependent upon proof of fault or âunconscionableâ conduct on his part. Bâs accountability, in this regard, willbe âstrictââ¦ââ</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Mr Kosmin submitted that the learned judge erred in applying the dictum of Lord Nicholls in <i>Criterion Properties v. Stratford UK Properties</i> as authority for the proposition that knowing receipt did not arise to be determined unless the Switch Transaction was set asideupon the basis on Mr Tingâs want of authority. He submitted that <i>Criterion Properties</i> was concerned with the setting aside of an executory contract in circumstances where there had been no transfer of trust property.It was upon this basis that the question of knowing receipt did not arise for consideration, not upon the basis that the contractwas not liable to be set aside. Mr Kosmin relied on the following passage on the judgment of Lord Scott:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â27. My Lords, I must express my respectful disagreement with the approach both of Hart J and of the Court of Appeal to the criticalissue in this case. This is neither a case of âknowing receiptâ nor one of âknowing assistanceâ. The word âreceiptâ inthe expression âknowing receiptâ refers to the receipt by one person from another of assets. A person who enters into a bindingcontract acquires contractual rights that are created by the contract. There may be a âreceiptâ of assets when the contract iscompleted and the question whether there is âknowing receiptâ may become a relevant question at that stage. But until then thereis simply an executory contract which may or may not be enforceable. The creation by the contract of contractual rights does notconstitute a âreceiptâ of assets in the sense that a âknowing receiptâ involves a receipt of assets. The question whetheran executory contract is enforceable is quite different from the question whether assets of which there has been a âknowing receiptâare recoverable from the recipient. To confuse these two questions is likely to lead, and in the present case has, in my opinion,led, to further confusion. It is fair to say, however, that it appears to me that the courts below dealt with the case on the basison which it was presented to them by counsel. It was indeed presented to your Lordships as being a case to which the principles ofâknowing receiptâ ought to be applied.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  <i>Criterion Properties</i> was concerned with the enforceability of a poison pill agreement [SSA] under which the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (âOaktreeâ) was entitled to have its interests bought out by the claimant in the event of a takeover. Hart J awardedsummary judgment to the claimant and made a declaration that Oaktree was not entitled to enforce the agreement  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20BCLC%20151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 BCLC 151.</a> Originally, both the claimant and Oaktree had launched applications for summary judgment, however the application by Oaktree wasnot pursued because it conceded that the apparent authority point raised a triable issue. The apparent authority point was put onthe basis that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ because the purpose of the (relevant agreement) was an improper one on the part of Criterionâs board, and Oaktree was onnotice of the improper purpose, and thus that the agreement was in excess of the actual and ostensible authority of the members ofCriterionâs board â¦â at 160.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20WLR%202108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 WLR 2108.</a> As appears from the judgment of Carnwath LJ, essentially, on the basis that on the issue:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â28. â¦ whether Oaktree knew sufficient about the motivation of the Criterion board to disable it from relying on that board'sapparent authority to commit Criterion to the contract. â¦â,</p>    </blockquote>    <p>applying <i>Akindele</i> test on knowing receipt, namely, the recipientâs state of knowledge should be such as to make it unconscionable for him to retainthe benefit of the receipt,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â40. â¦ this was not a suitable case for summary judgment. It was not enough that Oaktree had knowledge of the relevant facts.To decide whether to set aside the agreement, under the correct test, it is necessary to consider their actions and knowledge inthe context of the commercial relationship of the parties as a whole. This can only be done at trial.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr Kosmin relied, in particular, on the following words in the passage from the judgment of Lord Scott quoted in para. 25 above:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere may be a receipt of asset when the contract is completed and the question whether there is knowing receipt may be come arelevant question at that stage.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  But, Lord Scott went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â30 This case turns, in my opinion, on the âauthorityâ issue. If Mr. Glaser and Mr. Palmer either had actual authority to concludethe SSA, given by a person or body with power to confer that authority (see <i>British Bank of the Middle East v Sun Life Assurance Co of Canada (UK) Ltd.</i> [1983] 2 Lloydâs Rep 9, and especially Lord Brandon of Oakbrook at p17), or, if they did not have actual authority, had apparentauthority to do so, <i>then I can see no reason why the SSA should not be held enforceable against Criterion</i>. If, on the other hand, Mr. Glaser and Mr. Palmer had neither actual nor apparent authority to conclude the SSA, then the SSA couldnot be held enforceable against Criterion. Mr. Glaser and Mr. Palmer might be liable to Oaktree for breach of warranty of authority,but the SSA would not be Criterion's contract. The conscionability or unconscionability of Oaktree's behaviour in seeking to holdCriterion to the SSA would in either case be irrelevant.â (Emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>But if SSA was enforceable and enforced, I do not understand Lord Scott to say that a claim based on knowing receipt might still bemade against Oaktree.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  I turn to examine Lord Nichollâs judgment more closely. The citation from his judgment quoted in para. 24 above was part of para.4 and was preceded by the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2. As explained by Lord Scott, the issues arising on this application for summary judgment were clouded in the courts below bya faulty elision of two different issues to which different principles apply. The only relevant issue on this application is whetherthe second supplementary agreement was a valid and binding agreement. It is accepted by Criterion, for the purposes of this application,that Oaktree's directors acted honestly. Thus this issue of validity turns solely on whether the directors who signed the agreementon behalf of Criterion did so within the actual or apparent scope of their authority.

Unfortunately, in the courts below this 'want of authority' issue was approached on the basis that the outcome turned on whetherOaktree's conduct was unconscionable.

For this purpose, the rest of the headnotes is produced below:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe claimants were the liquidators of two Cayman Islands companies, both controlled by the same holding company, licensed to carryon the business of banking. In 1985 employees of the first company, acting in fraudulent breach of their fiduciary duties to theiremployers, procured the second company, then in financial difficulties, to enter into an artificial, but legally binding, agreementwith the defendant, a prominent Nigerian businessman, for the purpose of giving a false impression that certain dummy loans wereperforming normally. Pursuant to the agreement US$10m was paid by the defendant to the second company in exchange for 250,000 sharesin the holding company and on terms that after two years the second company would arrange for their sale at a price that would givethe defendant a 15% annual return on his investment. Under the terms of a divestiture agreement in 1988 the shares were sold andafter internal arrangements were made between the companies the defendant received payment of some US$16.679m. The claimants contendedthat the defendant was liable to account to them for US$6.679m as a constructive trustee on the basis that he had knowingly assistedthe breaches of duty or had received the divestiture payment with knowledge of the breaches. The judge dismissed the action on theground that dishonesty by the defendant was the essential foundation of the claimants' case whether under the head of knowing assistanceor of knowing receipt and that that had not been established by the claimants.</p>        <p class="quote">On appeal by the claimants-</p>        <p class="quote">Held, dismissing the appeal, (1) that on his primary findings of fact the judge had been entitled to conclude that the defendant hadacted honestly in entering into the 1985 agreement; and that, accordingly, the claimants' case that the defendant had knowingly assistedthe breaches of trust had been bound to fail.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In <i>Akindele</i>, the court was concerned with agreements which had been performed.

I believe it is implicit in LordNichollsâ judgment that âwant of authorityâ should have been determined upon an application of ordinary agency principles,and that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf applying these principles, the agreement is found to be valid and is therefore not set aside, questions of âknowing receiptâby (Oaktree) do not arise.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Lord Nichollsâ judgment supports the view taken by Stone J that if the underlying contract was enforceable on the applicationof familiar principles of agency and company law, questions of âknowing receiptâ would not arise because so far as the recipientis concerned there can be no question of the claimantâs assets having been misapplied. Lord Nicholls said in his judgment, thathe agreed with Lord Scott and that for the reasons Lord Scott gave, he would dismiss the appeal. It is clear that Lord Nicholls didnot regard the judgment of Lord Scott as being in any way inconsistent with his view. Lord Walker agreed with the judgments of bothLord Nicholls and Lord Scott.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Thus, <i>Akindele</i> could have been decided on the basis that the agreements were entered into with the apparent authority of BCCI and since the defendanthad acted honestly the agreements were enforceable against BCCI, such that there was no question of BCCIâs assets having been misapplied.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  So, with respect, I agree with Stone J that the claim based on knowing receipt cannot arise if TFB could:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â450. â¦ hold Akai to the Loan and Share Pledge Agreements by virtue of Mr Tingâs actual or apparent authority â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However, if Mr Ting had neither actual nor apparent authority such that those agreements are liable to be set aside, TFB:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ will be accountable for any benefits (it) may have received from (Akai) under (those agreements). â¦â per Lord Nichollsin <i>Criterion Properties</i> at [4].</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Stone J went on to hold:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)     in entering into the Switch Transaction Mr Ting acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to Akai (para. 324).</p>        <p class="quote">(2)     thus Mr Ting did not have either actual or implied actual authority to bind Akai (para. 351).</p>        <p class="quote">(3)     that Mr Ting had apparent or ostensible authority to enter into the Switch Transaction, it seems:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â384. â¦ by reason of the usual authority attaching to the position which he held, namely that of Executive Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer, and that such usual authority was confirmed by the fact that Akai invariably had permitted Mr Ting to enter intoall manner of financing agreements on its behalf.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)     that there was nothing:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â401. â¦ of substance occurring <i>at the time</i> which should have placed the Bank âon inquiryâ, far less is there any evidence of <i>actual</i> knowledge on the part of the Bank either as to any breach of fiduciary duty on the part of Mr Ting, or in terms of any want of authorityon his part to do as he did, and to execute the Akai Loan and Share Pledge Agreements on 4 December 1998.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)     In case he was wrong on his conclusion, he held</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i)     on knowing receipt / restitution, following <i>BCCI v.

However, the grant of actual authority is impliedly subject to a condition that it is to be exercised honestly and on behalfof the principal.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Stone J described the circumstances under which the Loan and Share Pledge Agreements were signed by Mr Ting on behalf of Akai:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â96. Miss Wattanakul (of TFB) was instructed by her superior to obtain evidence of the authority of the person who was to sign theagreements on behalf of Akai, and when, in early December 1998, Miss Wattanakul telephoned a Mr Pipat Bhadranavikat the Hong Kongbranch of the Bank, and requested that he arrange for the signing of the documentation by Akai.â</p>        <p class="quote">â97. She also liaised with Mr Domine Ko of Akai and requested a date and time for Akai to execute the Loan Agreement and the SharePledge Agreement, in response to which Mr Ko told Miss Wattanakul that Mr Ting would be signing the agreements on behalf of Akai;in turn, Miss Wattanakul asked Mr Ko to provide evidence at the meeting confirming Mr Tingâs authority, and thereafter told MrBhadranavik in the Bankâs Hong Kong office that Mr Ting would be signing on behalf of Akai, and that evidence of his authorityso to do should be obtained.â</p>        <p class="quote">â98. On 4 December 1998 Mr Bhadranavik attended at Akaiâs office in Hong Kong and was met by Mr Ting, Ms Clara Loh and Mr DomineKo of Akai.</p>        <p class="quote">99. Mr Bhadranavik was handed Minutes of an Executive Committee meeting of Akai of 4 December 1998 signed by Mr Ting as Chairman,which stated that he had authority to enter into the Loan Agreement and the Share Pledge Agreement on behalf of Akai.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The minutes showed that present at the meeting of the executive committee on 4 December 1998 were Mr James Ting, Ms Clara Loh, DrFrank Edward Holmes (by phone), and Mr Chuck Tam (by phone). It purported to show as resolved:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt was resolved that the Loan Agreement and the Pledge (the âAgreementsâ) be accepted and approved and that any one of theDirectors be authorised to approve any changes made to the Agreements prior to their execution and to execute, under hand or seal,and deliver the Agreements, and any other documents which may, from time to time, necessary for the Loan on behalf of the Company.</p>        <p class="quote">It was also resolved that the Loan be operated as follows:</p>        <p class="quote">Mr. James H.

Paragraph 48 of the Re-Amended Points of Defence and Counterclaim stated that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt was the normal practice of TFB to require evidence of authority from its borrower before entering into a facility pursuant tothis practice. (TFB) received the minutes of Akaiâs Executive Committee meeting dated 4 December 1998 before the Loan Agreementand Share Pledge Agreement were executed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Dr Holmes gave evidence at trial. He denied that he had attended the meeting of the executive committee by telephone. His denialwas accepted by the learned judge. The learned judge found:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â355. â¦ the overwhelming probability in the circumstances â and I now so find â was that Mr Ting, the dominant force withinAkai who apparently trucked no dissent, simply had this Minute made up, no doubt with the co-operation of his close associate andco-director within Akai, Ms Clara Loh, in order to suit the immediate purpose at hand, which was to comply with TFBâs request forsome form of âevidenceâ as to his authority to sign the Loan Agreement and the Share Pledge Agreement on behalf of Akai.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  He also said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â356. â¦ had it been necessary so to find I should have been driven to the conclusion that these âMinutesâ were false and ofno effect.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  On the basis of such finding, it is clear that Mr Ting did not have express actual authority. TFBâs case on implied actual authorityis that Mr Ting was the executive chairman and CEO of Akai, and as such must be regarded as having implied actual authority to signthose agreements on behalf of Akai. There is no dispute that if Mr Ting had been acting in breach of his fiduciary duty to Akai,the case on actual authority or implied actual authority must fail.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of Fiduciary Duty</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I turn to deal with the learned judgeâs finding that Mr Ting had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties. In this context it isessential to bear mind the words of Millett LJ (as he then was) in <i>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20Ch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] Ch 1</a> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ not every breach of duty by a fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty. â¦</p>        <p class="quote">It is similarly inappropriate to apply the expression to the obligation of a trustee or other fiduciary to use proper skill and carein the discharge of his duties.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  <i>Bristol and West Building Society</i> was concerned with a claim brought against the defendant solicitor who acted for a husband and wife in the purchase of a house andalso the plaintiff who financed the purchase in return for a mortgage. The solicitor was sued, inter alia, for breach of trust. Theplaintiff instructed the solicitor to report, prior to completion, any proposal that the purchasers might create a second mortgageor otherwise borrow in order to finance part of the purchase price. The solicitor knew that the purchases were arranging for an existingbank debt of Â£3,350 to be secured by a second charge on the new property but, due to an oversight, he stated in his report to theplaintiff that the balance of the purchase price was being provided by the purchasers without resort to further borrowing. When thepurchasers defaulted on their mortgage repayments the plaintiff enforced its security and the house was sold at a loss. The plaintiffought to recover the whole of its loss from the transaction, from the solicitor, alleging, breach of contract, negligence and breachof trust.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The headnotes read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(2) That the solicitorâs conduct in providing the plaintiff with the wrong information, although a breach of duty, was neitherdishonest nor intentional but due to an oversight and was unconnected to the fact that he was also acting for the purchasers; that,accordingly, his conduct and subsequent application of the money advanced by the plaintiff to complete the purchase was not a breachof trust or fiduciary duty; and that the order for damages for breach of trust would therefore be set aside.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Millett LJ said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe expression âfiduciary dutyâ is properly confined to those duties which are peculiar to fiduciaries and the breach of whichattracts legal consequences differing from those consequent upon the breach of other duties.â At page 16.</p>        <p class="quote">âThe nature of the obligation determines the nature of the breach.

Mr Snowden reliedon the following dictum of Pennycuick J in <i>Charterbridge Corporation Ltd v Lloyds</i> <i>Bank Ltd &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20Ch%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] Ch 62</a> at 74.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThat is sufficient to dispose of the action; but in case I am wrong on my view of the law, I must proceed to express a conclusionupon the contention that in creating the guarantee and legal charge, the directors were not acting with a view to the benefit ofCastleford. That is a question of fact, and the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff company. As I have already found, the directorsof Castleford looked to the benefit of the group as a whole and did not give separate consideration to the benefit of Castleford.Mr Goulding contended that in the absence of separate consideration, they must, ipso facto, be treated as not having acted with aview to the benefit of Castleford. That is, I think, an unduly stringent test and would lead to really absurd results, i.e., unlessthe directors of a company addressed their minds specifically to the interest of the company in connection with each particular transaction,that transaction would be ultra vires and void, notwithstanding that the transaction might be beneficial to the company. Mr Bagnallfor the bank contended that it is sufficient that the directors of Castleford looked to the benefit of the group as a whole. EquallyI reject that contention. Each company in the group is a separate legal entity and the directors of a particular company are notentitled to sacrifice the interest of that company. This becomes apparent when one considers the case where the particular companyhas separate creditors. The proper test, I think, in the absence of actual separate consideration, must be whether an intelligentand honest man in the position of a director of the company concerned, could, in the whole of the existing circumstances, have reasonablybelieved that the transactions were for the benefit of the company.

Where a caseof breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the directors is raised upon the ground that they have acted otherwise than for thebenefit of the company it will be necessary for the court to determine, as a factual issue, whether the directors did exercise theirpowers for the benefit of the company. This is a straightforward question of fact which can, in most cases, be answered in the affirmativeor negative.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Thus, when particular companies form part of a group of companies,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ a transaction carried out for the benefit of one of the companies in the group, company A, may be seen to be for the benefitof another company in the group, company B.â</p>        <p class="quote">âA particular difficulty arises when the directors of the particular company enter into the transaction on behalf of that companybecause they consider that the transaction is of benefit to the group as a whole and do not give separate consideration to the benefitof their company.

They continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAccordingly there seems to us to be difficulties in substituting an objective test (How would an intelligent and honest man haveacted?) for the factual question raised in the proceedings. It may be that if a director bluntly states that he or she did not considerthe interests of the particular company at all and solely had regard to the interests of the group then difficulties would arisein resolving that factual question (sic). But the position will rarely be such a black and white one and it would usually be possibleto discern whether in deciding to take certain action for the benefit of the group the directors perceived, and were justified intheir perception, that in so doing they were acting for the benefit of the particular company. On the other hand it may be possibleto discern that the directors embarked on a course to support the group unconcerned about the detrimental effect of the action onthe particular company or were prepared to sacrifice that company for the good of the other companies in the group. A careful analysisof the factual situation will usually reveal the answer to the factual question posed although no doubt on some occasions the problemmay very well be a difficult one.</p>        <p class="quote">We are mindful of the fact that Pennycuick J was not substituting the objective test for the subjective one which had traditionallybeen applied. In his view the occasion to apply the objective test only arose when it was clear that the directors had not consideredthe interests of the relevant company at all. In a sense he proposed a legal test to be applied only in limited cases to avoid whathe regarded as an absurd situation.</p>        <p class="quote">Nonetheless we have reservations about this means of resolving those difficulties. A preferable view may be that where the directorshave failed to consider the interests of the relevant company they should be found to have committed a breach of duty. If, however,the transaction was, objectively viewed, in the interests of the company, then no consequences would flow from that breach. Suchan inquiry would not require the court to consider how the hypothetical honest and intelligent director would have acted. On thecontrary, it would accept the finding of breach of duty flows from the failure to consider the interests of the company and wouldthen direct attention at the consequences of the breach. However, the approach adopted by the parties in this case both before GilesJ and this court requires that the <i>Charterbridge</i> test be applied and absolves the court from further considering this tantalizing question.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  It is clear from the discussion in <i>Equiticorp</i> that the <i>Charterbridge</i> test is limited in its application. That accords with the actual decision in <i>Charterbridge</i>. Pennycuick J said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTo avoid any possible misunderstanding, these findings do not, of course, imply that either Mr Pomeroy or the bank officers believedthat the transactions were prejudicial to Castleford. â¦</p>        <p class="quote">All these witnesses deposed that in their view today the transaction were in the interest of Castleford for reasons which they gave.â67H.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Bearing in mind that a breach of fiduciary duty connotes disloyalty and infidelity, I am unable to accept the tentative view expressedin <i>Equiticorp</i> that mere failure to consider the separate interest of the relevant company, for example, due to incompetence, would, ipso facto,amount to a breach of fiduciary duty. It is unnecessary for me to consider whether the breach of duty identified by Pennycuick Jis a breach of fiduciary duty or a breach of a duty to use proper skill and care.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Mr Snowdenâs reliance on <i>Charterbridge</i> is predicated on a finding that the only complaint against Mr Ting is that he had looked to the benefit to the Group as a whole anddid not give separate consideration to the benefit of Akai. But that was not the only complaint against Mr Ting. Indeed, as Mr Kosminsubmitted, Stone J had found that the entry into the Switch Transaction was in blatant disregard of the interests of Akai and itscreditors and/or shareholders [342]; it was âunarguableâ that imposing upon Akai the substantial debt burden of Singer NV, whichAkai had no obligation whatever to assume, and encumbering Akaiâs highly valuable Akai Electric shares as collateral was to thefinancial detriment of Akai and could only be reflective of a failure to consider the interests of Akai qua Akai [329; 333; 334],it was âabsurdâ to suggest that objectively it was in the interest of Akai to take up a debt of US$30 million from Singer NV,nor was there any evidence of how the US$30 million was to be repaid by Singer NV. It was wrong for there to have been any equationbetween the interests of Akai on the one hand and those of Singer NV on the other, merely by reason of the existence of a commonshareholder [337-339]. Thus, this is not a case where the <i>Charterbridge</i> test is relevant at all.  </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Mr Snowden referred to [268], [328], [331] and [332] and submitted that the learned judge had reached a conclusion as to Mr Tingâsconduct which was influenced by his perceptions of Mr Tingâs general reputation and behaviour, gathered from other proceedingsconcerning Akai, none of which had anything to do with the bank, and which related either to unproven allegations, not forming partof the evidence in a case or misconduct of an entirely different type to that in issue in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  I need only refer to [268] and [322]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â268. I bear this admonition in mind when considering the evidence before me, and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, althoughin principle I see no reason to lean over backwards to give Mr Ting the benefit of the doubt, not least since this territoryâshighest court, whilst unanimously upholding Mr Tingâs appeal and in refusing to order a retrial upon two counts of false accountingupon which Mr Ting originally had been convicted, nevertheless saw fit to observe (at paragraph 52 in the speech of Lord Woolf NPJ)that it was important to bear in mind that âthe appellant â¦ has â¦ properly been found by a jury to have acted with dishonesty,notwithstanding that his convictions have been set aside â¦â : see <i>Ting James Henry v.

In my view, therefore, speculative inference of what <i>could</i> have been in Mr Tingâs mind â and it must not be forgotten that this is a man whose part in the ultimate asset-stripping of Akaiachieved breathtaking proportions â does not suffice to discharge the evidential burden which is on the defendant as a result ofthe undisputed actions of Mr Ting which, when taken at face value, raise a strong <i>prima facie</i> case of breach of fiduciary duty.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  With respect to the learned judge, the references to the criminal proceedings against Mr Ting and any part which he might have playedin the asset-stripping of Akai are unhelpful. They cannot form a proper basis for the evaluation of the evidence relating to Mr Tingâsbona fides in the present case. Even so, on the evidence, I believe the learned judgesâ findings outlined in para. 65 above areperfectly justified.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  I have earlier referred to the learned judgeâs finding that the minute of the executive committee was forged. I agree with MrKosminâs submission that Mr Tingâs creation of a false and fraudulent minute purporting to authorize his conduct was clearlydishonest. An honest director would have brought the matter to the attention of the board for proper determination by the board.This never happened.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Akai was listed on the HKSE. It is not disputed that under the listing rules of the HKSE, the Switch Transaction would have beenregarded as a connected transaction because Akai and Singer NV were connected persons. Under rule 14.23(2), all connected transactionswere required to be disclosed to the HKSE. The HKSE would then determine what further disclosure and shareholders approval to requirein relation to the transaction. The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â335. â¦ had (HKSE) been so informed, at the very least a public announcement would have been required.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Indeed, I would go further. Rule 14.23(2) provided that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ where a waiver is given from the requirement to obtain shareholdersâ approval the Exchange may require a letter from theissuerâs auditors or a financial adviser acceptable to the Exchange stating that in their opinion the transaction is fair and reasonablefar as the shareholders of the company are concerned â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  I am of the view it is likely that HKSE would have required at least such an opinion given the amount involved and the Asian FinancialCrisis. Indeed, more likely than not, HKSE would have required shareholdersâ approval. Thus, if the matter had been reported toHKSE, not only would the outcome be uncertain, it probably would have taken substantial time, and the agreements would not have beensigned on 4 December 1998. The longer the delay, the more uncertain the outcome - It will be recalled that although Singer NV hadbeen relieved of the TFB debt, it filed for Chapter 11 on 13 September 1999. I also note that earlier on 30 October 1998, Moody haddowngraded, with a negative rating outlook, Singer NVâs $150 million 7% senior notes rated Ba to B3 and downgraded its parent,STC(âs) $654 million face value 11.5% of senior secured discount notes from B2 to Ca with a statement that Semi-Techâs:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ ratings reflect the risks associated with the vast deterioration of the holding companyâs portfolio of companies, which includeSinger, Pfaff, and Semi-Tech Global (Akai). All of which have been impacted by the weakening economies of Southeast Asia and Japan.âDow Jones News 10-30-98 7/84</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Regarding the earlier, albeit, more substantial transaction, the âPfaff transactionâ, the learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â340. In contrast to the relatively âinformalâ entry by Akai into the Akai Credit Facility, Mr Kosmin sought to compare, withinthe context of the âPfaff transactionâ, the elaborate steps then taken by the Board of Akai to ensure that because of the apparentconflict resulting from the fact that Singer was an affiliate of STC Canada, which itself was a substantial shareholder of Akai,that none of the âinterestedâ directors who were on the boards of both companies participated in that decision; in particular,noted Mr Kosmin, Mr Ting had not participated by reason of his position as Chairman of STC Canada and Singer, and because of hissubstantial equity interest in STC Canada (and thus, indirectly, of Singer), and that instead Akai had established an independentBoard committee to take financial advice from an independent financial adviser, together with the fact that the Hong Kong Stock Exchangehad required that the matter be decided by the shareholders of Akai. Whilst obviously not directly in issue, this submission is notunpersuasive.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Had Mr Ting brought the matter to the consideration of the executive committee or the board, I see no reason to believe that DrHolmes or Mr Tam would not have required that the transaction be referred to the board or that the board would not have requireddisclosure to HKSE.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  The creation of a forged minute and the failure to report the Switch Transaction to the HKSE are strong reasons to support the conclusionthat Mr Ting had acted in breach of his fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  I am satisfied that Mr Ting was in breach of his fiduciary duty such that TFB cannot rely on his actual implied authority.</p>    <p class="heading">Apparent / Ostensible Authority</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Reliance on apparent authority was introduced by amendment made on 4 December 2007.

It often coincides with actual authority.Thus, when the board appoint one of their number to be managing director, they invest him not only with implied authority, but alsowith ostensible authority to do all such things as fall within the usual scope of that office. Other people who see him acting asmanaging director are entitled to assume that he has the usual authority of a managing director. But sometimes ostensible authorityexceeds actual authority. â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Stone J said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â361.

Such ârepresentationâ or âmanifestationâ can be of a general nature, and, as Mr Snowden emphasized, can arise only fromthe principal putting the agent in a specific position which carries with it the usual authority to enter into the transaction ofthe type in question. In this context, the <i>locus classicus</i> in the English common law as to such representation is contained in the speech of Lord Diplock in the leading decision in <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer v.

The making of such representationis itself an act of management of the companyâs business. Prima facie it falls within the âactualâ authority of the board ofdirectors, and unless the memorandum or articles of the company either make such a contract ultra vires the company or prohibit thedelegation of such authority to the agent, the company is estopped from denying to anyone who has entered into a contract with theagent in reliance upon such âapparentâ authority that the agent had authority to contract on behalf of the company.ââ</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  In <i>Armagas Ltd. v Mundogas S.A.

It does not indicate that the Bank placedno reliance on the appearance of Mr. Tingâs authority. The question of what the Bank relied upon is a question of fact that involveda careful appreciation of the evidence given at trial.

Mr Kosmin pressed this point, but in my view such conclusion does not necessarily arise. If anything I should have thought thatthe nature of the brief (and much criticised) Executive Committee Minute as was produced on 4 December 1998 â and as was faxedto TFB by Mr Niasinn of the Bankâs Hong Kong branch â serves to inform the apparent authority argument, and buttresses the contentionthat to all intents and purposes the Bank regarded this Minute as an entirely natural development within the overall scheme of thingsas then perceived by TFB, and reflected the position wherein Mr Ting was, and indeed throughout had been recognized by the Bank as,the dominant and wholly authoritative force within and behind the operation of Akai.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  With respect,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)     The apparent authority sought to be relied on is the apparent authority of Mr Ting as chairman and CEO of Akai.

Stone J incorrectly treated Mr Ting's prior âcourse of conduct throughout his dealings with TFBâ (which was a course ofdealing in his capacity as a director of Singer NV) as a representation concerning his authority to bind Akai [424]. A representationby an agent as to his authority is insufficient to establish apparent authority; the representation must come from the principalor a person with actual authority to enter into the transaction or one of the same kind - in this case, the Board of Akai. Therewas no prior banking relationship between TFB and Akai.

I am prepared to accept that Mr Ting had similar authority regardingAkai. Mr Kosmin submitted that this was not simply a loan to Akai secured by a pledge of Akai Electric shares, but that the proceedsof these loans would be used to repay Singer NVâs indebtedness to TFB, and there is no evidence that Singer NV or Akai had everheld out Mr Ting as having authority to enter into such transactions. Even so, <i>Hely-Hutchinson</i> supports the view that a person in the position of Mr Ting might have apparent or implied actual authority to enter into a transactionsuch as the Switch Transaction. In <i>Hely-Hutchinson</i>, the judgment at first instance of Roskill J turned on apparent authority, however on appeal the decision turned on implied actualauthority, because the question arose:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ between the principal and the agent - either of them claiming against the other - actual authority must be proved.â Per LordPearson at 593G.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  However, since I have come to the conclusion that TFB had not relied on Mr Tingâs position in Akai the question of representationis academic. In any event, it is fact sensitive and cannot easily be separated from the question of reliance. Absent reliance, itis artificial to âfindâ what representation might have operated on the mind of TFB, and whether such representation, had it beenrelied on, would be sufficient.</p>    <p class="heading">Put on Enquiry</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  The same is true regarding whether TFB was put on enquiry. Since it was TFBâs normal practice to require evidence of authorityand that the normal practice was followed in this case, it is artificial to enquire whether TFB was put on enquiry. What better evidencethat TFB was not satisfied with relying on Mr Tingâs apparent authority than that it asked for evidence of actual authority? Withrespect, I cannot agree with Stone J:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â425. â¦ âthe thought never had crossed anyoneâs mindâ at TFB that Mr Ting in fact had possessed no authority so to bindAkai, â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The fact that TFB required evidence of actual authority shows that TFB did enquire.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Anyway, I will consider briefly Mr Kosminâs submission that TFB could not rely on Mr Tingâs apparent authority because it hadbeen put on enquiry. In this context, it must be noted that we are not concerned only with the Loan Agreement and the Share PledgeAgreement.

It is important to note that we are concerned here with the apparent authority of Mr Ting, andthe issue is whether TFB was put on enquiry regarding Mr Tingâs authority. As will be seen, some of the authorities referred toare concerned with the circumstances under which a bank might be put on enquiry regarding whether a transaction was in the interestof the company. Whilst such authorities might illustrate how one might be put on enquiry, it is important to bear in mind that thecircumstances under which a bank might be put on enquiry regarding the authority of, for example, a managing director, are likelyto be different from the circumstances under which a bank might be put on enquiry regarding whether a transaction is in the interestof the company.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  Stone J correctly pointed out whether a person has been put on enquiry is fact sensitive.

Factors such as the standing of the corporate customer, thebankâs knowledge of the signatory, the amount involved, the need for a prompt transfer, the presence of unusual features, and thescope and means for making reasonable inquiries may be relevant. But there is one particular factor which will often be decisive.That is the consideration that in the absence of telling indications to the contrary, a banker will usually approach a suggestionthat a director of a corporate customer is trying to defraud the company with an initial reaction of instinctive disbelief.

There <i>Nippon Credit</i> was not relying on the apparent authority of an individual. <i>Nippon Credit</i> relied on a board resolution which stated that the transaction was in the interests of Maronis. Bryson J said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[427] In any view it is very unlikely that a reasonable person or any person in Nippon Creditâs position would have questionedthis resolution and what it conveyed, and if such a person had known, as was the fact (although it was not easy to ascertain) thatall directors of Maronis had joined in the resolution, it is in my view impossible to suppose that it would have been questioned.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Here, the question, is given the size and nature of the Switch Transaction, should TFB have enquired into Mr Tingâs authority.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  Both Akai and Singer NV were listed companies with substantial (in the case of Akai, a majority of public shareholders). They wereneither subsidiaries nor affiliates of one another. The amount of the loan was US$30 million and the security provided had a marketvalue in excess of US$40 million. The transaction took place during the Asian Financial Crisis, which was a time of great economicstress. The proceeds of the loan were to be used to repay the indebtedness of a company, which TFB was aware:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â80. â¦ was experiencing significant cash-flow problemsâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  Another relevant background is TFBâs normal practice of requiring evidence of authority to enter into such transactions. Thus,one would not expect departure from the normal practice and reliance on the apparent authority of an individual without good reason.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  In my opinion these facts would have caused a reasonable banker to refuse to enter into the Switch Transaction without further enquiryon Mr Tingâs authority.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  Of course, once enquiry was made, there could be no reliance on apparent authority. TFB would be relying on actual authority.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  The learned judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â400. It should not be overlooked, as the history of the Singer Credit Facility serves to illustrate, that TFB had been dealingwith Akai and Mr Ting, wearing one or other of his various commercial hats, for a number of years, and was well used to the omnipotentmanner in which he operated in the conduct of all his business affairs, including the operation of Akai.</p>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">407. In the present case, of course, Mr Ting was Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Akai, and, as the evidence ofall the Bank witnesses indicated, universally was understood by officers of the Bank at all levels to be âthe bossâ who was runningAkai.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  These statements require some consideration. Accepting that Mr Ting was</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â407. â¦ âthe bossâ who was running Akai.â,</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â400. â¦ the omnipotent manner in which he operated in the conduct of all his business affairs, â¦â,</p>    </blockquote>    <p>there is, however, no evidence that TFB had ever entered into a Switch Transaction with any of âMr. Tingâs companiesâ on thebasis of his apparent authority. The available documentary evidence shows otherwise e.g. in relation to Singer Sewing Machine Companyâspledge of 5,460,000 Singer Thailandâs shares as security for the credit facility extended by TFB to (Akai) that there was a resolutionof the shareholders to make the pledge and to authorize Mr Ting to execute the share pledge agreement. Indeed, having regard to TFBâsnormal practice, there is no reason to believe that other loan agreements or share pledge agreements would not have been supportedby resolutions of shareholders or board of directors of the relevant company. This is not a case where TFB could point to other loanor share pledge agreements which had been entered into on the strength of the apparent authority of Mr Ting.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  So, in my opinion, TFB, not only did not, it could not rely on the apparent authority of Mr Ting.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  In case I am wrong, I will proceed to consider whether TFB was also put on enquiry whether the Switch Transaction was in the interestof Akai. The background facts have been helpfully stated in [23] to [94] of the judgment, some of which have been repeated in paras.3 to 10 above.

In the past, The Singer Company N.V. had Short-Term Revolving Line in the amount of USD 30millions with the Bank with Singer Thailand shares pledged as collateral. Thereafter, the value of such collateral had significantlydropped and could cover only 4.2% of the credit line. As a result, to reduce the Bankâs risk, a change of borrower from The SingerCompany N.V. to Semi-Tech (Global) Company Limited, a company in the same group with more stable financial status had been wished,together with changing collateral from pledging Singer Thailand shares to pledging Akai Electric Company Limited shares, which couldcover the entire credit line. A condition of this borrowing was to repay the Short-Term Revolving Line in the amount of USD30 Millionsof The Singer Company N.V., and adjusting the interest rate from LIBOR + 2.25% to LIBOR + 4.5%, thus proposing to the Meeting forconsideration. Since P/N in the amount of USD 30 Million of The Singer Company N.V. would expire on 6 October 1998, but it was inthe process of changing borrower and collateral, Khun Siripong Kallayanaruj, Deputy Vice President, on 1 October 1998, approved extensionof such P/N for another 30 days, which would be due on 6 November 1998, with the interest at LIBOR + 4.5%, details of which appearedin the documents circulated to all committees. Therefore it was proposed to the Meeting for ratification.</p>            <p class="quote">The Meeting acknowledged and ratified the approval of extension of repayment of P/N in the amount of USD 30 Million for another 30days, which would [be] due on 6 November 1998, with the interest at LIBOR + 4.5%, and approved the change of borrower from The SingerCompany N.V. to Semi-Tech (Global) Company Limited, together with changing collateral from pledging Singer Thailand Shares to pledgingAkai Electric Company Limited shares, with a condition to apply the money to repay the Short-Term Revolving Line in the amount ofUSD 30 Millions of The Singer Company N.V., and adjusting the interest rate from LIBOR + 2.25% to LIBOR + 4.5% as proposed.ââ</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>(2) Stone Jâs finding that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â69.

It follows, therefore, that I do not accept that the matters variously canvassed by Mr Kosmin as serving to place TFB âoninquiryâ â namely, the repayment and drawdown of the Singer facility in 1997/98, the knowledge of the Bank of the deterioratingfinancial position of Singer and Singer Thailand, the âunusual featuresâ of the transaction, the position of Mr Ting in relationto STC Canada, Akai and Singer, and the terms of Akai Bye-Laws and the Executive Committee Minute of 4 December 1998 â in the circumstancesnecessarily should have served, or did so serve, to stimulate suspicion on the part of the Bank, whether taken individually or cumulatively,either as to the propriety of the Agreements made with the Bank, or as to the authority of Mr Ting so to act.</p>        <p class="quote">413. In my judgment this was a hard-nosed commercial transaction on the part of TFB, albeit one that took place between Bank and borrowerat the time of, and in the somewhat fevered and financially fetid atmosphere of the âAsian financial crisisâ. It may even havebeen a transaction regarded by some within the Bank, to use an expression much favoured by Mr Kosmin throughout this case, as âasmall miracleâ, in the sense that a potentially problematic debtor (Singer) was being directly and immediately replaced, togetherwith appropriate security, by a company which appeared to rest on a sounder financial footing, but I do not regard this as the âcosyâor illegitimate arrangement which the plaintiff now seeks to portray; to the contrary, the Bank clearly went out of its way to obtainits commercial pound of flesh with the substantial increase in the applicable interest rate to LIBOR + 4.5%.</p>        <p class="quote">414. I further reject the supposition, which has infused the plaintiffâs argument throughout this case, to the effect that at alltimes the defendant Bank well knew that a âfast oneâ was being perpetrated by Mr Ting by means of the substitution of Akai forSinger, via entry into the Akai Loan and Share Pledge Agreements, but nevertheless, in the dire surrounding circumstances of thefinancial crisis then engulfing the Thai banks, that TFB had decided, in effect, to âgrab the money and runâ, and to worry aboutany adverse consequences if and when they transpired.</p>        <p class="quote">415. True it is that I have taken the view (and have so found) that this transaction between TFB and Akai must have been canvassedor discussed, at the least in principle, between Mr Ting of Akai and Mr Banyong Lamsam, Chairman of TFB, but, as earlier observed,this fact is not necessarily destructive of the Bankâs resistance to the plaintiffâs claim, nor does it mean that the arrangementas was entered into between the Bank and Akai necessarily merited the âsoft loanâ epithet which Mr Kosmin so skilfully deployedduring cross-examination and submission.</p>        <p class="quote">416. I repeat that in so far as the Bank was concerned this was an admittedly advantageous commercial transaction which attractedhigh rates of interest, but in my judgment, and absent any knowledge of Mr Tingâs lack of authority (which I have found the Bankdid <i>not</i> possess), TFB was perfectly entitled to look after its own commercial interests, and to assume that Akai/Mr Ting were looking aftertheirsâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  I have already commented on the learned judgeâs view that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â391. â¦ the bar for being placed âon inquiryâ clearly is placed at a high level,â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and his reliance on the dictum of Bryan J in <i>Maronis</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  The learned judge was also of the view that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â416. â¦ TFB was perfectly entitled to look after its own commercial interests, and to assume that Akai/Mr Ting were looking aftertheirsâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  But as Mason CJ said in the passage of his judgment in <i>Northside</i> quoted in para. 114 above (which I think also applies to reliance on apparent authority):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ an over-extensive application of the (<i>Turquand</i> rule) may facilitate the commission of fraud and unjustly favour those who deal with companies at the expense of innocent creditorsand shareholders â¦â. at page 164.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  Regarding the circumstances in which the nature of the transaction might be put on enquiry, Mason CJ went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ Agency principles aside, to hold that a person dealing with a company is put upon inquiry when that company enters into a transactionwhich appears to be unrelated to the purposes of its business and from which it appears to gain no benefit is, in my opinion, tostrike a fair balance between the competing interests. Indeed, there is much to be said for the view that the adoption of such aprinciple will compel lending institutions to act prudently and by so doing enhance the integrity of commercial transactions andcommercial morality.</p>        <p class="quote">It is not possible to give specific guidance as to the circumstances in which the nature of a transaction will be such as to put aperson dealing with a company upon inquiry. So much depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, notably the powers ofthe company (if relevant), the nature of its business, the apparent relationship of the transaction to that business and the actualor apparent authority of those acting or purporting to act on behalf of the company. Much will also depend upon representations aboutthe transaction made by such persons, for the party dealing with the company may often find protection in the principles of agencyor the doctrine of estoppel. In this respect, I should indicate my general agreement with the comments made by Brennan J in his judgment,which I have had the advantage of reading since preparing these reasons, concerning the position of a creditor who takes a companyâsguarantee for another's debt.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  This is what Brennan J said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ In these cases, it was the nature of the transaction which put the party purportedly dealing with the company on inquiry. Althoughthe nature of the transaction is not the only factor which might put a party on inquiry, it is often, and importantly, the factoron which the application of the indoor management rule depends. In <i>Rolled Steel Ltd.</i> Slade L.J. said:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âthe very nature of a proposed transaction may put a person upon inquiry as to the authority of the directors of a company to effectit, even if he has no special relationship with the company. Whether in any given case the person dealing with the company is puton inquiry must depend on all the particular circumstances.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">A creditor will ordinarily be put on inquiry when his debtor offers as security a guarantee given by a third party company whose businessis not ordinarily the giving of guarantees, for the execution of guarantees and supporting securities for another's liabilities,not being for the purposes of a company's business nor otherwise for its benefit, is not ordinarily within the authority of the officersor agents of the company. Of course, the circumstances may show that the giving of such a guarantee and supporting security (hereafterindifferently described as âguaranteeâ) is for the company's benefit. For example, it may be for the benefit of solvent companieswithin a group to guarantee the liabilities of a holding company in order to benefit the guarantor companies as well as other membersof the group. In such a case, provided the creditor has been satisfied that it is such a case, the apparently regular execution ofa guarantee and supporting security may be relied on pursuant to the indoor management rule. Of course, the only important consequenceof a creditor being put on inquiry is that, in the event that an apparently regular guarantee turns out not to have been authorizedby the guarantor company, the guarantor company may show that it is not bound.</p>        <p class="quote">When a creditor is put on inquiry, he cannot rely on the apparent regularity of execution of the instrument of guarantee and the indoormanagement rule but must be satisfied that the relevant officers and agents of the company had the company's authority to executean instrument pledging the credit or assets of the company to guarantee another's debts.â Page 182.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  <i>Northside</i> was not concerned with reliance on the apparent authority of a managing director.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  Notwithstanding Mr Pipitâs understanding quoted in para. 127(2) above, it was not TFBâs case that it had considered the matterand came to the conclusion that the Switch Transaction was in the interest of Akai.

Indeed it did not refer to the purpose of the loan, namely, the repayment of Singerâsdebt.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Nor do I accept as a sufficient answer that because the minute when received was put away and not seen by TFBâs senior managementit could be ignored. In this context, I agree with Mr Kosmin that the knowledge of the person charged with the responsibility toobtain evidence of authority:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ is to count as the knowledge of the company.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 500 at 511.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  I bear in mind the matters I have identified in para. 120 above as well as the inadequacy of the Executive Committee minute. I amof the opinion that TFB was put on enquiry whether the Switch Transaction was in the interests of Akai. Had they made the enquiry,it would probably have revealed that the transaction was not in Akaiâs interest, or that shareholdersâ approval might be required.Further, if they had been put on enquiry whether the Switch Transaction was in the interests of Akai, I believe it is inconceivablethat they would not also have enquired into Mr Tingâs authority.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  So, for this reason too, I am of the view that TFB could not rely on the apparent authority of Mr Ting.</p>    <p class="heading">Knowing Receipt</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  As I have come to the conclusion that the loan and the share pledge agreements were not made with the authority of Akai then asLord Nicholls said in <i>Criterion Properties</i>, TFB would be accountable for any benefits it might have received from TFB under these agreements. That being the case, Akai wouldnot need to rely on knowing receipt</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  Mr Kosmin submitted that Stone J fell into error by formulating the test as requiring actual knowledge of the breach of fiduciaryduty.

In light of these authorities, with which I respectfully agree, I accept the proposition that unconscionability is a functionof <i>actual</i> knowledge, and <i>not</i> of constructive knowledge. I also accept the proposition, at least within a commercial transaction, that a person who receives propertyconsequent upon a breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty <i>cannot</i> be said to be âunconscionableâ merely if in so doing he is careless or if he fails to make inquiry.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  Stone J also said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â454.

The facts in <i>El Ajou</i> are complicated. For our purpose, it is only necessary to note that the plaintiffâs claim against DLH for knowing receipt was basedon the knowledge of the fraud of Ferdman. Hoffmann LJ said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere are two ways in which Mr Ferdmanâs knowledge can be attributed to DLH. The first is that as agent of DLH his knowledgecan be imputed to the company. The second is that for this purpose he was DLH and his knowledge was its knowledge â¦â 701J.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  The appeal was allowed on the basis that Ferdman was the directing mind and will of DLH and as such his knowledge was that of DLH.We are not concerned with that.

That claim failed.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  However, in that context, Hoffmann LJ examined how the agentâs knowledge might be imputed to the principal. He said that includedcases where the principal has a duty to investigate as when:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ there may be something about a transaction by which the principal is âput on enquiryââ 702J.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  However, he found on the facts that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ in receiving the traceable assets.

The recipient's state of knowledge must be such as to make it unconscionablefor him to retain the benefit of the receipt. A test in that form, though it cannot, any more than any other, avoid difficultiesof application, ought to avoid those of definition and allocation to which the previous categorisations have led. Moreover, it shouldbetter enable the courts to give commonsense decisions in the commercial context in which claims in knowing receipt are now frequentlymade, paying equal regard to the wisdom of Lindley LJ on the one hand and of Richardson J on the other.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  The dicta which Nourse LJ would pay equal regard to are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn dealing with estates in land title is everything, and it can be leisurely investigated; in commercial transactions possessionis everything, and there is no time to investigate title; and if we were to extend the doctrine of constructive notice to commercialtransactions we should be doing infinite mischief and paralyzing the trade of the country.â Per Lindley LJ in <i>Manchester Trust v Furness</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%202%20QB%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 2 QB 539</a>, 545.</p>        <p class="quote">âClearly Courts would not readily import a duty to enquire in the case of commercial transactions where they must be conscious ofthe seriously inhibiting effects of a wide application of the doctrine.

The bills of lading referredto a charterparty. Lindley LJ was dealing with a submission that because the bill of lading referred to the charterparty, the holderof the bill of lading took it with notice of the charterparty. In that context, his lordship said at 545:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThat argument appears to me to be pushing the doctrine of constructive notice a great deal too far. â¦ What is wanted in thiscase is to say that by reason of the reference to the charterparty the holder of the bill of lading and the person who takes it inthe ordinary course of business are to be treated as having notice of all the contents of the charterparty. There is no doctrinethat goes to anything like that extent;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>His lordship then referred to the equitable doctrines of constructive notice in dealing with land and estates, where one would betaken to have constructive notice of a document referred to in, say, a document of title. I believe Lindley LJ was objecting to theextension of such a rule of constructive notice to commercial transactions. I do not believe Lindley LJ was of the view that forcommercial transactions nothing less than actual knowledge would suffice. That, I believe, is borne out by his reference to <i>London Joint Stock Bank v Simmons</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1892%5d%20AC%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1892] AC 201at</a> 221 where following the words of Lord Herschell quoted by Lindley LJ at 546, Lord Herschell said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf there be anything which excites the suspicion that there is something wrong in the transaction, the taker of the (negotiable)instrument is not acting in good faith if he shuts his eyes to the facts presented to him and puts the suspicion aside without furtherinquiry.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Furthermore, the dictum from Richardson J (as he then was) shows quite clearly that actual knowledge of breach of fiduciary dutyis not required.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  In any event, with respect, I believe extrajudicial statement of Millett LJ quoted in para. 113 above has addressed and resolvedthe concerns of Lindley LJ and Richardson J.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  With respect, I do not agree that <i>Akindele</i> is authority that actual knowledge is required for knowing receipt.

Mr Kosmin submitted that in cases where a party has been deprived of the use or benefit of an asset as a result ofa breach of trust, in determining the quantum of compensation, equity will presume that the wronged party would have made the mostbeneficial use of the asset of which it was deprived. But TFB was not entitled to sell the shares prior to Akaiâs default, whichtook place on 6 December 1999. On that basis, Mr Kosmin put forward a claim for US$30,867,372, being their value as at that date.Although the shares were not sold until April and May 2000, as I understand the evidence, TFB sold the shares as soon as they reasonablycould. That being the case, I have no doubt the learned judge was right.</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  Furthermore, I agree with Mr Snowden that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â76. On the facts of the present case, it would be entirely unreal for the court to assume that, if the Loan Agreement and SharePledge had not been made, Akai would have sold the Akai Electric shares on 04.12.98, or in April 1999, or indeed at any other pointin time before they were actually sold in April/May 2000. It must be recalled that Akai was a holding company and Akai Electric wasits main operating subsidiary at all material times. Akai never gave any indication of an intention to sell its controlling stakein Akai Electric, whether in April 1999 or at any other relevant time, and no evidence of any such plans has ever been adduced. Onthe contrary, Akai carried on operating Akai Electric as its subsidiary at all times after executing the Share Pledge and throughout1999. Even when a petition was presented in 2000 to wind up Akai for reasons entirely unconnected with this case, Akai resisted thepetition and put an alternative proposal to its financial creditors that involved the retention of its shares in Akai Electric.</p>        <p class="quote">77.

In this court, as below, the two tests (i.e. the <i>Equiticorp</i> test and the <i>Charterbridge</i> test) were presented as alternatives in ascertaining whether there had been a breach of fiduciary duty by Mr Ting. Much of the debatecentred on which of the two was the correct test.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  It is relevant to note at the outset that <i>Charterbridge</i> was not a case directed to the liability of directors or to their fiduciary duties. In this regard, I agree with the analysis ofBryson J in <i>Maronis Holdings Ltd and Another v Nippon Credit Australia Pty Ltd and Others</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2001/448.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] NSWSC 448</a> at Â§Â§ 173-176 where it was explained that the issue in <i>Charterbridge</i> was whether a loan transaction was <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the company: the directors were not parties to the action and it was not alleged that they had incurred any liability.The determination of the <i>ultra vires</i> question was thus objective and it is clear from the judgment of Pennycuick J (at 74) that for that determination the state of mindof the directors was âirrelevantâ.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  In that case the judge found that the directors, in deciding to enter into a guarantee had looked only at the interests of the groupof companies as a whole and had not taken into consideration the interests of the company (which was granting the guarantee) separately.It was the companyâs contention that a transaction could not be within the companyâs powers unless it was done for the companyâsbenefit which, as Pennycuick J recognised, was a question of fact. That was the question that was being addressedin the passage fromhis judgment cited in Â§ 56 of the judgment of Tang VP but, as earlier noted, that question did not arise in the context of determiningwhether there had been a breach of fiduciary duty; rather, it arose in the context of determining whether the transaction was <i>ultra vires</i> the company.</p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  It was within the <i>ultra vires</i> context that Pennycuick J stated the test as:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âwhether an intelligent and honest man in the position of a director of the company concerned, could, in the whole of the existingcircumstances, have reasonably believed that the transactions were for the benefit of the company.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Once its context is appreciated, it will be seen that the <i>Charterbridge</i> test has little relevance to a case such as the present case and inappropriate where what has to be determined is whether there hadbeen a breach of fiduciary duty by a director.</p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  As Clarke and Cripps JJA commented in <i>Equiticorp</i> (at p.147E):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe directors are bound to exercise their powers, <i>bona fide</i>, in what they consider is in the interests of the company and not for any collateral purpose. Whether they did so or not is a questionof fact.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It was for that reason that they expressed reservations about applying the <i>Charterbridge</i> test in determining whether directors had abused their powers.</p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  They went on to explain that, in such cases, the traditional approach is encapsulated in Viscount Finlayâs statement in <i>Hindle v John Cotton Ltd</i> cited in <i>Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20NSWLR%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] NSWLR 68</a> at 77:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWhere the question is one of the abuse of powers, the state of mind of those who acted, and the motive on which they acted, areall important, and you may go into the question of what their intention was, collecting from the surrounding circumstances all thematerials which genuinely throw light upon the question of the state of mind of the directors so as to show whether they were honestlyacting in discharge of their powers in the interests of the company or were acting from some bye motive, possibly of personal advantage,or for any other reason.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  Such an inquiry involves ascertaining the intention of the director whose conduct is under scrutiny. The majority in <i>Equiticorp</i> elaborated on their approach thus (at 148B-D):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAccordingly there seems to us to be difficulties in substituting an objective test (How would an intelligent and honest man haveacted?) for the factual question raised in the proceedings. It may be that if a director bluntly states that he or she did not considerthe interests of the particular company at all and solely had regard to the interests of the group then difficulties would arisein resolving that factual question. But the position will rarely be such a black and white one and it would usually be possible todiscern whether in deciding to take certain action for the benefit of the group the directors perceived, and were justified in theirperception, that in so doing they were acting for the benefit of the particular company. On the other hand it may be possible todiscern that the directors embarked on a course to support the group unconcerned about the detrimental effect of the action on theparticular company or were prepared to sacrifice that company for the good of the other companies in the group. A careful analysisof the factual situation will usually reveal the answer to the factual question posed although no doubt on some occasions the problemmay very well be a difficult one.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This passage highlights that what has to be resolved is the factual question of the directorâs state of mind.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  In the present case, as the judge noted (Â§Â§ 328, 331) there was an âevidential vacuumâ, there being no evidence from Mr Tinghimself. Plainly, that poses certain difficulties in the way of resolving the factual question of whether, in committing Akai tothe loan and share pledge agreements, Mr Ting had abused his powers. But the absence of evidence from Mr Ting is not indicative oneway or the other as to whether, as a director, he had or had not considered the interests of Akai. Whether Mr Ting had acted honestlyremains to be ascertained from all the surrounding circumstances which genuinely throw light upon the question of his state of mind.</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  The majority in <i>Equiticorp</i> proffered (somewhat tentatively) as a âpreferable viewâ (at 148E-F), the proposition that the failure to give consideration tothe interests of the relevant company is <i>ipso facto</i> a breach of duty (i.e. the <i>Equiticorp</i> test). As an approach, I respectfully agree with Tang VP that it seems wrong in principle for the reasons he gives. In any event,on the facts, the question is purely hypothetical as there was no evidence from Mr Ting himself and it would be wrong to equate theabsence of evidence with a failure to give consideration to the interests of Akai.</p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  As regards the surrounding circumstances, the minutes of the Executive Committee of Akai dated 4 December 1998 (âthe Exco minutesâ)become highly significant. The minutes purported to record a telephone meeting with Dr Holmes, one of Akaiâs directors, and hisapproval to the loan and share pledge agreements. The judge accepted Dr Holmesâ âemphatic denial that he had been telephonicallypresentâ at the Exco meeting said to have taken place at which approval had been given. At Â§ 355 of his judgment, the judge madea finding that Mr Ting simply had the Exco minutes âmade upâ.</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a>  That conduct is hardly consistent or reconcilable with an honest state of mind and is directly relevant because the Exco minuteswere âproducedâ for the very purpose of satisfying TFBâs requirement that evidence of authority to sign the agreements be provided.I note the reasons (reflected in Â§Â§ 287-305 of the judgment below which I do not propose to repeat) advanced by Mr Snowden to showwhy it was in Akaiâs interest to enter into the switch transaction. But, in my view, the need to resort to fabricating the Excominutes shows a lack of <i>bona fides</i> and undermines what, objectively viewed, might have been reasons for the transaction. While Mr Snowden stressed that Mr Ting hadderived no personal benefit from the loan and share pledge agreements in that it is not said that any part of the funds had beendiverted to Mr Ting for his personal use, the absence of personal benefit neither establishes that what was done could not have beenin breach of fiduciary duty nor precludes any conclusion that there had been such a breach.</p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  In my view, the inference is irresistible that Mr Ting could not have been acting honestly when he committed Akai to the transaction.Had he been acting as an honest director should, he would not have had to resort to fabricating the minutes. Rather, he would haveconvened a proper board meeting.</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  In the result, but for different reasons, I agree with the judgeâs conclusion that there had been a breach of fiduciary duty onMr Tingâs part. It follows that there can be no question ofMr Ting having actual authority or implied actual authority.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  I now turn to the question of apparent authority.</p>    <p class="heading">Apparent authority</p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  While a breach of fiduciary duty effectively precludes any reliance on actual authority because by its very nature it will nullifyactual authority, it does not nullify apparent authority. See <i>Hopkins v TL Dallas Group</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%201%20BCLC%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 1 BCLC 543</a> at Â§ 89.</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  It is TFBâs case (which the judge accepted) that Mr Ting had apparent authority to commit Akai to the agreements and that Akaiis bound by the agreements. I agree that TFBâs defence of apparent authority is not sustainable.</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  Mr Ting was the chairman and CEO of Akai. It was Mr Snowdenâs submission that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAkaiâs Board generally permitted Mr Ting to commit Akai to contracts without the need for further sanction of the Board â¦thatMr Ting had, to the knowledge of the other Board members, responsibility for dealing with financial institutions â¦This includedentering into financial arrangements with such institutions on behalf of Akai.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  It was said that although he was not officially Akaiâs managing director, the conduct of the board over the years was such asto render Mr Ting, for practical purposes, the <i>de facto</i> managing director of Akai. Mr Snowdenâs principal submission was that committing Akai to the switch transaction fell with the usualauthority of those positions of Mr Ting. Mr Snowden cited, <i>inter alia</i>, <i>Hely-Hutchison v Brayhead Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20QB%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 QB 549</a> in support.</p>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  Lord Denning MR stated (at 583D) that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦when the board appoint one of their number to be managing director, they invested him not only with implied authority, but alsowith ostensible authority to do all such things as fall within the usual scope of that office. Other people will see him acting asmanaging director are entitled to assume that he has the usual authority of a managing director.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>While the correctness of that statement of the law is accepted, the question whether the switch transaction was a transaction thatfell within âthe usual scopeâ of the office of managing director remains to be determined.</p>    <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a>  <i>Hely-Hutchison</i> itself was not a decision that turned on ostensible authority. In that case, R was the chairman of the defendant company which hadacquired some shares in P, a public company of which the plaintiff was chairman and managing director. R as chairman of the defendantcompany signed on the defendant companyâs notepaper purporting to indemnify the plaintiff against loss on his personal guaranteeto bankers for a loan to P and to guarantee to repay money lent by the plaintiff personally to P. It is relevant to note that theoffice of chairman did not carry with it authority to enter into those contracts without the sanction of the board. (584B)</p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  The judge found that R acted as the <i>de facto</i> managing director of the defendant company. He was the chief executive who made the final decision on any matter concerning finance.He often committed the defendant company to contracts without the knowledge of the board and reported the matter afterwards. Theboard knew of and acquiesced in R acting as <i>de facto</i> managing director. Lord Denning considered that those findings carried with it the necessary inference that R also had actual authority,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âsuch authority being implied from the circumstance that the board by their conduct over many months had acquiesced in his actingas their chief executive and committing [the defendant company] to contracts without the necessity of sanction from the board.â(584F)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>On that basis, Lord Denning did not consider it necessary to go into the question of ostensible authority. (584G)</p>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  Lord Wilberforce was of the same view. He noted that the board of the defendant company had authorised R to enter into heads ofagreement with the plaintiff on behalf of P with the object of obtaining for the defendant company a substantial holding in P. Fromthis initial step flowed subsequent transactions, including the letters of indemnity and guarantee in question which Lord Wilberforceconsidered as merely carrying through to a conclusion the objective of obtaining a substantial holding that had been approved bythe board. (587G-588F) Thus, that case was decided not on the basis of ostensible authority but on implied actual authority. In viewof the conclusion that Mr Ting was acting in breach of his fiduciary duty, implied actual authority cannot avail TFB.</p>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  Mr Snowden also referred to <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Magnal) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%202%20QB%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 2 QB 480</a> where Diplock LJ (as he then was) analysed the relevant law on apparent authority (at 505):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The commonest form of representation by a principal creating an âapparentâ authority of an agent is by conduct, namely, bypermitting the agent to act in the management or conduct of the principalâs business. Thus, if in the case of a company the boardof directors who have âactualâ authority under the memorandum and articles of association to manage the companyâs businesspermit the agent to act in the management or conduct of the companyâs business, they thereby represent to all persons dealing withsuch agent that he has authority to enter on behalf of the corporation into contracts of a kind which an agent authorised to do actsof the kind which he is in fact permitted to do usually enters into in the ordinary course of such business.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  In my view, it seems clear from the passages cited from <i>Hely-Hutchison</i> and <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer</i> that far from establishing that a managing director (and for that matter a CEO and chief executive) has untrammelled authority tocommit his company to any transaction without board sanction, they show that parameters do exist. While what contracts fall withinthe ordinary ambit of the authority of an executive chairman, CEO and/or managing director may be a matter of debate, there is anambit to that authority. The relevant question is whether the transaction is of a kind a managing director would in the normal coursebe authorised to enter into on behalf of the company. As Mason CJ observed in <i>Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar General</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%2d1990%5d%20170%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989-1990] 170 CLR 146</a> at 159,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe company would not have been bound had it not been one of that kind.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Moreover, it should not be overlooked that we are dealing here with a publicly listed company.</p>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  In so far as the conduct of the other directors of Akai and the practice of the board are said to be relevant to the scope of MrTingâs apparent authority, the relevant evidence consisted of the evidence of Dr Holmes, one of the other directors of Akai, whichwas to the effect that on matters such as dividends, interim or final, or bonus issues of shares or changes to capital and the like,it was Mr Ting who decided on those matters. (Tr. Day 3/30:10-14) Mr Ting was also responsible for dealing with financial institutionsas the following passage from the transcript shows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â MR SNOWDEN: â¦</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">As far as youâre concerned, Dr Holmes, who was responsible for negotiating and arranging Akaiâs financial affairs, such as agreementsfor loans and guarantees and the like?</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">A. Itâs my understanding Clara Loh would normally be responsible. Unless it dealt with, say, a large value loan or if it dealt witha senior executive of a bank, in which case Mr Ting was responsible. The only exception being ScotiaBank in Toronto, which Mr Tamwas responsible for, at a senior level.</p>        <p class="quote">Q. You were perfectly content with that arrangement?</p>        <p class="quote">A. Yes.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(Tr. Day 4/15:24-16:10)</p>    <p>That was the extent of the evidence on that issue.</p>    <p><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  I would accept that Mr Ting had authority to negotiate and arrange loans for the purposes of Akaiâs own business including thepledging of its assets as security. But the switch transaction was not such a transaction: it was nothing less than assuming thedebt of another company and securing the indebtedness by pledging Akaiâs own assets in the process with no apparent benefit toAkai discernible from the face of the transaction. On any view, it was anything but an everyday or run-of-the-mill loan transactionmade in the ordinary course of business.</p>    <p><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  Nor was there any evidence of an established practice of entering into switch transactions with TFB. Insofar as it might be suggestedthat a precedent for the switch transaction exists, that would not appear to be borne out by the facts. As recorded by the judge(Â§Â§ 28-30), in September 1990, TFB made available to Semi-Tech Global Ltd a US$20 million revolving credit facility. In June 1991,the STC Group underwent a restructuring: Singer which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange at about that time became a subsidiaryof Semi-Tech Global to head the worldwide âSinger groupâ of companies. In late 1991, at Semi-Tech Globalâs request, Singerwas substituted as borrower and took over the liability for the US$20 million facility.</p>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  While that transaction involved a âswitchâ of borrower, in substance, it was wholly different from the switch transaction underconsideration for the simple reason that the earlier transaction was between a parent and a wholly owned subsidiary where there wasan identity of interest which is not the case between Akai and Singer. Akai and Singer are publicly listed companies and 57% of Akaiand 50% of Singer are owned by the public. For that reason, it cannot be regarded as establishing a precedent for the switch transaction.Moreover, the notion that any bank would be willing to enter into a loan transaction with a corporate entity, particularly a publiclylisted company, without requiring a board resolution authorising the transaction in question seems somewhat removed from reality.</p>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  For those reasons, I am unable to accept that the positions held by Mr Ting in Akai, <i>ipso facto</i>, authorised him to enter into the switch transaction.</p>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  If (contrary to my view) Mr Ting as CEO, chairman and <i>de facto</i> managing director did have apparent authority to enter into the switch transaction, there was no evidence that TFB relied on therepresentation. That is essential if the defence of apparent authority is to succeed. The relevant evidence is helpfully set outin Â§Â§ 86-89 of the judgment of Tang VP. In my view, TFBâs requirement of âevidence confirming Mr Tingâs authorityâ fromAkai is the very antithesis of reliance on any representation of Mr Tingâs authority. Had TFB relied on the representing arisingfrom the positions held by Mr Ting as conferring the requisite authority, there would have been no need to require âevidence confirmingMr Tingâs authorityâ. I therefore conclude that TFB has not shown that it had relied on Mr Tingâs apparent authority. Thatis an insurmountable obstacle and fatal to its defence based on apparent authority. The ineluctable consequence is that Akai wasnot bound by the loan and share pledge agreements.</p>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  On the question whether TFB had been âput on inquiryâ, there is nothing that I can usefully add.</p>    <p><b>Hon Cheung JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  I respectfully agree with the reasons of the judgment of Tang VP.</p>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  I would like to focus my discussion on knowing receipt which is relied upon by Akai as one of the major planks of its claim againstthe Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a>  In my view Akai has established a valid claim against the Bank based on knowing receipt.</p>    <p class="heading">Knowing Receipt</p>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  A person may be liable as a constructive trustee when he knowingly receives for his own benefit trust property transferred to himin breach of trust: <i>Agip (Africa) Ltd v.

The pattern of inquiries to be followed by a person acquiring property for his own benefit is usually well known in advance, andprovides a simple yardstick for determining whether a recipient does or does not have notice of a matter.

All depends on the context.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">My view</p>    <p><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a>  1)     I do not regard actual knowledge to be the only basis for liability in knowing receipt. In considering the authorities itis important to bear in mind the context in which the principles stated in these cases is addressed. The law of knowing receipt hasbeen a developing one. From its early appearance under the general ambit of constructive trust, the two separate concepts of knowingreceipt and dishonest assistance gradually became distinct with their own specific requirements. Hence in dishonest assistance (previouslyknown as knowing assistance), being an accessory based liability, dishonesty or want of probity is required (<i>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v</i> <i>Philip Tan Kok Ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 378).</a> On the other hand knowing receipt is receipt based and dishonesty is not required. As Megarry VC observed in <i>Re Montaguâs Settlement Trust</i> the basic requirement in knowing receipt is whether the recipientâs conscience is affected. This becomes the touchstone in <i>Akindele</i> when unconscionability is held to be the single test of knowledge for knowing receipt. Because of the development of this branchof law, many of the cases which addressed the issue of actual knowledge or constructive notice may not have focused on the distinctionin these two concepts. As a result the cases may not be necessary reconcilable. However, what is clear is that the law both pre <i>Akindele</i> as shown in cases such as <i>Selangor</i>, <i>Karak Rubber</i>, <i>Belmont Finance</i>, <i>Baden</i>, <i>Rolled Steel</i>, <i>Agip</i>, <i>MacMillian</i>, <i>Twinsectra</i>and post <i>Akindele</i> such as <i>Criterion Properties</i> (CA) and <i>Charter plc</i> does not exclude the reliance on constructive notice in establishing knowledge as a constructive trustee. The review of authoritiesI have undertaken amply justifies this view. These authorities are too well established to be disregarded.</p>    <p>2)     I agree that the test of unconscionability identified by <i>Akindele</i> provides a sound jurisprudential foundation for knowing receipt. Equity has always proceeded on the basis of conscience. AlthoughLord Nicholls in <i>Royal Brunei Airlines</i> preferred the use of dishonesty and not unconscionability in accessory based liability, I do not see any real objection in principleto adopt unconscionability as the test in knowing receipt. The test of âunconscionabilityâ identifies the âdegreeâ of knowledgerather than the âtypeâ that is required to attract liability.</p>    <p>3)     In my view it is important to understand what Nourse LJ was trying to achieve by this single test of unconsciounability. Justas Lord Nicholls in <i>Royal Brunei Airlines</i> said at page 391,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â......To inquire, in such cases, whether a person dishonestly assisted in what is later held to be a breach of trust is to aska meaningful question, which is capable of being given a meaningful answer. This is not always so if the question is posed in termsof âknowinglyâ assisted. <u>Framin</u><u>g the question in the latter form all too often leads one into tortuous convolutions about the âsortâ</u> <u>of knowledge required, when the truth is that â</u><u>knowinglyâ</u> <u>is inapt as a criterion when applied to the gradually darkening spectrum</u><u>where the differences are of degree and not</u><u>kind</u>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Nourse LJ is likewise trying to do away with the difficulties with the âsortâ of knowledge required in this area. The <i>Baden</i> categorisation was rejected by Lord Nicholls in dishonest assistance. Nourse LJ likewise called for its rejection and also the actualknowledge/constructive notice division in knowing receipt. I agree with his view.</p>    <p>4)     If such divisions are to be discarded, why are we then still debating this topic in this appeal? First, until <i>Akindele</i>, the cases recognized the distinction, so was the case under appeal, hence the topic has to be addressed. Second, even if the <i>Akindele</i> approach is to be adopted in Hong Kong, the present exercise is not, as submitted by Mr. Snowden QC, who appeared with Mr. EugeneFung as counsel for the Bank, to resurrect the old division. Rather, it is to deal with the mechanistic rejection of the use of constructivenotice, particularly in some of the more recent cases (including the present case), when by so doing, the Courts have failed to appreciatethat they may have excluded some highly relevant factors in the determination of unconscionable knowledge. To equate knowledge inknowing receipt as âactual knowledgeâ only or to say unconscionability can only be constituted by âactual knowledgeâ missedthe point entirely: if there are circumstances which would put a reasonable man on inquiry, why should the knowledge that may beso acquired be discarded in the search for unconscionability?</p>    <p>5)     Likewise in respect of the <i>Baden</i> categorization there should not be a mechanistic approach as well. Wilful blindness or contrived ignorance (sometimes colourfullyreferred to as âNelsonian knowledgeâ based on the story of Admiral Nelson putting the telescope to his blind eye in a losingbattle) is treated as actual knowledge. But as Millett J warned in <i>Agip</i> at page 293 that there should not be over refinement or a too ready assumption that knowledge or circumstances which would indicatethe facts to an honest and reasonable man (category (iv)) and knowledge of circumstances which would put an honest and reasonableman on inquiry (category (v)) in <i>Baden</i> are necessary cases of constructive notice only. In my view although the terminology in these two categories may be akin to thosedescribing negligence or carelessness, in the context of their application in knowing receipt, one is not saying negligence or carelessnessis enough. Rather the focus is whether, given the circumstances of the case, the failure to inquire points towards the knowledgeon the part of the recipient of the misapplication of the fund. As Millett J observed in <i>Agip</i> at 295 on the basis of the constructive trusteeâs liability,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â......He is not liable for failing to make inquiry, but for the misapplication of the plaintiffâs property. He is under no dutyto make inquiry. His only duty is to act honestly. If he makes inquiry, he does so for his own protection. If he does not make inquiry,the loss is not caused by his failure to do so but by his participation in the misapplication of the plaintiffâs funds. He is liableonly if he acted with knowledge; and this must be judged in the light of all the circumstances known to him and any explanation actuallygiven to him. But it is not, in my view, to be judged byconsidering the hypothetical explanations which might have been given tohim if he had sought them. If it were otherwise, his liability would depend on whether the fraudster would have been sufficientlyinventive to be able to supply a plausible explanation if asked for one.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>6)     In view of their long established usage, my view is that inevitably the terms of actual knowledge and constructive notice willcontinue to be used (hopefully only for a brief appearance) when authorities are referred to in a legal system which relies on theuse of precedents. However, in referring to them it is important to understand the real purpose of their usage.</p>    <p>7)     Whether constructive notice will apply or not in a given case does not depend on whether the transaction in question involvesland or commerce. To exclude constructive notice solely because the transaction is commercial in nature is too simplistic. NourseLJ in <i>Akindele</i> emphasized the need for commonsense decisions in the commercial context in which knowing receipt claims are now made. In my view,it is precisely because of the broad approach when unconscionability is adopted as the underlining test of knowledge that one shouldnot confine the examination only to the actual knowledge of the recipient and exclude constructive notice in its wider sense.</p>    <p>8)     The Bank argued that the doctrine of constructive notice looks first to established practice, to see what should have beendone, and then imposes a legal fiction of treating a defendant as if he knew what he would have discovered if he had made the relevantinvestigation or inquiry. While this is a correct description of constructive notice, my view is that this approach is focused onthe traditional aspect of constructive notice which is associated with land transaction with its specific procedure for requisitionand inquiry as to title or incumbrance. But constructive notice is also used in the wider sense as Millett J in <i>MacMillian Inc</i> at page 1000 stated that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere is no room for the doctrine of notice in the strict conveyancing sense in a situation in which it is not the custom and practiceto investigate the transferorâs title. But in the wider sense it is not so limited. In Barclays Bank Plc. v. OâBrien  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20AC%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 A.C. 180</a> (a case concerned with land, but in which the defect in titleÂ¾the presence of undue influenceÂ¾could not be discovered by the routineinvestigation of title) Lord Browne-Wilkinson said, at pp. 195-196:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â The doctrine of notice lies at the heart of equity. Given that there are two innocent parties, each enjoying rights; the earlierright prevails against the later right if the acquirer of the later right knows of the earlier right (actual notice) or would havediscovered it had he taken proper steps (constructive notice). In particular, if the party asserting that he takes free of the earlierrights of another knows of certain facts which put him on inquiry as to the possible existence of the rights of that other and hefails to make such inquiry or take such other steps as are reasonable to verify whether such earlier right does or does not exist,he will have constructive notice of the earlier right and take subject to it.â â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>9)     When constructive notice is applied in commercial transactions it does not mean that the requirement to inquire in the traditionalconveyancing sense will be adopted without qualification. To do so may cause injustice. Whether there should be inquiry and the extentof the inquiry will depend on the facts of the case. The standard must be what a reasonable person in the circumstances of the casewould have done. Where the circumstances requires inquiry to be made, especially if the recipient already has had some establishedrequirement of inquiries in standard transactions but chose not to pursue these established requirement, I cannot see why constructivenotice should be excluded in such a case.</p>    <p>10)     I would apply the objective standard in determining unconscionability. Although the issue is concerned with the state of mindof the recipient, I do not see why, as a matter of principle, there should be a different standard from assessing dishonest assistancewhich is also concerned with the state of mind of the person. In <i>Royal Brunei Airlines</i> at page 389, Lord Nicholls recongized that honesty has a strong subjective element but he held that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHowever, these subjective characteristics of honesty do not mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honestyin particular circumstances. The standard of what constitutes honest conduct is not subjective. Honesty is not an optional scale,with higher or lower values according to the moral standards of each individual. If a person knowingly appropriates anotherâs property,he will not escape a finding of dishonesty simply because he sees nothing wrong in such behaviour.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Further, in <i>Cobbe v Yeomanâs Row Management Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%201%20WLR%201752" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 1 WLR 1752</a> at 1788, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe stated that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHere it is being used (as in my opinion it should always be used) as an objective value judgment on behaviour (regardless of thestate of mind of the individual in question).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Similar views are expressed by Fox at 8.58-8.59 and Nolan in his article â<i>How Knowing is Knowing Receipt</i>?â  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=59%20CLJ%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">59 CLJ 147.</a></p>    <p>11)     Lord Nicholls in <i>Royal Brunei Airlines</i> at page 389 stated that in the context of dishonest assistance, lack of probity is synonymous with dishonesty. In view of this connotation,one should avoid using the same term in the context of unconscionability.</p>    <p class="heading">The relevant factors</p>    <p><a name="p244" class="para" id="p244">244.</a>  What then are the relevant factors to be considered in deciding whether a recipient is guilty of knowing receipt. Mr. Kosmin QCand Ms Linda Chan, counsel for Akai, relied on the following factors part of which are drawn from the speech of Lord Nicholls in<i>Royal Brunei Airlines</i> at 390 when he considered the circumstances that an honest person should have regard in the context of dishonest assistance. In myview these factors are applicable on the issue of unconscionability. The circumstances are</p>    <p>1)     The nature and importance of the proposed transaction to the parties and the nature and importance of their respective roles.</p>    <p>2)     Whether the proposed transaction was within the ordinary course of business and the ordinary course of the partiesâ business.</p>    <p>3)     The position, conduct, knowledge, experience, personal characteristics, understanding and motives of the parties.</p>    <p>4)     The benefit to be derived from each of the parties from thetransaction.</p>    <p>5)     Their ability to investigate and make checks as to the validityand propriety of the transaction.</p>    <p>6)     The practicability of proceeding otherwise.</p>    <p>7)     The seriousness of the adverse consequences to thebeneficiaries.</p>    <p>8)     Whether there is a customary practice of making routineinquiries, and</p>    <p>9)     Whether and to the extent those inquiries were made.</p>    <p class="heading">The facts of the present case</p>    <p><a name="p245" class="para" id="p245">245.</a>  The underlining theme of the Bankâs defence is that it was concerned only with its own business and it was not there to take careof the interest of Akai. One, of course, would not expect commercial entities to have concern for another commercial entity in analtruistic sense. However, the issue here is whether the Bank had attracted liability as a constructive trustee because of its knowledge.Applying the objective standard of unconscionability, my view is that the Bank had the requisite knowledge in knowing receipt.</p>    <p><a name="p246" class="para" id="p246">246.</a>  1)     It is important to take an overview of the case. The special feature in this case which calls out for attention is first,the close relationship of the Bank, Singer and Mr. Ting and second, the Bank was the direct beneficiary of the switch transaction.In my view it is precisely because of these two factors that the Bank had chosen to proceed in a way which ignored the interest ofAkai whose assets were dealt with in an unauthorized way.</p>    <p>2)     Mr. Ting was the chairman and director of Singer NV. Through his interest in STC Canada he also had substantial interest inSinger NV. Singer NV also had substantial interest in Singer Thailand of which Mr. Banyong Lamsan (the Chairman of the Bank) wasthe chairman and Mr. Ting a director. The Bank also owned 8.5% of Singer Thailand.</p>    <p>3)     The earlier version of the Singer NV loan had been in place since 1989. Singer NV assumed the loan in early 1992. The loanwas secured by a pledge of six million Singer Thailand shares. By 1997, Singer NV owed US$30 million to the Bank. The pledged SingerThailand shares only covered 4.2% of the outstanding loan. The Bank knew Singer NV was not in a position to repay the loan.</p>    <p>4)     At the same time the Bank was also in financial difficulties. Thailand being the first country in Asia whose currency was attackedby international hedge funds in 1997. The Bankâs profit for the year ended 31 December 1997 was only US$17 million. This is tobe contrasted with the potential default of the US$30 million of Singer NV. With this background, Akaiâs assumption of the SingerNV loan backed by a new security from Akai Electric clearly was a gift from heaven for the Bank.</p>    <p>5)     In <i>Selangor</i> at 1586, Ungoed-Thomas J cited Lord Cairns LCâs comment in <i>Gray v. Johnson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281868%29%20LR%203%20HL%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1868) LR 3 HL 1</a> at 11,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â...if it be shown that any personal benefits to the bankers themselves is designed or stipulated for, that circumstances, aboveall others, will most readily establish the fact that the bankers are in privity with the breach of trust which is about to be committed.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Ungoed-Thomas J observed that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA benefit designed or stipulated for âmost readilyâ establishes itâ<u>apparently as evidence of it</u>.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>6)     The Bank knew precisely the purpose of the loan to Akai : it was to be used immediately to discharge the Singer NV loan. Onthe face of it, there was no benefit to Akai (a publicly listed company in Hong Kong with 57% of its shares held by the public) bytaking up this loan. To the contrary, the prejudice to Akai was apparent with an immediate assumption of a US$30 million liabilitytogether with its pledge of securities in Akai Electric.</p>    <p>7)     Mr. Ting, apart from his role in Singer NV, was also the Chairman and Chief Executive of Akai. Both Akai and Singer NV werealso partly owned by STC Canada which Mr. Ting had a substantial interest. In my view the conflict of roles of Mr. Ting was readilyapparent to the Bank without the need to resort to post event hindsight.</p>    <p>8)     Yet despite this, the Bank did not comply with its internal practice of making inquiry such as seeking proper evidence of approvalby the board of Akai of this transaction or seeking legal advice on the authority of Mr. Ting to enter into the transaction on behalfof Akai.</p>    <p>9)     The 4 December 1998 Executive Committee Minute of Akai obtained by the Bank was clearly not a proper proof of Mr. Tingâsauthority. It was not a board minute of Akai. The Bank had the Akaiâs Bye Laws which provided for disclosure requirements and howapproval in transactions of this type can be obtained. The minute did not show compliance with the standard requirements. The Bankhad plenty of opportunity to inquire when there was a two month period for the transaction to be completed.</p>    <p>10)     In my view the fact that the Bank was dealing directly with Mr. Ting who was the Chairman and Chief Executive of Akai couldnot have possibly justified its conduct in this case. If the Bank chose not to inquire in unusual circumstances because of fear ofoffending its customer, they must take with the benefit of not annoying their customer the risk of liability because they do notinquire : <i>AL Underwood v. Bank of Liverpool</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1924%5d%201%20KB%20775" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1924] 1 KB 775</a> at 793 per Scrutton LJ.</p>    <p>11)     In my view the conduct of the Bank had clearly not met the objective standard of what a reasonable banker in the circumstancesof the case would have done. To adopt some of the suggestions used by Lord Nicholls in <i>Royal Brunei Airlines</i> with modification to suit this case, a reasonable banker does not participate in a transaction which he knows involves a misapplicationof trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiary. A reasonable banker does not deliberately close his eyes or ears or deliberatelynot ask questions, lest he learns something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.</p>    <p>12)     As the Court of Appeal of New South Wales observed in <i>Yeshiva Properties No. 1 Property Ltd and others v. Marshall</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=219%20ALR%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">219 ALR 112</a> at 118 per Mason P that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â.... it is not necessary that the fraudulent scheme or purpose of the fiduciary or trustee should be fully known, or should beunderstood in any detail at all; the test is complied with if the known facts would communicate to a reasonable person a generalunderstanding that there was a fraud, breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>13)     Similar views were expressed by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Barlow Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation) and others v. Eurotrust International Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20WLR%201476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 WLR 1476</a> at [28] (as case of dishonest assistance) that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â......Someone can know, and can certainly suspect, that he is assisting in a misappropriation of money without knowing that themoneyis held on trust or what a trust means: see the <i>Twinsectra case</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20AC%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 AC 164</a>, para 19 (Lord Hoffmann) and para 135 (Lord Millett).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>14)     For the reasons I have given I respectfully disagree with the learned Judgeâs view. In my view the state of knowledge ofthe Bank of the transaction made it unconscionable to enter into it. The requisite knowledge in knowing receipt was established.It is not necessary to treat banks as recipients in knowing receipt in a separate category. Their liability is merely an illustrationof how knowing receipt can apply in a given situation.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of fiduciary duty</p>    <p><a name="p247" class="para" id="p247">247.</a>  1)     My view is that Mr. Ting had clearly acted in breach of his fiduciary duty towards Akai. The starting point is that Mr. Tingwas in a situation of actual conflict in his role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Akai and Chairman of Singer NV, yethe decided alone that Akai should assume the liability of Singer NV and without making the proper disclosure. As the High Court ofAustralia observed in <i>R v. Byrnes and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20183%20CLR%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 183 CLR 501</a> at 517, per Brennan J, Deane J, Toohey J and Gaudron J</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â.... a director who takes part in a decision to enter into a transaction in which the director or a third party in whom the directorhas an interest or to whom the director owes a fiduciary duty stands to gain an advantage or benefit but who does not make an adequatedisclosure of his interest acts improperly.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Not only has Mr. Ting not made the proper disclosure, he went so far as to produce a false minute of the Executive Committee meetingpurporting to authorize his conduct.</p>    <p>2)     Further this was done without any arrangement being put into effect to protect Akai. There was no recourse agreement by Akaiagainst Singer NV in the event that the Bank pursued against Akai on the loan. Akai received no apparent benefit whatsoever fromthe loan as the money immediately went back to the Bank in discharge of Singer NVâs liability towards the Bank. To the contrarythe assumption of the new liability must be from the view point of Akai to its prejudice. It was not in the ordinary course of businessof Akai to assume the financial responsibility of Singer NV. Dr. Holmes of Akai, the only witness who could provide evidence on theoperation of Akai was not even asked in cross examination by the Bank whether the transaction was to the benefit of Akai.</p>    <p>3)     The only justification that has been advanced is a rhetorical one and that is why should Mr. Ting do something to harm Akai?I do not regard this to be an answer to the conduct of Mr. Ting. Akai, Singer NV and STC Canada are separate legal entities and eachhad its own interest to look after. One would really go into speculation by saying that the deal was to prevent Singer NV from goinginto default so as to avoid a domino effect on the rest of the group including Akai, when Mr. Ting who engineered the switch transactiongave no evidence as to why the switch transaction was carried out.</p>    <p>4)     It is not necessary for me to express a view on which of the tests in <i>Equiticorp</i> and <i>Charterbridge</i> is the proper test. Even if the <i>Charterbridge</i> test is the correct one, the Bank will still encounter difficulties. First, to adopt the words of the learned Judge there is an âevidentialvacuumâ for the Court to find in the first place that the transaction was for the benefit of the group as a whole. If this pointcannot be satisfied how can the Court move further and consider that it was for the benefit of Akai as well? Second and more importantly,it is not simply a case where the interest of Akai was not considered. On the contrary the switch transaction was blatantly to thedisadvantage of Akai.</p>    <p class="heading">Is setting aside the transaction a pre-requisite?</p>    <p><a name="p248" class="para" id="p248">248.</a>  I agreed with Tang VPâs analysis of the respective speech of Lord Nicholls and Lord Scott of Foscote in <i>Criterion Properties</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p249" class="para" id="p249">249.</a>  The reference to âbinding contractâ and âexecutory contractâ in that case is in the context of a discussion on whether thedefence of actual or apparent authority can be relied upon by a person when the agent has carried out acts which are contrary tothe commercial acts of the agentâs principal. If the defence can be established, then in the words of Lord Nicholls âthe agreementis found to be valid and is therefore not set aside, questions of knowing receipt.... does not ariseâ. In this case the issue ofknowing receipt arises because the Bank failed in its case on authority. As Lord Scott observed in <i>Criterion</i> at [31]</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â... if a person dealing with an agent knows or has reason to believe that the contract or transaction is contrary to the commercialinterests of the agentâs principal, it is likely to be very difficult for the person to assert with any credibility that he believedthe agent did have actual authority. Lack of such a belief would be fatal to a claim that the agent had apparent authority.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Defence</p>    <p><a name="p250" class="para" id="p250">250.</a>  I agree with the learned Judgeâs view that the defendant failed in their defence of election and change of position. In respectof the latter, I would further rely on what Nourse LJ said in <i>Akindele</i> at page 456 that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â......Moreover, if the circumstances of the receipt are such as to make it unconscionable for the recipient to retain the benefitof it, there is an obvious difficulty in saying that it is equitable for a change of position to afford him a defence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Dishonest Assistance/Strict liability</p>    <p><a name="p251" class="para" id="p251">251.</a>  As liability based on knowing receipt is established against the Bank, it is not necessary for me to discuss whether dishonest assistanceis also established or the issue of strict liability.</p>    <p class="heading">Equitable Compensation</p>    <p><a name="p252" class="para" id="p252">252.</a>  The learned Judge assessed the compensation to Akai in the event that it could succeed on knowing receipt in the sum of US$20,504,295.38which was the proceeds of sale of 50.5 million Akai Electric shares in May 2000 (Akai does not claim for the value of the 5.5 millionshares that were returned to it in 1999).</p>    <p><a name="p253" class="para" id="p253">253.</a>  Two issues arising from this topic. First, did the Bank receive property for the purpose of knowing receipt? Second, is US$20,504,295.38the correct award?</p>    <p><a name="p254" class="para" id="p254">254.</a>  On the first issue the Bank argued that the liability for knowing receipt is a liability to account for the value of assets received,the Bank did not receive any assets from Akai by the grant of the share pledge. The Bankâs interest was merely a security interest.It only received assets when it received the proceeds of enforcing its security in 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p255" class="para" id="p255">255.</a>  1)     In my view there was transfer of property within the meaning of knowing receipt. The Bank relied on <i>Re MC Bacon Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20BCLC%20324" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] BCLC 324.</a> Millett J in considering section 238(4) of the Insolvency Act 1986 which is concerned with the depletion of a companyâs assetsby transaction at an undervalue held that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦.By charging its assets the company appropriates them to meet the liabilities due to the secured creditor and adversely affectsthe rights of other creditors in the event of insolvency. But it does not deplete its assets or diminish their value. It retainsthe right to redeem and the right to sell or remortgage the charged assets. All it loses is the ability to apply the proceeds otherwisethan in satisfaction of the secured debt. That is not someÂ­thing capable of valuation in monetary terms and is not customarily disposedof for value.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>2)     However, the security in that case was a debenture over the companyâs fixed and floating assets. I do not see this can berelevant in terms of pledge of shares which had been actually disposed of by the Bank.</p>    <p>3)     The Bank also relied on <i>Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. v. Kanishi (Far East) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%202%20HKLRD%2052" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 2 HKLRD 52</a> where the question was whether the security interest in the shares arising from the loan was a simple pledge with no proprietaryinterest. Ma J (as he then was) held at page 60 that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âShares are choses in action and not choses in possession. It is therefore not possible, as Mr Fung rightly accepted, to createa pledge of shares, as one would pledge either choses in possession (ie physical objects) or, certain types of choses in action,which by custom, are equivalent to the objects they represent (such as bills of lading, which represent cargoes, or bills of exchange,which are treated as cash): see <i>Harrold v Plenty</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1901%5d%202%20Ch%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1901] 2 Ch 314</a> at p.316. The depositing of share certificates or instruments of transfer cannot therefore constitute a pledge of the underlyingshares. All that is pledged here are pieces of paper: see <i>EG Tan &amp; Co</i><i>v Chase Manhattan Bank NA</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%203%20MLJ%20301" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 3 MLJ 301</a> at p.307 (High Court of Singapore).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>However Ma J also held that, that the âpledgeâ was in truth an equitable mortgage by the depositing of shares, certificates andinstrument of transfer.</p>    <p>4) I do not need to go into the debate about the nature of depositing share certificates or instruments of transfer because in myview the pledge of the Akai Electric shares to the Bank can be treated as an equitable mortgage. The pledge included an express powerof sale and appointment of the Bank as Akaiâs power of attorney for the purpose of exercising the power of sale.</p>    <p>5) In <i>Gold</i>, Iacobucci J discussed the question whether the giving of a guarantee was in the nature of a trust property for the purpose of knowingreceipt. He concluded that it was because in that case there was a collateral mortgage of real property as well. But he further addedat [54] and [55] that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[54] ... Even if one takes the position that the guarantee does not constitute trust property, the giving of the guarantee confersa valuable benefit on the Bank and correspondingly encumbers the estate and detracts from its value. The benefit conferred on theBank and the resulting loss in value suffered by the estate are sufficient, in my view, to bring the guarantee within the knowingreceipt category of liability.â</p>        <p class="quote">[55] Furthermore, in the present action, the Bank has attempted to enforce the guarantee against Primary. If the guarantee is enforced,then the Bank will clearly receive property. For these reasons and on policy grounds, in my opinion, the disputed guarantee can bethe subject of a claim in knowing receipt.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See also <i>Doneley v. Doneley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%201%20Qd%20R%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 1 Qd R 602.</a> In my view the same reasoning applied to the present case as well and the Bank did receive trust property for the purpose of knowingreceipt.</p>    <p><a name="p256" class="para" id="p256">256.</a>  On the second issue, Akai argued that the compensation should be US$50,775,031 which was the market value of the shares when theBank received the shares of 4 December 1998. Alternatively the compensation should be US$71,103,196 which was the historical highestvalue of the shares. This, however, was not pressed upon in the reply submission of Akai.</p>    <p><a name="p257" class="para" id="p257">257.</a>  1)     In my view the amount awarded by the Judge is the correct figure. The law in this area is succinctly summarised by WarrenCJ of the Court of Appeal of Victoria, Australia in <i>G.M. &amp; A.M. Pearce &amp; Co. Pty Ltd v. Australian Tallow Producers and Others</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSCA/2005/113.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] VSCA 113</a> that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[65] The measure of equitable compensation is that sum which would restore the plaintiff to the position he or she would have beenin had the breach not occurred. Equitable compensation is not assessed with respect to the foreseeable value at the time the breachof fiduciary duty occurred. This principle is explained by McLachlin J in Canson Enterprises Ltd v Boughton &amp; Co. in referenceto an earlier case, Guerin v The Queen, where damages awarded at common law (compensation as assessed from the date of breach) fromequitable compensation. With respect to equitable compensation, McLachlin J clearly stated that damages will be based on the trialdate âhaving regard to what actually happenedâ, as is the case in an equitable award for restitution. Her Ladyship moreover statedthat it is essential that losses made good are only those which, âon a common sense view of causation, were caused by the breachâ.The dicta of McLachlin J in Canson Enterprises has been followed in Australia, and notably, by the House of Lords in Target HoldingsLtd v Redferns. In Target Holdings, Lord Browne-Wilkinson (with whom Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Ackner, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettleand Lord Lloyd of Berwick agreed) held that :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â Equitable compensation for breach of trust is designed to achieve exactly what the word compensation suggests. To make good aloss in fact suffered by the beneficiaries and which, using hindsight and common-sense, can be seen to have been caused by the breachâ.</p>            <p class="quote">The court is also entitled, with the full benefit of hindsight, not to speculate against the interest of the plaintiff. â¦.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>2)     Further as the High Court of Australia observed in <i>Maquire and Another v. Makaronis and Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=188%20CLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">188 CLR 449</a> at 469 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron J, McHugh J and Gummow J :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âRecovery is sought in respect of a loss. ...... It is appropriate to begin with those fiduciaries who are trustees. The obligationof a defaulting trustee is essentially one of the effecting restitution to the trust estate. In Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns (78),Lord Browne-Wilkinson said:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">â The equitable rules of compensation for breach of trust have been largely developed in relation to such traditional trusts, wherethe only way in which all the beneficiariesâ rights can be protected is to restore to the trust fund what ought to be there. Insuch a case the basic rule is that a trustee in breach of trust must restore or pay to the trust estate either the assets which havebeen lost to the estate by reason of the breach or compensation for such loss. Courts of Equity did not award damages but, actingin personam, ordered the defaulting trustee to restore the trust estate.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">His Lordship continued, with reference to decisions of Lord Eldon (when Master of the Rolls) in Caffrey v Darby, Lord Cottenham LCin Clough v Bond, Street J in Re Dawson (deceased) and Brightman LJ in Bartlett v Barclays Trust Co [Nos 1 and 2]:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âIf specific restitution of the trust property is not possible, then the liability of the trustee is to pay sufficient compensationto the trust estate to put it back to what it would have been had the breach not been committed...Even if the immediate cause ofthe loss is the dishonesty or failure of a third party, the trustee is liable to make good that loss to the trust estate if, butfor the breach, such loss would not have occurred.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>3)     In the present case Akai lost the shares when they were pledged on 4 December 1998, the market value of which was US$50,775,031.This was the date when the breach occurred. However, one must recognize that the losses made good are only those which âon a commonsense view of causation, were caused by the breachâ. In my view it was when the shares were disposed of in 2000 they were put beyondthe reach of Akai. While one must not speculate against the interest of Akai, there really was no evidence from Akai about what useit would have on those shares. Certainly there was no indication the shares would have been disposed of in the market on 4 December1998. In my view the compensation that should be awarded is US$20,504,295.38 together with interest and fees paid by Akai to theBank in the sum of US$2.037 million for the use of the loan. The Judgeâs order on compound interest, namely 1% over US$LIBOR fromtime to time prevailing, with quarterly rests was not challenged by the Bank.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p258" class="para" id="p258">258.</a>  I would also allow the appeal by Akai.</p>    <p><a name="p259" class="para" id="p259">259.</a>  Although I took a different view of the case from the learned Judge, I would like to express my gratitude to him for his effortsin dealing with the complicated issues of fact and law of this mammoth case.</p>    <p><b>Hon Tang VP:</b></p>    <p><a name="p260" class="para" id="p260">260.</a>  Accordingly, we allow the appeal and enter judgment for the Plaintiff in the sum of US$22,541,332 together with compound interestat the rate of 1% over US Dollar LIBOR from time to time prevailing with quarterly rests from 6 December 1999.
