The respondent (the1st defendant) was the hirer of the barge. This appeal concerns an application to amend the plaintiffs' statement of claim made on10 June 1996, over 8 years after the writ was issued.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The judge, Cheung J, refused leave. He concluded that the application to amend was barred by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s35(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap 347</a> which, as relevant, reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(3) Except as provided by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 30</a> or by rules of court, the court shall not allow a new claim ... to be made in the course of any action after the expiry of any timelimit under this Ordinance which would affect a new action to enforce that claim."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The rules of court relevant for this purpose are Order 20 r5(2) and (5) which state:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(2) Where an application to the Court for leave to make the amendment mentioned in paragraph ... (5) is made after any relevant periodof limitation current at the date of issue of the writ has expired, the Court may nevertheless grant such leave in the circumstancesmentioned in that paragraph if it thinks it just to do so.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3) ....</p>        <p class="quote">(4) ....</p>        <p class="quote">(5) An amendment may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment will be to add or substitutea new cause of action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of actionin respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to make the amendment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The judge held that: (1) the proposed amendments pleaded new causes of action and (2) they did not substantially arise out of thesame facts as the cause of action in respect of which relief was claimed in the action. He accordingly refused the application toamend. Hence the appeal to this court.</p>    <p class="heading">The pleaded claim for relief</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The indorsement in the writ as pleaded against the 1st defendant states:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"<em>INDORSEMENT OF CLAIM</em></p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The Plaintiffs claim against the 1st defendant, as charterers and/or hirer of the barge SHUI NAM NO. 1' (the Barge'), for damagesfor breach of contract entered into between the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant on or about the 27th November 1987 relating to theuse and/or hire of the Barge and/or breach of duty of care relating to the use and/or hire of the Barge ...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> As can be seen, this makes claims against the 1st Defendant based broadly on breaches of contractual duty and on the basis of tortiousliability.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The statement of claim filed on 8 June 1988 pleaded an oral agreement made on about 27 November 1987 whereby it was agreed that the1st Defendant would charter the barge for a voyage from Hong Kong to Macau, the barge to be redelivered to the plaintiffs in HongKong.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The particulars subsequently delivered allege that the barge was incapable of self-propulsion and that the 1st Defendant, under thearrangement between the parties, provided a tug to tow the barge: the barge was accordingly under the control of the 1st Defendantat all material times.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The plaintiffs averred that, from these facts, the legal incidence of bailment arose; that the 1st Defendant failed to redeliverthe barge to the plaintiffs; the plaintiffs accordingly claimed the sum of $1.2m against the 1st Defendant, being the value of thebarge.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> This was the sole cause of action as averred in the statement of claim.</p>    <p class="heading">The proposed amendments</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> By the amendments proposed in their summons of 10 June 1996 the plaintiffs sought, in effect, to revive the causes of action previouslypleaded in the indorsement of claim in the writ: (1) breach of the 1st Defendant's contractual duties relating to the use and operationof the barge on its voyage from Hong Kong to Macau and (2) breach of the 1st Defendant's duty of care in tort, based upon similarfacts.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> As far as the contractual duties are concerned these arise, on the proposed amendments, from the same contractual arrangements whichhave already been pleaded, either expressly or by implication. What is new, in effect, is the averment of breach of those duties.By pleading <em>bailment</em> in the original pleadings, the plaintiffs avoided the need to aver how the loss of the barge occurred; now they say that the lossof the barge arose through the 1st Defendant's breaches of duty in contract, alternatively in tort. In essence, the additional avermentsallege (i) failure to provide a suitable tug; (ii) failure to heed the meteorological conditions before embarking on the voyage and(iii) failure to react adequately when the emergency arose.</p>    <p class="heading">The judge's <em>approach</em></p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The judge held, in my view correctly, that these are new claims or new causes of action. The question then arises: Do they arisesubstantially out of the same facts as the original cause of action?</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The judge said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The facts upon which the Plaintiffs plead their existing relief are simple, namely, the agreement between the parties for the hiringof the barge and its return and the failure of the Defendants to return the barge. The facts now relied upon by the Plaintiffs insupport of its new pleadings are different. The Plaintiffs were simply not concerned with the condition or the construction of thebarge and the tug, the weather conditions when the vessels were put to sea and the safety arrangements of the barge. All these relatedto the cause of the loss of the barge. The new causes of action do not arise from the facts of the original cause of action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The judge is, in my view, correct to say that the facts pointing to the cause of loss of the barge are new: But is that conclusiveof the issue before him?</p>    <p class="heading">Proper construction of Order 20 r5(5)</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The words in Order 20 r5(5) are not to be narrowly construed: they should be given a broad and liberal interpretation in order toattain the objective of the rules. By focusing attention on the <em>additional</em> averments which the plaintiffs need to make to establish the new causes of action, the judge has, in my judgment, applied the provisionsof Order 20 r5(5) too narrowly.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> If one looks at the issue broadly, what does one see? The contractual duties which are now pleaded arise from the original contract;the duty of care likewise arises from the relationship of owner and charterer of the barge as originally pleaded. There is no completeoverlap of facts because, in the new causes of action, additional facts have to be pleaded. This does not, however, take the caseout of Order 20 r5(5).</p>    <p class="heading">Discretion</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The judge having adopted an erroneous approach by construing the effect of Order 20 r5(5) too narrowly, the matter now falls uponus to exercise the discretion afresh.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Here the circumstances are overwhelmingly in favour of the plaintiffs. The same issues between the parties have already been raisedin the Third Party proceedings in a parallel action, High Court Action No. 7987/1990, which was on 3 July 1992 ordered by consentto be tried immediately after High Court CL-7/88 by the same judge, the parties to be bound by the judgment on common issues.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> These averments now to be added by amendment in the pleadings in CL-7/88 were in fact first raised in the Third Party proceedingsback in February 1991 in the other action.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> It has not been submitted on behalf of the 1st Defendant that any prejudice would in fact inure if the amendments were allowed. Thearguments which have been put to us with great cogency and skill by Mr Sussex focus on the proper application of Order 20 r5(5).</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In my judgment the appeal should be allowed and the judge's order of 28 June 1996 should be discharged. We should make an order allowingthe amendment in terms of the plaintiffs' summons of the 10 June 1996.</p>    <p>Godfrey JA:</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> I agree; but, since we are differing from the judge, I propose to add a few words of my own.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> In my opinion, the claim based on negligence and breach of contract which the plaintiffs now seek to revive, although a claim ofa different character from that originally pleaded in the statement of claim (i.e., a claim founded on an allegation of bailment)is a claim which arises out of substantially the same facts; indeed the identical facts, save that it is now sought to supplementthose facts with some additional facts necessary to support the allegations of negligence and breach of contract. In these circumstances,although the judge thought otherwise, the requirements of the rule to which my Lord Litton, V.P. has referred, Order 20 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5(5)</a>, are satisfied, and I agree that we should exercise our discretion in the manner he proposes.</p>    <p>Liu JA:</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> What should have been brought forward, once and for all, for final adjudication comprises, so it is submitted, quite a differentcause of action which is not based on the same or substantially the same facts.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Assuming, in the circumstances of this case, a claim in bailment be materially different from the proposed claim based on what allegedlycaused the barge to founder, the pleadings and the conduct of proceedings in this case have been such that this court should strivefor bringing together all the issues for doing full justice.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> I have also taken into account the once widely pleaded case in the general indorsement on writ and what is being regarded as thesame claim when the third party proceedings in the personal injury action are turned into a fully-fledged demand by, but a smallamendment to include the value of the lost barge. It would seem that no real prejudice would be caused to the 1st defendant if thisnew claim were admitted. The plaintiffs as applicants would evidently suffer prejudice without a joinder. Moreover, the 2nd defendantrelies on an Act of God for the loss of the barge, and events which caused or contributed to the sinking of the barge are expectedto be investigated at the trial. Mr Sussex concedes that if the Act of God defence of the 2nd defendant should succeed, the plaintiffs'claim against the 1st defendant would also be defeated. Therefore, in any event how the barge came to be lost at sea will be an issuein the action, and causation of loss of the barge will be as crucial to the 2nd defendant as it will be to the 1st defendant. Whatcaused the barge to founder cannot be realistically detached from the nature of the plaintiffs' case against the 1st defendant, whicharose also from the loss of the barge, albeit in bailment. For this reason alone, I think I would be right in concluding, thoughnot without diffidence, that there is a "significant overlap" of factual matrix between the existing claim and the cause of actionproposed to be added, both based on the loss of the barge. After all, overlapping is "substantially a matter of impression". See<em>Welsh Development Agency v. Redpath Norman Long Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 WLR 1409</a> at p. 1418D.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> In this case, loss of the barge led to the breach complained of by the plaintiffs, and when one looks beyond the pleaded duty ofthe 1st defendant in default to "the nature and extent of the breach" relied upon by the plaintiffs and "the nature and extent ofthe damage" complained of, it is reasonably clear that the proposed claim to be added cannot be said, as a matter of degree, to bea new cause of action.

Trollope &amp; Colls</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2033%20BLR%2077" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 33 BLR 77</a> at pp. 98 - 99.
