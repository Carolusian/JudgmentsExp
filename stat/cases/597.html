The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff has also taken out a summons asking for security for costs if leave is granted to the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Judgment arises from an appeal by the Defendant from the decision of a Master dated 20 October 2006.  In his decision, the Masterentered summary judgment against the Defendant in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup>  Plaintiff and dismissed the Defendantâs application for striking out the claim of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.  In the judgment, I allowed the Defendantâs appeal against the Masterâs decision to the extent that I affirmed thesummary judgment in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, but the order refusing to strike out the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs claim was set aside.  I further ordered that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs claim be struck out.  The Defendant is now seeking leave to appeal against the judgment in respect of the summary judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The action arises from a simple claim for unsettled premium of insurance policies undertaken by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as an insurer.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff appointed the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff as its general agent and authorized the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, among other things, to collect premium on its behalf.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Defendant was a company carrying on business as an insurance agent.  Mr. Li Wai Ming, the representative of the Defendant inthis hearing, is the director of the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Plaintiffs' case</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs case is that the Defendant, through the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, became an agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff on 19 September 2002.  On or about 25 September 2002, the âAgent Agreementâ signed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was sent to Defendant.  Although the Defendant did not sign and return the Agent Agreement, it had agreed to act and actedas an agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff by its conduct.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  From November 2002 to April 2003, the Defendant had requested the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff through the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff to issue various insurance policies which the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff did issue.  The Defendant only settled part of the premium it received and still owed the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff $153,949.65.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Defences</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Defendantâs main defence is that, so far as the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff is concerned, the Defendant did not have any contractual relationship with the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  All the transactions in respect of the policies issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff were transactions of Mr. Li in his personal capacity.  The transactions have nothing to do with the Defendant.  MoreoverMr. Li only dealt with Mr. Derek Tsang of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff in these transactions.  He did not deal with the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In so far as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff is concerned, the Defendantâs case is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff had no locus standi to sue the Defendant as it was only an agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, its disclosed principal.  I found that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff was only acting as an agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in dealing with the Defendant.  The contract was entered into between the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the Defendant.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff had no right to institute proceedings against the Defendant for the outstanding premium due to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and therefore no locus standi to sue the Defendant.  On this basis, I struck out the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The major dispute of fact, so far as the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs claim is concerned, is whether the Agent Agreement was sent to the Defendant on or about 25 September 2002.  I foundthat this dispute of fact was immaterial.  What is important is whether it was the Defendant or Mr. Li who acted as agent of the1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff when the relevant insurance policies were issued by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Based on the undisputed evidence of the case, which is overwhelming and cannot be disputed in my view, I found that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the Defendant were in a contractual relationship and Defendant acted as agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff in respect of the insurance policies in question.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Defendant also pleaded illegality as defence and counter-claim for damages for alleged tort committed by the debt collectorsinstructed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  I ruled that the contract between the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the Defendant was not illegal.  I further ruled that the alleged tort, arising out of a totally separate and distincttransaction, has no connection whatsoever with the present claim by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  It cannot be relied upon as an excuse to impeach the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs claim for the premium of the policies it had issued.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><u>The Test</u></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The proper test in considering whether to grant leave to appeal is set out in <b><i>Smith v Cosworth Casting Processes Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%201539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 1539</a>, that is, whether the applicant has a realistic prospect of success.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In the 9<sup>th</sup> affirmation of Li Wai Ming, the Defendant advances 4 grounds of appeal. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In the 1<sup>st</sup> ground, the Defendant says the communications between Derek Tsang and Mr. Li would support the Defendantâs case that the transactionsin questions were only dealt with by Mr. Li personally.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In the 2<sup>nd</sup> ground and 3<sup>rd</sup> ground of appeal, the Defendant criticises that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff has never sworn any affidavit in support of the claim and has never produced any accounting records and tax return concerningthe transactions with the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> ground of appeal is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff has made âinstantâ evidence at different stages of the proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In its written submission and further submission in court, the Defendant has also suggested I have misunderstood the Defendant'sdefence on ground of illegality.  I will not repeat here the reasons I have given in my judgment.  Suffice it for me to say thatthis ground has been considered and I disagree with the Defendant.  In its submission in court, the Defendant appears to add onemore ground, namely, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff's solicitor had no instruction to represent the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff on previous hearing and that Ms. Susan Liang, solicitor representing the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, is acting in champerty and has no proper authority to act for 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  However there is no evidence before the court to support this serious allegation against Ms. Liang.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On the other grounds of appeal, the Defendant is only arguing again on the weight of evidence which I had considered before I reachedthe judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I need to repeat here that Order 14 places the threshold onus on the Defendant to show that there is a triable issue.  The Courtwill test the credibility of an affidavit asserting a triable issue against the conduct of the Defendant and contemporary documents. The Court should not be asked to embark on a mini trial on affidavit evidence.  The issue is not whether the Defendantâs assertionsare to be believed, it is whether those assertions are believable. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In my judgment I found there was no triable issue in the relationship between the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the Defendant on the undisputed evidence and contemporary documents which are overwhelmingly against the Defendant. The Defendant made registration with IARB as agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  Mr. Li did not register as agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff.  The instructions for application for the relevant insurance policies were faxed by the Defendantâs staff without indicationat the instructions that the requests for policies were made by Mr. Li personally.  The insured were given receipts which bore thestamp of the Defendantâs company chop.  Some of the payments of premium were deposited into the bank account of the Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  On these undisputed evidence, I found the assertions of the Defendant that the transactions were Mr. Li's personal dealings andthat there was no contractual relationship between the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the Defendant totally unbelievable.  The Defendant, by its conduct issuing the relevant policies for the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and collecting premium from the insured, must be acting as the agent of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff with an implied term that the premium must be accounted for the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.  I cannot see any reasons that the case should go to trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  To conclude, I am of the view that there is no merit in the Defendant's application.  I find that the Defendant has no realisticprospect of success in its appeal which is bound to fail.  Accordingly, I refuse to give leave to appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Defendant has been liable to pay back the premium to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff for 3 Â½ years.  To date, the outstanding premium is still unpaid.  There is no good reason to delay the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff from enjoying the fruits of his success in the litigation.  I therefore also refuse to stay the execution of the judgment. For this reason, I do not need to make any order in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs summons for security for costs. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Costs should follow the event.  I make a costs order nisi that the Defendant do pay the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs costs of the application for leave to appeal.  The order nisi shall be made absolute after 14 days.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="19">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center" height="19">( C.P.
