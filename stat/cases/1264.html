The matter before the judge was an applicationunder Order 12 rule 8 of the Rules of the District Court wherein the defendant sought orders first for a declaration that âin thecircumstances of the case the Courts of Hong Kong have no jurisdiction over the defendant in respect of the subject matter of theclaim in this actionâ and secondly that the action should be dismissed as the plaintiffâs claim was time-barred by virtue ofArticle 29 of the Amended Warsaw Convention (âthe Conventionâ) as set out in Schedule 1 of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/500" class="autolink_findacts">Carriage By Air Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/500">Cap. 500</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ).  The judge made the declarations sought and dismissed the plaintiffâs action under Order 33 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/500/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 7.</a>  At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal judgment was reserved which we now give.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiff is a minor and sues by his mother as his next friend.  On 14 August 2004 the plaintiff, then aged 13, travelled fromKuala Lumpur to Hong Kong on one of the defendantâs aircraft.  He was travelling on a return ticket to Kuala Lumpur purchased byhis uncle.  Since he was alone he travelled as an âUnaccompanied Minorâ.  The following facts are taken from the statement ofclaim and assumed as correct for the purposes of this application.  When the plaintiff arrived in Hong Kong he was âgreeted andcollected by the defendant and/orâ by a Ms Evon, who was described as being an agent of the defendant.  They walked together towardsthe Customs and Immigration areas.  Ms Evon noted that the plaintiff looked pale and was told that the plaintiff had a headache. Ms Evon told the plaintiff to lineup at the immigration queue and she then left him and walked towards the immigration channel reservedfor cabin crew.  When the plaintiff was about to walk up to the immigration counter he fainted and fell down.  He hit his head onthe marble floor and sustained severe head injuries.  He was admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital.  He had a fractured skulland right frontal lobe contusion and subdural haematoma.  The operation to remove the intracerebral haematoma and subdural haematomawas only carried out some 12 days later.  The plaintiff still suffers from attentional problems, forgetfulness, reduced deficiencyin learning and emotional problems.  Apparently there is a risk of epilepsy which is estimated 20%, however that is calculated.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The plaintiffâs case is put upon 2 bases.  In paragraph 2 of the amended statement of claim it is pleaded that the plaintiff wasthe holder of valid ticket for the flight and that the defendant was fully aware that the plaintiff was a young passenger travellingalone.  That paragraph then continues:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âc)        It is an expressed, alternatively, an implied terms of the issuing of the air ticket to the Plaintiff, that the Defendantshall:</p>        <p class="quote">-   take full charge of the plaintiff the moment he checks in;</p>        <p class="quote">-   escort the Plaintiff throughout the departure and arrival formalities, including immigration, security and boarding procedures;</p>        <p class="quote">-   arrange a flight crew or staff to accompany the Plaintiff during his travel from the originating port they were handed to an flightcrew or staff, when until the destination point, where the plaintiff was handed to the receiving party; and</p>        <p class="quote">-   arrange a flight crew or staff to accompany the plaintiff when going through the customs and immigration desk and the baggagereclaim section.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Allowing for lapses in the precision of the language, it is clear that that is a pleading that would lead to a claim under contract. Indeed it is clear that the claim is put on the basis of contract and negligence.  In paragraph 4 it is stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â4.  The aforesaid accident was caused by the breach of expressed and/or implied terms of contract and/or common duty of care and/orthe negligence on the part of the Defendant, its servants and/or agents.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  There then follows particulars of negligence which seemingly are applicable both to the claim in contract and the claim in negligence. The issue before the judge was whether the claim as pleaded was time-barred under the provisions of Article 29 of the Convention. That Article provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âArticle 29</p>        <p class="quote">The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within 2 years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination,or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The point arises because the writ in this action was issued on 23 August 2006 which was more than two years after the date on whichthe plaintiff suffered his injuries.  That, however, was not the only issue in the case that the judge had to decide.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The first issue was one of jurisdiction.  Article 28(1) of the Convention provides that</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âArticle 28</p>        <p class="quote">(1) An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties,either before the court having jurisdiction where the carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, orhas an establishment by which the contract has been made or before the court having jurisdiction at the place of destination.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The judge considered that when the plaintiff suffered his injury he had still been in the course of disembarkation but that theHong Kong courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffâs claim because the plaintiff was travelling under a return ticketto Kuala Lumpur.  Whilst the return portion of the ticket was never used because, eventually, the plaintiff travelled directly toAustralia, the judge held that the fact that it was abandoned because of the accident on 14 August 2004 could not be taken to transformHong Kong from being a stopping place in the contract of carriage to the place of destination.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Although it was strictly unnecessary, the judge, nevertheless, went on to consider the question as to whether the action would betime-barred by reason of the provisions of Article 29.  Given the fact that the journey was never completed the judge had difficultyin applying the provisions of Article 29.  He came to the tentative conclusion, however, that the plaintiff might well be withinthe prescribed 2-year limit on the basis that although the journey had never been completed it could be said that the carriage hadnot stopped more than 2 years prior to the issue of the writ.</p>    <p class="heading">This appeal</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On this appeal Mr Lai, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, considered that the issue on the appeal turned on what he describedas âone very simple point, namely whether the Warsaw Convention applies to the facts of this accident.â  In short, his argumentwas that the plaintiff had completed the process of disembarking from the aircraft and hence the claim did not fall within the termsof Article 17 of the Convention.  Article 17 provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âCHAPTER III</p>        <p class="quote">LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER</p>        <p class="quote">Article 17</p>        <p class="quote">The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury sufferedby a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any ofthe operations of embarking or disembarking.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Counsel relied on a number of decisions of courts in the United States to support his argument that once the plaintiff had reachedthe terminal building and was approaching the immigration counter he had completed the process of disembarking.  On that basis itwas said that the contract of carriage was complete and therefore the Convention ceased to apply by the time of the accident.  Inthose circumstances, where the action was brought in respect of a purely local incident, there was no reason why the Hong Kong courtsshould not have jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr Stock, who appeared on behalf of the respondent, took a number of points.  The first was a point that was apparently argued inthe court below but not dealt with by the judge.  It was that the Convention did apply in the present case even if the claim didnot fall within Article 17.  The short reason is that it was a claim which arose out of a contract of international carriage by air. The second point was that even if the applicability of the Convention depended upon whether the claim fell within Article 17 thatwas satisfied because the judge was correct in reaching the conclusion that the plaintiff was still in the process of disembarkinguntil the time that the plaintiff was to be handed over to the appointed guardian at the airport.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Whilst seeking to uphold the judge on the question of jurisdiction, it was argued that the judge should have held that the claimwas time-barred and that time began to run against the plaintiff no later than 21 August 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  I consider that the starting point of the consideration of the issues in this case must be the basis of the claim.  Paragraph 3(c),set out above, makes it quite clear that it is the plaintiffâs case that the claim is based on events which are within the contractualambit, the contract being concluded on the issue of the air ticket.  Leaving aside any question as to who was in the circumstancesof the present case the contracting party, the pleading is clear that there was one single contract which therefore included notmerely the conveyance in the aircraft but also the escorting and supervision of the plaintiff in particular at the airport in HongKong.  To this extent, therefore, the plaintiffâs contract with the airline is markedly different from any contract which any adultmight make in normal circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The first question which arises in this case, therefore, is whether Article 17 lays down the limits of the applicability of theConvention or whether it lays down the limits of the liability of the carrier in respect of claims, other than claims made by a passengeragainst the carrier for damage to his registered baggage which must be dealt with under Article 18 and claims for delay which mustbe dealt with under Article 19.  In this respect I derive considerable assistance from the speech of Lord Hope of Craighead in thecase of <i>Sidhu v British Airways PLC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 430.</a>  In that case the House of Lords was dealing with 2 appeals one from the Court of Appeal in England and the other from the Courtof Session in Scotland.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Both actions concerned claims by passengers who had been on board an aircraft which had landed in Kuwait shortly after the invasionby Iraq had commenced in 1990.  The pursuer in the second action claimed psychological injury due to stress resulting from her captivitywhich took place mainly in Iraq.  The injuries in respect of which the plaintiffs claimed included physical and psychological injuries. The pursuerâs claim was in breach of contract whilst the plaintiffsâ claim was in negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  As was recorded in different parts of his speech, Lord Hope stated clearly, for example at page 437H, that it was common groundthat neither the pursuer nor the plaintiffs had any claim against the respondents under Article 17 of the Convention.  Lord Hopedid not examine that contention to any great extent although at page 440H-441D he briefly referred to the reasons.  In the firstplace it was said that there had been no âaccidentâ causing damage which had taken place on board the aircraft as opposed tothe result of the passengers having been detained in Iraq.  In the second place it was said that the injuries sustained by the pursuer,namely stress resulting from her captivity and the pain of separation from her family the absence from work and loss of income dueto psychological consequences of the captivity, did not fall within the scope of âbodily injuryâ for the purposes of Article17.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  It was in those circumstances that it became relevant to consider the provisions of Article 24 which provide:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âArticle 24</p>        <p class="quote">(1) In the cases covered by Articles 18 and 19 any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditionsand limits set out in this Convention.</p>        <p class="quote">(2) In the cases covered by Article 17 the provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply, without prejudice to the questions asto who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Apart from a detailed consideration of the Convention itself, Lord Hope considered the statutory framework which provided for theapplication of the Convention, but also decisions by courts in the United Kingdom and in other jurisdictions as well as the <i>travaux prÄparatoires</i>.  In the course of that he said at page 447D-H:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe reference in the opening words of article 24(2) to âthe cases covered by article 17â does, of course, invite the questionwhether article 17 was intended to cover only those cases for which the carrier is liable in damages under that article.  The answerto that question may indeed be said to lie at the heart of this case.  In my opinion the answer to it is to be found not by an exactanalysis of the particular words used but by a consideration of the whole purpose of the article.  In its context the purpose seemsto me to be to prescribe the circumstances-that is to say, the only circumstances-in which a carrier will be liable in damages tothe passenger for claims arising out of his international carriage by air.</p>        <p class="quote">The phrase âthe cases covered by article 17â extends therefore to all claims made by the passenger against the carrier arisingout of international carriage by air, other than claims for damage to his registered baggage which must be dealt with under article18 and claims for delay which must be dealt with under article 19.  The words âhowever foundedâ which appear in article 24(1)and are applied to passengerâs claims by article 24(2) support this approach.  The intention seems to be to provide a secure regime,within which the restriction on the carrierâs freedom of contract is to operate.  Benefits are given to the passenger in return,but only in clearly defined circumstances to which the limits of liability set out by the Convention are to apply.  To permit exceptions,whereby a passenger could sue outwith the Convention for losses sustained in the course of international carriage by air, would distortthe whole system, even in cases for which the Convention did not create any liability on the part of the carrier.  Thus the purposeis to ensure that, in all questions relating to the carrierâs liability, it is the provisions of the Convention which apply andthat the passenger does not have access to any other remedies, whether under the common law or otherwise, which may be availablewithin the particular country where he chooses to raise his action.  The carrier does not need to make provision for the risk ofbeing subjected to such remedies, because the whole matter is regulated by the Convention.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In my view Lord Hopeâs analysis, quite apart from being very profound and perceptive, must be correct.  Article 17 taken togetherwith the rest of the Convention is clearly directed to liability.  Liability is imposed on the carrier when a) the passenger hassuffered a bodily injury and b) the bodily injury has been caused by an âaccidentâ and c) the accident took place on board theaircraft or in the process of embarkation or disembarkation.  What is perhaps easily overlooked is that there is no requirement thatthe carrier should be at fault or blameworthy.  There is no reference to any standard of care on the part of the carrier.  The passengercan therefore rely on the fact that he has some kind of insurance should the 3 conditions for liability exist.  Negligence is irrelevantsave in so far as Article 20 provides a defence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âArticle 20</p>        <p class="quote">The carrier is not liable if he proves that he and his servants or agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage orthat it was impossible for him or them to take such measures.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Whereas the pursuer in the <i>Sidhu</i> case did not claim to have sustained any bodily injury that would bring the matter within the terms of Article 17, nevertheless,the Convention applied because there was a claim against the carrier arising out of a contract of carriage by air.  So in the presentcase, where there is a claim based on the contract of carriage by air, the fact that liability does not arise under Article 17 doesnot prevent the application of the Convention.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Stock, very properly drew this Courtâs attention to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of <i>El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd v Tsui Yuan Tseng</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=142%20L%20Ed%202d%20576" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">142 L Ed 2d 576</a> wherein the majority of the court followed the decision in the <i>Sidhu</i> case to the extent that a claim would still fall within the Convention even if it was in respect of psychological damage withoutphysical injury and thus conceded not to constitute bodily injury which was necessary to bring the matter within a claim to liabilityunder Article 17.  In doing so, however, Ginsberg J, delivering the majority decision, said at page 592:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Second Circuit feared that if Article 17 were read to exclude relief outside the Convention for Tseng, then a passenger injuredby a malfunctioning escalator in the airlineâs terminal would have no recourse against the airline, even if the airline recklesslydisregarded its duty to keep the escalator in proper repair.  See 122F3d, at 107.  As the United States pointed out in its <i>amicus curiae</i> submission, however, the Convention addresses and concerns, only and exclusively, the airlineâs liability for passenger injuriesoccurring âon board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.â  Article 17, 49 Stat.3018; see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i><i> </i>16.  â[T]he Conventionâs pre-emptive effect on local law extends no further than the Conventionâs own substantive scope.â Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16.  A carrier, therefore, âis indisputably subject to liability under local law for injuries arising outside of that scope: e.g.,for passenger injuries occurring before âany of the operations of embarking or disembarking.â â <i>Ibid</i>. (quoting Article 17).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  It might be thought that it would be incongruous that the Supreme Court should accept the reasoning in the <i>Sidhu</i> case, which was predicated on the distinction between the application of the Convention and the provisions of liability under theConvention.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  This statement was not part of the ratio of the Supreme Courtâs decision, but it was a similar decision to that reached in a numberof cases both in the United States and in England for example <i>Dick v American Airlines Inc.</i> <i>and Another</i> US District Court of Massachusetts, 12 March 2007, <i>Adatia v Air Canada</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20PIQR%20238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] P.I.Q.R. 238.</a>  In the first case, the judge said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe applicability of the Convention depended on whether the injury occurred âon board the aircraft or in the course of any ofthe operations of embarking or disembarking.â â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In the normal course of events the carrierâs contractual obligation for the carriage of passengers would cease once the passengershad left the aircraft.  The carrier would have no more functions to perform as regards the transport of the passengers because thepassengers would be inside the air terminal.  Apart from making sure the baggage was discharged from the aircraft, all other functionswould be undertaken by the airport authority.  Hence in normal cases the contractual obligations of the carrier and the scope ofliability under Article 17 would be coterminous.  However, as already indicated, this case is not the normal case.  The pleadingis that the airline did have other contractual obligations to perform, namely it had the contractual obligation to take care of andsupervise the plaintiff.  Thus, unlike other cases, the claim in this case is founded upon the contractual obligations of the contractof carriage extending beyond disembarkation.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It would seem that the courts have been more inclined to give a wider interpretation to embarking and more inclined to treat asa factual matter the process of approaching the boarding area as embarkation but in relation to disembarkation the courts have beendisposed to treat the process as complete once the passenger has reached a safe area inside the terminal.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>      Mr Lai sought to rely on the what has been referred to as a three fold test namely the location where the accident took place,the nature of the activity and the airlineâs control.  Many of the judgments to which this court was referred took those mattersas guiding factors as to whether the particular passenger was in the course of embarkation or disembarkation.  Of those factors clearlythat of control appears to have been considered the most important.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Naturally, once a passenger has checked in and has reached a point in an airport from whence he will be directed on to the aeroplaneit would be natural to think in terms of the process of embarkation having commenced.  In contrast, when a passenger has left theaeroplane and is inside the terminal he would not be directed or in any way controlled by the carrier but would be subject to suchdirections as would apply to all passengers using that airport.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In some cases it has been held the carriers had undertaken contractual obligations that required performance of functions by thecarrier after the passenger had left the aircraft and was inside the terminal building.  One such case was that of <i>Burke v Aer Lingus PLC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20ILRM%20148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 ILRM 148.</a>  That case involved the provision of a shuttle bus across the airport tarmac.  The judge held that the passenger was still in theprocess of disembarkation; his reasoning was consistent with the carrier carrying out its contractual duty of transporting the passengerto the destination.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In this case, I would agree with the submissions by Mr Lai that the plaintiff had indeed disembarked from the aircraft.  While disagreeingwith the judge below on this aspect I note that paragraph 13 of his judgment stresses the importance of the carrierâs control ofthe plaintiff because he was an Unaccompanied Minor.  As already explained, that is a matter of the pleaded contractual obligationof the airline.  It is not a matter which, in my view, extends the meaning of disembarkation but it is a matter which extends thecontractual obligation of the carrier.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The result is, therefore, that whilst the Convention is applicable to the pleaded cause of action, the pleaded accident was onewhich occurred outside the limits of liability laid down in Article 17.  In those circumstances, the plaintiffâs action on thepleading must fail.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Whilst it is not necessary to consider the other matters I would indicate that in my view the judge came to the correct conclusionin respect of Article 28 namely that Kuala Lumpur was both the place of departure and destination of the contractual carriage forthe purposes of the Convention.  In those circumstances Hong Kong courts do not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The judge was clearly apprehensive about the argument raised under Article 29 because it turned on whether it could be said thatthe carriage had stopped and when it was that the carriage stopped.  I would be inclined to the view that the carriage stopped atthe time when the plaintiff had taken the decision not to use the return ticket.  That probably was not until very much later thanthe time of the accident.  In those circumstances I would not interfere with the conclusion reached by the judge.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I would therefore dismiss this appeal and make an order <i>nisi</i> of costs in favour of the defendant.  Mr Lai submitted that there may be other ways in which a claim could be put.  Although no draftwas shown to this court I consider that it would be appropriate that the order should be drafted in terms that would permit the plaintiffto apply to the District Court for leave to be able to file an amended claim within 28 days of this judgment.  In so saying I donot give any indication as to whether any amendment or alternative way of making a claim would be viable.  That matter would haveto be considered by the judge before whom any such application might be made.  It is also noted that this court was informed thatthe plaintiff has issued a protective writ based on a quite separate cause of action of misrepresentation, in respect of which theplaintiffâs counsel informed the court there were no time bar difficulties.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Hon Suffiad J:</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I agree with the judgment given by the Vice President the draft of which I had the advantage of reading.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Hon Wright J:</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  This is an appeal from a decision of His Honour Judge Stanley Chan which concerns the issue of whether the Amended Warsaw Conventionas set out in Schedule 1 of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/500" class="autolink_findacts">Carriage By Air Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/500">Cap. 500</a>, applies to the plaintiff's claim.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr Lai, who appeared for the plaintiff both below and in this appeal, described the plaintiffâs argument as turning on the âsimplepoint of whether the Convention applies to the facts of this accidentâ.  It would better be characterised as requiring determinationof the question: âin circumstances where a contract between an airline and a passenger includes the provision of services beyondthe mere air journey itself, do the limitations on actions for recovery of damages created by the Warsaw Convention, extend to thoseadditional services?â</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The plaintiff contends that international carriage by air is prescribed by the provisions of Article 17, that the incident occurredoutside such carriage.  The defendant contends that it extends to the entire duration of a contract of carriage but continues, inthe alternative, that on the facts of this matter Article 17 was of application.</p>    <p class="heading">The facts</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The events which gave rise to the claim are not disputed by the defendant for the purposes of this appeal.  They arose out of amishap which occurred in Hong Kong International Airport on 14 August 2004 and may be summarised shortly. The plaintiff, at thatstage 13 years old, was the holder of a round trip air ticket issued by the defendant entitling him to fly from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysiato Hong Kong and back again.  He arrived on flight MH 72Q at approximately 1 p.m. that day.  His ticket indicates that he was dueto return to Kuala Lumpur on 21 August 2004.  He travelled alone, as an "unaccompanied minor".  He was met by a âMs Evonâ, describedas an agent of the defendant, who accompanied him to the Customs and Immigration area: according to the plaintiff the meeting tookplace at the landing gate.  The defendant's agent noticed that the plaintiff looked pale and, upon enquiry, he said that he had aheadache.  She told the plaintiff to line up for immigration formalities.  She left him in the queue whilst she went through a designatedimmigration channel.  When the plaintiff went to walk forward to the immigration counter, he fell, hitting his head on the marbleflooring and sustaining a head injury. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  He was admitted that day to Princess Margaret Hospital where he remained until 23 August 2004.  He was readmitted on 25 August 2004and then transferred to the Baptist Hospital the following day where surgery was performed.  He was discharged on 2 September 2004. He returned to his home in Australia in October 2004, without returning to Kuala Lumpur.</p>    <p class="heading">The plaintiffâs claim</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The plaintiff's statement of claim, paragraph 2, reads, without correction:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>c)   It is an expressed, alternatively, an implied terms of the issuing of the air ticket to the plaintiff, that the defendant shall:</p>        <p>-      take full charge of the plaintiff the moment he checks in;</p>        <p>-      escort the plaintiff throughout the departure and arrival formalities, including immigration, security and boarding procedures;</p>        <p>-      arrange a flight crew or staff to accompany the plaintiff during his travel from the originating port they were handed to anflight crew or staff, when until the destination point, where the plaintiff was handed to the receiving party; and</p>        <p>-      arrange a flight crew or staff to accompany the plaintiff when going through the customs and immigration desk and the baggagereclaim section.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Paragraph 4 then asserts:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>The aforesaid accident was caused by the breach of expressed and/or implied terms of contract and/or common duty of care and/or thenegligence on the part of the Defendant, its servants and/or agents.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>after which are set out of six particulars which are said to describe equally the defendantâs breach of contract and its negligence.</p>    <p class="heading">The proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The plaintiff instituted proceedings against the defendant in the District Court for damages arising from the incident.  The defendanttook out a summons pursuant to Order 12, Rule 8 of the Rules of the District Court, in which it sought a declaration that the Courtsof Hong Kong have no jurisdiction over it in respect of the subject matter of the claim in this action and an order that the plaintiff'sclaim be dismissed as it is time barred by virtue of Article 29 of the Convention.  The judge made the declaration sought and dismissedthe plaintiff's claim on the basis that the Hong Kong courts lacked jurisdiction. </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The plaintiff appeals both the declaration and the dismissal of the claim.  In regard to the latter aspect the plaintiff additionallycontends that there existed an, as yet unpleaded, alternative cause of action, namely misrepresentation by an agent of the defendantwhich occurred whilst the plaintiff was hospitalised which could not have been affected by the terms of the Convention, and thatconsequently the judge, if he found for the defendant, should not have dismissed the action but should have afforded the plaintiffan opportunity to amend his pleadings by including that alternative cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Under a heading "Legal issues not in dispute" the judge recorded :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Counsel for the plaintiff accepts that:-</p>        <p>(1)   The plaintiff's flight was covered by the Amended Warsaw Convention... which is given the force of law by the Carriage by AirOrdinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/500">Cap 500</a>...</p>        <p>(2)   The Convention while it applies, provides the exclusive code for relief displacing ordinary common law actions.</p>        <p>(3)   The Convention is an international treaty and should be considered as a whole, and the purposive interpretation should be adopted.</p>        <p>(4)   The Convention is to provide a uniform and exclusive international code relating to the liabilities of air carriers in respectof claims arising out or in the course of international carriage by air, to be applied in the courts of all signatories to the Conventionwithout reference to their domestic law.</p>        <p>(5)   The Convention also sets out the limits of liabilities and the conditions under which claims to establish liability are to bemet.  A balance should be struck in the interests of certainty and uniformity.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  That summary by the judge substantially encapsulates the overriding principles which are to be taken into account when consideringa claim arising out of an incident in the course of international carriage by air in circumstances which give rise to a claim.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  As to construction of the provisions of the Convention I turn to the summary by Lord Scott of Foscote, in <i>In re Deep Vein Thrombosis Group Litigation</i> <a> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20AC%20495" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 AC 495</a></a> starting at [11]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"[11] Counsel for the parties were in broad agreement as to the principles of interpretation of article 17 that should be applied.The important principles for present purposes are that:</p>        <p class="quote">(1) the starting point is to consider the natural meaning of the language of article 17, with the French text prevailing in case ofany inconsistency with the English text ;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) the Convention should be considered as a whole and given a purposive interpretation;</p>        <p class="quote">(3) the language of the Convention should not be interpreted by reference to domestic law principles or domestic rules of interpretation;and</p>        <p class="quote">(4) assistance can and should be sought from relevant decisions of the courts of other Convention countries, but the weight to begiven to them will depend upon the standing of the court concerned and the quality of the analysis. I would add to these that thebalance struck by the Convention between the interests of passengers and the interest of airlines ought not to be distorted by ajudicial approach to interpretation in a particular case designed to reflect the merits of that case. The point was well put by ScaliaJ in his dissenting opinion in <i>Husain v Olympic Airways</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282004%29%20124%20S%20Ct%201221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2004) 124 S Ct 1221</a>, 1234 (an opinion with which O'Connor J concurred):</p>        <p class="quote">"A legal construction is not fallacious merely because it has harsh results. The Convention denies a remedy, even when outrageousconduct and grievous injury have occurred, unless there has been an 'accident'. Whatever that term means, it certainly does not equateto 'outrageous conduct that causes grievous injury'. It is a mistake to assume that the Convention must provide relief whenever traditionaltort law would do so. To the contrary, a principal object of the Convention was to promote the growth of the fledgling airline industryby limiting the circumstances under which passengers could sue â¦ Unless there has been an accident, there is no liability, whetherthe claim is trivial â¦ or cries out for redress."</p>        <p class="quote">[12] I think at this point a word of caution about the process of interpretation is in order. It is not the function of any courtin any of the Convention countries to try to produce in language different from that used in the Convention a comprehensive formulationof the conditions which will lead to article 17 liability, or of any of those conditions. The language of the Convention itself mustalways be the starting point. The function of the court is to apply that language to the facts of the case in issue. In order todo so and to explain its decision, and to provide a guide to other courts that may subsequently be faced with similar facts, thecourt may well need to try to express in its own language the idea inherent in the language used in the Convention. So a judge facedwith deciding whether particular facts do or do not constitute an article 17 accident will often describe in his or her own languagethe characteristics that an event or happening must have in order to qualify as an article 17 accident. But a judicial formulationof the characteristics of an article 17 accident should not, in my opinion, ever be treated as a substitute for the language usedin the Convention. It should be treated for what it is, namely, an exposition of the reasons for the decision reached and a guideto the application of the Convention language to facts of a type similar to those of the case in question."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The relevant provisions of the Convention</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  It is convenient to set out those Articles of the Convention which are of relevance in this appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Article 1</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) This Convention applies to all <u>international carriage of persons</u>, baggage or cargo <u>performed by aircraft</u> for rewardâ¦</p>        <p>(2) For the purposes of this Convention, the expression "international carriage" means any carriage in which, according to the agreementbetween the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment,are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Contracting Partyif there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party.

Before the Warsaw accord, injured passengers could file suitsfor damages, subject only to the limitations of the forum's laws, including the forum's choice of law regime. This exposure inhibitedthe growth of the then-fledgling international airline industry. â¦ Many international air carriers at that time endeavored to requirepassengers, as a condition of air travel, to relieve or reduce the carrier's liability in case of injury. â¦The Convention draftersdesigned Articles 17, 22, and 24 of the Convention as a compromise between the interests of air carriers and their customers worldwide.In Article 17 of the Convention, carriers are denied the contractual prerogative to exclude or limit their liability for personalinjury. In Articles 22 and 24, passengers are limited in the amount of damages they may recover, and are restricted in the claimsthey may pursue by the conditions and limits set out in the Convention.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The cardinal purpose of the Convention is to achieve uniformity of rules governing claims that arise out of international air transportation. In order to achieve this goal, the Convention fashioned a comprehensive liability scheme designed to be the exclusive remedy forinjuries suffered during the course of international travel. This system protects air carriers against catastrophic liability byestablishing monetary caps on awards and restricting the types of claims that may be brought against carriers, while accommodatingthe interests of injured passengers by creating a presumption of liability against the carrier. Article 17 provides for strict liabilityof an air carrier for personal injuries sustained by a passenger in international travel. According to its terms, Article 17 applies"if the accident which caused the damage took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarkingor disembarking."

Uniformity requires that passengers be denied access to the profusionof remedies that may exist under the laws of a particular country, so that they must bring their claims under the terms of the Conventionor not at all.

The judge found that Hong Kong courts do not have jurisdiction: he was correctin that finding, in my view, only if that the plaintiffâs claim is one covered by the Convention.  Conversely if the plaintiffâsclaim is unaffected by the Convention then Hong Kong courts would have jurisdiction in that the cause of action arose here.

(See <i>Day v Trans World Airlines, Inc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=528%20F2d%2031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">528 F.2d 31</a>, 35 (2d Cir. 1975) applied in, e.g., <i>Alleyn(supra)</i>)</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  That is an appealing approach.  With respect, the judge appears to have confused the concept of control being exercised by an airlinein circumstances in which the issue was whether or not disembarkation had been completed (for the purposes of determining the applicationof Article 17) with the concept of the supervision and care of the plaintiff until he was handed over to the designated person inHong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  After reviewing a number of decisions as to when disembarkation had been held to have been completed the judge said the followingat paragraph 13 of his judgement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>In my view, by applying the tripartite test based on activity, location and control, the cases cited above can be distinguished fromthe present case.  Here the plaintiff was the UM of the airline.  Although there was no evidence presented as to the exact scopeand nature of being a UM of the airline, it is not difficult to envisage that an UM should not be taken as an ordinary passengeras such and he would not be allowed to go anywhere he wanted to even though he had left the aeroplane and was still in the airport. The UM has to be accompanied by the airline staff to clear the Immigration and Customs checkpoints.  The UM was under the controlof the airline or its agent.  The UM has to be literally delivered to the appointed guardian at the airport before the duty of escortinga UM by the airline could be fully discharged.  In the circumstances, I find that the plaintiff was still in the process of disembarkingup till the plaintiff was actually handed over to the appointed guardian at the airport.  In the circumstances, article 17 is applicablein this case.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The judge is correct when he says that the plaintiff had to be handed to a nominated person <i>"before the duty of escorting [the plaintiff] by the airline could be fully discharged".</i>  It is, of course, the plaintiff's case (and that is the reason why the claim would have been pleaded as it has) that the defendantwill be responsible for the care and safe conduct of the plaintiff from the time he was handed over to it in Kuala Lumpur until hewas handed over to the nominated person after arrival in Hong Kong, including, within that period, the international carriage byair.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In this instance the defendant undertook two distinct obligations: first, the obligation that it undertakes in respect of any personto whom it issues a ticket, namely, to carry the plaintiff from the point of departure to the destination, the element of internationalcarriage by air; second, to provide further services to the plaintiff in the form of special arrangements for his safe custody notonly during the period of international carriage by air but also during the times preceding and subsequent to that carriage.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The judge appears to have considered the entire period of the contract between the plaintiff and defendant, including the differentobligations undertaken by the defendant in terms of the contract, as constituting international carriage by air.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In my judgment it does not follow as an inevitable consequence of the defendantâs assumption of the additional obligations thatthe entire period encompassed by the additional pre-and post-flight obligations as well as by the true transportation becomes partof âinternational carriage by airâ and thus subject to the provisions of the Convention.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In many instance, for example where an adult simply purchases a ticket to fly from one place to another, it may well be that theprovisions of the Warsaw Convention will be coextensive with the period of the contract.  However, in circumstances such as the present,where the defendant has undertaken obligations additional to the actual international carriage by air, I can see no compelling reasonwhy the provisions of the Convention should be extended beyond that actual carriage.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Article 17 of the Convention is specific concerning the circumstances in which the bodily injuries which give rise to the actionmust have occurred: either whilst on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking. There will be no liability on the part of the carrier for any claims which arise in the course of international carriage by air otherthan in the circumstances prescribed by Article 17.  Article 17 directs a court to consider both when and where an event takes placein evaluating whether a claim for an injury to a passenger is pre-empted.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Where an incident occurs on board an aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking then the exclusiveright of action which a plaintiff has lies under, and subject to the limitations of, the Convention: if for whatever reason a conditionfor liability under the Convention is absent then the plaintiff's claim is unenforceable: <i>Sidhu v British Airways</i>, <i>El Al v Tseng</i> and <i>King v. American Airlines, Inc. (supra)</i><i>)</i>. </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  In <i>Sidhu v British Airways</i> at p. 435 Lord Hope of Craighead commenced his speech by saying:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>My Lords, the question in these two appeals is whether the Warsaw Convention... provides the exclusive cause of action and sole remedyfor a passenger who claims against the carrier for loss, injury and damage sustained in the course of, or arising out of, internationalcarriage by air.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and went on to answer that question in the affirmative.  In the course of doing so, he said at p. 447:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>In its context the purpose seems to me to be to prescribe the circumstances - that is to say, the only circumstances - in which acarrier will be liable in damages to the passenger for claims arising out of his international carriage by air.</p>        <p>The phrase "the cases covered by article 17" extends therefore to all claims made by the passenger against the carrier arising outof international carriage by air, other than claims for damage to his registered baggage which must be dealt with under article 18and claims for delay which must be dealt with under article 19.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The speech of Lord Hope is clear: Article 17 determines the limits of liability of the carrier in respect of claims, claims whichâarise out ofâ, in Lord Hopeâs words, international carriage by air. Conversely, once international carriage by air has ceased(or before it commences) the provisions of the Convention do not apply to any accident that occurs.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  It appears to have been an apprehension of the extension of the application of the Convention beyond its original intended ambitthat led Ginsburg, J., to say in <i>El Al v Tseng (supra)</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>The Second Circuit feared that if Article 17 were read to exclude relief outside the convention for Tseng, then a passenger injuredby a malfunctioning escalator in the airlineâs terminal would have no recourse against the airline, even if the airline recklesslydisregarded its duty to keep the escalator in proper repairâ¦ As the United States pointed out in its amicus curiae submission,however, the Convention addresses and concerns, only and exclusively, the airline's liability for passenger injuries occurring "onboard the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking"â¦ "[T]he convention's pre-emptive effecton local law extends no further than the Convention's own substantive scope"... a carrier, therefore, "is indisputably subject toliability under local law for injuries arising outside that scope: e.g. for passenger injuries occurring before âany of the operationsof embarking or disembarkingâ".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(followed in <i>King v American Airlines (supra)</i>)</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  This is particularly pertinent in the light of the decision in <i>Sidhu</i>, of which Ginsberg J. was aware at the time of delivering judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  It is to be noted that although Article 17 of the Convention contents itself with the phrase <i>â</i><i>in the course ofâ</i> Lord Hope used the phrase <i>"</i> <i>in the course of, <u>or arising out of</u>â</i>.  As the authors of Carriage by Air, 2001, Butterworths note at paragraph 7.15:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>This [phrase âor arising out ofâ]arguably includes (for example) a claim for damage sustained by a passenger in the terminal buildingafter completing the operation of disembarking, even though the carriage by air would by then have come to an end; such a claim couldstill be said to be one "arising out of" the carriage by air.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The issue which the judge should have addressed was whether the incident occurred during the period of international carriage byair or occurred at some other stage in the fulfilment by the defendant of its additional contractual obligations: if the former,the Convention applied; if the latter, it did not. </p>    <p class="heading">Had the plaintiff disembarked?</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In order to determine that question, it seems to me, one need only look to the provisions of Article 17 and consider whether theincident occurred in the course of any of the operations of disembarking.  If the plaintiff had not completed the disembarkationprocess then the international carriage by air was incomplete and the Convention applied: if the disembarkation process was completethen, in my judgment, so was the international carriage by air. See United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitâs decisionin <i>Lathigra v British Airways PLC</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20F3d%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 F.3d 535</a>; 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 33666 (applied in <i>Prescod v AMR, Inc</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=383%20F3d%20861" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">383 F.3d 861</a>; 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 17432) which, although dealing with a claim for delay rather than injury, held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>Once the passenger presents herself to the carrier or its agents as ready to begin the air journey, the Convention generally governsliability for delays in the carrierâs performance, and its provisions apply until completion of disembarkation at the destinationairport.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Support for this approach is to be found in <i>Rabinowitz v Scandinavian Airlines</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=741%20FSupp%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">741 F.Supp. 441</a>; 1990 U.S.Dist LEXIS 8173 thus</p>    <blockquote>        <p>To adopt plaintiffs' position of continuous liability from the time a passenger embarks on the first of a series of connecting flightson that same airline until she disembarks from the final flight would be to impose liability on the airline for any accident thatmay occur in airport terminals en route, in direct contravention of the explicit terms and purpose of Article 17.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The judge erred, in my view, when he made the finding that the plaintiff ââ¦<i>was still in the process of disembarking up till the plaintiff was actually handed over to the appointed guardian at the airport</i>.â.  To take that finding to its logical conclusion demonstrates its fragility: if the arrangement were that the plaintiff was tobe handed over to the nominated person at a vehicle in a parking lot at the airport and the plaintiff were injured in the courseof crossing that parking lot <i>en route</i> to the nominated person, on the judge's finding the plaintiff's claim would be subject to the operation of the convention.  Withrespect, that simply cannot have been the intention of those concluding the Convention.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Whether or not a passenger has completed disembarkation is largely a factual question in each instance.  There are any number ofdecisions in a wide range of the jurisdictions which are party to the Convention which deal with individual sets of circumstances. Despite the recognition of the desirability of consistency in application and interpretation of the Convention across all jurisdictions,not all of those decisions are readily capable of being reconciled.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  As indicated in Â§ 63 the judge favoured the âtripartiteâ approach developed in the United States.  I believe he was justifiedin doing so.  An instructive overview of how that test developed is to be found in <i>Alleyn (supra):</i></p>    <blockquote>        <p>At first, courts determined the factual boundaries of [the phrase "in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking"]by focusing almost exclusively on the physical location of the passenger when injured, in proximity to the aircraft... <i>Day</i>... shifted the focus away from location alone and created a flexible, tripartite evaluation to determine when Article 17 applies...The Second Circuit adopted a test developed by Judge Brieant in the Southern District which examines where the plaintiff was whenthe accident occurred ("locationâ), what the plaintiff was doing ("activity"), and at whose direction the plaintiff was acting("control")...</p>        <p>After <i>Day</i> courts around the country began to apply this three prong test to determine whether a specific accident occurred during the courseof embarking or disembarking... A review of case law reveals that a court's determination hinges upon the specific facts of the casepresented and how analogous or distinguishable those facts are from the facts of previously decided cases...</p>        <p>The majority of cases that have examined the issue of what is and is not disembarking have narrowly construed the term, denying mostaccidents the coverage of the Convention.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  I, too, would adopt that test. Applying it to the facts of the present matter as set out in Â§ 39 the judge should have found thatthe plaintiff had completed disembarkation, with the result that the incident which gave rise to the plaintiff's claim did not arisein the course of international carriage by air.  Had the judge made this finding he would have found the Hong Kong courts to havejurisdiction, by virtue of the cause of action arising here, and that the two-year limitation period created by Article 29 does notapply to this matter with the result that the claim is not time-barred.</p>    <p class="heading">Other matters considered by the judge</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In the light of the view I take on this matter whilst it is unnecessary for me to deal with the other issues considered by the judgeI would indicate my views briefly.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  I agree with his conclusion that the destination was Kuala Lumpur: in <i>Grein v Imperial Airways Ltd</i> [1037]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20KB%2050" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 KB 50</a> at 81 the Court of Appeal said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â¦the contract by reference to the place of departure and the place of destination are to be ascertained may be any contract of carriagewhether for a single journey, for a circular journey or for a return journey: the place of departure and the place of destinationmean the places at which under the particular contract in question the contractual carriage begins and ends. In the case of a returnjourney this will be or include, as the case may be, the place out to and back from which by the contract the passenger is to becarried.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>A similar approach to the determination of the place of destination has been adopted in the United States: see, for example, <i>Baah v Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=473%20F%20Supp%202d%20591" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">473 F.
