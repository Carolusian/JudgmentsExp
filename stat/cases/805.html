In the courseof such communications the Claimant engaged the services of its solicitors Messrs EDMUND W.H. CHOW &amp; CO. which wrote many lettersto the Defendant and his solicitors regarding the removal of the alleged breaches of covenants contained in the said Deed of MutualCovenants. After several months of correspondence the alleged breaches were removed by the Defendant although the Defendant had atall material times denied committing any breach of the said covenants. The Claimant eventually received a bill for $2,610,00 forthe cost for services rendered from its solicitors. The Claimant now seeks to recover this cost of $2,610.00 from the Defendant whichthe Defendant had refused to pay. The claimant subsequently lodged this claim in the tribunal to claim for the said $2,610.00 plus$238.00 for expenses incurred in lodging this claim plus $300.00 collection charges. The Defendant disputed this claim and lodgeda counterclaim of $5,000.00 for the legal cost which he claims to have been incurred by him in defending himself against the Claimant'sallegations.</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="88%" colspan="2" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">On the date set down for hearing (i.e. the 16.05. 1986) the Defendant requested to withdraw his counterclaim After due considerationleave was granted to the Defendant to withdraw his counterclaim.</p>                <p class="quote"> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%" class="quote"></td>            <td width="88%" colspan="2" class="quote">                <p align="left" class="quote">The Claimant had previously submitted numerous documents supported by affidavits.

Whether the Defendant had indeed committed any breach of thesaid covenants as alleged by the Claimant is not an issue before the tribunal. The issue before the tribunal is a claim for reimbursementof the legal cost. incurred by the Claimant in the negotiations by the Claimant's solicitors with the Defendant and his solicitorsfor the removal of the alleged breaches of the said covenants. To ascertain whether such legal cost may be recoverable by the Claimantit is necessary to determine whether the Defendant has an obligation to pay for such Legal cost. It is clear that there is no contractbetween the Defendant and the Claimant's solicitors to the extent that any legal cost incurred would be payable by the Defendant.It is therefore necessary to examine the relationship between the Claimant and the Defendant to determine whether in the circumstancesthe Defendant would be liable to reimburse the Claimant for the said legal cost. The relationship between the Defendant and the Claimantis merely one that is between the owner of a property in the estate managed by the Claimant under and by virtue of the said Deedof Mutual Covenants. The said Deed of Mutual Covenants enables the Claimant (as the Manager of the said estate) to claim from allowners of property in the said estate management fees and such other fees as may be imposed under the House Rules and/or the saidDeed of Mutual Covenants. The said Deed of Mutual Covenants also enables the Claimant to recover such costs and expenses as may legitimatelybe incurred as a result of the Claimant enforcing its rights to recover such management fees and other expenses or expenses imposedunder the House Rules and/or the said Deed of Mutual Covenants. The said legal cost claimed in this claim is not cost and/or expensesincurred as a result of the Claimant enforcing its rights to recover management fees or other fees payable under the said House Rulesand/or the said Deed of Mutual Covenants. The said legal cost claimed herein is cost incurred as a result of negotiations by solicitorsin seeking to enforce the said covenants other than management fees or fees payable under the said House Rules and/or the said Deedof Mutual Covenants. I therefore find that such said legal cost is not related to the said Deed of Mutual Covenants to the extentthat it is recoverable in this tribunal. The claim by the Claimant against the Defendant is therefore dismissed for want of jurisdiction.In view of the circumstances I make no order as to costs against any party."</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Section 27A of the Ordinance gives the adjudicator power of his own motion by notice on the prescribed form to all parties to reviewthe award or order and in such review to reopen and rehear the claim wholly or in part and to hear fresh evidence and to confirm,vary or reverse his previous award or order.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> This is the power which the adjudicator purported to exercise on 10th June 1986 when he made a number of orders.
