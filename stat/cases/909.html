This we now do.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The appeals were against the decision of Deputy Judge Patrick Chan to grant leave to the plaintiffs in two separate actions againstthe Attorney General to amend their statements of claim. Both actions involved claims for medical negligence and, since the issuesraised in each application for leave to amend were the same, they were, by consent of the parties, transferred by a master to beheard together by a judge in chambers.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The plaintiff, Mr. Ng Kam-chuen in HCA 7255 of 1985, and the deceased Madam Chau Sau Yung, the administrators of whose estate hadcommenced the action in HCA 2437 of 1987, were both patients at the Kwai Chung Hospital at the relevant times.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Mr. Ng's claim arose out of injuries he sustained on or about 14th January 1984 when he attempted to commit suicide by jumping outof the window of the ward in which he was a patient on the 6th floor of the hospital.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The claim of the administrators of the estate of Madam Chau arose from her death on 25 June 1984 as a result of an act of suicidein which she hanged herself in a showercubicle at the hospital on 23 June.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> In his statement of claim dated 25 November 1985, Mr. Ng pleaded that his action arose out of the negligence in the performance oftheir duties of three doctors, a psychiatric nurse and staff of the hospital; that he had been diagnosed at the hospital to be sufferingfrom schizophrenia; that at all times the medical and nursing staff of the hospital had undertaken to provide him with medical andnursing services; that, having had knowledge of the fact that on 7th December 1983 he had attempted to commit suicide by jumpingfrom a window of the same ward of the hospital, the Medical and Health Department knew or ought reasonably to have known at all timesafter that attempt that he required such medical and nursing services as would prevent him from again attempting to jump from a window;and that his act of jumping from the window was caused and/or contributed to by the negligence of the doctors, psychiatric nurseand staff of the hospital.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr. Ng then pleaded the following particulars of negligence</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i)    Failing to provide any or any adequate nursing services for the Plaintiff.</p>            <p class="quote">(ii)    Failing to provide any or any adequate medical services for the Plaintiff.</p>            <p class="quote">(iii)    Failing to take any precautionary measures or any adequate precautionary measures to prevent the Plaintiff from jumping outof the window at all or alternatively to prevent the Plaintiff from jumping out of the window at any time after the first incident.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iv)    Failing to provide any or any adequate supervision of the Plaintiff."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> In their statement of claim dated 29 April 1987 the administrators of Madam Chau's estate claimed that their action arose out ofthe negligence of three doctors, a nursing officer and a senior nurse of the hospital; that Madam Chau had been diagnosed at thehospital to be suffering from schizophrenia; that at all material times the medical and nursing staff of the hospital had undertakento provide medical- and nursing services for her; that she had been admitted to the hospital pursuant to a referral memo dated 11May 1984 from South Kwai Chung Polyclinic in which it was stated that she had repeatedly threatened to kill himself and had complainedthat she was unhappy, worthless and helpless; and that her death was caused and/or contributed to by the negligence of the doctors,two nurses and staff of the hospital.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The particulars of negligence that were pleaded were:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i)    Failing to provide any or any adequate nursing services for the deceased.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ii)    Failing to provide any or any adequate medical services for the deceased.</p>            <p class="quote">(iii)    Failing to take any precautionary measures or any adequate precautionary measures to prevent the deceased from hanging herself.</p>            <p class="quote">(iv)    Failing to provide any or any adequate supervision of the deceased.</p>            <p class="quote">(v)    Ignoring or failing to pay proper or any attention to any or all of the symptoms more particularly described in paragraph 5and 6 above."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The symptoms described in paragraph 5 were those referred to in the memo from the South Kwai Chung Polyclinic. Those described inparagraph 6 were:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"(i)   'Dull and flat affact' (sic)</p>            <p class="quote">(ii)    'Poor attitude or approach'</p>            <p class="quote">(iii)    'Poor contact to nurses and co-patients', sitting alone</p>            <p class="quote">(iv)    'Lazy' and dozing off most of the time, tired and sleepy</p>            <p class="quote">(v)     Uncooperative and mute on approach</p>            <p class="quote">(vi)    'Lack of volition'</p>            <p class="quote">(vii)    'Anxious for being pregnant' (she was not)</p>            <p class="quote">(viii)   'Claimed her head to be a bomb'</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(ix)     'Feeling of hopelessness'</p>            <p class="quote">(x)      'Self care needed supervision'</p>            <p class="quote">(xi)      'Worried she might die', 'worried about future'."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The Attorney General, who is sued as the representative of the Medical and Health Department, admitted in both his defence and hisamended defence to Mr. Ng's action that Mr. Ng had been admitted to the hospital on 25 October 1983 pursuant to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/136" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health Ordinance</a>; that he had been diagnosed there as suffering from schizophrenia; that on 7 December 1983 he had attempted to jump out of a windowof the ward on the 6th floor, and that the three doctors and the psychiatric nurse were employees of the Medical Health Department.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> He also admitted in his defence to the action by the administrators of Madam Chau's estate that she had been admitted to the hospitalon 11 May 1984 pursuant to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/136" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health Ordinance</a>; that she had been diagnosed there as suffering from schizophrenia; that her admission had been pursuant to a referral from the SouthKwai Chung Polyclinic; that the referral memo dated 11 May 1984 from that polyclinic had stated that she had repeatedly threatenedto kill herself; and that the three doctors and two nurses were members of the staff of the hospital who cared for her.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> By summonses dated 4 June 1991 Mr. Ng and the administrators of Madam Chau's estate both sought leave to amend their respective statementsof claim. The proposed amendments were extremely lengthy. It is agreed however that they were succinctly summarised by the judgeas follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" In the proposed amendments in HCA 7255 of 1985, the Plaintiff sets out his medical history since admission into hospital. He quotesextensively and in some places verbatim from medical notes and records regarding his conditions. It is alleged that the Hospitalstaff had failed to reconsider the diagnosis of schizophrenia, to detect the deterioration of his conditions and to take sufficientprecautions to prevent him from attempting to commit suicide. The proposed amendments in HCA 2437 of 1987 are very much similar instyle if not in contents. In some paragraphs, exactly the same wordings are used. Mr. Sujanani for the Plaintiffs submitted thatthere was always one cause of action, that is, negligence, and that the proposed amendments only extended the original issues andprovided particulars. With respect, I am not sure this is entirely correct. In the draft amendments in HCA 7255 OF 1985, there arealtogether 26 paragraphs of particulars of negligence pleaded. Apart from the reliance on the maxim of res ipsa loquitur, the restof the allegations can, in my view, be divided into 5 broad categories:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)    failure to reconsider the diagnoses of schizophrenia: Paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (v), (xii) &amp; (xiii).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(2)    failure to give the correct treatment: Paragraph (iv).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(3)    failure to take adequate precautions to prevent the Plaintiff from jumping out of the window: Paragraphs (vi), (vii), (x),(xiv) which is a repetition of (vi), (xix), (xx), (xxiii) and (xxv).</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(4)    failure to assess the risk of suicide: Paragraphs (vii), (ix), (xi), (xv), (xvi) which is similar to (vii), (xvii), (xviii)and (xxiv).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(5) failure to keep a proper medical record: Paragraphs (xxi) and (xxii).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">An analysis of the 33 paragraphs of particulars of negligence contained in the draft amendments in HCA 2437 of 1987, yields a similarresult, that is to say, 5 broad categories of allegations:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1)    failure to reconsider the diagnosis: Paragraphs (i), (vi), (xiii), (xviii), and (xxx).</p>            <p class="quote">(2)    failure to give the correct treatment: Paragraphs (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (xxviii).</p>            <p class="quote">(3)    failure to take adequate precautions to prevent the deceased from committing suicide: Paragraphs (vii), (xiv) which is a repetitionof (vii), (xvi), (xix), (xx), (xxv) and (xxxii).</p>            <p class="quote">(4)    failure to assess the risk of suicide: Paragraphs (vii), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii), (xv), (xvii), (xviii), (xxiii), (xxiv), (xxvi),(xxix) and (xxxi).</p>            <p class="quote">(5)    failure to keep a proper medical record: Paragraphs (xxi) and (xxii)."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> We think it proper to observe that the proposed amendments, which consisted of 42 and 43 pages respectively whereas the statementsof claim consisted of 5 and 6 pages, were justifiably criticised by the judge for containing offensive remarks and for being largelycomposed of the evidence proposed to be adduced instead of consisting, and consisting only, of statements in summary form of thematerial facts on which the plaintiffs sought to rely for their respective claims, contrary to R.S.C. O.18, r.7. However, that wasnot the objection that was pursued either before the judge or in the grounds of appeal by Mr. Marshall, counsel for the defendantboth in this court and the court below. His objection was that the allegations contained in the proposed amendments raised or constituteda new cause of action, namely, the negligence of a wrong diagnosis, and that the addition of a new cause of action which is statutebarred should not be allowed unless it can be justified under R.S.C. Order 20 r.5 (5).</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> In support of this contention Mr. Marshall cited <u>Weldon v.

Having also considered two authorities citedby Mr. Sujanani for the plaintiffs - <u>Collins v. Hertforshire County Council</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1947%5d%201%20KB%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1947] 1 KB 598</a> and <u>Dorman v. J.W.

From the analysis I have set out earlier they now seek to allege in addition to inadequate precautions, mistaken diagnosis,wrong treatment, incorrect assessment and insufficient medical records. I do not think the proposed amendments merely extend theoriginal issues and provide further particulars. They do not just invite the trial court to consider their claims from a differentapproach. They involve a different set of ideas and a different allegation of fact. They plead a different case of negligence. Iam satisfied that the amendments do indeed raise new causes of action and that unless they fall within Order 20 rule 5(5), leaveshould be refused."(our emphasis).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Having come to that conclusion, however, the judge decided that the proposed amendments came within the ambit of Order 20, r.5 (5).He therefore allowed them.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> In his notice of appeal the Attorney General contended that the judge erred in law in granting leave to make the amendments. Theplaintiffs contended in a respondent's notice that the judge's decision should be affirmed on the ground that the proposed amendmentsdid not raise new causes- of action but merely extended the original pleaded issues and allegations of negligence and provided furtherparticulars of the defendant's negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> It was agreed at the outset of the hearing of these appeals that we should first hear argument on the respondent's notice. Mr. Marshallpresented his submissions in much the same way as he had done before the judge. He contended that the proposed amendments introducedthree new causes of action in the form of three new torts of negligence arising from the allegations of (1) failure to give a properdiagnosis (2) failure to give correct treatment and (3) failure to keep proper medical records.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Since each case must be decided on its own facts, we do not consider it profitable to embark on an analysis of the cases that werecited to the judge and again to us. On a consideration of the statements of claim and the proposed amendments we find ourselves unableto agree with the judge's conclusion that the amendments give rise to new causes of action. It seems to us that he fell into errorby thinking that the plaintiffs "complain only of inadequate precautions". Having thought that that was the plaintiffs' sole complaint,it is not surprising that he then arrived at the conclusion which he did. Although there is no specific reference in the statementsof claim to diagnosis, correct treatment or the keeping of proper medical records, it is plain that in each case one of the particularsof negligence alleged against the doctors was a failure "to provide any or any adequate medical services for [Mr. Ng and Madam Chau]."</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In our view providing medical services clearly involves the making of diagnoses, the giving of correct treatment and the keepingof proper medical records. Had the defendant requested further and better particulars, the particulars that have now been providedin the proposed amendments could then have been given. We do not accept Mr. Marshall's submission that the statements of claim wereso drafted that any reasonable person would have been led to the conclusion that the only allegation of negligence was that of failingto take precautionary measures to prevent the Mr. Ng and Madam Chau from attempting to commit suicide. There were four particularsof negligence given in Mr. Ng's statement of claim and five in that of the administrators of Madam Chau's estate. The fact that ineach case there were separate particulars relating to the failure to take adequate precautionary measures on the one hand and thefailure to provide adequate medical services on the other, made it plain that medical services relate to hospital care other thanthe taking of precautionary measures. The material in the proposed amendments of which the defendant complains consists essentiallyof further and better particulars of the negligence already alleged.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> Mr. Marshall readily conceded that if we found against the plaintiff on the respondent's notice it followed that the appeal mustbe dismissed and that the judge's decision to allow the.amendments should be upheld notwithstanding that it was given for the wrongreason.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Having heard counsel on the question of costs of the proceedings below, we reserved our decision on that issue. We think that justicewould be best served by ordering that the costs of that hearing be plaintiff's costs in the cause and that the costs of the summonsesbe to the defendant. We so order. The plaintiff's own costs shall be taxed in accordance with the legal aid regulations.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(K.T.
