This is therefore the assessment of the damages of the Plaintiffâs claim. Prior to the hearing, theDefendant has expressly written to the court indicating that he would not attend todayâs hearing. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  There has been an anonymity order dated 5 January 2010 prohibiting the naming or other identification of the Plaintiff in the contentsof any report of her case and the Plaintiff would simply be referred to as âLâ in all the court documents. </p>    <p class="heading">Facts</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  L is a Chinese female who is able to speak English, Putonghua, Shanghainese and Cantonese.  She graduated with a Master degree inAustralia in 2003.  Upon her graduation, she applied for and was offered a job by the Sydney office of the Marcus Evans Group whichis a worldwide established marketing enterprise. However, she was forced to give up the offer due to visa complication. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  L then emigrated to live in Hong Kong.  Some time in July 2007, she saw a job advertisement of the Hong Kong branch of the MarcusEvans Group (âthe Companyâ) recruiting sponsorship sales executive, and L applied for the job immediately.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On or about 3 August 2007, L attended a job interview which was conducted by the Defendant who was the general manager and the mostsenior staff of the Company. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  After the interview, the Defendant tried to develop a close relationship with L by sending her a number of text messages by mobilephone, including one saying âMissing you alreadyâ and another one saying âYou are a very special lady and I hope we can becomemore than friends.â </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On or about 10 August 2007, L received an e-mail from the Malaysian office of the Marcus Evans Group giving her an offer of thesaid job of sponsorship sales executive.  Her duties included contacting the top companies in the world with a view to secure sponsorshipfor various big events.  L accepted the offer. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Before the commencement of Lâs employment, the Defendant invited L to a dinner at a restaurant in a hotel.  During the dinner,the Defendant started to talk about topics with sexual overtones.  He talked about the sexual orientation of two senior managersand said that his relationship with his wife was not good.  He also told L that he had sexual relationship with a Chinese colleaguein the Singapore branch of the Marcus Evans Group when he was working there.   L was astonished by the private nature of the conversation. During the dinner, the Defendant invited L to dance with him five times, and each time L declined his request politely. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  After the dinner, the Defendant suggested L should go to a hotel with him and L refused.  The Defendant then asked L to go to theoffice of the Company for a business discussion, and L agreed.  When they arrived in the office, the Defendant turned on the musicafter a brief business discussion.  The Defendant then walked close to L and asked L to dance with him.  L declined and then left. At that time, L felt offended and thought that it was inappropriate for the Defendant to persist in his advances after her repeatedrejections. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  When L left the office and waited for a taxi, the Defendant followed L and again asked L to go to a hotel.  L refused and told himthat she had a boyfriend.  The Defendant immediately turned cold and demanded L to pay for the dinner and said it was a businessdinner. </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  After returning home on the same evening, L told her boyfriend what had happened.  As L wanted very much to establish herself inthe marketing industry, L still took up the offer of working in the Company. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  L started her employment with the Company on 18 September 2007.  During her first week in the office, the Defendant taught L howto log-in the computer system of the Company.  The Defendant sat close to L, put one hand on his private part and leered at L.  Lwas quite offended and L thought that the Defendant was trying to send her a sexual signal. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On or around 20 September 2007, the Defendant asked L to go to the board room for a meeting.  When they were inside the room, theDefendant praised Lâs appearance and then stroked Lâs thigh.  L felt disgusted and immediately stopped him.  L left the roomimmediately. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On or about 25 September 2007 during lunch time, the Defendant again stood close to L in the office.  He praised Lâs dress andtouched Lâs breast lightly.  L immediately stopped him and brushed his hand away. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On or about 9 October 2007 during lunch time, L was in the office with the Defendant.  The Defendant turned on the CD player inthe office and asked L to dance with him.  He then indicated that he wanted to have sex.  L immediately refused and she was increasinglyupset with the Defendantâs sexual advances.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On or about 15 October 2007 in the afternoon, L was standing by the water machine in the Company office.  The Defendant walked towardsL and said, âDarling, how are you?â  At the same time, the Defendant put one hand on his private part and leered at L.  L wasdisgusted.  Since then, L began to avoid the Defendant and did not greet him when L saw him in the office.  Sensing Lâs changein attitude, the Defendantâs attitude towards L began to deteriorate. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In or around the week before Lâs dismissal on 24 October 2007, the Defendant began to treat L badly and constantly picked on Lâsperformance.  Further, the Defendant asked L to move to sit in an isolated desk in the back of the office and he also wrongfullyaccused L of not properly cleaning the desk. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On 24 October 2007 at lunch time, the Defendant informed L that she was fired. During the discussion, L felt aggrieved and toreup the letter notifying the termination of her employment.  Just at that particular moment, the Defendant grabbed Lâs wrist forcefullyand seized the torn letter from her.  His force was so great that Lâs left wrist was bruised with apparent purple marks which remainedhurtful for several days.  The Defendant was angry and told L not to argue and to pack up her things and get out of his sight immediately. He took Lâs bag away and put it outside the Company office, and he also called the security guard to escort L to leave.  All thesehappened in front of all the colleagues in the office.  L felt insulted and the experience had gravely hurt her self-esteem. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  L was very upset and contacted the management of the Asia Pacific Headquarters of the Marcus Evans Group the next day to complainabout the Defendantâs sexual harassment and unfair dismissal.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum of the claim</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Based on the undisputed evidence of L, this is a clear case of sexual harassment under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 2(5)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">23</a>(3) of the SDO.  As dismissal was a direct consequence of the Defendantâs act of sexual harassment, damages from sexual harassmentshould include the damages flowing from the dismissal.  In any event, the dismissal constitutes an independent cause of action, namelysex discrimination under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 5(1)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a>(2) of the SDO, because L would not have been subjected to the Defendantâs sexual harassment but for her sex.  Hence, damages shouldbe awarded for loss flowing from both the acts of sexual harassment and dismissal.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  L is claiming for damages under the following three heads of damages:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i)   injury to feelings;</p>        <p>(ii)  exemplary damages under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 76</a> of the SDO; and</p>        <p>(iii) loss of earnings.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>(i) Injury to feelings</i></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Injury to feelings flows from both the acts of sexual harassment and dismissal.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  According to Mr Poon, the Chief Legal Counsel of the Equal Opportunities Commission which conducts the case on behalf of L, <i>Yuen Sha Sha v Tse Chi Pan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20HKC%20731" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 HKC 731</a> is the only case in Hong Kong which touches upon the assessment of damages for sexual harassment claim.  In that case, the defendantwas an university student.  He secretly placed camcorder inside the plaintiffâs room who was another student studying in the sameuniversity.  The video tapes found on the defendant contained images of the plaintiff changing her clothes and the defendant hadshown the tapes to a former schoolmate of both the plaintiff and the defendant.  In 1999, HH Judge H C Wong awarded $50,000 as damagesfor injury to feelings, $20,000 as exemplary damages and $10,000 as aggregated damages. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In <i>Yuen Sha Sha</i>, Judge H C Wong adopted the principles in assessing the quantum of damages of injury to feelings as set out by Smith J in <i>Prison Service v Johnson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20ICR%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] ICR 275:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â(i) Awards for injury to feelings are compensatory.

For a plaintiff who was subjected to a series of sexual advances and overt sexual comments, a sum of AUS$13,000was awarded as damages for hurt and humiliation in that case.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  L claims a sum of $100,000 as damages for injury to feelings.  After listening to her evidence, I accept that she was at one timefull of expectation working for the Company and was very keen to establish herself in the marketing industry. However, much to herdismay, the Defendantâs sexual harassment made her progressively uncomfortable, and eventually she was even disgusted and offendedby his persistence and later humiliated by his exploitation of the power imbalance.  It persisted for over a month.  L refused thesexual advances by the Defendant and it eventually led to the deterioration of the relationship between the Defendant and herself. The dismissal was extremely high-handed and openly oppressive abuse of Lâs personal dignity including hurting her wrist.  L wasextremely distressed and humiliated.  L suffered anxiety, stress, humiliation, physical injury and insomnia as a result of the sexualharassment.  In such circumstances and based on the authorities mentioned above, I am of the view that the quantum claimed by L,which falls within the middle band of the <i>Vento</i> guidelines, is reasonable and I allow the claim in full.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(ii) Exemplary damages</i></p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The second head of damages asked for is exemplary damages which is a kind of damages expressly authorized under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/480/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 76(3A)</a> of the SDO.  The object of exemplary damages is to punish a defendant for his conduct in inflicting the harm, when the compensatoryaward is inadequate to punish the defendant for his outrageous conduct, to mark the courtâs disapproval of such conduct and todeter him from repeating it <i>(see: Yuen Sha Sha, supra.,</i> at page 742<i>.).</i> Sexual harassment exploits and abuses the victim, who is generally vulnerable because of the power imbalance.  Sexual harassmentis also a tort which is easy to commit and difficult to redress.  All these factors are present in the instant case.  After referringto the two local authorities including <i>Yuen Sha Sha</i> and <i>Yuen Wai Han</i>, I agree that compensatory award is insufficient to punish the Defendant in the present case.  I am of the view that the amount claimedby L in the sum of $20,000 is appropriate and I allow such claim in full.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(iii) Loss of earnings</i></p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  L has also claimed for loss of earnings arising from the dismissal of her employment.  At the time of the dismissal, Lâs salarypackage was about $14,112 a month.  After the dismissal, she remained unemployed for a period of 5 months and 14 days and she onlymanaged to resume employment again on 8 April 2008 working as a marketing manager.  Hence, L is entitled to claim the full sum of$77,039 [(14,112 x 5 months) + (14,112 x 7/31) + (14,112 x 7/30)] as damages for loss of earnings.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In summary, the quantum of Lâs claim can be summarized as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <table width="85%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse">            <tr>                <td width="70%" valign="top">(i)   injury to feeling</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top">$100,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="70%" valign="top">(ii)  exemplary damages</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top">$  20,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="70%" valign="top">(iii) loss of earnings</td>                <td width="30%" valign="top"><u>$  77,039</u></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="70%" valign="top" style="text-align:right">Total:       </td>                <td width="30%" valign="top">$197,039</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  For items (i) and (ii), I allow interest at the rate of 2% per annum from the date of writ to the date hereof.  For item (iii),I allow interest at 4% per annum, which is half the existing judgment rate, from 25 October 2007 to the date hereof.  There wouldbe interest on the whole judgment sum from the date hereof to the date of payment. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  I now listen to the Plaintiffâs submission on the issue of costs.</p>    <p>(Submission on costs)</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s73b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 73B(3)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap.336</a>, each party to the proceedings under the SDO should bear its own costs unless the court otherwise orders on the ground that:(1) the proceedings were brought maliciously or frivolously; or (2) there are special circumstances which warrant an award of costs.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In the present case, the Defendant has not indicated an intention to contest the Plaintiffâs claim from the outset of the proceedings. However, I understand from the correspondence between the parties prior to the action that the Plaintiff was in fact prepared tosettle the case in the sum of $60,000 together with an apology from the Defendant.  Even facing with such a humble request, the Defendantrefused to accept the offer and was not even willing to offer an apology for his wrongful conduct.  In my judgment, the Plaintiffhas conducted the proceedings in a reasonable manner, and as a result I find that the circumstances of the present case warrant anaward of costs against the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Further, I am of the view that for a claim for sexual harassment, it deserves separate consideration.  Unlike other discriminationclaims, the Defendant knew from the outset that his conduct was wrong.  Every adult should know that it is wrong to make unwelcomesexual advances to a person of the opposite sex, in particular, that person is an employee under your supervision.  Further, it isalso obvious that one should not touch the body of a person of the opposite sex in an indecent manner, and that was actually whatthe Defendant had done at least on two occasions.  In such circumstances, I am of the view that there are special circumstances inthe present case to warrant an award of costs against the Defendant, and I therefore order him to pay for the costs of this Action.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(David Lok)<br />            District Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Herman Poon, Chief Legal Counsel of Equal Opportunities, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Defendant, in person, absent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2010/252.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
