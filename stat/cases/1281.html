The âtreatment planâ was, insimple terms, that the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant would first perform an operation on the Plaintiffâs upper and lower jaw-bones with the extractions of 4 first premolars(teeth 14, 24, 34 and 44) (âthe 1<sup>st</sup> surgeryâ), and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would then provide a period of orthodontic treatment to the Plaintiff afterwards. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> surgery was successfully performed.  However, in the course of receiving the orthodontic treatment from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, it was noticed that there was a shift of midline of the Plaintiffâs lower front teeth with also anterior open bite. Consequently, the Plaintiff received another maxillofacial surgery (âthe 2<sup>nd</sup> surgeryâ) followed by another period of orthodontic treatment. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiff alleges that due to the prolonged and underperformed orthodontic treatment by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the lower front teeth of the Plaintiff suffered root resorption that caused them to become mobile and less durable whichwould not have happened but for the negligence of the Defendants.  A tooth (25) was abscessed already and might need to be extractedin 10 yearsâ time. Moreover, she has suffered unnecessary pain and sufferings in having to undergo the 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is a service company owned by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. The 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant is a consultant of the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (âthe hospitalâ) who was the superior of the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant at the material times. The 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant was sued on the hospital behalf.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Contribution notices had been served by the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants and vice versa.  At the start of this trial Miss Wong, counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, indicated that they withdraw their contribution proceedings against the other defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The expertsâ evidence on liability was substantially conflicting. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiff relied on the evidence of 2 expert witnesses from the United Kingdom, namely Mr. Stephen Powell, the PostgraduateOrthodontic Director at Kingâs College, London University, and Mr. Timothy William Lloyd, a consultant in maxillofacial surgeryin the Eastman Hospital and University College Hospital in London.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants also called 2 expert witnesses to give opinion in court, including Professor Cheung Lim-Kwong, the Personal Chair Professorof the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Faculty of Dentistry in the University of Hong Kong, and Professor Erik UrbanOskar Hagg, Chair of Orthodontics of the Faculty of Dentistry in the University of Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> Defendants called Professor Henk Tideman, the Emeritus Professor of the University of Hong Kong and Professor in Oral and MaxillofacialSurgery of University of Sonklar in Thailand.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Apart from their expert reports, the above named experts have also put together their credentials for my reference.  They are allwithout doubt the cream of their respective fields and their expertise is in no way challengeable.  Suffice it to say is that, althoughtheir opinions are in some respect very different to each others, I am satisfied that all of them had given their opinions impartially.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Professor Cheung and Professor Hagg had examined the Plaintiff before preparing their reports whereas Mr. Powell and Mr. Lloyd hadonly the opportunity to observe a dental surgeon in Hong Kong to do an examination on the Plaintiff shortly before this trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u><b>Factual Background</b></u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Plaintiff was 26 years old when she sought orthodontic treatment from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in 1996 at the Yang Dental Clinic which was managed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant (all claims against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had been withdrawn in 2004).  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was an approved charitable institution in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Plaintiff sought orthodontic treatment in order to improve the appearance of her front teeth as she thought they were oversizedand the upper and lower teeth only touched at the edges (instead of the upper teeth being in front of the lowers).  She complainedthat her upper and lower lips were bulging, having a problem of excessive showing of gingivae, and her face was long.  She learntfrom her friend that the Yang Dental Clinic offered orthodontic treatment at a reasonable charge.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 17<sup>th</sup> September 1996, the Plaintiff was diagnosed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to have suffered upper and lower dentoalveolar hyperplasia (abnormal increase).  There were deformities between her upperand lower jaw bones and orthodontic treatment alone could not correct her problem.  In order to correct the malalignment of the Plaintiffâsteeth, elective maxillofacial surgical interventions to her upper and lower jaws were necessary prior to the commencement of orthodontictreatment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant referred the Plaintiff to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery &amp; Dental Unit at the hospital for consultation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 25<sup>th</sup> October 1996, the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant, at the time a Senior Dental Officer of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery &amp; Dental Unit at the hospital, diagnosedthat the Plaintiff had maxillary (upper jaw) and mandibular (lower jaw) dentoalveolar hyperplasia.  He advised the Plaintiff thatthe 1<sup>st</sup> surgery would include âWunderer and Hoferâ osteotomies (surgical operation whereby the dimension of the bone is modified by cutting),extractions of four first premolars and genioplasty (chin augmentation operation) reduction and advancement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  A joint orthognathic consultation was held at the hospital on 30<sup>th</sup> January 1997 in which the 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants were all present.  Several treatment options were offered and explained to the Plaintiff for consideration at the jointconsultation.  It was the consensus of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants that the treatment plan was the best option.  Details of the 1<sup>st</sup> surgery had been explained to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  On 13<sup>th</sup> February 1997, the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant explained the treatment plan to the Plaintiff again and in more detail.  He explained to her, amongst other things, thatthe whole treatment process would take about 2 to 3 years and the Plaintiff was warned of many adverse physical effects on her duringthe early post-operative phase.  According to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiff expressed that she fully understood the treatment plan and agreed to accept the same.             </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 17<sup>th</sup> February 1997, the Plaintiff was admitted to the hospital.  She signed a document titled âConsent for Operationâ on the sameday.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> operation was performed on 19<sup>th</sup> February 1997.  It was uneventful and the Plaintiff was discharged from the hospital on 21<sup>st</sup> February 1997.  Thereafter, the Plaintiff attended several follow-up appointments with the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant and her recovery was normal.  In the beginning of April 1997, the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant referred the Plaintiff back to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for post-surgical orthodontic alignment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  From 10<sup>th</sup> April 1997 onwards until at least March 2000, the Plaintiff had been undergoing orthodontic treatment with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  What had happened during this period of time is very significant and is under dispute.   </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  However, it is not in dispute that at least as at March 2000, it was noticeable that there had been some adverse changes occurredto the Plaintiffâs occlusion.  The lower dental mid-line was deviated more to the right, there was anterior open bite with increasedoverjet, the edentulous gap at the lower right posterior region between teeth 45 and 47 (âthe Spaceâ) was almost closed and thelower teeth were lingually tilted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  According to the Plaintiff, she noticed that her front teeth began to tilt inwards and shift aside as early as in the end of 1997. She also noticed a gap began to appear between her left top and bottom front teeth.  She mentioned these observations to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant every time when she attended his clinic but he just ignored them.  She also mentioned her concern of the changes in positionof her front teeth to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant in February 1998 but the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant made no response to her.  She repeated her concerns to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants in subsequent appointments but they just simply ignored her.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  According to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in his first statement made in July 2006, at the beginning of the post-surgical orthodontic treatment, he used 022â x028â multibanded straight wire appliances on the Plaintiffâs teeth and advised her that the treatment would usually take about2 years.  By July 1997, initial leveling and alignment with 015â multiflex, 014â 016â 018â round wires were completed.  Inabout August 1997, both upper and lower 017â x 025â rectangular wires were placed in order to close the spaces in all segmentsexcept the Space.  At a later stage when more root control was required, the regular wires were changed to 018â x 025â.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  It is convenient to explain more about the Space at this stage as the attempt to close or narrow the same became a very, if notthe most, important part of the Plaintiffâs complaints against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The Space is the gap left by the early loss of the Plaintiffâs right lower first molar (tooth 46).  The Plaintiffâsright upper molar (tooth 16) above the Space is  âover-eruptedâ and the tip of which extends to the level of the lower teethwhen the Plaintiff bites which, according to the Plaintiffâs expert, would block any movement of the Plaintiffâs tooth 47 towardsthe Space. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  It is also the Plaintiffâs case that the attempt by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to close the Space by orthodontic means (i.e., moving the adjacent tooth 47 to fill the gap) was impossible.  There wassimply insufficient alveolar bone at the Space to allow tooth 47 to move onto it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  According to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, he noted the Space at his first appointment with the Plaintiff on 17<sup>th</sup> September 1996.  At that time, he advised the Plaintiff that the Space had to be replaced by a bridge/denture in future after completionof the surgery and the construction of the bridge/denture would be carried out by another dental practitioner.  At the early stageof the post-surgical treatment when multibanded appliances were placed, he proposed to the Plaintiff that the Space might be reducedby intra-elastics in order to allow a shorter span for future prosthetic replacement.  He did not suggest nor attempt to close theSpace.  The Plaintiff consented to the proposed treatment and intra-elastics were then placed from the molar teeth to the hooks.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  It is the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs evidence that he noted subsequently that the lower labial segment of the Plaintiff moved much faster in a posteriormanner to the right.  He then advised the Plaintiff to wear intermaxillary elastics in order to counteract the posterior movementof the lower anterior segments.  The Plaintiff accepted his advice and he taught her how to put the elastics on the teeth and providedher with elastics for her own use.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant said in his statement that in subsequent appointments the Plaintiff confessed to him that she did not wear the elasticsas taught.  He said as a result there was an increased overjet as well as a lower centerline shift of the Plaintiffâs teeth.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  According to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, at the end of the year 1999, the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant had a telephone conversation with him about the progress of the Plaintiffâs treatment.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant told him that he noted the slow progress of the orthodontic treatment and there was a shift of the centre line to the right. He told the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant that it took a long time to level the over-erupted tooth 16 and the lower front teeth of the Plaintiff were moving toofast lingually inward to the right and the Plaintiff was not wearing the elastics as instructed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In view of the fact that the Plaintiffâs problems of overjet and midline shift became more significant, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant increased the number of intermaxillary elastics on 29<sup>th</sup> October 1999 from 1 piece to 2 pieces and on 25<sup>th</sup> January 2000 from 2 pieces to 3 pieces in order to increase the orthodontic force to counteract the inward movement of the loweranterior segments.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff still did not wear the elastics sufficiently and confessed to him that she did not wear theelastics at work during the daytime but only wear them at night.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has in his supplemental witness statement given details as to the orthodontic treatments he performed on the Plaintiffat the material times.  This supplemental witness statement was to explain the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs very brief notes of the treatment history of the Plaintiff.  I should say, without the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs explanation it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to comprehend in a meaningful way the contentsof them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Another main area of complaint of the Plaintiff is that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant failed to maintain the medical notes of the Plaintiff properly.  However, as I have indicated times and again to Mr. Fan,counsel for the Plaintiff, it seemed to me that the Plaintiff had not sufficiently identified to the court the causal link betweenthis alleged insufficient keeping of medical notes and the damages that the Plaintiff suffered.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On 28<sup>th</sup> March 2000, the Plaintiff informed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that the hospital suggested her to receive a second surgery.  On 31<sup>st</sup> March 2000, in a joint consultation held at the hospital with the attendances of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants, the Plaintiff was advised of 2 options to cure her problems by either a further orthodontic adjustment or surgical intervention.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The Plaintiff attended Yang Dental Clinic 2 more times to see the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in May 2000.  Thereafter, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not see the Plaintiff until after commencement of the present proceedings.  The Plaintiff was receiving treatment fromanother orthodontist named Dr. Tommy Chan. (âDr. Chanâ)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  According to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiff was passive and silent during the appointments with him and did not complain to him about her occlusionsas alleged.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant confirmed in his statement that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had mentioned to him in a telephone conversation in August 1999 about the Plaintiff not wearing the elastics as instructed. He also confirmed that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant mentioned that it took a long time to level the over-erupted tooth 16. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  According to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiff complained to him about the changes of her occlusion and lower front teeth for the first time on 10<sup>th</sup> March 2000.  On that occasion he also noticed the other problems of the Plaintiff and he had the view that it is in the best interestof the Plaintiff to have another joint orthognathic consultation with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  There had been some cross-examinations by Mr. Fan against the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant on his medical notes of the Plaintiff for the post-surgery consultations.  Mr. Fan suggested that according to what wasrecorded in the medical notes (e.g. a shift of lower dental midline), the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant should have noticed the Plaintiffâs problem on her occlusion as early as in August 1999.     </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The further joint orthognathic consultation was held on 31<sup>st</sup> March 2000.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant said the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had told him that the change of the Plaintiffâs occlusion was the result of an attempt to close the Space orthodontically,which had not been discussed as part of the treatment objective during the first joint consultation on 30<sup>th</sup> January 1997.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant explained the 2 options at length to the Plaintiff in the joint consultation.  The surgical option included a Hofer Osteotomyto match the lower anterior segment with the upper arch.  It was a repositioning of the lower anterior dentoalveolar segment to facilitatethe orthodontist to improve the Plaintiffâs occlusion with minimal orthodontic adjustment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The Plaintiff opted for the surgical option and changed her orthodontist to Dr. Chan.  She was admitted to the hospital on 4<sup>th</sup> July 2000 to prepare for the surgery and had signed a copy of âConsent for Operationâ on the same day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant performed the 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery on 5<sup>th</sup> July 2000 with the assistance of 2 other practitioners under the supervision of the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant.  The surgery was uneventful and the result was satisfactory.  The Plaintiff was discharged on 8<sup>th</sup> July 2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Six weeks after the operation, the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant referred the Plaintiff back to Dr. Chan for further orthodontic alignment.  In the 2 follow-up consultations by the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant held on 2<sup>nd</sup> December 2000 and 7<sup>th</sup> July 2001 respectively, the occlusion of the Plaintiff was found to be stable with normal overjet and overbite.  On the second follow-upconsultation, it was noted that the missing tooth 46 was replaced with a Maryland bridge from tooth 45 to tooth 47.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>   The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant was later on posted to another government hospital (North District Hospital) and the Plaintiff requested to have her casefollowed up by the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant there.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant continued to attend to the Plaintiff until 8<sup>th</sup> April 2004.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u><b>Particulars of negligence</b></u></p>    <p

style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>   For both defendants, the first pleaded particular of negligence is the lack of informed consent.  However, in his final submissionMr. Fan mentioned only briefly on this issue.  On the other hand, he put a lot of emphasis on the Defendantsâ failure to keep propermedical records which he did not mention at all in his opening submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>   As regard the issue of informed consent, Mr. Fan said only this in his written final submission:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>52.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>In the Plaintiffâs clinical notes, it is unknown if the Plaintiff has been given all the relevant information, including optionsof the proposed treatment, and that the Plaintiff did understand fully before giving her informed consent to the treatment.</i></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>53.</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="88%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>Prior to the 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery, there is no evidence that the Plaintiff was offered the option to seek a second opinion especially from another oral andmaxillofacial surgeon.â</i></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>    In his opening submission, Mr. Fan said:  <i>âTaking the matter at a glance, the blame appears to rest solely on D1 as he failed to obtain the informed consent of the Plaintiffbefore attempting to close the gap at the back of the Plaintiffâs lower right jaw.  Moreover, D1 was attempting the impossiblewhich should have never taken place.â</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  There is an obvious shift of the Plaintiffâs case in this regard. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mr. Fan also submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants did not monitor the progress of the post-surgical teeth alignment of the Plaintiff properly.  He said <i>âthe Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the final outcome of the treatment, which depends on the satisfactory outcomeof the treatments rendered by themâ</i>.  He stressed that the treatment was a âjoint treatmentâ but there was insufficient âteam workâ demonstrated by the Defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In relation to the issue of attempting to close the Space, apparently Mr. Fan has also changed his case.  In his written final submissionhe did not say anymore, as he did in his opening, that <i>âD1 was attempting the impossible which should have never taken placeâ</i> but to intermingle the issue with the alleged inadequacy of medical records and failure to monitor the reduction of the Space bythe Defendants.  He even speculated that <i>âThere is a good chance that due to the absence of a written treatment plan and the grossly inadequate entries of clinical records,D1 had confused the treatment of the Plaintiff with another patient and he therefore proceeded to close the Gap without even realizingthat he should not have attempted to do so.â</i>  With respect, there is simply no evidence before the court to support this wild guess. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  As I have mentioned previously in this judgment, the medical notes kept by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant are clearly inadequate and difficult to understand.  This might account for the fact that Mr. Fan relied heavily on thisand made it the trump card of the Plaintiffâs case in his final submission.  However, in going through the Amended Statement ofClaim, there was nothing pleaded as to the relationship between the inadequacy of records and the injuries the Plaintiff suffered. In other words, nothing was said about how the failure to keep proper medical records caused the alleged injuries.  Even worse isthat, there is nothing in the evidence to demonstrate how the improperly kept medical records contributed to the Plaintiffâs allegedinjuries.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  For the purpose of further discussions, I would categorize the Plaintiffâs complaints against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(a)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Failing to keep adequate records</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(b)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Failing to obtain informed consent;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(c)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Prolonged treatment;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(d)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Closing or narrowing the Space; and</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(e)</td>                <td width="90%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">Insufficient teamwork.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u><b>Discussions</b></u></p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Causation</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  It is trite law that <i>âthe onus of proving causation lies on the pursuer or plaintiffâ</i>.  <i>Wilsher v.

That is to find out, first of all, the cause of the collapse of the Plaintiffâs lower front teeththat led to the 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery and secondly, the reason why the Plaintiffâs teeth became mobile.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(a) Cause of the collapse of lower front teeth</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>   As regard the collapse of the lower front teeth (teeth 45, 43, 42 and 41), Mr. Powell, expert for the Plaintiff, explained thatas tooth 47 could not be pulled forward to the Space, it became a âperfect anchorageâ that pulled the lower front teeth backward. The centerline was therefore pulled to the right and as the lower front teeth had moved backward, anterior open bite was resulted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Mr. Powell opined that there was insufficient bone at the Space to allow tooth 47 to move onto it and the over-erupted upper molar16 also blocked the way.  He described the shape of the Space as a âcolâ which is in his words âlike the top of a mountainwhereby there is a peak but as you come away from the peak the mountain falls rapidly away and there is no material save at the peak.â This is called âneckingâ or an âatrophic alveolarâ and âthe bone does not exist laterally in the area of the missing toothâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Mr. Powell relied on a textbook by William Proffit which stated that âwhen teeth are extracted and the space is not closed thebone which contain the teeth gets eaten away.  It atrophies.â  He said one can feel by touching the space in clinical examinationto tell whether there is sufficient bone but he can also tell from the study cast of the Plaintiff that there was insufficient bonefor movement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Mr. Powell stressed that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not start to intrude tooth 16 only until after 22 months of the orthodontic treatment.  In his view, during this periodof time the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had been using forces to try to bring forward tooth 47 whereas it was blocked by tooth 16 whenever the Plaintiff bites.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  As to whether there was sufficient bone to move tooth 47, Professor Hagg, expert of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, took a different view from Mr. Powell.  In giving his evidence, he referred to a case from the book by Vincent Kokichthat involved the movement of tooth 47 to space 46 with necking condition similar to the present case.    He also demonstrated tothe court some cases of himself and his students involving movement of the molar to a necking space.  It is Professor Haggâs evidencethat this kind of orthodontic treatment can be done nowadays. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  In this part of his evidence Professor Hagg was asked to explain about the âridge augmentation techniqueâ to add extra boneto accommodate implants and he answered that an oral surgeon or maxillofacial surgeon would be more qualified to do so. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  On the other hand, Professor Tideman, expert of the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant who is a renowned surgeon, testified that the clinical photos and x-rays showed that the height of the bone between teeth45 and 47 have been lowered and the bone at the buccolingual region is thin.  This means that there is not enough bone to push thetooth in and he believed that any surgeon or orthodontist would agree that it is not possible to close or to bring teeth to the Spaceor to close it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant gave evidence that although there was some necking of the Space, it was not impossible to move 47 forward.  By lookingat the Orthopantomopgraph radiograph (âOPGâ) of the Plaintiff, he determined that there was sufficient alveolar bone to enablemovement of tooth 47.  It is his evidence that tooth 47 had actually moved and the Space was reduced as early as in September 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  There was a dispute between the expertsâ evidence as to whether tooth 47 had actually moved or only âtippedâ towards the Space. Mr. Powell gave evidence that after the intrusion of tooth 16, that is when the gate is open, the crown of tooth 47 tipped forwardby 3 mm whereas tooth 45 (followed by 43, 42 and 41) retracted by 5 to 7 mm. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  On the other hand, Professor Hagg said tooth 47 was not more tilted than it was before treatment.  He arrived at the conclusionby looking at the OPG and the study casts and comparing the position of tooth 47 as against the upper teeth 17 and 16.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  It is common ground that tooth 16 has to be leveled in order to move tooth 47.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In approaching expert evidence, the court cannot speculate upon medical matters or come to conclusions or diagnoses which are notsupported by at least one of the experts.  On the other hand, where there is dispute upon an issue of the medical fact, the courtmay prefer the evidence of one partyâs experts over that of the otherâs.  <i>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Liability, 6<sup>th</sup> Edition at 13-037</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  As agreed by Mr. Powell, the best person to tell whether there was sufficient bone would be the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as he was the one who performed clinical examination on the Plaintiff at that time.  However, in his evidence he said onlythat he found that there was sufficient bone by looking at the OPG of the Plaintiff.  He could have arrived at a conclusion by touchingand feeling the Space as suggested by Mr. Powell but he mentioned nothing about this.  Furthermore, he did not go on to explain ordemonstrate to the court in more detail how he formed his view by looking at the OPG alone.  It is in my view not safe to just relyon his evidence to conclude that there was sufficient bone to move the tooth 47.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Having said that, however, the evidence of Professor Hagg is not without force.  Not only that he showed this court examples ofsimilar cases allowing the movement of teeth with necking conditions, he also demonstrated that the tooth has actually moved in spiteof the necking condition of the Space.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In saying that the tooth 47 has actually moved I have accepted the evidence of Professor Hagg that it has not just tipped for 3mm as suggested by Mr. Powell.  By comparing the OPGs taken at different time, even bearing in mind that there would be discrepancieson settings when taking the same, it is obvious that tooth 47 has moved if we make reference to the relative positions of its rootsat different stages to the position of teeth 17 and 16.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>   With this conclusion in mind I should move on to consider the issue of the intrusion of tooth 16 before I come back to determinethe relevance of the sufficiency of bone.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  In his supplemental witness statement the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant stated that as early as in April 1997 when the Plaintiff was first referring back to him by the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant after the 1<sup>st</sup> surgery, he decided that tooth 47 should be moved forward to minimize the Space in order to allow a shorter prosthesis to be madeand he realized that â<i>it was necessary to level the over-erupted 16 because it was in the way of the movement of tooth 47</i>.â  He also explained the same to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  In paragraph 13 of the statement (quite contrary to what he has stated in his first statement as mentioned in Paragraph 25 herein)the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant said, â<i>At the next appointment on 12 August 1997, I considered that it was the appropriate moment to apply traction force to close the ExtractionSpaces to minimize the space left by the loss of tooth 46.  This course of treatment</i> <i>continued smoothly and without change till early February 1998</i>.â</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  In the same statement the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant stated that in September 1998,he <i>âobserved that tooth 47 had moved slightly forward mesially</i><i>and that the width of the gap between the teeth 45 and 47 had been reduced.  This was a good indication that the gap left by the lossof the tooth 46 could be minimized, and that the tooth 47 was capable of bodily movement without demonstrating undue side effects. I decided to continue with this course of treatment and to continue to monitor the movements of the tooth 47.â</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  However, it was not until February 1999 that action was taken to level tooth 16 with tooth 17 bonded in order to achieve the same.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>   According to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, in or about October 1998, unexpectedly he noticed that the Plaintiffâs lower anterior segment was moving in a posteriormanner to the right and in turn led to an increased overjet.  He saidin his statement that <i>â[he] suspected that slow bone healing in the surgical site following the</i> <i>1<sup>st</sup></i> <i>surgery may have been</i> <i>the</i> <i>cause</i>.â   He was forced to and indeed retracted this statement in cross-examination.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>   It is the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs evidence that inter-maxillary class II elastics had been applied to improve the Plaintiffâs overjet.  He explainedthat<i>ââ¦the use of CL II elastics will enable the lower teeth to move forward anteriorly.  The elastics are placed from the anteriorhook on the upper arch wire and posteriorly to the lower molar band hook.  This force vector will be translated into a horizontalforce component.  Because all the lower teeth are linked with an arch wire, this horizontal force component will move the lower teethin particular the lower anterior forward.â</i></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant stated that by the end of 1998, it became apparent to him that the Plaintiff did not wear the inter-maxillary elasticssufficiently because the undesirable movements of the lower anterior segment had not stabilized as expected.  He had the impressionthat the Plaintiff was growing reluctant to wear them.  And he said <i>â[t]his situation caused me some concern because I had long intended to embark on the orthodontic procedures required to intrudeand level the over-erupted tooth 16, which would in turn facilitate further progress in minimizing the spaces in the mandibular arch. This course of treatment should have begun months ago but for the delays caused, amongst other things, by the loosened, and theneed to allow some time for the inter-maxillary elastics to take effect. Despite the delays, I had adopted a conservative approachto treatment and preferred not to begin the next phase of treatment until the lower anterior segment of her teeth exhibited a certaindegree of stability.  One reason for this is that the use of inter-maxillary elastics had to be halted for a few months in the interim. This in turn meant that the movements of the lower anterior segment had to go unchecked during this time, the outcome of which couldnot be predicted.â</i> This is how the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant sought to explain why the intrusion of tooth 16 was done at such a late stage.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  However, this explanation does not sit well with what was described to have occurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  First of all, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not actually explain why the leveling of tooth 16 could not have started before he decided to apply inter-maxillaryelastics to the Plaintiff.  According to him, it was apparent at the outset that tooth 16 had to be leveled.  There is no reasonwhy it could not be done before his attempt to move tooth 47.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Secondly, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant embarked on the intrusion of tooth 16 after, according to him, the Plaintiffâs agreement to cooperate and he observedsome improvement in the condition of her lower anterior segment.  Nothing was mentioned about the stability of the lower anteriorsegment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  I have a serious doubt about the reason given by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as to why he only started to level tooth 16 at such a late stage.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant also accused the Plaintiff of not wearing the inter-maxillary class II elastics sufficiently after it was applied againon 20 April 1999.  According to him, later on he noticed that the centerline shift in the lower arch and the overjet became moresignificant than before and the Plaintiff confessed to him that she did not wear the elastics as instructed because of inconvenienceat work.   Double elastics were therefore prescribed on 21 October 1999.  However, the Plaintiffâs lower anterior segment continuedto retrocline and symptoms appeared to aggravate rapidly from the beginning of 2000.  He stated that in light of the Plaintiffâsfailure to wear the inter-maxillary elastics sufficiently as instructed, triple inter-maxillary elastics were prescribed on 25 January2000.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  It is difficult to understand the logic behind the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant given above.  If the cause of the aggravation of the Plaintiffâs problem were her failure to apply the elastics properly,what would be the purpose of keep on increasing the force of the elastics?  Obviously it was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs view that the force then applying was insufficient when he decided to double or triple the elastics to be applied.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Although as some stage the Plaintiff might have manifested her unwillingness to wear the inter-maxillary elastics that caused the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to complain to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant about it, I do not accept that this was the cause of the problem of the Plaintiffâs occlusion.  I agree to Mr. Powellâsview that without the Plaintiffâs cooperation to wear the elastics, the teeth of the Plaintiff would not have moved in such a way.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not impress me as a reliable witness as I observed him giving evidence.  He even retracted what he said in his witnessstatement.  The supplemental witness statement seeking to explain his medical notes was filed shortly before the trial started, andthe contents of which is, as I have set out above, hardly convincing and in part inconsistent with his previous statement.  I donot accept the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs evidence as an accurate reflection of what actually happened and his state of mind at the material times.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  I accept the evidence of Mr. Powell that the cause of the collapse of the Plaintiffâs lower front teeth was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs failure to intrude or level tooth 16 before he applied forces to move tooth 47 forward.  Although the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did later on make effort to intrude tooth 16 and indeed it was, damage had already been done to the Plaintiffâs lowerteeth. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  I note that after the intrusion of tooth 16 the midline shift and overjet of the Plaintiffâs occlusion did not stop.  It was infact aggravated.  Although I have found that there was sufficient bone for tooth 47 to move a bit forward, I take also the view thatthere was insufficient bone for the tooth to move further.  Due to the lack of bone for tooth 47 to travel, the lower front segmentwas forced to further retrocline and no matter what force applied by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by way of elastics, the problem could not be improved.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">(b) Cause of the mobility of teeth</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Professor Cheung, expert of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, recorded in his report his findings of the degree of mobility of the Plaintiffâs teeth as at August 2005 and January2007 respectively.

Professor Cheungsaid the mobility was probably caused by periodontal disease and Professor Hagg added that the self-administration by the Plaintiffof movable retainers might be a cause.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Professor Cheung explained the relationship between orthodontic treatment and root resorption in this way â <i>ââ¦the basis of orthodontics is to apply a force to the teeth using devices that attach to the teethâ¦to move the teeth acrossthe bone in order to align the teeth into desired position.  So by moving the teeth in bone a force is being generated in the toothand on the directions where it is moving, on the front end of where it is moving there will be bone resorptionâ¦the cells in thebone will eat away the bone in order to allow the teeth to move across in the jaw whereas on the other hand the bone-forming cellswill then generate bone in replacing the space that is created from the tooth being moved away.</i>â</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  It is generally accepted that orthodontic treatment causes a certain degree of root resorption.  As submitted by Miss Wong, thereare many factors that could cause variations in the degree of root resorption experienced, and this could range from the classicdifferences of age, gender and morphology of the teeth to the more subtle and even almost impossible to quantify factors of individualtissue/tooth response to different orthodontic forces and techniques, as well as genetics.  Professor Hagg described root resorptionas an unavoidable biological price of orthodontics.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  However, as agreed by Mr. Powell, the likelihood of severe root resorption materializing is very low or in his own words, severeand generalized root resorption (resulted from orthodontic treatment) is very rare.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  On the other hand, there are studies showing that the length of orthodontic treatment has a positive correlation with the degreeof root resorption.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Root resorption manifests no clinical symptoms unless hypermobility results and the only way to diagnose it is by taking of radiographsor specifically, periapicals.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  The tooth roots exposed to external root resorption due to orthodontic treatment would heal once treatment stops.  It is noted thatthis factor turned out to be crucial in determining the causation of the mobility of the Plaintiffâs teeth.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>   As can be seen from the table under paragraph 97 hereinabove, the mobility of the teeth had generally increased from 2005 to 2007. It is noteworthy that orthodontic treatment on the Plaintiff had already ceased before 2005.    Since root resorption would be healedor at least stabilized after cessation of orthodontic treatment, the increase in mobility could not be caused by increase of rootresorption.  This proposition is consistent with the scientific findings of Professor Cheung by measuring the ratio of changes inthe crown length.  It follows that there should be other factor(s) that have contributed to the increase in mobility.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  The support of the dentition is a balance between the periodontium, the length of the roots and a range of other factors.  The lossof periodontal bone can contribute mobility to teeth and is a result of periodontal disease.  In order to find out the reason behindthe increase in mobility, Professor Cheung compared the radiographs between 2003 and 2007 of the Plaintiff and measured the root-crownratio of the Plaintiffâs lower anterior teeth.  The result was that it indicated an increase of crown length but there was no changein the total tooth length which meant that there was likely a loss of periodontal bone around the lower anterior teeth.  Togetherwith the clinical finding of deteriorating gingival recession and root dentine exposure, it is consistent with the diagnosis of periodontaldisease.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  It is noted that in his latest observation of clinical examination of the Plaintiff performed by the local practitioner this year,Mr. Powell could not see any inflammation or pocketing which one would normally expect to see for periodontal disease.  However,he agreed that there was an occurrence of descending bone loss which is normally ascribed to inflammatory changes. He could not explainthe phenomenon but only say that there was an âanomalyâ in it.    </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Professor Hagg gave evidence that, when it comes to the support of teeth, the effect of a 3 mm resorption of the root correspondsonly to 1 mm loss at the âmarginal crestâ (the most superior part of the bone near the crown).  That is to say, bone loss hasa much more significant effect on mobility of teeth than root resorption.  He mentioned a study by â<b>Levander and Malmgren</b>â that even for a tooth with severe root resorption of over 50%, it can still maintain its vitality and is still functioning. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>   Furthermore, Professor Hagg said that at the time when he examined the Plaintiff in 2005, the Plaintiff had been self-administratinga removable retainer to her lower front teeth.  She told him that when she used it there was a gap between the teeth but when shedid not use it the teeth closed.  The teeth were therefore going back and forth (jiggling) depending on whether she was using theretainer.  According to Professor Hagg, this jiggling effect together with poor oral hygiene created an unfavourable environmentwhich then contributed to the breakdown of marginal bone.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>   On balancing the evidence of the experts, I tend to accept the propositions put forward by Professor Cheung and Professor Hagg. Professor Cheungâs evidence was founded by scientific measurements and there was nothing in the circumstances that their theoriescould not explain.  On the other hand, there was a so-called âanomalyâ in Mr. Powellâs theory and it could not explain whythere was an increase of mobility whilst the degree of root resorption remained the same.

The problem is that the on-going orthodontic treatment had caused problems itself with regards to root resorptionand damage to the teeth and â¦ further prolonged orthodontic treatment was likely to cause further damage.  But there is also riskassociated with further surgery.

In view of the result of the 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery, which was successful, it could not be said that the 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery was not a reasonable option that the Plaintiff could take.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Prolonged treatment</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs case that the orthodontic treatment was unnecessarily prolonged resulting in a severe root resorption onthe Plaintiffâs teeth that affected their longevity.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Mr. Powellâs view was that an orthodontic treatment should last not more than 3 years and the treatment rendered to the Plaintiffhad been too long in the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Professor Hagg gave a different opinion that orthodontic treatment can last for 3 years or even longer, depending on circumstances. He mentioned about a study published in America that the average treatment time was 27 months.  There was also a case in a Norwegianstudy that had lasted for 7 years.  However, those studies involved pure orthodontic treatment only with no surgical treatment beforehand.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  According to Professor Tideman, for post-operative treatment the maximum treatment time would be around 2 years.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant first applied orthodontic treatment to the Plaintiff on 10<sup>th</sup> April 1997.  3 years had passed when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant decided to receive the 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery to remedy the problem of her occlusion.    In my view, such length of treatment is definitely on the high side of its kindbut it can hardly be described as significantly prolonged.  I do not think that the length of the treatment in itself suggested anyimpropriety of the treatment.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  As I have mentioned hereinabove, the degree of root resorption due to orthodontic treatment varies depending on a range of factors(paragraph 99).  The length of treatment is just one of the factors and severe root resorption materializing is rare. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  While I appreciated that the evidence of Dr. Li had not been tested in any manner, it had not been challenged either as there hadbeen no application taken out by the defendants to call him for cross-examination.  Although there was nothing before the court tomake reference to for the basis of Dr. Li to conclude that there existed a 50% root resorption, in consideration of the evidenceof the experts testified before the court, I have no doubt that root resorption did occur and in my view the resorption occurredwas severe.  Here I refer to the evidence of Professor Hagg that a root resorption of over 25% can be regarded as a severe one. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  Besides, it is probable that but for the decision of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to narrow the Space and turned out to be unsuccessful that led to the collapse of the lower front teeth of the Plaintiff,the treatment time would have been shorter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  Nevertheless, I was given no clue as to what degree of extra root resorption, if any, could be attributable to the said âprolongedorthodontic treatmentâ.  Would a 3-year treatment, as against a 2-year one, long enough to render the root resorption deterioratefrom an acceptable degree to a âsevereâ one?  I can have no idea.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  As such, the Plaintiff has failed to prove that the prolonged treatment itself caused or contributed materially to the severe rootresorption of her teeth.  In any event, as I have found already that the Plaintiff has also failed to prove that her injuries werecaused by root resorption, this issue is already academic.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Closing or narrowing the Space</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had taken a wrong move in attempting to move tooth 47 in such a way that caused the Plaintiffâs lower front teeth tocollapse and hence the need to undergo the 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>    According to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the purpose of his narrowing the Space was to allow a shorter prosthesis to be made and in addition, the cost of bridgingcould be reduced too.  It was the contemplation at that time of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the Plaintiff that the Space was to be dealt with by another dental practitioner (presumably a restorative dentist)in future.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Obviously, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was well aware that there were several options open to the restorative dentist to fill up the Space, for instances, conventionalbridge, Maryland bridge, cantilever bridge or even an implant.  In my view, in seeking to reduce the Space the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was in fact to a certain extent making a decision for the restorative dentist which was, with respect, unnecessary.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>    Although it was Professor Haggâs view that it was an advantage for the restorative dentist to carry out his work by reducingthe Space, I agree with Mr. Powell that there could have little benefit in partially closing the Space which means that at the endof the day, say for example, a prosthesis is still necessary. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  I take the view that narrowing the Space at that stage was totally unnecessary in achieving the purpose of treatment to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  It is common ground that tooth 16 has to be intruded or even extracted in order to move tooth 47 into the Space.

Although tooth 47 didmove a bit in the end, an ordinary competent orthodontist, exercising an ordinary degree of professional skill, would have appreciatedthe insufficiency of bone for moving the tooth any more and would not have continued to apply further force trying to bring it forward.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  Although the mode of treatment adopted by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was approved by Professor Hagg in his evidence, I see it illogical or unreasonable for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant choosing to move tooth 47 in such a way given the circumstances that I have outlined hereinabove.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  The judgment of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20AC%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] AC 232</a>, which had been cited in Miss Wongâs final submission, is of assistance.  .</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>My Lords, I agree with these submissions to the extent that, in my view, the court is not bound to hold that a defendant doctor escapesliability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just because he leads evidence from a number of medical experts who are genuinelyof opinion that the defendantâs treatment or diagnosis accorded with sound medical practice.

Again, in the passage which I have cited from Marynardâs case, Lord Scarman refers to a ârespectableâ body of professionalopinion.  The use of these adjectivesâresponsible, reasonable and respectableâall show that the court has to be satisfied thatthe exponents of the body of opinion relied upon can demonstrate that such opinion has a logical basis.  In particular in cases involving,as they so often do, the weighing of risks against benefits, the judge before accepting a body of opinion as being responsible, reasonableor respectable, will need to be satisfied that, in forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the question ofcomparative risks and benefits and have reached a defensible conclusion on the matter.â</i> (at 587)</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>   In the circumstances, I conclude that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had been negligent in choosing to move and moving tooth 47 the way he did.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Insufficient teamwork</u></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  There is no question that in the present case it was a joint treatment that had been given to the Plaintiff by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants.
