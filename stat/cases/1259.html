He held, at paragraph 31 of the judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn my judgment there was no failure at all on the part of either defendant: neither was negligent, neither was in breach of itsduty. I am satisfied that the defendants had taken all such reasonable precautions as were necessary. The injury sustained by theplaintiff was solely the result of his own negligent conduct.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  So far as quantum was concerned, the Judge dealt with this because he believed it âappropriate to say a little because the plaintiffâsassertions in support of quantum are interwoven with the issue of his credibilityâ (Judgment Â§33).  He would have assessed damagesfor pain, suffering and loss of amenities at $50,000, pre-trial loss of earnings and MPF at $76,360.20 and other special damagesat $3,552.  He would not have awarded any damages for post-trial loss of earnings and MPF or for disadvantage in the labour market.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  From this judgment the plaintiff now appeals. He is acting in person in this court, having been represented by counsel and solicitorsbelow.  No doubt because of the fact he is acting in person, his notice of appeal is not in proper form, since it omits to stipulatethe order which he seeks from this court by way of substitution for the order of the Judge against which he is appealing.  However,it is clear enough from the grounds of appeal advanced that the plaintiff is seeking an order that judgment be entered in his favouron liability and that the quantum of his damages should be greater than the sum assessed by the Judge.</p>    <p class="heading">The facts giving rise to the plaintiffâs injury</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The Judge found that, since arriving in Hong Kong in 1997, the plaintiff had worked in the construction industry as a general labourerfor a number of subcontractors.  In 2006 he changed jobs and took up employment with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on 1 August 2006.  He was introduced to this job by a friend, Nassar Khan, who was his immediate superior on the day ofthe accident.  He was employed as a general labourer by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant but was in possession of a riggerâs certificate issued to him in 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In October 2007 he was promoted from general labourer to rigger, although he had been performing the duties of a rigger since August2006, working on the MTRC West Kowloon station construction site, on which the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the principal contractor.  It was the plaintiffâs evidence that part of his duties as a rigger was to ensure thatloads placed on vehicles for transportation were safe and secure.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 26 March 2008, the plaintiff was instructed by his supervisor to load a metal drum onto a crane truck and to unload it at theJordan Ferry pier.  He accomplished this task with the assistance of two general workers from the site, after which the truck, itsdriver (who was apparently also the crane operator), the two general workers and the plaintiff returned to the site.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The plaintiff was then required to supervise the loading of steel frames onto the same truck and to transport them, one by one,to the ferry pier.  In order to load the first of the steel frames onto the truck, the plaintiff placed hooks into the metal framestructure and the crane operator hoisted the frame onto the flatbed of the truck.  The two general workers were present and assistedwith this.  Whilst the frame was still being hoisted and before the plaintiff saw it safely placed and secure on the truck, he leftthe scene to go to the toilet.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  When he returned from the toilet, the plaintiff found the frame had been loaded onto the truck but the crane operator and two generalworkers were no longer there.  It appears that they had left for their lunch break.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Judge noted that there was considerable contradiction in the plaintiffâs version of events as to how he came to sustain hisinjury.  He considered the plaintiffâs statement made to the Labour Department dated July 2008, an accident report dated 24 July2008 and the plaintiffâs witness statement.  The Judge said those accounts were broadly consistent with one another, namely thaton his return from the toilet, the plaintiff found that one of the legs of the metal frame was shorter than the others so that theworkers had inserted a wooden block or chock for support and that he had tried to test if this support was stable by holding thewooden chock with his left hand and shaking the leg of the metal frame with his right hand.  When he was doing so, the wooden chockgave way and the leg of the metal frame came down, catching the plaintiffâs left thumb between the bottom of the leg and the woodenchock.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In contrast, the Judge recorded that in his cross-examination, the plaintiff asserted that he had not attempted either to push thewooden chock or to move the leg of the metal frame.  The Judge did not accept this new version propounded by the plaintiff, namelythat he was merely standing with his hand on the wooden chock when the frame dropped onto him (Judgment Â§16).</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Judge found that what the plaintiff had said on previous occasions before coming to court more accurately reflected what occurredon the day of the incident.  His material findings as to the mechanism of the injury are these:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â19. â¦ He was fully aware of the fact that a frame was being loaded on to the crane truck and that it was his responsibility toensure that it could be safely transported yet, despite this, he chose to absent himself from the loading process before it was complete.I note his evidence that it was his lunchtime, as well is that of the driver/crane operator and the general workers.</p>        <p class="quote">20. I accept that upon his return neither the general workers nor the driver/crane operator was present at the crane truck. The plaintiffplainly did approach the truck and then manipulate the frame, the wooden block or both in some manner or another so as to cause thetip of his thumb to be pinched between the wooden block and a part of the frame. That it was what may properly be described as thetip of his thumb being ânippedâ is evident from the fact that he was able to withdraw his hand, apparently without any difficulty,from the glove which can be seen in photographs exhibited as having the very tip of the thumb portion caught between the wooden blockand the frame.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The grounds of appeal</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The Judge clearly understood the basis on which the plaintiffâs claim was advanced. His summary of the plaintiffâs case in paragraph2 of the Judgment accurately reflects the Amended Statement of Claim:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â2. The plaintiffâs case as pleaded is that as a consequence of the injury he experienced pain and suffering and is now preventedfrom carrying on his previous occupation; that the injury which gave rise to that condition was caused by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs negligence or by the breach of the duty of care which it owed to him as his employer, or by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs breach of its statutory duty of care, which breaches have been particularized in 15 different ways; and that the likelihoodof harm to him was foreseeable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  As noted above, the Judge found in favour of the defendants on the issue of negligence and breach of duty.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The first ground of appeal in the notice of appeal is that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe learned Judge was plainly wrong to made [sic] certain comments as to his own impressions as to the merits of this case duringcounselâs opening. Judgeâs views were expressed in such strident terms.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  There is nothing unusual in a judge expressing provisional or preliminary views on the strengths or weaknesses of a partyâs casein the course of opening submissions.  The practice of providing trial bundles and written opening submissions in advance of thehearing saves considerable time by enabling a judge to understand in advance the facts, evidence and issues in the case.  If, inthe course of having read the relevant materials before the hearing, the judge forms provisional or preliminary views about any particularaspect of the evidence or issue arising in the case, it is perfectly proper for him to indicate this to counsel in the course ofthe opening submissions.  The purpose of his doing so will generally be to assist the parties by focusing their attention on thereal issues and areas of the evidence which may need particular attention when the witnesses are giving their oral evidence.  Thisexpression of provisional or preliminary views by a judge is entirely consistent with the more active case management role whichhe is expected to discharge under the Civil Justice Reform.  Thus, although it may be disquieting for a litigant to hear a judgeexpressing provisional or preliminary views on the merits of his case at the stage of the opening, there is nothing objectionableabout this providing of course the judge retains an open mind on the evidence and submissions that are then put before him in thecourse of the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  We have not been provided with a transcript of the proceedings below and so we do not know precisely what was said by the Judge,and how he might have expressed himself, in the course of the plaintiffâs counselâs opening.  There is therefore no proper basison which to accede to the plaintiffâs first ground of appeal.  I would add, however, that it is amply clear from the Judgment itselfthat the Judge in the present case took care to identify the issues in the action, to identify the relevant evidence which went tothose issues, to consider the arguments advanced by the plaintiff in support of his case and to explain his reasons for coming tothe conclusions he did on both liability and quantum.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In the circumstances, I reject the plaintiffâs first ground of appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The second and third grounds of appeal go to the issue of liability.  In the second ground of appeal, the plaintiff contends thatthe system of work was unsafe and that, when he returned from the toilet to find the metal frame already loaded on a flatbed truckwith the wooden chock being used to support the shorter leg of the frame, he found himself in a quandary as to what to do because,he contends, if the driver had returned before everyone else came back from lunch and started to drive away to the ferry pier, thechock might have given way during transit and caused a serious accident.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  By the third ground of appeal, the plaintiff contends that the Judge did not address the claims for breach of statutory duty atall.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  There is no doubt that the Judge properly had in mind the question of whether the system of work was safe.  In paragraph 23 of theJudgment, the Judge cited part of the speech of Lord Oaksey in <i>Winter v Cardiff Rural District Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%201%20All%20ER%20819" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] 1 All ER 819</a> at p. 822H in which one of the common law duties of an employer was specifically identified as being a duty to give adequate directionsas to the system of work or mode of operation.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The Judge noted (Judgment Â§24) the plaintiffâs answer to a question asked by the factory inspector in which he asserted thathe usually checked the legs of a frame before it was loaded onto a truck and that, if he saw that the legs were of unequal length,he would arrange for them either to be evened up or for the entire frame to be cut up.  He also noted the plaintiffâs evidencethat it was he who secured the ties necessary to enable the frame to be lifted onto the truck (Judgment Â§25).</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  There was no suggestion in the evidence that the plaintiff had checked the frame prior to it being loaded onto the truck (JudgmentÂ§25) and the Judge noted that, when he returned to the scene and found nobody else present, he chose to use a method to check thestability of the frame and chock which he had never used before and to do so without reference to his supervisor whom he acceptedhe could have contacted (Judgment Â§26).</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The issue of whether the plaintiff was put in a quandary was addressed by the Judge (Judgment Â§Â§27 and 28) who noted that thesuggestion the driver might drive away immediately without waiting for the other workers and the plaintiff is inconsistent with therequirement that they also be present at the ferry pier to assist in the offloading process.  The Judge held:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â28. â¦ there simply was no necessity for the plaintiff to have interfered with the chock and frame at that stage: he needed tohave done nothing as there is no suggestion in the evidence that, at that time, the arrangements posed any danger to the plaintiffor to anyone else. On the plaintiffâs evidence the worst-case scenario was that there was a potential danger which would only berealised, if at all, once the truck was moved.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Judge went on to hold:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â29. There were obvious, commonsense avenues open to the plaintiff to prevent that happening, none of which would have involvedexposing himself to a situation in which he might be injured. Instead, the plaintiff made a conscious decision to act, unnecessarily,as he did.</p>        <p class="quote">30. The plaintiff accepted that he had supervised the loading of lorries in situations like this many times before: he was an experiencedrigger, well-familiar with the working practices of his employer which, until then, he had followed without incident. This was hisfirst departure from those practices. He was, he said, trusted to do his job properly and safely.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  On the question of whether a safe system of work was provided, I find myself in complete agreement with the Judge.  On the mechanismof the injury as found by the Judge, which is not challenged on this appeal, this is a case in which the plaintiff failed to ensurethe legs of the frame were of even size before it was lifted onto the flatbed of the truck.  For whatever reason, the plaintiff absentedhimself from the loading operation and failed to oversee it as he ought.  There was no need for the plaintiff to handle the metalframe and wooden chock in the risky and therefore unsafe manner in which he did without seeking advice from his supervisor or assistancefrom his co-workers.  There was no immediate danger at the time and the plaintiff simply brought the accident upon himself.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In the circumstances, I accept the submission of Mr Ashok Sakhrani, counsel for the defendants, advanced in his skeleton that thedefendants were entitled to rely on this experienced plaintiff to exercise some care for his own safety.  Given the plaintiffâsconfirmation that he had never previously used this method to check the stability of a metal frame, there was no reason for the defendantsto foresee or think that he would act in this way on this occasion.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I therefore reject the second ground of appeal and now turn to the third ground of appeal, alleging failure on the part of the Judgeto address the claims for breach of statutory duty.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In my opinion, there is nothing in this ground of appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The Amended Statement of Claim alleged breach of statutory duties under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59I" class="autolink_findacts">Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap. 59</a>) and the Occupational Health and Safety Ordinance and Regulation (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/509">Cap. 509</a>).  Specifically, breach of regulation 52(2)(a)of the CSSR and breaches of sections 6(2)(a), (b), (c) and (e) of the OHSO and regulations 24(1), 27(1)(a) and 27(1)(c) of the OHSRwere alleged.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  It is not necessary to set out the various provisions of the OHSO and OHSR relied upon at length.  The requirements of those provisionsare, in summary: to provide or maintain plant and systems of work that are so far as reasonably practicable safe and without riskto an employeeâs health; to make arrangements for ensuring, so far as reasonably practicable, safety and absence of risks to thehealth of an employee in connection with the use, handling, storage or transport of plant; to provide such information, instructions,training and supervision as may be necessary to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, the safety and health at work of the employee;to provide or maintain a working environment for an employee that is, so far as reasonably practicable, safe and without risks tohealth; to avoid, so far as reasonably practicable, the need for an employee to undertake manual handling operations which may createsafety and health risks; to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to reduce risks to the safety and health of an employee whilsthe is undertaking manual handling operations to the lowest level reasonably practicable; and to provide an employee with such mechanicalaids or mechanical equipment as to secure his safety and health whilst undertaking manual handling operations.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  It will be apparent from the summary of those obligations that they are co-extensive with the employerâs common law duty of careto an employee and, to that extent, add nothing in the context of an action for damages for personal injuries arising out of an accidentto an employee in the course of his employment.  I agree with the view expressed by Deputy High Court Judge Fung (as he then was)in <i>Lam Wai Chi v Project Concern Hong Kong</i>, unrep., HCPI 78/2002, 10.4.03 at Â§48 that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the considerations under the Occupational Safety and Health Regulations and the tort of negligence are co-extensiveâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  So far as regulation 52(2)(a) of the CSSR is concerned, this provides:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(2) The contractor responsible for any construction site where materials are being kept or stored and any contractor who has directcontrol over any construction work which involves the use of the materials that are being kept or stored in the site shall ensurethat they are not â</p>		<blockquote>			<p class="quote">(a) insecurely stacked in a place where they may be dangerous to workmen employed at the site; â¦â.</p>		</blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  It is, in my opinion, self-evident from this provision that it is directed towards materials that are stored or stacked in placeon a construction site and not to materials, like the metal frame in the present case, which was being transported individually fromone part of the construction site to another.  In short, the regulation in question does not apply on the facts of this case.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I have already set out the Judgeâs concluding paragraph on liability (Judgment Â§31).  I am satisfied that he was mindful of theallegations of breach of statutory duty advanced on behalf of the plaintiff and that he reached the view, correctly in my judgment,that there was no breach of any such duty.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The last ground of appeal, ground 4 of the notice of appeal, concerns quantum.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Given my conclusions on the three grounds of appeal which go to the issue of liability, it is not necessary to deal with ground4 in any detail or indeed at all.  However, I am quite satisfied that there is no merit whatsoever in this ground of appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  It is clear that the Judge formed an adverse view of the plaintiffâs credibility so far as his injury was concerned.  He plainlyconsidered the plaintiff had tried to exaggerate the nature and consequences of his injury (Judgment Â§49).</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The Judge considered and weighed the evidence of the partiesâ respective orthopaedic experts, who had produced a joint report.Their examination suggested sub-maximal effort in testing and poor co-operation when testing the range of movement of the plaintiffâsleft thumb.  There was an objective absence of muscle wasting which contradicted the plaintiffâs complaints.  The defendantsâexpertâs unequivocal view was that the plaintiff could return to his pre-injury employment as a rigger if he were motivated todo so.  Even the plaintiffâs expert considered he could be able to perform the duties he performed as a rigger, although addedthe qualification that he needed to do these actions more slowly and carefully and some reduction in efficiency and endurance wouldbe expected.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Having set out the respective views of the experts, the Judge concluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â46. I have had the benefit of seeing photographs of the plaintiffâs hands taken at the time of the examination by the orthopaedicsurgeons as well as the radiographs and, in addition, of observing the plaintiff in court. I reject, as being without any foundation,the submission made on behalf of the plaintiff that Dr Yip [the defendantsâ orthopaedic expert] shows bias in comparing the plaintiffâsinjury to a simple domestic laceration. I accept his evidence in this regard.</p>        <p class="quote">47. I also accept that the plaintiff is able to return to his pre-injury employment: this is the view of both orthopaedic surgeons,albeit that Dr. Lamâs [the plaintiffâs orthopaedic expert] view is mildly qualified. I reject the plaintiffâs assertions tothe contrary which are subjective and unsupported, indeed contradicted, by the evidence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  For these reasons, the Judge held that the plaintiff had failed to prove any future loss of earnings post-trial at all or any disadvantagein the labour market (Judgment Â§48).</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  This court will only interfere with an assessment of damages if the trial judge is found to be in serious error or acting on a wrongprinciple of law or if the amount awarded is so high or so small as to make it, in the judgment of this court, an entirely erroneousestimate: <i>Cheung Kai Chi v Chun Wo Contractors Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%201%20HKLRD%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 1 HKLRD 102</a> at Â§Â§70-72.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In my judgment, there is no question of the Judge having been in serious error having acted on a wrong principle of law in his assessmentof damages in the present case.
