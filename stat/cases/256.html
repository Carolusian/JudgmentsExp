The word âaqua-â i.e. the word âaquaâ with a hyphen is defined as :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â<i>combining form</i> [Latin <i>aqua</i> water] forming nouns with the sense âwaterâ esp. with ref. to aquatic entertainment.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Thus the clear difference in the definition of âaquaâ in the earlier 3<sup>rd</sup> edition published in 1944 and the subsequent 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> editions published in 1993 and 2002 of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, which was called the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionaryin 1993 and renamed the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in 2002, is that in the editions published in 1993 and subsequently theword âaquaâ was no longer said to be the Latin word for water but that it had meant water generally since 1970 to 1999 and thatits etymology was Latin.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> The above dictionary entries strongly support the view that the word âaquaâ has become an English word as from the late 20<sup>th</sup> century i.e. from 1970 to 1999.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Mr. Garland, SC, for the plaintiff, however, disputed that the word âaquaâ was an English word.  He maintained that it was aLatin word and relied on the entry in the Oxford English Dictionary 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, the 1989 publication as set out above at para. 59.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> There is some support for this view in the Chambers Dictionary published in 1998 which defines the word âaquaâ as a noun meaningwater with the letter âLâ in brackets.  This signifies that the word was still regarded as a foreign word, rather than as a naturalizedEnglish word.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Mr. Garland, however, accepted that the word âaqua-â i.e. the word âaquaâ with a hyphen is a word which has come to be incorporatedinto the English language though it has Latin roots.  He also accepted that the word âaquaticâ has become an English word.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> It is not necessary to refer to all the other dictionary entries that I have been referred to.  Suffice it to say that there is strongsupport for the submission of Mr. Yan that the word âaquaâ has become an English word as from 1970 although there is also somesupport for the view put forward by Mr. Garland that it is a foreign word.  There can be no doubt, however, that the word âaqua-âi.e. the word âaquaâ with a hyphen and the word âaquaticâ have become English words with Latin roots.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> In any event it seems to me that it matters not whether the word âaquaâ has become an English word.  The question is whetherin Hong Kong it has by 1998 been commonly regarded and understood by the public as a word meaning water.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> I would observe that in <i>Beecham Group Ltd</i><i>.</i><i>âs Applicatio</i><i>n</i>, an unreported decision of Mr. Murphy dated 12 November 1976, the applicant applied to register in Hong Kong the mark âAQUAFRESHAnd Deviceâ in Class 3 in respect of antiÂ­-perspirants, perfumes, non-medicated toilet preparations; cosmetic preparations, dentifrices,shampoos and soaps.  It was held that the public in Hong Kong were familiar with the word âaquaâ as meaning water.  The markwas rejected for registration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The evidence of some of the witnesses also shows that in the 1990s the word âaquaâ was commonly understood as meaning water. This was what the plaintiffsâ witnesses Raymond Ferretti, Kathryn Re, Lin, Terrence Doyle and Sue Chow, the sales manager of the2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff at all material times, understood the word âaquaâ to mean.  Steven Berenson (âBerensonâ), the President of the1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, however, said that although he knew that âaquaâ meant water he was of the view that it was not commonly used thatway.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> Sue Chow agreed that âAqua-Leisureâ was quite an appropriate name for describing the sort of products that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff dealt in.  She herself had come across the use of the word âaquaâ on many occasions in relation to water-related products.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> Berenson accepted that the name âAqua-Leisureâ meant âwater leisureâ and that âAqua Gamesâ refer to water or aquaticgames.  Berenson also said that the mark âAqua Explorerâ in relation to diving masks conveyed the idea that a person who wantedto explore water would wear such equipment.  Berenson also agreed that on the material that had been drawn to his attention in evidencethere had been a fair amount of use of the word âaquaâ in relation to swim and aquatic activity related products and that insome cases the word âaquaâ referred to the type of business that the various companies which had made use of the word âaquaâdealt in.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> Paul Hoiriis (âHoiriisâ), the Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and a director of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, also agreed that the name of the products âAquaDiscâ and âAquaSkimmerâ indicated that the toys were to be playedin water.  He also agreed that the name of the company Aquatoy Inc. indicated that the company deals in toys which are played inwater.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> There is also an abundance of evidence to show that the word âaquaâ is used on and in relation to water-related products and/orbusinesses to refer to water and to describe them as being water-related products.  These have been particularised in the writtenfinal submissions of the defendant.  However, I shall refer to only some of them.  These include :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(a) âAqua Aerobicsâ which is used to describe aerobics done in water; (at page 77 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">S1</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part III)</a></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b) âAqua Golfâ which is used to describe a golf game played in water in a 		swimming pool; (at page 222 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(c) âAqua parkâ which is used with âaquatic parkâ (at page 292 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(d) âAqua Volleyâ which is used in connection with a floating volleyball game to be played in water (at page 294 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(e) âAqua Roller Fun Floatâ which is used in connection with an inflatable roller to be played in water (at page 301 of Bundle<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(f) âAqua Rocker Fun Floatâ which is used in connection with an inflatable rocker to be played in water (at page 302 of Bundle<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(g) âAqua Deckâ which is used to refer to a floating swim platform (at page 329 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(h) âAqua Cycleâ which is used to refer to a water bike (at page 329 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(i) âAqua Footballâ which is used to refer to a football played in water (at page 394 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(j) âAqua Baseballâ which is used to refer to a baseball game to be played in water (at page 400 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(k) âAqua Beltsâ which is used to refer to various flotation belts to be worn in the water (at page 406 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(l) âAqua Clothingâ which is used to refer to various types of clothing to be worn in the water (at page 411, 420, 424 of Bundle<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2)</a>; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(m) âAqua Basketballâ which is used to refer to a basketball game to be played in water (at page 403 of Bundle <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">S2).</a> </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> It is significant that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff has an almost identical product to the âAqua Basketballâ which it calls âWater Basketballâ.  This can be foundin the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs Swimgear and Water Games 1996 Catalogue where the product SA-1009 is called an âAdvanced Flotation Water Basketballâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> It is also significant that the plaintiffs themselves have used the words âaquaticâ and âaquaâ interchangeably.  An exampleof this can be found in the plaintiffsâ own document namely, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs detailed breakdown of sales for 1993 where the item no. ET9000 for the product âAquatic Tot Trainerâ is used interchangeablywith âAqua Tot Trainerâ.  The plaintiffs have themselves described the products that they deal in as âaquatic leisureâ productsas can be seen from the statement of claim dated 2 July 1999 of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff filed with the Donguan Technical Supervision Bureau in the Mainland.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> I am also entitled to have regard to my own knowledge of the use of the word âaquaâ in Hong Kong in July 1998.  I have no doubtthat the consuming public in Hong Kong commonly regard and understand that the word âaquaâ means water and that was also theposition as at July 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> The Registrar in dealing with the applications for the registration of the two âAquaâ marks rejected the applications under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(d).</a>  The Registrar in a letter dated 30 January 1999 signed by Miss Florence Lai took the objection, <i>inter ali</i><i>a</i>, that the trade mark âAquaâ was descriptive of the goods in the sense that the goods are used for aquatics.  The solicitors forthe 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff did not dispute this in their reply of 9 June 1999 but instead presented evidence of the use of the mark âAquaâ therebyrelying on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(e).</a>  The Registrar in a subsequent letter dated 29 June 1999 signed by a different officer Ms Fok stated that she was satisfied thatthe mark was deemed to be distinctive of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs goods and accepted the âAquaâ trade marks for registration under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(e).</a>  This necessarily meant that the marks were not suitable for registration under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(d).</a>  The reason must have been that the marks had a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> It is clear that the Registrar considered that the two âAquaâ trade marks did not quality for registration under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(d).</a>  However, because of the evidence submitted by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs solicitors, the Registrar decided to register the âAquaâ marks under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(e).</a> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> As regards the two âAqua LEISUREâ trade marks, all the products in respect of which the marks were registered are also swim orwater-related products.  They are all products to be used in aquatic leisure activities and aquatic sports.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> As I have said, the Registrar came to the view that the two âAquaâ marks should not be registered under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(d)</a> but because of the evidence of user submitted, registration was allowed under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(e).</a>  It was made clear in the register that the trade marks were deemed to be distinctive of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs goods pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(e).</a>  No such statement appears on the register in respect of the two âAqua LEISUREâ marks.  It appears that the registration of twoâAqua LEISUREâ marks were allowed under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(d)</a> with a disclaimer of the exclusive right to use the word âLEISUREâ.  That was, in my view, a fundamental flaw in the decisionof the Registrar.  The Registrar came to the view, correctly in my judgment, that the mark âAquaâ has a direct reference to thecharacter or quality of the goods the subject of the applications for registration of the two âAquaâ marks and hence refusedregistration under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(d).</a>  That being so, I fail to see how the Registrar could have come to the view that the registrations of the two âAqua LEISUREâmarks should be allowed under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(d).</a>  The same objection that âAquaâ has a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods should also been applicable tothe registration of the two âAqua LEISUREâ marks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> It seems to me to be plain that the word âaquaâ in the âAquaâ marks and the âAqua LEISUREâ marks is clearly descriptiveand can be used to signify or call up in the minds of those who read it a quality or character of the goods in respect of which itis registered namely, aquatic or water-related products.  In my judgment the word âaquaâ has a direct reference to the characteror quality of such goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> The fact that the word âaquaâ is a noun and not an adjective does not matter.  It is no answer to say that the marks consistsof the word âaquaâ and not the word âaquaticâ.  It seems to me that âaquaticâ is the adjective for âaquaâ and notfor âwaterâ as Mr. Garland submitted.  Mr. Garland relied on the dictionary entry for âaquaticâ in the New Oxford Dictionaryof English where it is defined as :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â<b>adjective</b> of or relating to water.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">I am unable to accept that this dictionary entry supports the view that âaquaticâ is the adjective of âwaterâ.  It is simplydescribed as an adjective.  The meaning of the word is âof or relating to waterâ.  It seems to me that the noun is âaquaâand the adjective is âaquaticâ. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> <i>In the Matter of a Trade Mark of Keystone Knitting Mills Ltd</i><i>.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1928%5d%2045%20RPC%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1928] 45 RPC 421</a> it was held that the word âCharmâ registered in Class 38 in respect of âhosiery being wearing apparelâ had a direct referenceto the character of the goods and the mark was expunged.  It was held that in considering whether a mark has reference to the characteror quality of the goods the mark must be looked at, not in its strict grammatical signification, but as it would represent itselfto the public at large who are to look at it and to form an opinion as to what it connotes (at page 426).  It seems to me that justas it was no answer to say that the mark was âCharmâ and not in its adjectival form âCharmingâ, it is no answer to say herethat the marks consist of âAquaâ and not âAquaticâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The defendants have established to my satisfaction that the two âAquaâ and the two âAqua LEISUREâ trade marks did not qualifyfor registration under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(d).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">S<i>. 9(1)(e)</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> The defendants further contend that the âAquaâ trade marks are not distinctive and do not qualify for registration under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(1)(e).</a></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 9(2)</a> provides that âdistinctiveâ means :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(a)    in the case of a trade mark relating to goods, adapted in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registeredor proposed to be registered, to distinguish goods with which the proprietor of the trade mark is or may be connected, in the courseof trade, from goods in the case of which no such connection subsists;â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> Thus âdistinctiveâ is defined as adapted, in relation to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered or proposed tobe registered, to distinguish goods with which the proprietor of the trade mark is or may be connected, in the course of trade, fromgoods in the case of which no such connection subsists.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> And <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(3)</a> provides that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â In determining whether a         trade mark is adapted to distinguish as aforesaid the tribunal may have         regard to theextent to which -</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(a)  the trade mark is inherently adapted to distinguish as aforesaid; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(b)  by reason of the use of the trade mark or of any other circumstances, the trade mark is in fact adapted to distinguish as aforesaid.â</p>    </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> This in effect provides that there must be distinctiveness in law and also in fact.

This question of degree as applied to (b) of subsection (3) is assumed to be answered in the sense that that factor isfully present.

In short, I am unable to see why the respondents in the circumstances which existin this case should be allowed to gain such a monopoly in respect of the word âGlastonburyâ as might place a trader in Glastonbury,desirous of making a perfectly honest use of the word, in a position of grave difficulty, and might cause confusion in the mindsof purchasers.â  (emphasis added). </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">There was no restriction to use as a description.

If the answer is in the affirmativethe Court will probably hesitate to allow the word to be registered.  But if the answer be in the negative, either by reason of thenature of the words, or because past user has limited the possibility of other traders safely or honestly so using the words theCourt may well grant the desired permission.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> However, it seems to me that the descriptive use of the words was one possible use considered by the Court.  This did not precludethe Court from considering the relevance of other uses, including trade mark use and use in promotional or publicity material byother traders so as to disentitle the applicant from registration of the trade mark.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> Mr. Garland relied heavily on <i>Re J &amp; P Coats Ld</i><i>âs Application</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2053%20RPC%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 53 RPC 355.</a>  This was in respect of the registration of the word âSheenâ for âmachine twist being sewing cottonâ.  It was held that theword âSheenâ was not the ordinary or natural word used in the trade, not a word incapable of losing its primary meaning and thatits registration would not embarrass a trader who used it legitimately.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> That case however is distinguishable.  It provides no assistance to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  There was considerable evidence of the trade in that case which led the Court to come to the view that the word âSheenâwas not a word simply descriptive of the quality of the goods.  There was considerable evidence that the word âSheenâ was notthe ordinary and natural word which would be used in the trade to describe sewing cotton.  The evidence in that case showed thatâSheenâ and âSuper Sheenâ have in the sewing cotton trade generally become well known as denoting exclusively machine twistof the applicantâs merchandise and as distinguishing their machine twist from that of any other cotton manufacturer or merchant. The Court in that case also considered (at 375) that on the evidence which was overwhelming it was not the ordinary or natural wordwhich in the trade would be used, including use as a trade mark. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> As Jacob LJ (as he now is) said in <i>BUDGET</i> at 15 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe major difference between Sheen and this case is the evidential position. In Sheen, although the word was of a semi-descriptivenature (albeit more poetical than commercial), there was positive and compelling evidence that other traders did not and did notwant to, use the word, either as a trade mark for their cotton or as a description.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> That is also the difference between Sheen and this case.  Here the evidence is overwhelming that other traders did want to and haveused the word âaquaâ in relation to goods of the same description.  The evidence is referred to in Schedule A to Mr. Yanâsclosing skeleton submissions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> It is plain that possible defences to infringement under s. 34 such as that the use is merely a <i>bona fide</i> description of the character or quality of a personâs goods should not be taken into account when considering registration of atrade mark.  The reason for this is that the privilege of a monopoly should not be conferred where it might require honest men tolook for a defence (<i>COLORCOAT</i> at 517).  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> The submission of Mr. Garland to the effect that a mark is not inherently adapted to distinguish only if other traders would wishto use the mark as an honest description of their own similar products or for promotional material but not if other traders woulddesire to use the mark as a trade mark is in my judgment misconceived.  This is not what Lord Parker said. The classic test of LordParker has been applied in the later authorities as well as by the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong in <i>Re Guangdong Food Stuffs</i>.  In my judgment that is the correct and applicable test and not the test as submitted by Mr. Garland.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> In considering the test as to whether other traders are likely, in the ordinary course of their business and without improper motive,to desire to use the word âaquaâ upon or in connection with their goods, the evidence presented by the defendants show that itis clear that other traders would wish to do so.  The 1998 Inflatable Items catalogue of Shanghai Oriental Plastic Products Co. Ltd.(âShanghai Orientalâ) show that âAQUAâ has been used for an inflatable ball, âAqua Animalsâ for animal toys to be playedin water, âAqua Boatâ and âAqua Fun Boatâ for inflatable boats.  Intex has also in their 1995 catalogue used âAqua VisionMaskâ for its swim masks.  These clearly show that at the time of the application of the trade marks other traders in Hong Kongwere likely, in the ordinary course of their business and without improper motive, to desire to use the word âAquaâ upon or inconnection with their goods.  It is use upon or in connection with the goods that matters.  It is no answer to say that the use hasbeen trade mark use and not as a description of the goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> There are also other catalogues by other traders after the date of the application for registration of the trade marks which showthat other traders have used the word âaquaâ upon or in connection with their goods in the ordinary course of their businesswithout improper motive.  This can be found in the Grace Best (International) Industrial Co. Ltd. (âGrace Bestâ) catalogue wherethere is the use of the âbest aquaâ swimming goggles and the 1999 catalogue of Royal Beach where âAqua Parkâ is used uponor in connection with pools and inflatables.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> There are also many examples of other traders using âAquaâ upon or in connection with inflatable swimming pools, floating playthingsas set out in Schedule A to the written final submissions of the defendants.  It matters not that the evidence of this was afterthe date of the application.  It serves to illustrate the point that as at the date of the application other traders would wish touse the word âAquaâ upon or in connection with their goods without improper motive.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> There is also an abundance of evidence of the use of the word âaquaâ in relation to water-related products and swim productsin foreign countries as detailed in Schedule A to the written final submissions of the defendants.  All this, together with the factthat in the said catalogues of Intex, Royal Beach and Shanghai Oriental referred to above those traders did use the word âaquaâin connection with swim or water-related products, does demonstrate, and I so find, that in 1998 traders in Hong Kong were likelyto want to use in the course of their business the word âaquaâ in connection with or upon the products in respect of which theregistrations were sought.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> The evidence also shows that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was a licensee of Aquatoys Inc. who marketed the âAquaDiscâ and âAquaSkimmerâ products.  Far from complaining aboutthe use of the word âaquaâ by Aquatoys Inc., the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff took out a licence to produce these two products under a license agreement with Aquatoys Inc.  This provides cogent evidencethat honest traders, like Aquatoy Inc., desired to use the word âaquaâ for floating playthings which are goods covered by theregistrations.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> It seems to me that it would not be right or fair for the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to have a monopoly over the word âaquaâ under the âAquaâ and âAqua LEISUREâ trade marks in respect of the goodsfor which they were registered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> In my judgment the word âaquaâ is a very descriptive word and commonly regarded and understood in Hong Kong as meaning water. It is a natural and ordinary word in relation to the goods covered by the registrations that other traders would wish to use.  Allthe goods covered by the registrations are water-related goods to be used in aquatic leisure activities and aquatic sports.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> It is pertinent to observe that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff has itself described the products it deals in as âaquatic leisureâ products in its statement of claim dated 2 July1999 filed with the Donguan Technical Supervision Bureau in the Mainland.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> I have no hesitation in finding that in 1998 other traders would have wished to legitimately use the word in relation to or in connectionwith the same or similar goods.  Such use would have been use either as a description of the goods or as trade mark use or use aspromotional material.  All this is use in relation to or in connection with the goods.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> That being so, it seems to me that the word âaquaâ was not inherently adapted to distinguish and the requirement of (a) unders. 9(3) was not satisfied.  </p>    <p class="heading">Factual distinctiveness</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> The1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs case is that by the time of the application for registrations of the mark the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had 100% distinctiveness in fact.  It was submitted that there was no other trader which had in Hong Kong used the wordâaquaâ on the specified goods other than the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff so that 100% distinctiveness in fact had been established.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> I am unable to accept this.  There was evidence that Intex had in its 1995 and 1996 catalogues offered for sale a product calledâAqua Visionâ in connection with swim masks.  Shanghai Oriental also in their 1998 catalogue offered for sale products calledâAquaâ, âAqua Funâ, âAqua Animalsâ, âAqua Boatâ and âAqua Fun Boatâ.  These were offered for sale in their cataloguesbefore the date of the application of the registered trade marks.  The defendant did not put in evidence of the quantities, of theseproducts sold in Hong Kong before the date of the application.  However, it seems to me that as they were offered for sale in thecatalogues there has been some use made of the word âaquaâ by such other traders although it is not clear how extensive suchuse was in Hong Kong.  Even though factual distinctiveness has been shown, I am not persuaded that there has been 100% factual distinctivenessby the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff at the time of the application.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> In support of its applications for registrations, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff relied on the statutory declaration of Douglas Stephen Clark to establish evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs use of the mark âAquaâ.  In the letter dated 29 June 1999 the Registrar was satisfied that the âAquaâ trademarks were deemed to be distinctive of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs goods on the basis of the evidence of user submitted.  Mr. Yan, however, submitted that the evidence contained in thesaid statutory declaration was insufficient to establish factual distinctiveness of the mark âAquaâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> Para. 7 of the declaration showed that since 1992 the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff sourced through or from Hong Kong more than 50 m. units of their products all bearing the trade mark âAquaâ with totalsales in excess of US$150 m.  Berenson, however, confirmed in evidence that this quantity included all products not only bearingthe mark âAquaâ alone but âAquaâ in combination with other words.  Also, this included all products exported.  The fact thatthis quantity was sourced through or from Hong Kong does not mean that this quantity was sold in Hong Kong.  Domestic sales in HongKong were much less.  According to Sue Chow, the total domestic sales in Hong Kong between 1996 and 1998 was about US$100,000 peryear but it is not clear how much of this was for products under the mark âAquaâ alone and how much was for products under themark âAquaâ in combination with other words and for products under the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs âDolfinoâ mark.  On the documentary evidence exhibited to the affirmations of Pearl Lam there were from 1992 to1998 domestic sales of 143,775 pieces or an average of 20,000 pieces each year.  Sales were made domestically to Toys âRâ Usand Seibu.  It does not appear that there were substantial domestic sales at the time of the application.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> Mr. Yan made the point that the only trade fair in Hong Kong where products bearing the âAquaâ trade marks could have been exhibitedwas in January 1998, the Hong Kong Toys and Games Fair.  This was because Berenson said that before November 1998 the only exhibitionsthe plaintiffs had participated in were in January 1985 and 1998.  However, in 1985 the âAquaâ trade marks were not in use sothe only exhibition where the âAquaâ trade marks were used on products was in January 1998.  This was, however, as Mr. Yan submitted,limited exposure in a trade fair in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> Although there was evidence of domestic sales in Hong Kong of products bearing the mark âAquaâ it does not appear that such saleswere substantial.  In the circumstances, the degree of factual distinctiveness was in my view not high. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> In any event even if there was 100% factual distinctiveness that in itself would not be sufficient to render the word âdistinctiveâto qualify for registration under s. 9(1)(e) as the word âaquaâ was not inherently adapted to distinguish.  </p>    <p class="heading">Foreign registrations</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> Evidence has been given of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs trade mark registrations in foreign countries.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> In â<i>NEEDLE-POINT</i>â <i>Trade Mark</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%20RPC%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] RPC 113</a> it was held that the fact that the applicants had succeeded in registering their mark in a foreign country had little or no bearingon whether the mark was capable of distinguishing the goods of the applicants in the United Kingdom.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> I do not know what material was provided to the foreign registries in support of the foreign registrations.

The tort of passing off is complete when the defendant parts with possessionof the deceptive goods even though the damage may not occur until later,if at all (<i>Wadlowâs The Law of Passing Off</i> 3<sup>rd</sup> Edn. para. 5-103).  When deceptive goods are exported, liability can arise under the doctrine of instruments of deception.  The tortof passing off is complete when deceptive goods are exported or disposed of in Hong Kong even though it may be destined for a foreignmarket.  This is not disputed. However, it is necessary to prove that the goods are such as would deceive ultimate purchasers inthat market.  The claimant must prove that his mark is distinctive in that market and that the defendantâs conduct is calculatedto deceive there (<i>Wadlow</i> para. 5-114).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> Where a trader adopts a descriptive word or a word in common use for his trade name or mark, he must accept that some risk of confusionis inevitable.

have sourced through or from Hong Kong more that 50 m units of the plaintiffsâproducts with the trade mark âAquaâ with total sales amounting to greater than US$200 m.  The majority of the sales were undoubtedlyto North America. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a> Sue Chow said that between 1996 and 1998 direct sales to countries excluding USA, Canada and South America have exceeded HK$24 m.Domestic sales for the same period were around US$100,000 per year. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> Mr. Yan submitted that the evidence was insufficient to establish goodwill or at least strong goodwill in Hong Kong in the âAquaâor âAqua LEISUREâ trade marks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a> It seems to me that the fact that 50 m units were sourced through or from Hong Kong does not mean that this quantity of productsreached the attention of the consuming public in Hong Kong.  The evidence of Sue Chow was that domestic sales in Hong Kong between1996 and 1998 was about US$100,000 per year.  This presumably included products sold both under the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs âAquaâ trade marks and âDolfinoâ trade marks.  In terms of quantity, 143,775 pieces were sold domesticallyfrom 1992 to 1998 or 20,000 pieces per year on average.  There is also the evidence in the statutory declaration of Douglas Clarkthat there have been sales in Toys âRâ Us and Seibu so it seems that the domestic sales took place there.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a> The plaintiffs also rely on the evidence of Berenson that the plaintiffs have promoted and offered their products for sale in HongKong both at trade fairs and at the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs showroom.  However, those attending the trade fairs and the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffâs showrooms would have been traders in the field and it is unlikely that they would have been the consuming public inHong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a> Raymond Ferretti, Kathryn Re and Terrence Doyle, all former buyers for retail chain stores in the USA, gave evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was commonly referred to as âAquaâ and that in their experience the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was the only maker of swim products who has used the word âAquaâ whether alone or in conjunction with other words. They were of the view that swim products sold under those marks designated the products of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  Their evidence undoubtedly supports the fact the plaintiffs had very substantial reputation and goodwill but this wouldbe for their markets in the USA. Their evidence does not, in my view, support a very substantial and extensive reputation and goodwillof the plaintiffs in respect of the âAquaâ products in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a> I am satisfied, however, that the plaintiffs have established sufficient reputation and goodwill in Hong Kong in the mark âAquaâto found the action in passing off.  However, such reputation and goodwill in Hong Kong was not substantial but it is sufficientto found the action.  This element in the tort has been established to my satisfaction.</p>    <p class="heading">Reputation and goodwill in Europe</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a> Antoine Mettens, De Vries and Frank Tiessen gave evidence to the effect that the plaintiffs did not have a significant presence inEurope in 1998 and that âAqua Leisureâ was a minor brand in Europe in 1998.  I observe that this part of their evidence was notchallenged.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a> Mr. Yan also submitted that the plaintiffsâ own evidence supported the view that âAqua Leisureâ was not an established brandin Europe in 1998.  There is some force in this submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a> The invoices for sales to Germany indicated that only 159,538 units of âAquaâ swim products were sold to Germany from 1993 to1996.  However, it is possible that further sales were made to Germany to a company called Globus as Hoiriis said that this was eitheran Austrian or German company.  There were sales of about 10,000 units in 1997 and 54,000 units in 1998 to Globus.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a> As regards Denmark, there is evidence from Hoiriis that sales were to a company called Top Toy in Denmark with 19,536 units in 1997and 5,364 units in 1998.  These are not substantial sales.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a> As regards the Czech Republic, there is no evidence of any sales or promotional activities in respect of the plaintiffsâ productsthere.  No evidence to support any goodwill or reputation there has been adduced and in my view the plaintiffs have failed to showa reputation and goodwill in the Czech Republic.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a> As regards Italy, there were sales of 99,090 units to Italy from 1992 to 1994 and 3,558 units in 1996.  Hoiiris also gave evidencethat he believed that there were sales to a company called Genovese which sounded Italian to him but he could not say definitelywhether these were sales to an Italian company.  For 1997 there were sales of 660 units to this company.  Also, there were salesto Toys âRâ Us in Italy of 864 pieces in 1997 and 7,170 pieces in 1998.  These were not substantial quantities.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a> As regards Belgium, the summary of invoices show that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff sold 339,810 units from 1992 to 1996.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a> As regards Spain, the summary of invoices indicate that 473,232 units of Aqua swim products were sold in Spain in the years 1992to 1993 and 1996 to 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a> As regards Holland, there is no evidence of any sales or promotional activities regarding any of the plaintiffsâ products.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a> It is significant that Berenson himself acknowledged in evidence that as at the date of the Nuremberg fair in 1998, the plaintiffsâbusiness was rather limited in Europe.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a> Mr. Yan also submitted that the fact that there was evidence of export to European countries does not mean that the plaintiffs haveacquired reputation and goodwill in those countries as there is no evidence that the goods were sold to the public there.  However,I agree with Mr. Garland that this is a matter that can be inferred.  It can reasonably be inferred that sales have taken place inthe countries where the plaintiffs have exported their products and I so infer.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a> Be that as it may, the plaintiffs have established that they have a reputation and goodwill only in the following countries in Europe:Germany, Denmark,Italy, Belgium andSpain.  However, such reputation and goodwill was not a substantial one but, in my view, it wassufficient to found the action.</p>    <p class="heading">Reputation and goodwill in other countries</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a> As regards Australia, there was no evidence of any sales or promotional activities in Australia.  The plaintiffs have failed to establishgoodwill and reputation in Australia.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a> As regards South Africa, there was evidence of sales of 159,512 units of Aqua swim products from 1992 to 1995.  This was not substantial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a> As regards Dubai, the evidence shows that there were sales of 17,700 units from 1992 to 1996.  This was also not substantial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a> The evidence shows also that in South Africa and Dubai, the plaintiffs did not have a substantial reputation and goodwill in 1998but in my view there was sufficient reputation and goodwill to found the action.</p>    <p class="heading">Was there misrepresentation?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a> The essence of the tort is misrepresentation.  It is necessary to consider if there was any misrepresentation by the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant as to constitute passing off.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a> The 6<sup>th</sup> defendant was incorporated in Hong Kong on 13 March 1998 under the name Aqua Splash Limited.  There is no dispute that De Vries wasthe ultimate controller of the company.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and Lin were directors and shareholders.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a> There is no dispute that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant distributed its catalogue Exh. P9 featuring Aqua Splash swim products at HKITGS in October 1998 where it had a sales booth.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a> There is also no dispute that sometime in 1998 and end June 1999, the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant sold Aqua Splash swim products to the value of over HK$26 m. of which about half were to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a> The question to consider is whether there has been any misrepresentation by the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a> It is not necessary to show an intention to deceive as part of the cause of action.  However, the plaintiffs rely on an intentionto deceive on the part of the defendants at para. 25 of the re-re-re-amended statement of claim where it is pleaded that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">â The Defendants, at all material times, well knew of the 1<sup>st</sup> and/or 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffsâ goodwill/reputation attached to the use of the Aqua trade marks and in particular the mark âAquaâ in relation toswim gear and pool accessories.  Yet the Defendants not only chose a name and mark closely similar to the Aqua trade marks in launching,marketing and selling its products, but in using the name or mark âAqua Splashâ as aforesaid, the Defendants further adopteda stylised form of the mark which was confusingly similar to the style which the Plaintiffs have consistently used to represent theAqua trade marks on and in relation to Aqua swim products.  In the premises, the Defendants, in committing the acts complained ofherein, had intended to deceive and mislead members of the trade and/or public as aforesaid.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a> Thus by such plea, in support of their allegation of an intention to deceive on the part of the defendants, the plaintiffs rely onthe fact that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)    the defendants well knew of the 1<sup>st</sup> and/or 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs goodwill/reputation attached to the use of the Aqua trade marks (as defined in paragraph 5) and in particular to themark âAquaâ in relation to swim gear and pool accessories;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2)    the defendants chose a name and mark closely similar to the Aqua trade marks in launching, marketing and selling its products;and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3)    in using the name or mark âAqua Splashâ the defendants further adopted a stylized form of the mark which was confusinglysimilar to the style which the plaintiffs have consistently used to represent the Aqua trade marks on and in relation to the plaintiffsswim products.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a> The plaintiffs rely heavily on the fact that De Vries was actuated by fraud when he chose the name âAqua Splashâ for his company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a> De Vries gave evidence that in mid to late 1990s he decided to launch a range of inflatable swimming toys and related accessories. The dominant market leader at that time was Intex.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant began selling inflatable swimming toys and related accessories in the early 1980s.  It bought primarily from Intex.  Therewas no formal distribution arrangement.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant onsold Intex products to its (the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs) European customers.  After the establishment of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs purchases of Intex products was carried out through the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant who onsold the goods to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a> By 1996 it became apparent to De Vries that Intex was expanding its sales network and increasingly selling direct to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs European customers.  Because of this it became increasingly difficult to realize a profit from onselling Intex productsinto the European market.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs last purchase of Intex products was made in or about October 1997.  De Vries decided to explore other alternativesand decided to launch an exclusive range of inflatable products.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a> For that reason, he was interested in identifying potential suppliers when he attended the Nuremberg Toy Fair in January 1998.  Thisis the worldâs largest trade exhibition in the toy industry.  He said in evidence that there were approximately 10 to 15 manufacturersat the fair.  He visited the booths of each of these to identify potential manufacturers for a new line of inflatables. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a> I accept and believe this part of De Vries evidence and find that he was truthful and credible on these matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a> De Vries also visited the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs booth.  There is no dispute that he must have met and discussed matters with Berenson although Berenson in his witnessstatement thought that he had discussed matters with Hartwig Spreuwers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a> There is a dispute of fact as to what transpired between De Vries and Berenson at the Nuremberg Toy Fair in January 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a> De Vries said that the representative that he spoke to, which must have been Berenson, gave him the impression that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was a manufacturer of inflatables.  As a result of this, he was interested to explore whether the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff might be a suitable manufacturer and supplier for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  He said that they discussed in general terms the possibility of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff manufacturing a range of inflatables.  He was given the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs catalogue and showed a price list although he did not remember whether he was given a price list to take away.  Hesaid that after he visited the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs booth he asked other Impag representatives including Hartwig Spreuwers, Marco Zeegers, Rudd Veldkamp and Radka Houstovato visit the booths of the companies that he had visited and to give him their opinion as to the marketability of the manufacturersâproduct lines.He said that H</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">CoerdH</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a> De Vries was adamant that he did not enter into any deal with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs representative during the fair.  He learned subsequently at the fair that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was not itself a manufacturer of inflatables but a distributor.  He denied that in his discussions with Berenson he toldhim that he wanted to be the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs distributor in Germany as well.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a> Berenson said that he had an initial discussion with a representative of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who must have been De Vries.  He gave a catalogue and confidential price lists to him.  He said that during the fair therewere three visits by various representatives of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  He said that he gave them everything they would need to know to sell his product range in Europe.  He basically wentinto detail as to how they approached customers, how he sold the products, their best prices which was confidential and also whatthey would need to do to be successful. As a result of the discussions he had, Berenson was convinced that a deal had been reachedwith the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to be a distributor in Europe for the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  As it had been indicated to him that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant wanted to distribute in Germany as well, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff also dismissed their German distributor during the time of the fair.  He said that, however, when he went over to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs booth on the final day of the fair to shake on the deal the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs representatives indicated that they were not sure whether they were still interested in serving as the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs distributor in Europe.  Berenson said that their reaction was a total turnaround from what he thought was a commitment. Thereafter he never received any communication from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a> On this dispute of fact between Berenson and De Vries, I prefer the evidence of Berenson to that of De Vries.  I accept Berensonâsevidence on these matters and reject De Vries evidence on this.  I find that De Vries did give Berenson the impression that the 1<sup>st</sup>defendant wanted to be the European distributor for the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in relation to inflatables and swim products.  I also find that De Vries obtained a confidential price list and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs catalogue and other information about the way the plaintiffs sold in Europe from Berenson.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a> However, I am not satisfied that there was any intention to deceive on the part of De Vries.  He wanted to launch a new line of inflatablesand he wanted to get as much information as possible from a competitor.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a> The intention which must be proved is an intention to deceive, not any other intention, such as an intention to take advantage ofthe market developed by a competitorâs advertising campaign (<i>Cadbury-Schweppes Pty. Ltd v</i><i>. The Pub Squash Co. Ltd</i>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20RPC%20429" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] RPC 429</a> at 494).  De Vries was simply taking advantage of the market developed by the plaintiff by getting as much information as possiblefrom Berenson. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a> De Vries gave evidence, which I accept, that one of booths he visited during the fair was the booth of High Crown International Corporation(âHigh Crownâ).  This is a Taiwanese company manufacturing inflatables in the Mainland.  He talked to Ian Kao of High Crown. As a result of discussions with him he became confident that High Crown would be suitable to manufacture inflatables for him. Hewas invited by Ian Kao to visit him in Taiwan.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a> De Vries said that after the fair he visited his second home in Portugal where he used to spend time thinking about the progressof his companyâs business and considering new ideas.  At that time he decided to name the new line of inflatables âAqua Splashâ. This was inspired by the chain of Aqua Splash water parks in Portugal and he considered this to be an appropriate name for his lineof inflatables.  Hence his choice of name âAqua Splashâ.  I accept his evidence on this and find his explanation credible.  Ibelieve him.  I find that his choice of name was not related to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs trade mark and name.  The 6<sup>th</sup> defendant was thus incorporated in March 1998. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a> I find that De Vries was truthful and credible when giving evidence on these matters.  I am satisfied that he was not actuated byfraud when he chose the name âAqua Splashâ.  I am unable to accept that De Vries wanted to copy the name and the products ofthe plaintiffs.  I am satisfied that De Vries did not intend to deceive.  The words âAqua Splashâ are also in my view very descriptiveof the products in the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs range of goods and it was apt to describe the products and business of the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant.  Other traders have also used the name âAqua Splashâ upon or in connection with similar goods and water related goods. There was evidence of the use of this on diversâ masks and water parks in Italy, Switzerland, Greece and France, and on childrenâssplash pools.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a> De Vries also gave evidence, which I accept, that he went to Taiwan in March 1998 together with Marco Zeegers of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for further meetings with Kao.  They selected products from the existing range of products manufactured by High Crown. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also requested High Crown to produce moulds for a small number of items not previously produced by High Crown.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a> During this visit De Vries also met Patrick Galante of MGM Design Creation Textiles (âMGMâ) a French design company to discusssurface designs for products in the Aqua Splash range.  He gave Galante a broad description of concepts and images he was hopingto project through the Aqua Splash range and suggested that the range should be based on primary colours such as red, yellow andblue.  Galante agreed to prepare a selection of new designs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a> De Vries also said that in April 1998 Marco Zeegers met with MGM in France and reviewed the MGM designs.  These were brought to HongKong in late April 1998 when they met Kao and settled on the final physical and printed designs of the full Aqua Splash range.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a> The documentary evidence supports De Vries that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant paid MGM about US $40,000 for the designs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a> De Vries also said that High Crown produced the sample products in late May or early June 1998.  Thereafter De Vries arranged forKral Image Centre a studio in the Netherlands to take photographs of the sample products.  After the photographs were taken, thesewere sent to the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant.  She then arranged for Talent Design Company(âTalent Designâ) to design the layout of the Aqua Splash catalogue incorporatingthe photographs.  The catalogue is Exh. P9.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a> Talent Design was also instructed to design a logo for the âAqua Splashâ range.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a> There is a dispute of fact between De Vries and Lin as to what instructions were given to Talent Design.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a> De Vries said that he gave general instructions to Talent Design regarding the design of the logo.  De Vries accepted in evidencethat the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs catalogue together with catalogues of other traders were provided to Talent Design although he said that this was givenby Lin to Talent Design.  He accepted that he did provide many catalogues, including the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs, to Lin and it was his evidence that she provided the same to Talent Design.  Linâs evidence was that the catalogueshad been supplied to Talent Design as Talent Design had not previously had experience of designing catalogues for companies thattraded in inflatables.  She said that De Vries mentioned that the logo should have some association with water.  Talent Design prepareda selection of six logos from which De Vries selected one. I accept this part of her evidence.  The logo that was eventually producedwas the one used in the catalogue Exh. P9.  De Vries also said that he wanted to use revolutionary colours of yellow and blue.  Thiswas in contrast to Intex and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff which was on blue or teal on a white background.  This was also the logo used on the packaging of the products of the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a> Lin in her supplemental statement said that De Vries told Law Ho Ming of Talent Design to produce a catalogue similar to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs catalogue and that he also said that he wanted the âAqua Splashâ logo to be similar to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs logo.  She confirmed this in evidence.  This was denied by De Vries. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a> On this dispute of fact, I prefer the evidence of De Vries to that of Lin.  Linâs evidence on this only came in her supplementalwitness statement.  It was never in her original witness statement when she was still a defendant. By the time she made her supplementalstatement the plaintiffs and Lin had already entered into a settlement agreement whereby they settled these proceedings on certainconditions.  One such condition was that Lin had to give evidence both written and oral regarding all matters in her knowledge whichassists the plaintiffsâ claims in the action.  She was under an obligation to give evidence to assist the plaintiffs and her evidencemust be viewed with care with that in mind.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a> Lin was also under an obligation to procure an authorized representative of Talent Design to give evidence regarding the full circumstancesof the design of the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs catalogues and the instructions they received.  She fulfilled that obligation by making Law Ho Ming available to theplaintiffs.  The plaintiffs served a witness statement of Law Ho Ming.  However, for reasons not explained, they failed to call himas a witness at the trial.  Law must have been a crucial witness on this dispute of fact yet the plaintiffs failed to call him eventhough a witness statement had been served.  Lawâs witness statement is, of course, not evidence at the trial.  I accept Mr. Yanâssubmission that an adverse inference should be drawn against the plaintiffs that if Law had been called to testify, his testimonywould not have supported Linâs evidence on this dispute of fact but would instead have supported De Vries account of this(see theobservations of Le Pichon JA in <i>Li Sau Keung v</i><i>. Maxcredit Engineering Ltd &amp; Ano</i><i>ther</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20HKC%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 HKC 434</a> at 443-444).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a> The plaintiffs rely on the use by the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant of the name âAqua Splashâ and the use of the mark âAqua Splashâ to market and sell their products.  They allegethat the âAqua Splashâ logo is graphically represented in a style similar to the graphic representation of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs âAquaâ trade mark.  They also allege that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant had also offered to sell and sold some Aqua Splash swim products which were similar in design to the plaintiffsâ Aquaswim products.  The plaintiffsâ case is that a substantial number of trade purchasers in Hong Kong would likely have been deceivedinto thinking that the Aqua Splash swim products were from the same people who made Aqua swim products i.e. the plaintiffs or otherwisein some way connected with the makers of the Aqua swim products.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a> The plaintiffs also rely on the fact that there was actual confusion among trade purchasers visiting trade fairs.  The evidence ofSue Chow was that Jana Prochazkova, a trade customer of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff from the Czech Republic attended the HKITGS in October 1998.  She told Sue Chow that when she went to the fair she beganto look for her as she thought that the plaintiffs were exhibiting at that fair.  She walked around the fair and approached the âAquaSplashâ booth thinking that it was the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs booth.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in fact did not have a booth there.  I observe that Prochazkova has not been asked to provide a hearsay statement.  Noexplanation has been given as to why it was not possible to provide such a statement.  I attach little weight to Sue Chowâs evidenceon this.  It may well be that because of the use of the word âaquaâ she thought that it was the plaintiffsâ booth.  However,she must have been learnt very quickly that this was not the plaintiffsâ booth as she went to look for Sue Chow later in her office. There is no evidence as to what transpired at the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs booth.  There is no suggestion that she was misled by anyone at the booth into thinking that this was the plaintiffsâbooth or was associated with the plaintiffs.  In my judgment this is in any event the type of confusion which must be tolerated bya trader who chooses to use a very descriptive word like âaquaâ in his name and trade mark.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a> Ken Suchard whose evidence is by way of a hearsay statement gave evidence that he attended the February 1999 Nuremberg Toy Fair onbehalf SMC Kidz-Toys in South Africa.  He was asked by his associate to attend the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs booth at that fair but he was given the wrong booth number.  He walked around the fair and came across a booth withthe name âAqua Splashâ and assumed that because of the name âAquaâ this was the plaintiffsâ booth and approached it.  Heasked for Berenson or Sue Chow but was told that the booth was not the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs but Aqua Splashâs.  He was told that the two companies were not the same.  So it seems that it was immediately madeclear to him that it was not the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffsâ booth.  He was not misled into entering into discussions with the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant or misled into thinking that it was in some way associated with the plaintiffs.  If he was confused by the use of the wordâaquaâ, this again is in my judgment the sort of confusion that must be tolerated by a trader who uses a very descriptive wordlike âaquaâ in its name and trade mark.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a> The two instances of confusion relied on do not assist the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a> The plaintiffs also rely on the similarity of some of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs products and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs products.  This has been expanded on in the evidence of Berenson by reference to Exh. P12 which sets out the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs products taken from their respective catalogues.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a> The first one relied on is the similarity of the surface design in the inflatable pools at page 1 of Exh. P12.  In my judgment thesurface designs are not closely or substantially similar.  The 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs surface designs were designed by MGM for the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant and they are not closely or substantially similar to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs surface designs.  It has not been disputed that MGM designed these for the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant.  There is no suggestion that MGM copied the surface designs from the plaintiffsâ surface designs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a> There is also a reliance on the similarity of the lounger shown at page 2 of Exh. P12.  There is in my judgment a substantial differencebetween the two, the difference being the hole at one end in the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs product which is absent in the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs product.  Absent the hole this was a very common design as accepted by Berenson in evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a> The evidence also shows that Intex had a similar product before 1998.  Other companies also had this similar product.  The fact thatthere was such a lounger in the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs range of inflatables would not lead to deception or confusion with the plaintiffsâ products.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a> As regards the goggles, masks, snorkels and fins in Exh. P12, the evidence shows that the designs of these were not unique to theplaintiffs but were common products widely available from different companies.  This was accepted by Sue Chow.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a> De Vries gave evidence which I accept that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant sourced masks and goggles from Grace Best.  These were goggles and masks designed by Grace Best who sold to different customersunder their own brand name and their own packaging.  When De Vries visited Grace Bestâs showroom in April 1998 he saw Grace Bestâsproducts displayed in the packaging of at least ten toy companies including the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff. The selection of masks and swimming accessories made by De Vries and Zeegers was made from Grace Best range.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a> I am unable to accept that because the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had similar items for sale which were common and widely available to other traders this would lead any one to be deceivedor confused into thinking that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant was in some way associated with the plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a> There was also an allegation, although not pleaded, that by using the words âOfficial Safety Lensâ and âPolycarbonate Lensâon some of their masks the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant copied the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffsâ products.  I am unable to accept this.  Sue Chow gave evidence that the markings were required by law.  I am unableto accept that such markings would lead anyone to be deceived or confused into thinking that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs products were in some way associated with the plaintiffsâ products.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a> In my view there are sufficient differences between the plaintiffsâ logo, catalogue and packaging and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs logo, catalogue and packing so that there would not be any likelihood of deception or confusion.  The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs âAquaâ mark is a simple mark consisting of the single word Aqua represented simply with a slanting upward lineunderneath.  Berenson seemed to be unaware that in the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs trade mark registration in the United State Patent and Trade Mark Office the mark was said to be of the word âAquaâ:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âwhich is underlined, in a fanciful silhouette of a dolphin or finned fishâ.  </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">So the slanting line was said to represent a fanciful silhouette of a dolphin or finned fish.  This was the visual idea intended tobe conveyed namely, that of a finned fish or dolphin.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a> Conversely, the âAqua Splashâ mark is a playful mark consisting of two words âAquaâ and âSplashâ; âAquaâ in blueand âSplashâ in red.   Although De Vries said that the red âSplashâ was more prominent it seems to me that both words wereprobably just as prominent.  Underneath the word âAquaâ are two waves and there are drops of water on the side of the word âSplashâ. The idea intended to be conveyed was one of waves and water.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a> It seems to me that even taking into account the imperfect recollection of customers, there are sufficient differences between thetwo so as to make it unlikely to mistake the âAqua Splashâ mark with the âAquaâ mark.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a> It is not in dispute that the products are typically displayed on shelves in a shop.  The evidence of De Vries and Mettens is thatconsumers do not focus on the brands or marks when purchasing the swim products and inflatables.  This seems to be supported by thefact that there is no evidence of any advertisements placed by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff targeting consumers to promote the brand names of the products.  Mettens and De Vries emphasized that the consumers wouldpay attention to the packaging and the price of the products rather than to the brand.  I accept their evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a> Also, the packaging of the Aqua Splash products which were sold in Europe make it plain that the goods were distributed in the EuropeanUnion by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, a European company in the Netherelands.  The packaging of the 1<sup>st</sup>plaintiffsâ products make it plain that the products were from the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff with the name and address in the USA of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff. I find that it is unlikely that the public or traders would be deceived or confused into thinking that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant was in some way associated with the plaintiffs.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a> Insofar as Ken Suchard in his hearsay statement suggests that there would be confusion in South Africa, I do not place much weighton his hearsay statement.  There is no evidence that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant has sold in South Africa.  In any event, the plaintiffs do not enjoy substantial reputation and goodwill in South Africa. There is unlikely in my view to be confusion or deception in South Africa.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a> The âAqua Splashâ catalogue and packaging used different colours from those used by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.  The 6<sup>th</sup> defendant used yellow and blue as the colours for its catalogue and packaging.  This was a revolutionary choice of colours by DeVries as he confirmed in evidence.  This is also supported by the different catalogues in evidence like Intex, and the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs which had a white background.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a> I am satisfied that there are sufficient differences between the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffsâ catalogue and packaging and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs catalogue and packaging.  In my judgment there has been no misrepresentation by the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant leading or likely to lead the public or traders to believe that the goods offered by it are the goods of the plaintiffsor in some way associated with the plaintiffs.  As there are sufficient differences between the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs logo, catalogues and packages, the plaintiffs have failed to establish that there has been passing off by the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify">    <a name="p237" class="para" id="p237">237.</a> As regards the plaintiffsâ allegation that the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant has exported instrument of deception, the plaintiffsâ pleaded case is that these have been exported to Germany, Denmark,USA, Czech Republic, Australia, South Africa, Dubai, Italy Belgium Spain and Holland (Answer 13e of the further and better particularsof the amended statement of claim).  Of these, the plaintiffs have failed to establish goodwill and reputation in the Czech Republic,Holland, Australia and hence there can be no passing off in respect of export to those countries.  In any event, as I have foundthat there are sufficient differences between the plaintiffsâ and the 6<sup>th</sup> defendantâs catalogue and packaging, the plaintiffs have failed to establish passing off in the countries where the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant has exported Aqua Splash products.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a> I find that there was no passing off by the 6<sup>th</sup> defendant. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a> In the circumstances, Issues 7 and 8 do not arise.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a> The plaintiffsâ claims are dismissed.  Judgment is to be entered for the defendants on the plaintiffsâ claims.  I also give judgmentto the defendants on their counterclaim and order that each entry in the register of Trade Marks in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffâs âAquaâ and âAqua LEISUREâ trade marks be rectified by varying each such entry so that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff be required to disclaim any right to the exclusive use of the word âaquaâ as a condition of each such mark being permittedto remain on the register.  I also direct that under s. 48(1)(d) notice of the rectification be served in the prescribed manner onthe Registrar of Trade Marks.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a> I also make an order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of the action and the counterclaim be costs to the defendants.</p>	<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>	<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>			<td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Arjan H.
