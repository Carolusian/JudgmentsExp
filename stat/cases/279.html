INTRODUCTION</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a> This action concerns a luxury development known as "The Belvedere" at 51 Plantation Road on the Peak. Linfield<sup><sup>1</sup></sup> is the owner of the Property, which consists of 6 houses. TDA was the architect, PCL the main contractor, MML the nominated stone-claddingsub-contractor, and GWA the RSE for the Property. Linfield claims that the Defendants breached their contractual or common law dutiesin the design and building of the Property. As a result, Linfield says that it ended up with a substandard development. Linfieldhas many complaints. Some are that the limestone cladding of Houses 1 to 6 was wholly unsuited to Hong Kong weather conditions andin any event was ineptly fixed to the external walls of the Property; that reinforcement bars in the concrete works of Houses 1 to6 were left exposed or with insufficient cover and thereby undermined the structural integrity of the Property; and that there wasno proper waterproofing of the Property's podium. In a separate action, Linfield has sued BHP on like grounds.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Construction of the Property was initially completed around the first half of 1998. It was Linfield's intention to hold the Propertyfor long-term investment purposes and to rent out Houses 1 to 6. It started to lease individual houses in about May 1998. However,between December 2000 and April 2002, repairs were carried out to remedy the defects alleged by Linfield. By this action, Linfieldseeks to recover against the Defendants the cost which it incurred in repairing the defects which it attributes to the Defendants'breaches. The total sum claimed under this first head is $37,709,144.61. Linfield also claims the rental which it says that it lostthrough being unable to lease houses pending completion of repair work. An additional sum of $42,139,629.00 is claimed under thissecond head. Linfield's total claim is therefore $79,848,773.61.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Linfield's actions against TDA, PCL and BHP have been stayed to a consolidated arbitration which is not currently anticipated totake place until 2005. But the stay has not meant that TDA, PCL and BHP have played no role in the trial of this action. This isbecause in these proceedings GWA has sought contribution or indemnity against TDA, PCL, MML and BHP for any liability to Linfieldon the part of GWA. BHP has itself served contribution and indemnity notices on TDA, PCL, and MML for any amount which BHP mightbe liable to GWA. On the eve of trial the Court was informed that TDA was insolvent and the liquidators of TDA did not propose toappear in the action. The Court was also told by MML through its solicitors Messrs. Deacons that MML had decided not to defend theaction. Accordingly, the trial of these proceedings was only attended by representatives of Linfield, GWA, BHP and PCL.</p>    <p class="heading">II.

The parties enter into contracts: February to December 1994</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> Sing Kee is a family-owned investment company of which Mr. Lu was and remains the managing director. On 4 February 1994 Mr. Lu approachedhis friend Dr. Ho, a noted architect and principal of TDA, for advice on the development of a property. In April 1994 Sing Kee establishedLinfield as a wholly-owned subsidiary for property development activities. On 20 April 1994 Linfield acquired from Shell the landon which the Property is situated. Linfield's original intention was to build 5 Western-style townhouses on the land. At the time,as part of its conditions for sale, Shell retained an option to buy back one house. After Shell informed Mr. Lu at the end of 1994that it did not intend to exercise the option, Linfield revised the design for its proposed development from 5 to 6 houses.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> On 11 May 1994 Mr. Lu had discussions with Mr. Nick Brooke, the Senior Partner of BHP, about the provision by BHP of developmentand project management services in connection with the construction of the Property.

Linfield concluded its letter by looking forward to the formal signing of aformal consultancy agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> On 28 July 1994 BHP suggested to TDA that PCL be removed from the shortlist of tenderers for the demolition contract relating tothe Property's substructure.

TDA's scope of servicesincluded preparation of general building plans for submission to the Buildings Department, coordinating with consultants for thepreparation of structural plans for Building Department Approval, periodic site inspections during construction, and the issue ofa defects list. By way of detailed conditions of agreement TDA's submission incorporated the terms of the "Agreement between Clientand Architect published by the Hong Kong Institute of Architects (latest edition)". Sing Kee signed a copy of TDA's proposal letteron 25 January 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On 23 December 1994 GWA wrote to DLS, Quantity Surveyors for the project, about reservations as to PCL's capability for the siteformation works. GWA recommended against inclusion of PCL in the tender list for such works. By fax of the same date to TDA, Mr.Angus Chan of BHP noted that BHP did not concur with GWA's comments on PCL. TDA then wrote to Mr. Joseph Kong of BHP to voice strongobjection to inviting PCL to tender for the site formation works. TDA believed that PCL lacked the capacity and experience to undertakethe difficult work involved. The following day (24 December 1994) GWA again wrote about its doubts as to PCL. PCL's largest previouscontract experience on site formation and filing was only for works worth $2 and 3 million, whereas the value of Linfield's siteformation contract was $30 million. GWA wrote a further negative assessment of PCL's abilities as a site formation contractor on20 February 1995. Ultimately, although PCL put in the lowest tender for the site formation works, the contract was awarded to Gammon.</p>    <p class="heading">B. Choice of limestone: January 1995 to July 1996</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The Buildings Department approved the building plans for the project on 9 January 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> On 27 February 1995 BHP confirmed to TDA that Linfield wished to proceed with a residential development of 6 (instead of 5) houses.BHP instructed TDA to proceed with the necessary design work or submissions occasioned by the change of intention.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> At this point Mr. Lu started to consider an appropriate stone to use as cladding for Houses 1 to 6. The use of stone had originallybeen suggested by Dr. Ho who produced samples for Mr. Lu to examine. Dr. Ho recommended limestone and gradually this sedimentarystone became the preferred cladding material because (as Mr. Lu observed in evidence) "it had a softer appearance and texture thangranite and was less common than granite and would thus tend to give the Property a distinctive look". Mr. Lu had ambitions for theProperty. He envisaged it as embodying a degree of refinement, discrimination and taste setting it apart from other high class developments.It was "to be something very special, probably the best in Hong Kong".</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> On 14 March 1995, (along with Dr. Ho, Mr. Patrick Chan and Ms. Kirkwood of TDA) Mr. Lu, his sister Daphne and his wife Carol visited6 Perkins Road, Jardines Lookout, to view a property (then under construction) which employed limestone cladding. Dr. Ho drew Mr.Lu's attention to fossils in the limestone and the inherent beauty of the material. Mr. Lu acknowledged that limestone had a "softerfeel" than granite and from then onwards Mr. Lu and his wife gradually became converts to the idea of using limestone for the Property'scladding.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> On 30 May 1995 GWA wrote to Sing Kee to vary the terms of GWA's engagement as structural and geotechnical engineer so as to reflectthe inclusion of a 6th house in the project. GWA's scope of services remained the same. But fees were amended to provide for a lumpsum of $300,000 over the $550,000 previously agreed. Sing Kee signed its acceptance on 27 June 1995.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Since the Perkins Road visit, Mr. Lu had asked architect friends of his about the use of limestone for the Property. Most did nothave experience in the stone. This was not surprising. At the time limestone was not in common use in Hong Kong for cladding. Mr.Lu had also seen other Hong Kong buildings (one in Tai Hang Road) which made use of stone cladding. He was, however, unhappy withthe colour of the stone that he saw. The stone used did not produce the "feel" which he wanted for the Property. Mr. Lu noted thatthe Tai Hang Road building had patches of stain on the external wall, but he was told that was due to the fact that sealant coatinghad been improperly applied.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Sometime in the autumn of 1995 TDA presented Linfield with a shortlist of types of limestone to select. Mr. Lu was partial to Pearde Chassagne Banc 13-08 ("Chassagne"). Unfortunately, he was told that not enough of that type of limestone was commercially availablefor use in the Property. The second choice was Charmot, but Mr. Lu was not wholly satisfied by the colour of the Charmot samplesprovided to him. The search for an appropriate limestone therefore continued.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> In light of the information, some non-committal, which he had been receiving from his acquaintances about the use of limestone forcladding, on 10 November 1995 Mr. Lu met with Ms. Kirkwood and Mr. Joseph Kong to discuss the choice of stone. Mr. Lu queried whetherlimestone was after all suitable for use in Hong Kong and (if it was) whether it was appropriate as far as initial and maintenancecosts were concerned. Mr. Joseph Kong accordingly asked TDA by a letter dated 23 November 1995 to provide the following informationto enable Linfield to assess the practicality of using limestone:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Country of origin.</p>        <p>(2) Name of suppliers.</p>        <p>(3) Type of warranty that will be provided by suppliers.</p>        <p>(4) Type of surface treatment to be applied to the limestone.</p>        <p>(5) Laboratory test report of limestone's tensile and compressive strengths.</p>        <p>(6) Thickness of cladding to be used.</p>        <p>(7) Method of fixing and maintenance.</p>        <p>(8) Appropriate costs estimates for the supply and installation of limestone cladding for 6 houses.</p>        <p>(9) Alternative external finishes.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Although Mr. Joseph Kong asked TDA to reply "as soonest possible", it appears that no response was ever received. Instead, as Mr.Lu pointed out in evidence, none of his consultants expressed any concern with the then ongoing design of the Property on the assumptionthat limestone would be used as cladding.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Mr. Lu freely confesses (and I accept) that in those days he knew next to nothing about stone cladding, much less about limestone.He relied on his consultants to advise him if there was any problem, technical or otherwise, about using limestone for cladding inHong Kong. In the absence of any caution from his advisers, Mr. Lu was simply concerned with the aesthetic qualities of the proposedstone material, namely, whether any particular limestone had a suitable colour, appearance and texture for houses of the nature whichLinfield wished to erect.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> On 20 December 1995 DLS invited tenders for superstructure works at the Property. PCL was among the companies invited to tender.The Tender Specification included Technical Specifications dealing with stone cladding, but the tender did not identify the precisestone to be used for cladding.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Discussions over the appropriate stone continued. In early 1996 Dr. Ho mentioned to Mr. Lu that he had a friend who was an expertin the stone field and could tell Linfield everything that it wished to know about stone. Dr. Ho wanted to introduce Mr. Lu to thisperson and a meeting was therefore arranged.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> On 11 January 1996 DLS issued Addendum 1 to the superstructure tender documents. This specified Chauvigny Marbrier limestone as externalcladding. Linfield had selected this stone after browsing through a catalogue compiled by Rocamat (one of the world's leading stonesuppliers). Mr. Lu also had in mind Mr. Joseph Kong's advice that Chauvigny Marbrier was denser than Chassagne and that denser andstronger stones were preferable.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> On 7 February 1996 the Buildings Department approved the superstructure works for Houses 1 to 5. It was then envisaged (as in facttranspired) that the superstructure would be built in 2 phases, the first comprising Houses 1 to 5 and the second House 6.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> Mr. Lu met with Dr. Ho and his stone expert friend on 13 February 1996. The expert turned out to be Mr. Tabar, MML's managing director.Mr. Lu had been expecting a "professor" of stone and was surprised to find that Mr. Tabar was a contractor wishing to market MML'sservices to Linfield. Although Mr. Tabar showed Mr. Lu and his wife a variety of different stones which MML could supply, he didnot say much about the properties of different stones nor discuss their strengths and weaknesses as cladding material. After themeeting Mr. Tabar made 3 proposals for the supply of stone material. One was to use Chauvigny Marbrier, another to use SJ Claire,the third to use granite. Granite was rejected because it would have involved modification of the design being prepared by Dr. Ho.It would not have been possible to use granite for the elaborated moulding designs envisaged by Dr. Ho for the Property. Mr. Tabarnoted that the Peninsula Hotel (for which MML had been the contractor) employed SJ Claire and pressed the 2nd proposal accordingly.But Mr. Lu thought that SJ Claire was too light in colour. Mr. Lu's preference thus remained firmly with Chassagne.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Mr. Tabar said that he had a source in France from which sufficient Chassagne for Linfield's purposes could be obtained. He proposedthat Mr. Lu and his wife travel to Paris to see the stone. Mr. Tabar offered to pay tickets and accommodation for the trip. Mr. Ludeclined the offer of tickets and lodging but agreed to go to France at Linfield's own expense.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> At a project meeting on 29 February 1996 BHP requested DLS to provide a standard nominated subcontract document for stone works andwindows for the purpose of obtaining quotations from stone and window suppliers.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> On 19 March 1996 Linfield decided that the stonework for the Property would be re-tendered as a nominated sub-contract and the maincontract tenderers for the superstructure works would be informed accordingly. The stonework package in the main contract would bereplaced with a prime cost sum. The NSC appointed would be required to provide Linfield with a performance warranty and bond.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Between 23 and 26 March 1996 Mr. Lu and his wife visited Paris with Mr. Joseph Kong. They were met there by Dr. Ho and Mr. Tabar.The group visited several quarries, including those of Rocamat. In the course of that trip, on one late afternoon, Mr. Lu and Dr.Ho were strolling ahead of Mrs. Lu and Joseph Kong. Mr. Lu asked Dr, Ho whether limestone generally was a suitable material for thePeak given the stone's high porosity (a characteristic which Mr. Lu had learned about from Mr. Joseph Kong). Dr. Ho responded inthe affirmative, stressing that limestone was a natural material. Dr. Ho pointed out that the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris wasmade of limestone and had been standing for hundreds of years with minimal maintenance. Since Dr. Ho's answer seemed logical, Mr.Lu accepted the explanation. With the benefit of hindsight, Mr. Lu now realises that Dr. Ho failed to say that Notre Dame Cathedralis made from limestone blocks, in contrast to the thin veneer limestone cladding which it was proposed to fix mechanically to theconcrete external walls of the Property. Therefore, that Notre Dame Cathedral has stood for hundreds of years in the northern climatesof Paris, constituted little assurance that thin veneer cladding in the sub-tropical environment of Hong Kong would endure for aslong.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The visit to France did not resolve the question of the choice of stone. Mr. Lu instead came back with a shortlist of candidate limestones:Vilhonneur B5, Vilhonneur MB, Chauvigny and SJ Claire. The prospective NSCs could at least be asked to price these stones. It wasenvisaged that the Chauvigny and Vilhonneur could be provided by Rocamat through its Hong Kong installing agent Man Shing, whileMML could supply SJ Claire.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> By letter to BHP dated 27 March 1996 TDA analysed the results of the tender for the superstructure works. The 2 lowest tenders camefrom CCECC ($96,941,885 after adjustment) and PCL ($100,854,784 after adjustment). TDA recommended (at Â§6.1):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Technically, there is little difference between the two lowest tenderers for the Architectural, Structural and E &amp; M works. Ourrecommendation must therefore be based on the matter of price and programme. CCECC offer both the lowest price and shortest constructionperiod."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>GWA made a similar recommendation of CCECC in its tender analysis provided to BHP on 28 March 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> On 2 April 1996 DLS issued a tender addendum which specified Charmot as the external cladding material. On the following day by anotheraddendum, contractors were asked to tender for cladding on the basis of further alternatives: Vilhonneur B5, Vilhonneur MB and SJClaire. No choice of stone had actually been made. Charmot was merely specified for the purpose of obtaining prices.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> On 3 April 1996 TDA on behalf of Linfield sent a letter of intent in relation to the appointment of PCL as main contractor for thesuperstructure works. PCL had by then agreed to reduce the tender amount to $96,654,784.40. Although TDA and GWA had recommendedCCECC over PCL, Linfield awarded the contract to PCL on Mr. Joseph Kong's suggestion. BHP was closer to Mr. Lu than Dr. Ho at thetime. Mr. Lu acted on Mr. Joseph Kong's advice because he thought that BHP was more likely than the other consultants to give Linfieldits honest opinion. PCL obtained possession of the site where Houses 1 to 5 were to be built on the same day.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> On 18 April 1996 tenders for the stone work were opened. Markway had the lowest tender, followed by MML and then Rocamat. None waswholly satisfactory for one reason or other. For example, Mr. Lu queried the quality of Markway's workmanship. Nor was Mr. Lu happywith the stone types for which tenders had been received. MML was asked to price for use of Chassagne. This was in part because MMLclaimed that it had a source for Chassagne with adequate supply. MML backed its claim by producing a fax from Ets Yelmini-ArtaudSA in Jura certifying that the latter company could supply blocks of Chassagne B11 "for an approximatively quantity of 100 M3 or5 000 sq M" within 6 months of an order. MML also recommended a limestone identified as Corton (Pierre de St Julien). Rocamat wasasked in turn to review its tender to see where savings could be made.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> By now the lack of decision on the award of the stone works contract was placing the construction programme for the Property in jeopardy.At a project meeting on 23 May 1996 BHP informed Linfield that a decision had to be made before 28 May 1996 if the project completiondate was to be met.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> On 23 May 1996 Marbres du Boulonnais (Markway's stone supplier) faxed Sing Kee to suggest that Chassagne was "probably not the bestalternative as it always contains crystal lines, which can be large (4/5 millimeters wide) and sometime dark". It thought that BeaulieuB3 or Beaulieu B5 might be better. Samples were provided to Markway to show to Mr. Lu. By a further fax dated 3 June 1996 Marbresdu Boulonnais observed that Beaulieu B3 and B5 were "among the hardest French limestone, and even mostly used in Europe for trafficflooring".</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> On 28 May 1996 Mr. and Mrs. Lu met with Ms. Kirkwood to examine the options for stone cladding. At this stage 3 stones were underconsideration: Charmot from Rocamat, Forjone from Markway and Chassagne Beige Banc 2 from MML. Despite this, Mr. Lu's real preferenceremained for Chassagne. However, he was not confident that MML could deliver a sufficient quantity of that stone.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Mr. Joseph Kong warned Linfield that MML had a bad reputation. According to Mr. Joseph Kong, MML had been late on some projects andits performance unsatisfactory. Under Mr. Joseph Kong's urging then, Mr. Lu agreed to enter into an agreement with Asia Marble asNSC for the stone works.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> On 5 June 1996 Mr. Lu (on the basis of Mr. Joseph Kong's advice) authorised BHP to appoint Asia Marble as NSC for a revised amountof about $24.3 million. This step was taken out of urgency, so as not to delay the construction programme for the Property. In factMr. Lu had doubts over the quality of Asia Marble's craftsmanship. These doubts stemmed from remarks by Dr. Ho to the effect thatAsia Marble were unable to produce single corner pieces and instead had to stick 2 stone pieces together at an angle. This (Dr. Hofelt) was not ideal from an aesthetic viewpoint. Indeed, as far as Dr. Ho was concerned, MML apart, none of the stone suppliers beingconsidered by Linfield were any good.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> MML did not give up trying to obtain the stone work contract. Mr. Tabar met with Mr. and Mrs. Lu, Dr. Ho, Ms. Kirkwood and Mr. AngusChan on 21 June 1996. Mr. Eric Au and Ms. Fiona Lam of DLS were also present. Mr. Tabar suggested that Mr. Lu visit France to inspectthe proposed stone materials once more. It was also decided at the meeting that MML would prepare structural calculations in relationto the stone works for submission to the Building Department. These calculations were urgently needed. GWA was not present at thismeeting.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Influenced by Mr. Joseph Kong's comments about MML, Mr. Lu was reluctant to go to France. But Dr. Ho lobbied hard to persuade Mr.Lu to consider MML's appointment as stone contractor. At around midnight on 30 June 1996 Dr. Ho sent Mr. Lu a lengthy fax in whichhe outlined a way forward. Dr. Ho discerned that there was "mistrust" between Mr. Lu and Mr. Tabar, but he did not believe that therewas any basis for such feeling. Dr. Ho believed that "technically speaking, there is no problem of Tabar's ability to perform a goodor even an excellent job". Dr. Ho assured Mr. Lu of this. Indeed, unless MML supplied enough of the chosen stone and installed thesame properly according to design and specification, there was no obligation to pay. Thus, Dr. Ho advocated a meeting between theparties and taking up Mr. Tabar's offer to go to France "immediately to select and to place an order of the limestone of your choiceon the spot in your presence". If this was done, Mr. Lu "will be sure what and where you are getting your limestone". If all thatcould be done within the week, the original time schedule could be met without posing difficulties for the main contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Mr. Lu thus agreed to visit France again. He also became inclined to appoint MML as NSC. Sing Kee inquired of Rocamat whether itwas prepared to supply MML with Charmot (the stone specified by Addendum No. 2 to the tender) even though MML was not its Hong Kongagent. By fax dated 2 July 1996 Rocamat confirmed that it was prepared to do so. A letter confirming award of the NSC to MML wassent by TDA on 4 July 1996. The contract amount was $23,900,000, including a provisional sum of $2,000,000 for contingencies. About65% of the NSC amount represented the cost of the stone to be used. MML thanked Linfield for the award on 5 July 1996. By a letterdated 13 August 1996 PCL formally awarded the sub-contract for the supply and installation of stone work at the Property to MML.MML signed a copy of this letter on 24 September 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> On 14 June 1996 MML signed a Warranty in Linfield's favour in the following terms:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We [MML] (The Sub-Contractor) warrant that in consideration of your nominating us as Sub-Contractor for the Sub-Contract Works:-</p>        <p class="quote">(a) We will carry out complete and maintain the Sub-Contract Works in accordance with the terms of the Sub-Contract.</p>        <p class="quote">(b) We have exercised and will exercise all reasonable skill and care in:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1) the design of the Sub-Contract Works insofar as the Sub-Contract Works have been or will be designed by us; and</p>            <p class="quote">(2) the selection of materials and goods for the Sub-Contract insofar as such materials and goods have been or will be selected byus.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c) We will comply with and satisfy the performance specification or requirement insofar as such performance specification or requirementis included or referred to in the tender documents and/or our Tender as part of the description of the Sub-Contract works.</p>        <p class="quote">(d) ....</p>        <p class="quote">(e) Nothing in our Tender shall operate to exclude or limit our liability for breach of the warranties set out herein.</p>        <p class="quote">(f) We will obtain a suitable performance bond (terms to be in accordance with the specimen attached as Appendix 'A' to Form of Tender)in favour of the Employer.

Throughout, TDA was severely critical of PCL's work. For example, by letter to PCL dated 9 July 1996 Ms. Kirkwood pointedout that there were a number of areas of defective concrete casting by PCL and PCL's workmanship was not of the requisite quality.In a similar vein GWA repeatedly complained about PCL's work. For instance, in a memo dated 9 July 1996 Mr. Pisano (GWA' ResidentEngineer) advised that the reinforcement quality of PCL's steelwork was below standard and site drainage was found to be lacking.A letter from TDA to PCL (copied to BHP and GWA) of 31 July 1996 observed:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We record our concern that construction of the structural work on site does not comply with the structural drawings. Furthermore,the work for these areas appeared to have had gone ahead despite repeated reminders from the resident engineer of non-compliance.</p>        <p class="quote">The contractor shall submit his method statement for rectifying the works and bear responsibility for any time and cost implicationsinvolved."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> On 11 July 1996 Mr. and Mrs. Lu together with Mr. Joseph Kong and Dr. Ho travelled to France where they met Mr. Tabar. Linfield paidthe air fares of its consulting team, but Mr. Tabar paid for hotel accommodation. On the final day of the visit, Bastille Day 14July 1996, Mr. Tabar took the party to a warehouse owned by Marbres du Boulonnais. The factory manager showed Linfield's representativesfor the first time a limestone known as Poiseul B5. Mr. and Mrs. Lu found the stone's colour and texture pleasing. Mr. Lu asked Dr.Ho whether the material was suitable for the Property. Dr. Ho asked Mr. Tabar. A discussion ensued in French between Mr. Tabar andthe factory manager which Mr. Lu could not understand. Shortly after, Dr. Ho said that the material was suitable.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> On the spot Mr. and Mrs. Lu decided to use Poiseul B5. Dr. Ho confirmed this decision in a fax dated 16 July 1996. An Architect'sInstruction dated 12 August 1996 formally confirmed the substitution of Poiseul B5 for Charmot.</p>    <p class="heading">C. The course of construction from July to September 1996</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> By an Architect's Instruction dated 15 July 1996 TDA confirmed that aluminium window frames would be substituted for the UPVC framesspecified in the tender. The aluminium windows were to be in accordance with specifications previously issued, but with the deletionof the thermal performance requirement.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> At a meeting on 17 July 1996 among MML, GWA and TDA, it was decided that MML "would supply all typical fixing details and calculationsincluding the fixing detail for solid stone columns and the clad tie beam to the head of the columns". The calculations would besubmitted to GWA for checking as RSE before the end of July for onward submission to the Buildings Department. In the event MML didnot provide structural calculations to GWA until about early September 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The 17 July meeting was also told that the first shipment of Poiseul B5 would take place at the start of August and TDA would arrangeto inspect the consignment in France prior to shipment. A consignment of 9 crates of limestone (246.91 sq m) was shipped on 9 August1996 and a Certificate of Acceptance of Quality was issued by Dr. Ho on 11 August 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> On 29 July 1996 the Buildings Department approved the superstructure works for House 6.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> By a letter dated 30 July 1996 Linfield appointed Mr. Shum as clerk of works starting from 7 August 1996 at a salary of $24,000 permonth. Mr. Shum's job was to monitor the works at the Property. He was employed by Linfield but acted under TDA's direction.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> In early September 1996 MML submitted shop drawings for the stone cladding works to TDA. Copies of the drawings were also suppliedto PCL. On 19 September 1996 MML supplied Structural Stone Works Drawings and a current Drawing List to GWA for its information.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Criticism of PCL's work continued. At a meeting on 23 August 1996 more defective concrete work was reported and PCL was advised touse smaller vibrators. PCL undertook to confirm the steps needed to improve the quality of its concreting. PCL also acknowledgedthat there had to be better supervision of its workers and their workmanship. Nonetheless, despite PCL's assurances, Mr. Pisano observedon 30 August 1996 that, upon inspection, only one small vibration rod was available for compaction in connection with concretingfor Houses 1 and 2. Mr. Pisano concluded that "[t]he recurrence of said situation will not be tolerated and subsequent concrete pourswill not be allowed to commence". On 30 August 1996 Mr. Pisano noted that PCL had ignored GWA's request that all exposed concretehad to be protected during the first stage of hardening from premature drying due to sunshine, dry wind or rain. Yet further on 30August 1996 Mr. Pisano expressed "growing concern" to Mr. Tin of PCL about the poor quality of the formwork being used for concreting.Mr. Pisano asked Mr. Tin to instruct his staff to adhere to minimum periods of time for removal of formwork. Mr. Pisano additionallystressed the importance of ensuring that complete and accurate records were taken of the time elapsed between hydration and dischargeof concrete. Following an inspection of House 4 level 2/2A, Mr. Pisano refused to allow concreting to take place until 10 errors(relating (among other things) to incorrect spacing of vertical bars) were corrected. On 11 September 1996 problems were also detectedin relation to House 4 level 3 which led to concreting being held back. Further, as at 12 September 1996, Mr. Pisano discerned nosign of improvement in the quality of formwork for House 3. All the foregoing correspondence between GWA and PCL was copied to TDAand BHP.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> PCL plainly were experiencing serious project management problems. Thus, on 4 September 1996 Mr. Greg Wong wrote to PCL thus:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"We are deeply concern and disappointed about your project management team's effect for this captioned project. We strongly feel thatthere is communication and miscommunication problems among your management team. Numerous discussions/ meetings were held to resolvefield problems/ queries over the last few weeks. However, these queries (which have been resolved) were again raised by other staffof your management team during site meetings. It is obvious that if 'better' communication between your project team were carriedout, then the above situations will not arises."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr. Pisano also raised the problem of communication among PCL's staff. He wrote on 12 September to Mr. Tin:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Despite previous verbal and written instruction not to do the addition of water by your concreting workers was observed during thecasting of House 3 level 2A (441.60 mpd). It may be that your workers have a problem with communication and understanding simpleinstruction, in which case it may be advisable to replace them with coherent site staff.</p>        <p class="quote">Instruct your staff that no means of adding water (e.g. hose pipe) should be in the area of concreting during each pour. If this practicecontinues concreting works will be stopped."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>At a meeting on 20 September 1996 Mr. Shum reported that there was insufficient labour on site, formwork and steel fixings had tobe improved, and there was delay on PCL's programme. On 26 September 1996 Ms. Kirkwood wrote to PCL thus:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It would appear that our previous instructions and concerns raised with regards to poor quality of workmanship and untidy site arrangementhave been totally ignored. These matters have been raised on a number of occasions and no improvements are being made. This is totallyunacceptable and will not be tolerated further.</p>        <p class="quote">We request your reply by return with confirmation that you will take immediate steps to improve and maintain site activities to anacceptable standard."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">D. The structural calculations</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> On 1 October 1996, having checked the same, GWA submitted MML' structural calculations and drawings for the stone work and anchoringat the Property to the Building Authority for approval. Much of the trial focused on whether GWA were negligent in their checkingof MML calculations. I will consider the parties' submissions on the matter in Section III of this Judgment. But it is convenientto describe the calculations submitted by GWA to the Building Authority in some detail at this stage.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> The calculations were prepared for MML by P. C. Lam. They are handwritten. An unnumbered initial sheet and sheets 1 to 13 are dated14 August 1996, sheets 14 to 17 are dated 28 August 1996, sheets 18 to 23 are dated 29 August 1996, sheets 24 and 25 are dated 27August 1996. GWA's submission includes further sheets which appear to have been separately prepared by P C Lam. Of these later sheets,3 are dated 16 September 1996, 3 are dated 26 September 1996 and the last is an undated typed sheet with Poiseul B5 technical data(stated to be derived from "French tests according to French Standards").</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> There are 2 cover sheets. One entitled "Structural Calculations of Granite Cladding and Anchoring for Proposed Building Located at51 Plantation Rd, Mid Levels, Hong Kong" is dated 16 August 1996 and bears a P C Lam fax legend dated 30 August 1996. PresumablyMML received the initial batch of 25 sheets from P C Lam under cover of this sheet. The top most cover sheet is entitled "StructuralCalculations of Granite and Anchoring" and is on paper bearing GWA's logo. GWA thus added its own cover to the P C Lam document beforesubmitting the same to the Building Authority.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> The initial sheet to the calculation

I also notein passing that the structural calculations take into account the fact that the shop drawings show a number of ways of fixing stonepanels to the external walls of Houses 1 to 5. Thus, for example, Shop Drawing SD-03 pictures a Type 1 fixing whereby a panel isheld in place by 2 pins each on its left and right hand sides and 2 more pins at the quarter points of its upper side. In a Type2 fixing a panel is held by 2 pins on each of its left and right hand sides. In a Type 3 fixing the panel is held by 2 pins at thequarter points of its top and bottom sides.

But the project had experienced delay in concreting work,so that not all houses were ready to be handed over to MML. For example, at a meeting on 17 October, GWA noted that PCL "still hadnot rectified the concrete wall<sup><sup>3</sup></sup> being poured for incorrect thickness since last site meeting". This (GWA advised) "might affect the stone installation works". Mr.Shum notes in the margin to the minute that chipping work to rectify the incorrect thickness was in progress. It was instead decidedthat the houses would be made available to MML one at a time in accordance with a programme to be provided by PCL.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> A principal focus of this trial has been on the substantial hacking off done to the concrete walls of Houses 1 to 5. In particularcases this hacking off led to the exposure of the underlying reinforcement bars or, at any rate, to a reduction of the concrete coverto the same. Left unremedied, the exposure of rebars or the depletion of their cover can impair the structural integrity and durabilityof concrete walls. For the purposes of later discussion, I will catalogue in this section the various hacking off situations as theyarose on the project.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> On 22 October 1996 MML wrote to PCL that, as measured at ground floor level, the concrete walls on numerous elevations of House 3had been cast in excess of specification, the excesses ranging from +80 to -39 mm. MML followed up with a more detailed alignmentsurvey of concrete measurements for Houses 1 to 4 by a fax dated 24 October 1996. The survey showed wall spans at several elevationswere of specification at ranges of +64 to -58 mm (House 1), +67 to -34 mm (House 2), +39 to -74 mm (House 3) and +42 to -58.6 mm(House 4). PCL acted on MML's survey by hacking off concrete where the same exceeded the +15 mm tolerance allowed by the TechnicalSpecification. But where the concrete was short of the specified dimension, MML did not require PCL to do anything.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> By a fax dated 31 October 1996 to Ms. Kirkwood, PCL advised that in accordance with TDA's instruction the 50 mm thick enlarged concretesurface of the external wall of the servants' toilets and the internal wall adjacent to the kitchen staircase in Houses 1 to 5 werebeing chiselled away to comply with the relevant architectural drawings.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Minutes of a meeting on 1 November 1996 record the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Rectification to wall thickness at garden door Contractor reported that the taking down and rebuilding has not commenced.

Minutes of a meeting on that day also record that the hackingoff of the wall thickness by the garden door had been completed and "resifix" applied. The minute also states: "Contractor has submittedthis method statement but it has not been formally approved." The method statement was formally approved by GWA by a fax to PCL dated7 December 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> On 6 December 1996 the Building Authority approved the proposed "Fixing Details for Granite Cladding" in relation to Houses 1 to5. At this point, given the references to "granite cladding" in the structural calculations submitted by GWA, the Building Authoritywas labouring under the impression that granite and not limestone was to be used in Houses 1 to 5.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> At a meeting on 13 December 1996 PCL advised that all waterproofing works on Houses 1 to 5 had been completed and testing had commenced.Some remedial work (PCL pointed out) had started where leaks had occurred around formwork bolt holes. The clerk of works was monitoringthe testing, which would continue after drilling and waterproofing of stonework fixings.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> On 8 January 1997 the Building Authority consented to the carrying of "Fixing Details for Granite Works" in connection with Houses1 to 5.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> On 5 February 1997 the Building Department inspected the concrete work in Houses 1 to 5.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> On 4 March 1997 Mr. Pisano wrote to Mr. Tin as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Upon inspection of the site it has come to me attention that throughout house 1 to 5 areas of concrete have been 'cut chase'. Youare reminded that all treated areas will require two inspections, one inspection once the preparation work has been completed andone when the remedial work has been completed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> In the real world, concrete cannot be truly flat. There are bound to be small variations (whether surface protrusions or declivities)along a concrete surface. What happened was that as MML was installing stone panels to the external walls of Houses 1 to 5, MML wasdiscovering that it was not always possible to keep the panels in proper alignment. The stone panels themselves were not completelyeven in length and width. Further, the anchor bolts to which the stone panels would be attached were of relatively fixed dimensions.The anchor bolts could not be readily lengthened or shortened to take account of inevitable variations along the concrete surface.To enable the stone panels to be positioned in some reasonably aesthetic alignment, MML would therefore instruct PCL to hack offparts of the concrete walls of Houses 1 to 5. Mr. Pisano noticed this hacking off in the course of his inspection work and sent offthe fax just quoted as a result.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Mr. Tin's oral evidence on the nature of the remedial work referred to by Mr. Pisano was confused. At different stages in his cross-examinationMr. Tin both claimed that before 30 October 1997 hacking off to accommodate MML's stone panels had and had not resulted in reinforcementbars becoming exposed. At one point in his cross-examination Mr. Tin suggested that remedial work to hacked off areas consisted entirelyof applying Vandex. At another point Mr. Tin said that the same remedial work included the application of Sika Top concrete mortar.Mr. Tin explained that he understood the expression "cut chase" in Mr. Pisano's fax to be referring only to hacking off. If so, itseems to me more likely that, apart from the limited incident mentioned above, at the time of Mr. Pisano's fax hacking off had notbeen found to have caused reinforcement bars to become exposed.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> At this point the remedial work envisaged by Mr. Pisano required the application of Sika Top to restore appropriate cover for thereinforcement bars embedded within the concrete walls of Houses 1 to 5. I do not read Mr. Pisano as referring simply to the applicationof Vandex, rather he seems to have been referring to using Sika Top in accordance with the method statement mentioned above. As willbe seen below, where later hacking off led to the exposure of reinforcement bars, the application of Sika Top was not by itself afeasible repair. The Sika Top would have simply restored cover which it had been thought necessary to hack off in the first instanceso as to allow MML to align its stone panels. That situation called for another method statement which would provide adequate coverfor rebars without increasing the hacked off thickness of the relevant concrete walls. If the hacking off referred to by Mr. Pisanoin March 1997 had led to exposed rebars, I doubt that Mr. Pisano would simply be writing in the way that he did without calling fora further method statement from PCL.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The minutes of a meeting on 7 March 1997 state:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"PCL are having to carry remedial work to concrete external dining room walls to suit the stone work installation. There is some inaccuracyof setting out possibly due to bowing of the framework. Approval from GWA head office to be given to concrete remedial works. PCLto confirm reapplication of waterproofing. C of W will inspect."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>This is further evidence of the need to hack off to enable MML to align its stone panels. It shows that PCL had to obtain approvalfrom GWA for remedial work. The passage further shows that waterproofing with Vandex was a separate consideration from remedial workwith Sika Top. Finally, the minutes highlight the clerk of works's responsibility to inspect the remedial works.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> By letter to MML dated 14 May 1997 TDA confirmed that MML would undertake the following tasks:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. Walling stones with veins will be taken off and replaced.</p>        <p class="quote">2. Cracked/broken walling stones which have been repaired and installed will be taken off and replaced.</p>        <p class="quote">3.

The installers will be instructed not to hang any such stones."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> MML's stone work required more and more hacking work to be done. Stone installation work was threatening to delay completion of Houses1 to 5. A meeting dated 14 May 1997 records the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Problems with the concrete structure now being raised as installation is proceeding. PCL stated they have 4 labourers assigned todo the hacking off work and will complete all that is marked up within the next two days.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">PCL stated that any further adjustment works needed will require 2 days notice for arrangements and can provide more labour as requiredand will complete in a reasonable time. If works are required immediately then NSC may hack off only after notifying CofW but mustundertake to assume responsibility for the water proofing. PCL must notify CofW of completion of hacking off for inspection and againfor inspection of waterproofing rectification."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>A meeting dated 16 May 1997 contains the following minute:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"PCL &amp; MML agreed to a joint survey to mark out all areas, where hacking off of concrete is required."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>A joint survey to check and mark up areas requiring hacking off was scheduled as a matter of urgency. Following the survey the minutesof a meeting on 12 June 1997 state:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"MML can commence to the entire of houses 1-5.

Mr. Lu, however, was anxious that as much as possible Mr. Joseph Kong remainedas BHP's representative on the construction of the Property. Following discussion between Mr. Nick Brooke and Mr. Lu, it was agreedthat Mr. Joseph Kong would continue to spend his evenings and weekends working on Linfield's project while working full-time on someother employment. Nonetheless, from that time onwards, Mr. Joseph Kong became less and less engaged with the work on the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> Hacking continued to be an issue.

It was hoped that completion would be on 14 October 1997 and an Occupation Permit ("OP") inspectioncould take place on 20 October 1997. However, the hacking off at House 5 remained to be done as of 24 September 1997.

GWA chased up for photos of repairs to these, but they were never produced. The few photos suppliedshow that Sika Top was not applied to the hacked off concrete areas surrounding the exposed parts of the rebars. Thus, where hackingoff had exposed only some but not all of a particular set of reinforcement bars, that part immediately adjacent to the exposed portionwould not have been pushed back into a groove and would not necessarily have had sufficient cover restored to it.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> On 16 December 1997 GWA wrote to BHP thus:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"While on a site visit on 7th November, 1997 (with Mr. Johnny Tin (PCL), Mr. Simeon Shum (Clerk of Works), Ms. Tain Kirkwood (TDA)and our Mr. Pouyan Behrouzi (GWA)), we discovered that hacking on the external face of the walls was taking place in order to makeit possible to install the stone cladding. We immediately demanded that PCL provide us with a structural rectification proposal forour approval, since none had been issued to is for this before the hacking began. PCL then issued a proposal to rectify the hackedareas (and any further areas not yet hacked) by applying repair mortar Sika Top 122 to protect the exposed steel bars from weatheringwhile maintaining a minimum 15 mm cover (see attached fax from PCL dated 10th November, 1997). This proposal is acceptable to ussince it will ensure that the reinforcement bars will receive the necessary cover to protect them from weathering.</p>        <p class="quote">As long as this rectification proposal has been carried out properly, the concrete will not be adversely affected by the hacking.We have instructed PCL and the Clerk of Works to submit photos of all hacked areas that have been prepared prior to application ofthe repair mortar (i.e. concrete and reinforcement bars cleared of all loose debris and dust). As of today, we have not yet receivedthose photos.

The application included copies of Testconsult's results, a product description of Poiseul B5 from Marbres du Boulonnaisand instructions on the treatment of the limestone with Dallages.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> Mr. Lu was not satisfied with Mr. Joseph's Kong's performance in the period after resignation from BHP. Mr. Joseph Kong's attendanceon the project was inevitably reduced and Mr. Lu did not feel that he was devoting sufficient attention to the construction of theProperty. After discussion with Mr. Nick Brooke, Linfield terminated BHP's involvement on the project by letter dated 29 December1997. Termination took effect from the end of the year.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> On 5 January 1998 Linfield appointed Mr. Lim as Resident Architect for the project. Among Mr. Lim's duties were the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1) to make sure that the main contractor and the sub-contractor carry out their work properly and efficiently according to the contract;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) to make sure that the main contractor and the sub-contractor are carrying out their work are up to the qualities standard expected;</p>        <p class="quote">(3) to make sure that the main contractor in the sub-contractors maintain effective and efficient management of their respective works;</p>        <p class="quote">(4) to make sure that the main contractors and the sub-contractors maintain productive and smooth co-operation;</p>        <p class="quote">(5) to make daily report of the progress of work on site carried out by different trades and submit the said report to the ProjectArchitect (Ms. Tain Kirkwood) and the Client daily;</p>        <p class="quote">(6) to inform the Project Architect immediately should there be any instructions to be issued to the contractors so that issuanceof Architect's Instruction will be centralised from the Architects office to avoid possible confusion."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> On 16 February 1998 GWA submitted to the Building Authority revised structural calculations for the fixing details of House 6. Theserevised calculations had been forwarded to GWA by MML. The main amendments arose from the revision of the allowable bending stressfrom 4.5 down to 2.37 N/mm3. An allowable bending stress of 4.5 N/mm3 coupled with the factor of safety of 3 stipulated by the originalcalculations implies a flexural strength of 13.5 N/mm3. However, Testconsult's results only supported an average flexural strengthof 7.1 N/mm3 (1 MPa = 1 N/mm3). Dividing that latter figure by 3 yields an allowable stress of 2.37 N/mm3. For this reason, the lowerallowable stress was used in the structural calculations for House 6. Nonetheless, the amended calculations concluded that, evenwith the lower allowable stress figure, the thickness of 30 mm per stone panel posited by MML's original cladding design for Houses1 to 5 remained valid.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> A joint inspection of House 6 took place on 24 February 1998. The inspection considered (among other topics) the hacking work whichwas taking place at House 6 in order to allow MML to install its stone panels. On 26 February 1998 MML faxed PCL that "because ofincompletion of concrete hacking, water-proofing and inadequate spacing for stone return to window", MML could not commence stonework on 15 February 1998 as originally intended but had to wait for PCL to finish the requisite work.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> On 16 March 1998 the Buildings Department indicated that, before it would consent to the cladding works to House 6, it required (amongother things) a "live mock up test to be carried out for the shear to demonstrate that the stone panels can withstand three timesthe shear load assumed in the structural calculations".</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> On 8 April 1998 Linfield took possession of Phase I, but "subject to completion and rectification of all outstanding and defect worksin a timely manner".</p>    <p class="heading">G. Practical completion to remedial work: April 1998 onwards</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> Some time in early 1998 Mr. Lu had noticed that there were cracked stones on the facade, podium and poolside terraces. Many facadestones were inconsistent in colour and improperly fixed and aligned. There were also gaps between the stone sills and window framesof Houses 1 to 5. In addition, a number of stone panels also showed visible epoxy repair. He asked MML to replace the stones, butthis did not happen.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> On 29 April 1998 Linfield advised its consultants that Axiom had been appointed as project manager for the entire project.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> On 27 May 1998 Hong Kong Curtain Wall Testing Centre Ltd. released a report on the shear test conducted on a limestone panel forHouse 6. The results were satisfactory. The stone panel (length: 1,294 mm; width: 1,006 mm) was subjected to cyclic pulse wind pressuresup to maximums of +4.375 kPa (that is, 125% of a design pressure of 3.5 kPa) and -6.125 kPa (that is, 125% of a design pressure of-4.90 kPa).</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> On 24 June 1998 Linfield received a written complaint about significant water seepage experienced by tenants since they moved intoHouse 2. The problem of water leakage in the Property, especially through windows of Houses 1 to 5, was one which persisted despiterepeated efforts at addressing the same.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> On 26 June 1998 GWA wrote to Linfield seeking additional consultancy fees totalling $425,340. The request was amended to $301,430on 1 August 1998. This revised fee was agreed by Linfield on 10 August 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> The Building Authority consented to the fixing details for the stone cladding to House 6 on 27 June 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> At around this time Mr. Lu noticed other problems with Houses 1 to 5. Many corner stones were in two rather than one piece as MMLhad previously promised. Stone panels were stained. A significant number appeared to have mould growing on them. Mr. Lu became worriedthat the mould might grow into the joints between stones and cause the joints to expand and crack the adjoining stones. Again hespoke to MML. MML said it would replace the problem stones. But this did not happen.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> On 28 July 1998 Dr. Ho resigned as AP and Architect for the project. For some time Dr. Ho had been asking Linfield for additionalfees to compensate TDA for the much greater time spent on the project than Dr. Ho had originally anticipated. Linfield not havingagreed, Dr. Ho felt he could no longer continue. On 4 August 1998 Dr. Ho was persuaded to withdraw his resignation upon payment ofan additional fee of $1,996,778.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> In October and November 1998 Mr. Lu took photographs of the stained stone panels which he had noticed. He sent the pictures to Mr.Hartog, a stone cladding expert and principal of BDAP recommended to Mr. Lu by Mr. Michael Snarey of Stanton Hillier Parker in Sydney.Initially, Mr. Hartog responded by a fax dated 2 October 1998. There Mr. Hartog commented on the respective roles of an architectand main contractor in the design of a stone cladding system for a project. The fax ended: "We [Mr. Hartog and his colleague Mr.McKenzie] question the wisdom of selecting a stone which requires frequent treatment to maintain its appearance and surface integrity."</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> Mr. Hartog visited the Property with Mr. McKenzie between 1 and 6 December 1998. At the time Mr. Hartog questioned the suitabilityof the stone. This prompted Mr. Lu to commission BDAP to investigate the stone cladding and associated problems (especially wateringress) at the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> On 17 December 1998 PCL, Mr. Wong and Mr. Ho respectively certified that the building works for Phase 2 had been completed and appliedfor an OP for House 6.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> Mr. Hartog and Mr. McKenzie prepared a report dated 20 January 1999 based on their inspection of the Property. The report is a longone. I will not attempt to summarise it. Among it recommendations and conclusions, the following give a flavour of the report's tenor:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) "We recommend that Linfield seek, as a matter of urgency, a copy of all engineering calculations and design validations submittedto Taoho Design by Michelangelo Marble Limited. If the specified calculations were not submitted, or are found to be inadequate,Linfield should commission independent testing of stone samples and expert engineering analysis of the cladding design. Testing andanalysis should be based on nominal panel and support configurations and worst-case combinations of dimensional tolerances, off-centrepin holes, misaligned pins and inadvertent load-shedding through plated steel washers, shims and bands of epoxy resin."</p>        <p>(2) "We consider the likelihood of catastrophic failure of the cladding in service, for instance the sudden collapse of one or morepanels during storm winds, is low. Continuous perimeter joint seals of Tremco Dymonic would have the unintended benefit of distributingdistressing forces from isolated unstable panels to all abutting panels. It is more likely that spalling will first occur aroundfixings without noticeable displacement of the panels. Any chips or spalls found near the base of walls should be retained and labelledand their locations recorded. In the long term, a complete survey and subsequent monitoring of all distress around fixings will benecessary. Linfield and its legal advisors should consider instructing Michelangelo Marble and/or the head contractor to conductadditional and more comprehensive wind pressure tests which accurately replicate the range of deviations from and undocumented modificationsto the fixing details shown in shop drawings and/or tested in May 1998."</p>        <p>(3) "Mechanical fixings and surrounding stone must be considered to act in concert. BDAP+JTCW is at present unable to confirm thedesign capacity of typical angle brackets and dowel pin fixings used at 51 Plantation Road was calculated on the basis of project-specificcriteria and verified by testing prior to widespread use on site. However, it is unlikely that the load-bearing capacity of 5 mmthick stainless steel angle brackets and 10 mm diameter Hilti anchors shown in shop drawings will be exceeded. It is the bending,tensile and shear capacity of the limestone itself which has been, and will continue to be, exceeded, as is evident from consistentpatterns of cracking and spalling."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> On 18 March 1999 MML was denied access to Houses 1 to 4 and not permitted to carry out rectification work there.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> On 19 March 1999 Linfield wrote to Dr. Ho, instructing him to desist from issuing any Certificates of Making Good Defects in respectof the Main Contract Works in light of Mr. Hartog's observations. Mr. Lu appended a list of defects (as drawn up by Mr. Hartog) toLinfield's letter.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> On 18 May 1999 a meeting took place among Mr. Lu, Mr. Hartog, Dr. Ho, Mr. Mui of Axiom and Mr. Yiu of TDA at the Property. MML wasunable to attend the meeting. There was debate over whether the cladding was "unsafe". Dr. Ho did not think so. He suggested that,if Linfield genuinely believed that the cladding was unsafe as alleged by Mr. Hartog, tenants should be told to evacuate immediately.Among the other topics discussed was the safety factor of 3 used in the structural calculations. In Mr. Hartog's view a factor ofsafety of between 7 to 12 was applicable depending on the nature and character of the stone used. Dr. Ho disagreed and asserted that3 was the only safety factor required by the Buildings Department. Dr. Ho clearly did not get along with Mr. Hartog. Nonetheless,it was agreed that BDAP and TDA would consult with a fa?ade expert in Ove Arup Hong Kong on the question. Linfield accordingly commissionedAFE to test out and report on the Poiseul B5 employed on the project.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> By letter dated 31 May 1999 MML rejected BDAP's allegations that the its stone work was defective.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> A meeting on 25 June 1999 dealt (among other matters) with the question of staining on the stone panels. MML stressed that the stainswere natural to limestone and caused by environmental factors. It maintained that regular cleaning by Linfield was the only solution.Waterproof coating could improve the stone's resistance to environmental impacts, but would not obviate the need for maintenance.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> By letter dated 3 July 1999 PCL in turn denied liability for defects pointed out by BDAP.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> On 27 August 1999 TDA wrote to PCL to complain about the large proportion of windows in the Property which were leaking seriouslyduring the recent periods of heavy rain. The windows (TDA noted) "have never been repaired to our satisfaction despite repeated reminders"since the time of completion. Other contractors would now be asked to rectify the problem at PCL's cost.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> There was joint inspection of Houses 3 and 5 on 24 September 1999. Dr. Ho, Mr. Hartog and representatives of AFE were present (amongothers). In the course of the inspection, stone cladding was removed, enabling closer examination of the fixing system behind. Smallpieces of stone (about 15 mm diameter) were found on the lawn of House 3. These may have been blown off from the fa?ade of one ofthe houses by a recent typhoon.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> Mr. Hartog reported his views to Mr. Lu in a letter dated 4 October 1999. The letter, among others contains an attack on the professionalismof Dr. Ho and the competence of MML. It includes the following comments:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) "At the 18 May inspection I suggested that a slot for an undocumented bracket may have been cut as far as 25 mm into panels nominally30 mm thick. The representative of Taoho Design Architects declined to respond. However TDA has subsequently argued that the occurrenceof halo-stains commonly originate from contaminants falling onto brackets. TDA's opinion was forcefully reiterated in its reportof the removal of a single panel from Apartment 3 on 24 June. In my responses to TDA's report, I noted that those orchestrating thedemonstration had overlooked the opportunity to examine the wall cavity immediately above and to the sides of the panel. The currentremoval of stone around ground floor windows on Apartment 5 strongly suggests that physical evidence supporting BDAP+JTCW's explanation,and confirming further deviations from the design illustrated in MML's shop drawings, may have been visible only centimetres fromthe small area selectively uncovered and observed by TDA and MML on 24 June. I am now more convinced that the exercise of 24 Junewas a sham. While rejecting BDAP+JTCW's explanation for recurrent and worsening staining, TDA and its associate MML have yet to offertheir own explanation. The evidence in support of BDAP+JTCW's initial speculation is meanwhile mounting."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) "It is my view that Taoho Design Architects accepted a generous fee to provide a comprehensive service during construction andthen expended negligible time addressing the compliance of construction and quality of workmanship in the elements known to be proneto defects with expensive consequences; windows and facade waterproofing. This is consistent with plausible comments made from timeto time about Dr. Taoho; he is regarded as an excellent conceptual designer with an uneven record in contract administration andpoor knowledge of construction materials and detailing."</p>        <p>(3) "How else are we to explain Dr. Taoho's attitude to the explicit specification and later complete omission of resilient cushionsbetween stone and stainless steel brackets. to the deletion of specified backing rods under Dymonic seals, the excessive use of epoxyresin, the seemingly ad hoc embedment of brackets in epoxy-filled slots around window openings revealed during preparation for thecurrent remedial works and so on? What evidence of Michelangelo Marble's competence in exterior thin stone cladding did Taoho havein 1996 when he so effusively recommended the company. As far as I aware, MML had <em>by that time</em> completed some interior stonework. Why did Taoho place such importance on the need for L-shaped corner panels? Rocamat states thatit was never asked to do so and would have cautioned against the practice. How did Taoho manage to overlook the substitution of site-appliedsilicone sealant for the extruded synthetic rubber gaskets that are common components of the window system supplied by Alcon? Howdid the architect manage to overlook perimeter sealing of hundreds of metres of snap-on cover channels that have no essential waterproofingfunction but now retain water and fine silt against the sills? Why did the architect fail to notice irregularities in the windowtest report submitted by the window manufacturer? My guess is that TDA does not have appropriately experienced staff, or else thatsuch staff disdain examination of shop drawings, close review of test reports and visits to building sites. Nevertheless, the architects'terms of engagement required it to guard the client against the very defects now so widespread at The Belvedere."</p>        <p>(4) "The party most responsive for the poor performance of the windows is Taoho Design Architects. Notwithstanding that TDA may beabsorbing the costs of its attendance at meetings and of other work associated with rectification, Linfield and its advisors shouldrecognise the conflicts of interest that confront the architect. TDA has no interest in attributing responsibility or in uncoveringevidence that allows others to attribute responsibility. It probably seeks an expedient short-term solution that directs attentionaway from its own performance. Above all, an architect who permitted windows to be installed without continuous flashings and gasketseals, with misplaced setting blocks, inverted pressure plates, site-applied silicone seals and so on, should be no more than a distantobserver of remedial work specified, detailed, inspected and approved by others."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> Mr. Hartog followed up with another letter on 6 October 1999 which concluded:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The calculation sheets for Houses 1 to 5 are dated variously as 14, 28 and 29 August 1996. The cover sheet is dated 16 August 1996.The sheets were faxed by P. C. Lam &amp; Associates Ltd. on August 30 1996. It thus appears that the engineering consultant engagedby Michelangelo Marble Ltd. was, in mid-to-late August 1996, checking decisions on bracket and stone thickness which had alreadybeen made by MML. Shop drawings D-18, dated 31 July 1996, shows 30 mm thick limestone and a typical angle-bracket which almost completelyfills a panel joint noted as 6 mm wide. There is nothing improper in a contractor making estimates, based on its experience or industrypractice, before engineering validation of the design. It now remains for us to identify and compare the critical values (1) assumedby MML, (2) provided by the French stone supplier, (3) used by P C Lam &amp; Assoc. in its calculations, (4) reported by Testconsultafter the work was underway, (5) measured by Marc Heinlein, and (6) determined by Arup Facade Engineering to be sufficient for thework as executed, taking into account the known deviations from the design documented in the shop drawings. Unfortunately, the engineer'sreliance on a safety factor of 3.0, the variability of test results reported by Marc Heinlein and the ad hoc modifications tend toconfirm my original suspicion that the work of Michelangelo Marble Ltd. was based on misconstrued rules-of-thumb and expediency ratherthan basic engineering principles. I [re]main convinced that Taoho Design Architects bears most responsibility through its lack ofdiligence in evaluating MML's work before, during and since stone-fixing at The Belvedere. BDAP+JTCW will take no further actionuntil the opinion of AFE is formally reported."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> Mr. Hartog sent a detailed fax criticising the windows and glazing used on the Property on 10 October 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> Mr. Lu met with Mr. Hartog and Mr. Snarey in Sydney on 19 October 1999. Mr. Lu asked Mr. Hartog to send another fax expanding onmatters discussed at the meeting. The fax includes more attack on TDA, including personal criticism of Dr. Ho. For example, Mr. Hartogstates:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) "Unfortunately, Dr. Tao Ho did not recognise his limitations and those of his firm. He did not hesitate to accept a generous feefor a range of services TDA has clearly failed to provide. He did not recommend the engagement of an expert on stone cladding. Heoverlooked serious inconsistencies in the test report on windows. On the basis of our two meetings and his diverting correspondence,I suspect that he does not easily defer to the opinions of others, even in fields where he has little knowledge. He overcomes a personallack of knowledge of building technology by bombast. He is unlikely to employ and encourage self-confident juniors or peers whosespecific skills complement his own. The reported role of Tain Kirkwood in your project and the self-conscious deference shown byJohn Yiu on 18 May suggest that Tao Ho does not highly value skills other than those he personally professes. It was Tim Phillipswho related that Tao Ho's reputation as a talented designer is not matched by TDA's performance in detailing, specifying and contractadministration."</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) "It is telling that Dr. Tao Ho has not sought to repudiate any of BDAP+JTCW's criticisms by sound technical arguments. He relieson name-dropping, the supposed praise of parties distant from the project, vague references to some mysterious 'Hong Kong code ofpractice', my supposed lack of familiarity with Hong Kong's peculiarly undemanding standards of workmanship, dismissal of BDAP+JTCW'sopinions as being 'outside the contract', an almost bizarre claim that only his own 'reasonable satisfaction' is valid, and, ultimately,appeals to Christian forbearance accompanied by threats to cause you further damage. He poses as the wronged party. He insists, contraryto your abundant evidence, that he has worked diligently to safeguard your interests (recall, however, how effusively he promotedMichelangelo Marble and sought to convince you that it could execute a 'good and even excellent' job. How diligently did he investigateMML's competence before making that unwarranted recommendation?). I intend no disrespect in suggesting that Tao Ho recognised youas a neophyte client more than usually dependent on his advice and unlikely to recognise or even suspect derelictions of his andTDA's professional duty. He has exploited that situation, even to threaten to further devalue your interest."</p>        <p>(3) "I believe your interests are best served by removing Tao Ho Design Architects from the scene in a way that puts it on noticethat it will be held responsible for a substantial part of your losses. Linfield has more than enough evidence to dismiss TDA forincompetence. Geoffrey Chan [of JSM] may be prepared to extend that to professional negligence, fraud, fraudulent concealment andmisrepresentation. You can then engage someone who truly represents your interests and has the skills to devise appropriate remediesand, in so doing, accumulate overwhelming evidence of TDA's incompetence. You need take no deliberate action to impugn TDA's reputation;in Hong Kong, the word will soon get around. You might even find some sympathetic allies, fellow victims of TDA. The same appliesto the defects problems, particularly after the water damage of early September. I believe it is better to get on with retrievingthe situation without the risk that Tao Ho will exploit it to your disadvantage. Accept that the buildings have significant problemsand announce that you are dedicated to their complete remedy, albeit without the questionable skills and input of TDA, as financesand access permit. That at leat makes you immune from Tao Ho's threats and his insistence that he must run the show. Meanwhile, continueto gather evidence of the poor performance of TDA and Progress. If timing and circumstances permit, Peter McKenzie and I are preparedto come to Hong Kong to document and test viable solutions that will make the buildings marketable. As we cautioned on Tuesday evening,that will involve stripping the limestone, comprehensive window repairs and recladding with a different stone (most likely granite)and complex decorative elements that may not need to be made of stone."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr. Hartog sent a further fax in similar vein on 21 December 1999.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> Defects, in particular leaking windows and problematic stone work, continued to beset the Property. On 5 January 2000 Mr. Lu sentthe following e-mail to AFE, urging them to produce their report as soon as possible:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I refer to our meeting on April 17 when you told me the final report will be available on 28 April. As mentioned before, I am undertremendous pressure to rectify the defects as soon as possible and without your report, we are not in the position to proceed. Iwould be grateful if you can confirm when the report will be ready. Each month's delay is costing me $250,000 per house. The tenantsare also threatening me of moving out. Please therefore do not delay this matter unnecessarily."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> AFE finished its report ("the 1st AFE Report") on 12 May 2000. The 1st AFE Report was prepared by Mr. Tim Phillips of AFE. Samplesof the limestone panels used in the Property were sent to Corived SRL in Italy for testing. The tests showed a mean flexural strength(combining 5 dry and 5 wet sample results) of 5.49 MPa with mean modulus of rupture (combining 5 dry and 5 wet sample results) of6.4 MPa. Mean compressive strength of 5 dry samples was 81.3 MPa (perpendicular to rift) and 82.15 MPa (parallel to rift) with figuresof 68.03 MPa and 70.75 MPa respectively for wet samples. In terms of factor of safety, the report suggested that a factor of safetyof 6 should have been used when calculating allowable flexural strength of the stone and a factor of safety of 8.4 should have beenused when checking stresses at anchorage point. Based on Corived's results, the 1st AFE Report made the following recommendations:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. The panels with a factor of safety of less than 6 (for bending) and less than 8.4 at anchorage locations, should be replaced.</p>        <p class="quote">2. Replace the panels which already show signs of failure.</p>        <p class="quote">3. Since the replacement of panels is a costly and time consuming business, it is not considered necessary to replace all of the areaswhich are installed incorrectly, ie with epoxy adhesive, but to identify those which derive their strength entirely from the an adheredconnection and replace those. This quantity is not known.</p>        <p class="quote">4. Monitoring of the limestone in place is recommended which will allow the replacement of panels as they fail. A stock of replacementlimestone should be procured and maintained as the failure is predominantly seen as being in stress bands about every 4 rows of panels.</p>        <p class="quote">It should be noted that the panels which are secured by epoxy adhesive will be difficult to replace and some damage may be done toadjacent panels. A wastage percentage of around 25% should be anticipated, unless experience of stone replacement to date shows otherwise."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> At around this time Mr. Lu instructed Mr. Kenny Kong of DCL to carry out a condition survey of the Property to identify the extentof defects, including problems with the stone cladding. Mr. Kenny Kong's advice in due course was that some 80% of the stone claddinghad to be replaced if defects were to be rectified. Accordingly, Mr. Kenny Kong believed that it was more cost effective to demolishand replace the entire cladding system.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> At a meeting on 11 July 2000 (attended by Mr. Lu, Mr. Hartog, Mr. Snarey and Mr. Job of AFE among others) there was a discussionas to whether to adopt a newly designed fixing system for granite cladding to remedy the defects in the Property. The following werenoted in relation to the facade:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) "Although the original cladding calculations were based on granite, the RSE had advised that BD approvals were based on drawingssubmitted instead of calculations, hence, should a heavier material is to be adopted for stone cladding, re-submission to BuildingsDepartment would be required."</p>        <p>(2) "It had been observed and confirmed that the existing cladding had not been built in accordance with approved shop drawings. BothAFE and LK [Liu Kwong &amp; Associates Ltd.] remarked that the existing approved fixing method is common in local practice and thathad the existing cladding been erected in accordance to the approved drawings, the said cladding would ave been sufficient with minoradjustments. PH disagreed and suggested that a new fixing system should be adopted."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> On 22 August 2000 Linfield decided to go ahead with the rectification of existing defects in the stone work of the Property by overhaulingthe limestone cladding completely and using granite instead. Linfield further decided to vacate all tenants before commencement ofremedial works and to rectify all problems at the Property at the same time. DCL was appointed as project manager of the works.

The report was prepared for Linfieldby Mr. Miglio. It analysed the result of tests on sample limestone panels chosen by Mr. Miglio during an inspection visit of theProperty between 16 and 19 July 2001. The tests were carried out by BRE in December 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a> The 2nd AFE Report states that the tested samples were chosen and classified by reference to the absence or presence of stylolites.The latter are "natural features that are apparent as sinuous slightly darker lines in the stone, and may sometimes have the appearanceof irregular fractures or veins". Stylolites are "typically closed tight, but can be open or clay filled in which case they may formpotential planes of weakness within the stone". The limestone was classified as Types I, II or III as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where there were relatively few stylolites and they appeared to lie sub-parallel to the face of the panel, the stone was classedas Type I. Where the stylolites were more frequent and tended to cut obliquely across the thickness of the stone, outcropping inareas across the face, the stone was classed as Type II, Where the stylolites cut more directly across the thickness, the stone wasclassed as Type III."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> In terms of designing for the thickness of cladding made from Poiseul B5, the 2nd AFE Report comments as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Guidance on the assessment of thickness can be found in several sources but is perhaps best explained in the UK Building ResearchEstablishment IP 7/98. This sets out the basic framework for the calculation based on the parameters described above.</p>        <p class="quote">On this basis, the data generated by the testing recently completed at the BRE can be used to review the acceptability of the 30 mmthickness suggested by Taoho Design. In addition, from this data it will be possible [to] back analyse the acceptability of the thicknessby calculation of the factor of safety for each stone. At this point however, it may be instructive to consider the meaning of theterm 'factors of safety'.</p>        <p class="quote">A review of the flexural strength data for the intact Poiseul Beige (Type 1 and 2) shows that the average (mean) strength can be calculatedas 7.4 MPa. However, this average does not reveal the range in the strength values obtained; the lowest value was only 2.8 MPa andthe highest 10.8 MPa. While some degree of spread of results is to be expected this range in values is quite high, even for limestone.</p>        <p class="quote">Clearly it would not be sensible to carry out a design based simply on the mean strength of the stone as much lower values are clearlypossible. To allow for this material variability, the required strength for a stone (as determined by the calculations on size loadsetc) is multiplied by a factor, which represents the unreliability or variability of the strength data. This factor is known as the'factor of safety'. The BRE IP 7/98 indicates that when using the average bending strength for a stone a factor of safety of 6 shouldbe assumed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a> That is not to say that a factor of safety of 3 will never be acceptable. According the 2nd AFE Report, it may be used in a design,but only where characteristic (as opposed to mean) flexural strength is employed in calculations. More particularly, the 2nd AFEReport explains:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The only circumstances where we consider a factor of safety of 3 would have been acceptable would have been on the basis of a detailedknowledge fo the strength characteristics of the stone (for further details refer to Guide to the selection and testing of stonepanels for external use (1997) by the UK Centre for Window and Cladding Technology (CWCT)). Having tested a sufficient number ofsamples to be representative of the stone the analysis is not based on the mean (or average) strength value but on the 'lowest expectedvalue' or 'characteristic strength'. In broad terms this approximates to the mean (average) strength minus twice the standard deviation.Around 95% of the strength values that occur would be greater than this 'lowest expected value'. This statistical approach alreadytakes into account a significant amount of material variation and the factor of safety adopted can therefore be reasonably reduced.Only under these circumstances would a factor of safety of 3 be reasonable. However, the whole basis of this approach is that thereis a statistically meaningful set of appropriate test data upon which to assess the material variability, There is no evidence thatMichelangelo Marble had any such test data specific to the Poiseul.</p>        <p class="quote">In the absence of such test data we are left to infer that Michelangelo Marble assumed a strength value for Poiseul Beige based ona typical strength for any limestone and applied a factor fo safety of 3 to this number for the purposes of their analysis. Thereis no validity in this approach and any reasonably competent engineer would have known that it was a fundamentally flawed analysisupon which to determine the thickness of stone."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a> By letter dated 4 June 2004 Sing Kee again notified GWA that "the benefit of the agreement [between Sing Kee and GWA] has been assignedby this company to Linfield Limited".</p>    <p class="heading">I.

But just before thetenancy was to commence, Mr. Pacconi changed his mind. Linfield had spent the 1 month deposit (which was forfeited as a result ofthe tenant's breach) on repainting and re-fitting the interior of House 1. In August 2002 a person offered to rent the premises for$200,000 but backed out. Between February and December 2003 Mr. Lu lived in the house (while maintaining his home at Grenville House)for marketing reasons, in order to convey the impression that the development had tenants. Mr. Lu was prepared to move out of House1 at a moment's notice, if a prospective tenant expressed an interest in living there.

Linfield's complaints</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a> Linfield contends that MML and GWA made unrealistic assumptions in submitting or approving the design and accompanying calculationsfor the limestone cladding system employed at the Property. A reasonably competent engineer (Linfield says) would have realised thatin the real world the design could simply not be built. These lapses on the part of MML and GWA were exacerbated by the fact (accordingto Linfield) that in executing the design MML's workers were incompetent and careless, while GWA failed to undertake any proper supervisionor inspection of MML's work. If GWA had properly supervised MML and inspected its work, it would have seen at an early stage thatlimestone panels of 30 mm thickness were wholly unsuited to the project and, in any event, MML was not installing the panels withthe requisite degree of workmanship in accordance with the contractual specification.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a> Linfield further says that GWA negligently proceeded on the basis of certain assumptions in approving MML's design.

DISCUSSION</p>    <p class="heading">A. MML's liability</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a> By its Warranty to Linfield MML agreed to exercise all reasonable care in the design of the stone works and the selection of stonepanels for cladding. MML also undertook to comply with the Technical Specification. In my view MML failed to meet its contractualobligations.</p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a> In relation to the stone cladding works, Mr. Kong's survey of the Property revealed the following problems:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) There were extensive cracks in the cladding stones used for Houses 1 to 6. In some cases clumsy attempts had been made to repaircracks or broken areas with epoxy.</p>        <p>(2) Joints between stone panels were filled with irregular epoxy plugs.</p>        <p>(3) Joint widths were inconsistent.</p>        <p>(4) Washers, newspapers and timber were embedded in the joints between numerous stone panels.</p>        <p>(5) Contrary to Technical Specification cl.6.5.13 plastic cushions were not installed in the joints between stone panels.</p>        <p>(6) There were unused anchor bolt holes in the concrete behind the stone cladding which had not been plugged.</p>        <p>(7) Irregular-sized angle brackets had occasionally been used as fixtures for some stone panels.</p>        <p>(8) In some instances cladding had been fixed over exposed reinforcement bars in the concrete. MML had not insisted that PCL remedythe exposed reinforcement bars before cladding was placed.</p>        <p>(9) There was "halo staining" on the cladding inside the lightwells of Houses 1 to 6 and on some external walls.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a> In relation to individual stone panels and their dowel pins, Mr. Kong also found the "realities" catalogued in Section II.J of thisJudgment.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a> Still another problem was the presence of mould and fungus on the exterior of the stone cladding.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a> Mr. Kong's overall subjective impression was that, at the time of DCL's survey of Houses 1 to 6, approximately 90% of the externalcladding which MML installed at the Property, suffered from one or more of 4 defects: cracking, breakage, crazing (hairline cracksfollowing a particular direction or describing some discernable shape) and mould.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a> The problems just described, taken as a whole, establish that MML's workmanship was seriously deficient. The mould and fungus additionallysuggest that thin veneer cladding made from Poiseul B5 was not fit for Hong Kong's environment.</p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a> Although Linfield selected Poiseul B5 for the Property, by Technical Specification cl.6.5.4.1 the choice was subject to MML's obligationto test the stone supplied and confirm its suitability in the environmental conditions of Hong Kong. Prior to installation of claddingon Houses 1 to 5, MML never seems to have commissioned a laboratory to carry out tests on Poiseul B5 samples as required by the TechnicalSpecification. MML appears to have relied on generic data provided by Marbres du Boulonnais as to the physical properties of PoiseulB5. But the fact that Poiseul B5 was not appropriate to Hong Kong's sub-tropical environment is manifest from the fact that, withina few months of installation, the stone even when treated with sealant showed signs of fungus and mould.</p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a> Mr. Houghton for BHP submits that "[r]elatively little effort seems to have been put into either cleaning [the stone cladding] orthe re-application of the same sealant [that is, Dallages], or trying out a different sealant". Mr. Houghton suggests that, had seriousefforts been made to clean or treat the Poiseul B5, the mould and fungus problem would have been solved. I do not think that thisis right. Linfield made strenuous efforts to surmount the problem of mould and fungus, both by re-applying Dallages and trying outalternative sealant coatings. Linfield's attempts proved abortive. The parties concluded that, given the environment at the Peak,mould and fungus staining on the Poiseul B5 cladding was inevitable and the problem could only be minimised at best by regular, potentiallyexpensive, cleaning.</p>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a> Even if Poiseul B5 was suitable for Hong Kong's environment, MML's method of installing stone panels was negligent. The problemsjust mentioned above were all too common examples of poor workmanship by MML. It appears that MML made little attempt to reject patentlyunsound stone panels. Instead, perhaps as a result of the pressures of complying with a tight work programme, MML incorporated defectivepanels indiscriminately into the cladding at the Property. MML installed panels in which stylolites were prevalent to an extent thatmade them inappropriate and possibly unsafe to use as cladding. MML also used panels with breakages (often ineptly glued back withepoxy) when it should have rejected those panels for aesthetic and safety reasons. Due to the poor selection of stone panels andbad workmanship, cracking, spalling and halo staining were widespread in the cladding system at the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a> The 4 December 1997 letter from MML to PCL mentioned above suggests that MML was fully aware that it was wrongly covering up exposedreinforcement bars with stone cladding. In the letter MML acknowledges that the exposed rebars might lead to the staining of theProperty's stone panels, but MML blames PCL for the situation and argues that such blame absolves MML of liability. Exposed rebarscan undermine the long-term structural integrity of a building. Regardless of which party was at fault for the exposed rebars, aresponsible sub-contractor in MML's position ought not knowingly to have installed panels over exposed rebars, but should insteadhave required the problem to have been remedied before proceeding any further. Putting up panels over exposed rebars despite a riskthat the aesthetic appearance of Houses 1 to 6 would be compromised with stains, was not consonant with MML's obligations to usereasonable care and competence in carrying out work.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a> I therefore conclude that MML is liable to Linfield for breach of MML's Warranty. I shall return at the end of this Judgment to considerthe measure and quantum of Linfield's damages against MML.</p>    <p class="heading">B. Linfield's locus to sue GWA in contract and tort</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a> I turn to the more difficult question of whether GWA is liable to Linfield.</p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a> As a preliminary issue, Mr. Carolan argues for GWA that there was no valid legal assignment to Linfield of Sing Kee's contractualrights against GWA. Immediately before the writ was served, GWA had not had notice of Sing Kee's assignment dated 4 September 2001.By <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23" class="autolink_findacts">Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23">Cap.23</a>) ("LARCO") <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a>, notice is necessary to complete a legal assignment. Prior to service of the writ, there having been no notice to GWA, Sing Kee'sassignment (Mr. Carolan says) can only have been valid in equity. But (Mr. Carolan points out) Sing Kee's assignment was unsupportedby consideration moving from Linfield. Accordingly, Mr. Carolan doubts whether the assignment can be valid even in equity. In anycase, if an equitable assignment is assumed, Linfield would still not be entitled to sue GWA in its own name, but must join SingKee as a party. Since Linfield has not joined Sing Kee as a party and since the limitation period for GWA's liability has expired,Linfield (Mr. Carolan concludes) has no title to sue GWA in linfield's own name as assignee of Sing Kee's rights.</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a> I disagree. First, LARCO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a> does not require consideration for there to be a valid legal assignment. Second, LARCO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a> does not require any particular form of notice of an assignment. Service of the writ by Linfield constituted sufficient notice ofSing Kee's assignment. This is because the material facts of Sing Kee's assignment were mentioned in Â§1 of the generally-endorsedwrit. Mr. Carolan cites <strong>Compania Colombiana de Seguros v. Pacific Steam Navigation Co.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%201%20QB%20101" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 1 QB 101</a> for the proposition that notice of an assignment must be given before service of a writ if a plaintiff is to sue as a legal assignee.But I do not see anything in Roskill J's judgment in <strong>Compania Colombiana</strong> which supports such contention. The question whether or not a writ could itself constitute notice of an assignment was not in issuein <strong>Compania Colombiana</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a> As a subsidiary point, Mr. Carolan argues that, since Sing Kee is effectively assigning a "bare right to litigate", then even ifthere had been notice within the terms of LARCO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/23/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a>, there could still be no proper assignment. It is not possible (Mr. Carolan says, citing <strong>Compania Colombiana</strong>) to assign a bare right to sue for damages.</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a> I disagree. The relevant rule is not as dogmatic as Mr. Carolan submits. The correct principle was stated by Lord Roskill in <strong>Trendtex Trading Corporation v. Credit Suisse</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 679 (HL)</a>, at 703F-G:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The court should look at the totality of the transaction. If the assignment is of a property right or interest and the cause of actionis ancillary to that right ir interest, or if the assignee had a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment and in enforcingit for his own benefit, I see no reason why the assignment should be struck down as an assignment of a bare cause of action or assavouring of maintenance."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a> Here Linfield is not only the owner of the Property, it is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sing Kee. In the early days of the projectwhen Mr. Lu was first putting together a team of consultants to advise on the development of the Property, he dealt with GWA throughSing Kee. The initial contact on the project having been through Sing Kee, GWA addressed its contract proposals to Sing Kee. Subsequently,Sing Kee's management decided to acquire the Property from Shell through Linfield. Correspondence on the Property with GWA continuedto be with Sing Kee as that had been the conduit for original negotiations. But all consultants (including GWA) understood that theirservices were being provided in practical terms to Linfield as the owner of the Property. The parties (including Mr. Wong and GWA)treated Sing Kee and Linfield as synonymous. Sing Kee's contract with GWA was in effect an agreement to provide Linfield with thebenefit of GWA's services (see, for a similar contract, <strong>Panatown Ltd. v. Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%204%20All%20ER%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 4 All ER 97</a>, at 151c). In those circumstances, Linfield must certainly have had a genuine commercial interest in being assigned Sing Kee's rightsagainst GWA. If there was an assignment of a bare right to litigate, such assignment is legally enforceable and does not infringethe law against maintenance and champerty.</p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a> Accordingly, Linfield's action in contract as Sing Kee's assignee is validly constituted at law.</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a> That is not the end of the question of title. Mr. Carolan has raised a final interesting argument. He says that, even if Sing Kee'sassignment is valid at law, Linfield cannot derive any practical advantage from the assignment. This is because Sing Kee could onlyhave assigned whatever rights of action it may have had against GWA. But Sing Kee (Mr. Carolan submits) had no rights of action againstGWA. To have a proper cause of action Sing Kee must establish that it suffered loss from GWA's conduct as RSE. Sing Kee could nothave sustained loss, because it had no interest in the Property. If GWA caused damage, such damage would have been sustained by Linfield,not Sing Kee. Linfield (Mr. Carolan reasons) cannot recover its own damages under the guise of enforcing Sing Kee's rights.</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a> I disagree with the submission.</p>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a> First, all parties conducted themselves throughout as if Sing Kee and Linfield were interchangeable. GWA, for example, routinelyaccepted payments of its fees from Linfield as well as Sing Kee. When seeking additional fees, GWA wrote on 26 June 1998 to Linfield,not Sing Kee. In his examination Mr. Wong explained that this was because everyone else had been treating Sing Kee and Linfield asinterchangeable and Mr. Wong had been "brainwashed" into doing likewise. I infer from this that, although formally in a contractrelationship with Linfield's parent, GWA fully realised that it was providing services for Linfield's benefit and GWA knew that Linfieldwas relying on GWA to provide professional advice and services of the nature and scope stipulated in GWA's agreement with Sing Kee.</p>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a> In those circumstances, a "special relationship" in the sense explained in <strong>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. v. Heller &amp; Partners</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 465</a> existed between Linfield and GWA. Linfield was thus entitled to sue GWA for any breaches of the duty of reasonable care owed to Linfieldat common law by reason of such special relationship. The decision of the House of Lords in <strong>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 AC 398</a> (which did not involve a "special relationship" arising from direct reliance in the <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong> sense) does not militate against this conclusion. Linfield's legal rights against GWA are therefore not limited to such contractualrights of suit as Sing Kee may have assigned, but include Linfield's own right at common law. Following <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong>, this latter right of suit against GWA would allow recovery by Linfield for "pure economic loss".</p>    <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a> Second, <strong>Panatown</strong> suggests (without conclusively deciding) the possibility of a contractual right of action on the following "broad ground": WhereA contracts with B for B to provide services for C's benefit and B fails to provide such services to C, A may be able to sue B forsubstantial damages for loss of A's "performance interest". The measure of A's damages against B would be the cost to A of providingthe agreed services to C. See, for example, <strong>Panatown</strong> at 109b-113a (Lord Clyde); 143b-148j (Lord Jauncey); and 151b-f (Lord Browne-Wilkinson). There is an ongoing debate whether, to triggerthe broad ground, A should be obliged to provide C with what B undertook to provide or whether A must account to C for any damagesrecovered. But to the extent that the broad ground is valid, Sing Kee would have a cause of action against GWA in contract for substantialdamages. The damages would reflect the fact that Sing Kee's interest in GWA's performance was compromised by GWA's failure to renderthe promised services to Linfield. The legal assignment would have transferred to Linfield, Sing Kee's rights of suit under the broadground.</p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a> I can assume here that what was identified as the broad ground in <strong>Panatown</strong> is valid as a matter of law and that the assignment operated to transfer to Linfield a cause of action in connection with the lossof Sing Kee's performance interest. There is no need finally to decide the validity of the broad ground as a legal proposition. Thisis because, given my conclusion on the existence of a special relationship between Linfield and GWA, it does not matter whether Linfieldhas an additional right of suit under the broad ground. The scope of the GWA's duty to Sing Kee and the measure of damages recoverableunder the broad ground would not significantly differ from the scope of the common law duty of care. It also seems to me that onthe facts of the present case the measure of damages consequent upon a breach either duty would be similar, if not identical.</p>    <p class="heading">C. Scope of GWA's duties at common law and in contract</p>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a> Having decided that Linfield has title to sue, I consider the scope of GWA's duty. I begin by examining GWA's duty under the lawof tort.</p>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a> The starting point for defining the duty of care which GWA owed to Linfield as RSE must be a consideration of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123">Cap.123</a>) ("BO") and its subsidiary legislation as they stood at the time when GWA was engaged as a consultant. The role of RSE hasevolved since the mid-1990s. For the purposes of this action, the Court needs to establish what an RSE's duties were at the timeof GWA's engagement. In the analysis which follows I shall refer to the BO and its subsidiary legislation as they were at the timeof GWA's contract with Sing Kee.</p>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a> BO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> provided:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(1) Every person for whom building works ... are to be carried out shall appoint:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) an authorised person as the coordinator of such building works ...; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b) a registered structural engineer as a consultant to the authorised person on the structural elements of such building works orstreet works if so required under this Ordinance.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">....</p>        <p class="quote">(3) Any authorised person and any registered structural engineer appointed or nominated under subsection (1) ... shall:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) supervise the carrying out of the building works ... in the prescribed manner;</p>            <p class="quote">(b) notify the Building Authority of any contraventions of the regulations which would result from the carrying out of any work shownin any plan approved by the Building Authority in respect of the building works ...; and</p>            <p class="quote">(c) comply generally with this Ordinance.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4) A structural engineer may not be appointed as a consultant under subsection (1)(b) unless he is registered in the structural engineer'sregister."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is apparent from BO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4(1)(b)</a> that the RSE's responsibility was confined to the structural elements of relevant building works.</p>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A" class="autolink_findacts">Building (Administration) Regulations</a> ("B(A)R") <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12(2)</a> provided:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Subject to paragraph (3), all foundation plans, structural details and calculations required under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulations 8(1)(d)</a> and (i) and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a>(f)<sup><sup><a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123A/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">4</a></sup></sup> shall be prepared and signed by a registered structural engineer, and his signature shall be deemed to be his assumption of all responsibilityfor the plans, structural details or calculations, as the case may be.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote">This provision emphasised the point just made on an RSE's duty. An RSE did not become responsible for the entirety of plans submittedto the Building Authority but (apart from foundation plans which are not of concern here) only for the structural details of suchplans.</p>    <p><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a> Taken in isolation, cladding was at the time of Linfield's project regarded as a non-structural element of a building. The word "cladding",for example, was defined by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B" class="autolink_findacts">Building (Construction) Regulations</a> ("B(C)R") <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37</a> as "a facing or architectural decoration additional to the external walls of any building". Cladding, however, must be fixed or securedto the external walls of buildings. It is the fixing or interface between an external wall (a load bearing structure) and cladding(a load) that is of concern to the RSE. The RSE needs to ensure that the external wall and fixing are strong enough as structuresto bear the load of any cladding (including wind load transferred to the building through the cladding and its fixing system) withoutcollapsing. Thus, while cladding of itself may be of little interest to an RSE, the structural integrity of the system by which claddingis fixed to the wall of a building must be of concern to the RSE.</p>    <p><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a> That an RSE was responsible for fixing details of any plans relating to cladding submitted to the Building Authority was made clearfrom PNAP 59 (entitled "Cladding"). The May 1994 version of that note current at the time of GWA's engagement as RSE stated in Â§3:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where cladding is to be affixed to any building, details of the thickness, strength, durability, fixings and sequence of supportshould be submitted for approval by the Building Authority. Failure to do so may result in delay or refusal to grant an occupationpermit when the building is completed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>A contrast can be drawn with PNAP 59 as it now stands. The March 2003 version of PNAP 59 is wider in scope. In addition to provisionson fixtures and anchors for cladding, that practice note stipulates:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"6. Stone cladding is a natural material. The mechanical properties, physical properties and chemical properties can vary considerablybetween different types and grades of stones. Tests on stone cladding panels are required to be carried out to verify the characteristicstrengths adopted in the design and to form part of quality assurance during construction. The characteristic strengths shall benot less than three times that of the designed strengths used.</p>        <p class="quote">7. When stone cladding is to be used, the following tests are required to be carried out for each type of stone:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) flexural strength test of dimension stone to ASTM C880 - Standard Test Method for Flexural Strength of Dimension Stone or to BSEN12372 - Natural Stone Test Methods, Determinations of Flexural Strength under Concentrated Load or to other appropriate equivalentstandards; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b) strength test of individual stone anchorage to ASTM C135 - Standard Test Method for Strength of Individual Stone Anchorages inDimension Stone or to other appropriate equivalent standards.</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">8. As limestone is highly susceptible to acid rain and may deteriorate quickly when being used as exterior cladding material, in additionto paragraph 7 above, aged strength testing to simulate weathering due to extreme temperature change and extreme moisture contentchange should be carried out for limestone cladding to demonstrate that the residual flexural and anchorage capacities are not lessthan 80% of those obtained in the standard tests specified in paragraph 7. The aim of aged strength testing is to simulate the conditionsin which limestone panels are fully saturated and return to their driest conditions and to stimulate the critical temperature changesduring their intended design life.</p>        <p class="quote">9. At least 4 test specimens are selected at random from batches of stone delivered to site for each of the test specified in paragraphs7 and 8.</p>        <p class="quote">10. The test should be carried out by or under the direction and supervision of a testing agency independent of the supplier of thestone cladding. The test results should be certified by the testing agency, and endorsed by the authorized person or registered structuralengineer to confirm that the test results have reached the required characteristic strengths adopted in the design. No consent forthe commencement of the stone cladding works will be given until the test reports specified in paragraphs 7(a), 7(b) and 8 for eachtype and grade of stone, selected randomly either from the first batch of stone delivered to site or from the blocks of sones atthe quarry that are to be used on the proposed project, have been submitted and found to be satisfactory by the Building Authority."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In the intervening years between 1994 and 2003 the best practice expected of an RSE has evolved. The Building Authority's guidelineshave shifted from an RSE being only concerned with the integrity of a fixing system in 1994 to the RSE (or AP) now having to ensurethat stone panels destined for use as cladding are tested in relation to certain mechanical, physical and chemical properties.</p>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a> The RSE's responsibility for the structural elements of building works provides the key for analysing the scope of the RSE's dutyin relation to supervision.</p>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a> BO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4(3)</a> imposed a duty on the AP and RSE to "supervise". BO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a> additionally provided for the appointment of a registered contractor for the building works. According to BO <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9(3)</a>, the registered contractor so appointed shall:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(a) give continuous supervision to the carrying out of the building works ...;</p>        <p class="quote">(b) notify the Building Authority of any contravention of the regulations which would result from the carrying out of the work shownin any plan approved by the Building Authority in respect of the building works...; and</p>        <p class="quote">(c) comply generally with the provisions of this Ordinance".</p>    </blockquote>    <p>There is accordingly a "three-pronged approach" (using the terminology coined by GWA's counsel) to supervision under the BO. Thereis supervision by the AP, the RSE and the registered contractor. While there may be some overlap in the ambit of supervision by eachof the three, their several responsibilities are complementary.</p>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a> The RSE being responsible for structural elements, his duty of supervision must go towards ensuring that works relating to the structuralelements of a building are properly carried out. This was clear from B(A)R <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37(2)</a> which stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where a registered structural engineer has been appointed in respect of such works, the registered structural engineer shall be responsiblefor such periodical supervision of the structural works and shall make such inspections of the same as may be necessary to ensurethat they are being carried out in general accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance and regulations and with the plans approvedin respect thereof by the Building Authority and with any order made or condition imposed, pursuant to any provision fo the Ordinanceor regulations in that behalf, by the Building Authority."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a> Consequently, as RSE, GWA's role was to ensure that the concrete structure of the Property could transmit the loads imposed on thebuilding properly and safely to the ground. That would involve GWA first examining the design of Houses 1 to 6 and satisfying itselfas to structural details of that design, including satisfying itself that structural walls and fixings were of adequate thicknessor strength to withstand designated loads. In addition, GWA was statutorily obliged to exercise all reasonable care through supervisionto ensure that the structural elements of the relevant works were built in accordance with approved plans.</p>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a> Ms. Cheng SC for Linfield submits that the above analysis should be carried further. She refers to B(A)R s.18A which provided:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Where plans of any building works ... are submitted to the Building Authority for his approval there shall be submitted, togetherwith the plans, a certificate, which shall be in the specified form, by the authorised person or by the registered structural engineer,as the case may be, who prepared the plans or under whose supervision the plans were prepared, that:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) the plans were prepared by him or under his supervision or direction; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b) to the best of his knowledge and belief the plans comply in all respects with the Ordinance and the regulations made thereunder."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Ms. Cheng says that, since GWA signed its name on MML's drawings and calculations for the stone cladding to be used at the Property,it follows from B(A)R <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.12(2)</a> and 18A that GWA assumed full responsibility for every detail in MML's design and calculations.</p>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a> If Ms. Cheng means that, by checking and approving MML's drawings, GWA guaranteed that the same were free from error, I think thather submission goes too far. For example, the reference in B(A)R s.18A to the plans complying with the BO and its subsidiary regulationsto the best of an RSE's "knowledge and belief" points to the real issue being whether in checking and approving a set of plans anRSE has taken all reasonable care to satisfy himself that the plans and drawings submitted are proper and adequate. One asks: "Properand adequate in respect of what aspects?" The answer must be guided by the analysis just carried out: "Proper and adequate in respectof the structural details depicted on such plans, such structural details being the province of the RSE under the BO". In other words,the question is whether the RSE has taken all reasonable care to see that the structural details contained in drawings checked andapproved by him will result in the construction of a structurally safe building, rather than one which would constitute a structuralhazard.</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a> In contrast, GWA's counsel would limit GWA's common law duty owed as RSE to Linfield to ensuring that no physical damage (as opposedto pure economic loss) is caused to a person (including a property owner) as a result of structural weakness in a building. GWA'scounsel argue that Linfield has no tortious claim against GWA either for the costs incurred in putting right structural defects inthe Property or for any other form of pure economic loss (such as loss of rental).</p>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a> If the situation were that of a third party who suffered economic loss as a result (say) of a structure collapsing and preventingthe 3rd party from conducting some profitable business, I would be prepared to accept on the basis of <strong>Murphy v. Brentwood</strong> that the 3rd party has no claim for pure economic loss. But where (to the knowledge of GWA) Linfield has relied on GWA's due performanceof its duties as RSE, <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong> constrains me to hold that Linfield may recover for pure economic loss and not merely economic loss consequential upon physical damage.Accordingly, I do not think that GWA's common law duty was as limited as GWA's counsel contend.</p>    <p><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a> Consider now Linfield's contractual rights against GWA in consequence of Sing Kee's legal assignment. This can be dealt with shortly.As I have already said, it does not seem to that there should be a substantial difference between Linfield asserting a right at commonlaw and Linfield suing for damage to Sing Kee's performance interest under the relevant contract. By cl.1 of its contract with SingKee, GWA agreed to perform the work of an RSE as set out in the BO. This is precisely the duty owed to Linfield at common law discussedabove. If Linfield fail to establish a breach of GWA's common law duty, it follows that it will also fail in respect of any assignedcontractual rights.</p>    <p><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a> I now examine whether GWA has breached its obligations as RSE for the project.</p>    <p class="heading">D. Linfield's claims against GWA</p>    <p><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a> Linfield's complaints against GWA can be broken down into 3 broad areas:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Failure to advise Linfield in relation to the inadequacies of MML's design of the stone cladding system.</p>        <p>(2) Failure properly to supervise the concrete and cladding works for Houses 1 to 6.</p>        <p>(3) Miscellaneous criticisms such as the failure to advise on the inclusion of a movement joint in the podium.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I begin by discussing the first 2 areas of complaint in general terms. I shall then comment on the specific Particulars of Claim allegedagainst GWA in the Schedule to the Amended Statement of Claim. In that section, I shall deal with the miscellaneous criticisms whichI have classified as Linfield's third broad area of complaint.</p>    <p class="heading">D.1 Choice of stone and design of the stone cladding system</p>    <p><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a> GWA played no role in the choice of Poiseul B5. GWA was not invited to France, was not invited to visit the various properties employinglimestone cladding which Mr. Lu inspected before selecting Poiseul B5, and was not sent details of the types of stone under considerationby Linfield until after the Poiseul B5 had been purchased and cut and a first shipment despatched to Hong Kong. I do not think thatGWA can be blamed for the selection of Poiseul B5.</p>    <p><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a> After the Poiseul B5 was chosen for the Property's stone cladding, it was noted at a stone work meeting on 17 July 1996 (attendedby Mr. Behrouzi for GWA) that MML would prepare calculations and drawings for the stone cladding fixings. This confirmed what hadpreviously been decided by Linfield (in the absence of GWA) on 21 June 1996 even before the Poiseul B5 had been chosen. GWA did notreceive the calculations until around September 1996. Up to that point, I do not see how GWA can be faulted in connection with thechoice of stone.</p>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a> Linfield can realistically only criticise GWA for approving MML's calculations and drawings, instead of querying or rejecting thesame. Linfield's complaints thus focus on GWA's failure to do one or more of the following when reviewing MML's calculations:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Insist that samples of the Poiseul B5 supplied be taken and tested to determine the stone's physical properties, in particularits flexural and shear strengths;</p>        <p>(2) Question MML's use of an FOS (based on mean strength) of 3 instead of 6; and,</p>        <p>(3) Reject MML's design as "not buildable" in practice.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a> On testing, it seems to me that GWA were entitled to rely on the data provided with MML's calculations. As appears from the initialsheet thereof, MML's calculations were predicated on allowable bending and shear stresses of 4.50 N/mm<sup>2</sup> and 0.90 N/mm<sup>2</sup> respectively. The calculations posit an FOS of 3. This means that MML's design was premised on the use of stone with flexural strengthof 13.50 N/mm<sup>2</sup> (4.50 N/mm<sup>2</sup> x 3) and shear strength of 2.70 N/mm<sup>2</sup>(0.90 N/mm<sup>2</sup> x 3). I do not think that GWA was obliged to require or initiate independent laboratory tests verifying such flexural and shear strengthswhen reviewing MML's calculations.</p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a> I accept here the evidence of Mr. Watkins, GWA's expert. Mr. Watkins pointed out that the calculations were being checked in advanceof construction. GWA could assume that there had been or would be quality control tests by MML to ensure that stone of the characteristicsstipulated in the calculations was actually delivered. Mr. Watkins accepted that, if the figures in the calculations struck an RSEas obviously wrong, he ought to raise queries. But Mr. Watkins believed that the data in MML's calculations appeared to be of thecorrect order of magnitude.</p>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a> Mr. Fred Ng, Linfield's expert, suggested that MML's data was so obviously wrong that alarm bells should have rung with GWA. ButMr. Fred Ng could not substantiate this point. He could not articulate why a flexural strength of 13.50 N/mm<sup>2</sup> was out of line with normal expectation. Indeed, Linfield's own evidence from Mr. Hartog shows that there are French limestones whichexhibit flexural strengths of the magnitude identified in MML's drawings.</p>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a> I think that it was reasonable as a matter of practice at the time and within the terms of the then PNAP 59 for an RSE to take asgiven such data supplied by a sub-contractor (especially a specialist stone cladding sub-contractor such as MML). This conclusionis reinforced by reference to Technical Specification cl.6.5.4.1. That provision imposed a duty of testing the stone to be used onMML. I do not think that it was incumbent on GWA, in the absence of any indication that MML had plucked figures out of thin air,to suspect that MML's data was erroneous or other than the results of testing. GWA's role was not to act as a guarantor of the performanceby MML of every one of its obligations under the Technical Specification.</p>    <p><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a> Even if I am wrong in this, I do not see that Linfield's case would be assisted on the facts. There would still be a problem of causation.</p>    <p><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a> Ms. Cheng says that, if (instead of approving MML's calculations) GWA had caused tests of Poiseul B5 to be carried out, GWA wouldhave discovered that the flexural strength of Poiseul B5 was substantially below 13.50 N/mm<sup>2</sup> Given that panel thickness is a function of the flexural strength of the stone used, GWA (Ms. Cheng says) ought then to have realisedthat the MML's design stone panel thickness of 30 mm was inadequate.</p>    <p><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a> But when the Building Authority requested, in connection with the application for approval of the fixing details of the claddingto House 6, that the flexural strength of 13.50 N/mm<sup>2</sup> be supported by laboratory test results, samples of Poiseul B5 were in fact tested<sup><sup>5</sup></sup>. The tests showed a mean flexural strength of 7.60 N/mm<sup>2</sup>. That is a lower figure than 13.50 N/mm<sup>2</sup>. Nonetheless, if that lower figure were plugged into MML's calculations, the stone panel thickness of 30 mm would still be valid.</p>    <p><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a> Tests were therefore actually carried out and those tests did not falsify the calculations in relation to stone panel thickness.The cladding of House 6 continued on the basis of 30 mm thick stone panels and, unsurprisingly, no one saw a need to revise the alreadyapproved calculations for the fixing details of Houses 1 to 5.</p>    <p><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a> It is consequently difficult to see how (even if valid) Linfield's criticism of any failure by GWA to insist on tests in or aboutSeptember 1996 can have been causative of loss to Linfield. If tests had been taken, they could well have produced results such asthose generated by Testconsult and matters would most likely have proceeded as they in fact did.</p>    <p><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a> Ms. Cheng has argued that the tests by Testconsult were inadequate. For example, she suggests that too few samples were tested andcontends that something akin to the BRE tests which formed the basis of the 2nd AFE Report should have been conducted. Thus, a largernumber of stone panel samples divided into Type I, II and III categories depending on the presence of stylolites ought to have beentested.</p>    <p><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a> Ms. Cheng's submission seems to me to be one made with the benefit of hindsight. No cogent expert evidence was adduced to explainrigorously why the Testconsult results were flawed. For example, by way of comparison even the current PNAP 59 only refers to thetaking of 4 test specimens. Nothing is said in PNAP 59 about division into Types I, II and III panels. Corived admittedly testedmore samples (10) than Testconsult, but even Corived did not divide the samples into Type I, II and III specimens. Why then was itunreasonable for GWA to be satisfied with the Testconsult results and not require a much grander experiment to be conducted? Further,I seriously doubt the practicality of Ms. Cheng's suggestion. In September 1996, when it was recognised as vital that the approvalof the Building Authority to the fixing details be obtained as soon as possible, would it have been possible for GWA to insist onfull-blown sampling and testing of the nature conducted by BRE for the 2nd AFE Report, when only the first consignment of stone foruse on the project had just been despatched from France in August 1996?</p>    <p><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a> Ms. Cheng submits that MML's calculations dealt inadequately with shearing failure at the dowel pins. Had MML examined that modeof failure more conscientiously, it would have found that its design was inadequate. Proper consideration of shearing failure atthe dowel pin would have meant conducting tests similar to those undertaken by Mr. H. K. Ng (another of Linfield's experts) and analysedin his report. That report shows (according to Ms. Cheng) that in terms of shear strength at the dowel pins a significant numberof stone panels would have not have met the criterion of an FOS of 6 (based on mean strength). Ms. Cheng says that GWA should havefocused on this when reviewing MML's design and calculations.</p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a> On shear strength at the dowel pins, GWA's counsel refer to Mr. H. K. Ng's cross-examination wherein he acknowledged that his testsdid not measure actual shear strength. Given Mr. Watkins' evidence (which I accept) that, based on the Corived test results for compressivestrength and modulus of rupture, the mean shear strength of the Poiseul B5 panels should be in the order of 6.0 MPa (or a characteristicvalue of about 3.0 MPa), Mr. H. K. Ng's "shear strength" of 1.445 MPa is most likely understated. It follows, since Mr. H. K. Ng'sanalysis of the FOS for individual panels depends on the shear strength figure used in calculation, that the various FOS derivedby him for specific stone panels are likely to be lower than the FOS which one obtains if actual shear strength of Poiseul B5 hadbeen used in one's equations. I do not think that it is logically an answer to this to assert (as Ms. Cheng does) that, whether ornot Mr. H. K. Ng's "shear strength" represents actuality, Mr. H. K. Ng calculated his "shear strength" using the same assumptionsas those MML made. In my view, the most that can be said of Mr. H. K. Ng's evidence is that it is inconclusive as a critique of MML'sdesign.</p>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a> More generally on FOS, I am unable to conclude that GWA acted negligently or unreasonably in accepting an FOS of 3.

Essentially, Linfield complains that GWA approved MML'sdrawings when GWA ought to have realised that the design required such precision of workmanship that in practical terms few (if any)contractors could comply with it. Linfield stops short of saying that the design was impossible to build. Linfield merely says thatthe assumptions listed in Section II.J of this Judgment were unrealistic and impractical ones to make. GWA (Linfield contends) oughtto have realised that MML was likely to make a mess of it (as MML in fact did).</p>    <p><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a> I do not see how it formed any part of GWA's duty as RSE to advance a view as to the likelihood or otherwise of a specialist stonecontractor such as MML being able to erect cladding in accordance with its design. Matters might have been different if the structuraldesign was an obvious physical impossibility, but that is not the case here. As Ms. Cheng accepts, MML's design was physically possible.It was only that the drawings gave little room for error. But, if MML had contractually undertaken to perform work to such degreeof precision, it was not GWA's role to say in September 1996 that MML could not conceivably deliver what it had undertaken. If MML'sworkmanship fell below the requisite mark, that would be MML's fault, not GWA's.</p>    <p><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a> Moreover, I believe that there is a logical difficulty with Linfield's argument. Assume that MML's design had been more tolerantof error. Even then a contractor could still cut corners in foreseeable ways. There could still be rebates carved on the backs ofstone panels, careless drilling of holes into stone panels, botched applications of epoxy and thousands of other anomalies, justbecause a contractor is under time pressure and cannot be bothered to make the effort to get things right.</p>    <p><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a> If Linfield is correct, GWA would have to anticipate likely defaults on the part of a particular contractor and insist that MML re-designto rule out the possibility of such carelessness. Where would the process stop? Any design can be bungled and bungled in a myriadof foreseeable ways. When would an RSE be able to say "enough is enough" and a design is "practically buildable" in the sense ofhaving minimal prospect of being bungled by even an inept contractor? It seems to me that the way in which an employer best guardsagainst shoddy building work is by selecting a reputable contractor capable of executing the requisite design. The process is notthe other way around. It is not the role of an RSE to ensure that a design is capable of being executed by a particular contractor.</p>    <p class="heading">D.2 Supervision</p>    <p><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a> Linfield's criticism of GWA for lack of proper supervision concerns 2 general areas:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Supervision of concrete works, in particular the failure to ensure that:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) hacked off areas were properly treated so that adequate concrete cover was restored; and,</p>            <p>(b) exposed reinforcement bars in the Property's concrete walls were properly repaired; and,</p>        </blockquote>        <p>(2) Supervision of the putting up of the cladding system.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In essence Linfield argues that had GWA supervised properly, hacking off would not have had to be so extensive, reinforcement barsshould not have been exposed, and MML's many workmanship defects would have been corrected at a much earlier stage. Therefore, thefact that significant hacking off had to be done, that reinforcement bars were exposed and left unremedied, and that the claddingput up by MML had many defects, shows (Linfield reasons) that on the balance of probability GWA was not properly supervising thestructural works at the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a> On hacking off and exposed rebars, I accept Mr. Watkins' evidence of the practice commonly followed in Hong Kong.

Mr. Fred Ng does not complain about there having been hacking. To haveexpected perfect alignment of concrete walls would have been (in his opinion) a Utopian scenario. Instead Mr. Fred Ng says that GWAshould have increased supervision if and when it noticed that there were problems. He faults GWA because he does not perceive anyincreased level of supervision. It is unclear how increased supervision by the RSE in unspecified circumstances could have led toany different outcome. Indeed, it is unclear precisely what level of "increased" supervision (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.) is envisaged.</p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a> In any event, Mr. Fred Ng's opinion appears to me to be divorced from any factual context. What specific problems did he have inmind which ought to have led to "increased" supervision by GWA? In answer Mr. Ng repeatedly referred to "the problem with the windows".But he never spelled out on what basis GWA was responsible as RSE for the windows of the Property<sup>6</sup>. At the end, Mr. Ng's view is no more than a vague statement of general principle. That cannot take analysis far. Without more specificobservations from Mr. Fred Ng as to how GWA failed to observe the good practice of an RSE in the actual situation in which GWA founditself, I am unable to say that GWA failed to act as a reasonably professional RSE in the way it actually supervised the concreteworks.</p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a> I would make 4 more general observations on the concrete work at the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a> First, as GWA's counsel are at pains to stress, GWA's supervision does not guarantee a result. It does not guarantee that the Property'swalls, once constructed, will be structurally adequate. Even conscientious periodic supervision may fail to spot defects in the workof an incompetent concrete works contractor. What is significant in this case is that no one has suggested that the concrete wallsof the Property are structurally unsound. On that basis alone, Linfield must face an uphill task in making out a case that GWA wasnegligent in its periodic supervision of the concrete works and caused loss as a result.</p>    <p><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a> Second, the real problem appears not to have been hacking off of concrete. A method statement was prepared to deal with that particularproblem and PCL was specifically reminded by GWA of the need for 2 inspections of remedial work to hacked off areas where concretecover had to be restored. The real difficulty was where hacking off led to the exposure of reinforcement bars.</p>    <p><a name="p242" class="para" id="p242">242.</a> Although previously there may have been instances of exposed reinforcement bar (possibly, for example, in November 1996, in the gardenwall area), these were isolated incidents and had been remedied. It was only during inspections in late October and early November1997 that it was noticed that there were exposed reinforcement bars beyond those treated in the past.</p>    <p><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a> The extent of the problem of exposed reinforcement bars at the time of its discovery in late 1997 and thereafter, is unclear. Theevidence suggests that the problem, although it existed, was not widespread. Thus, the photographs of exposed rebars in the trialbundle are few. It is known that a total of 584 m<sup>2</sup> of concrete was repaired as part of the remedial work by Pat Davie. That 584 m<sup>2</sup> comprises areas of spalling, hollowness, insufficient cover, rough concrete and exposed rebar. There is no breakdown of the areasof each of the latter concreting defects. Nonetheless, considered in conjunction with the photographs, the area of exposed rebarcould not have been so great.</p>    <p><a name="p244" class="para" id="p244">244.</a> Whatever the extent of exposed rebars, Linfield says that periodic supervision ought to have picked up the fact that there was exposedrebar behind the cladding being put by MML. I do not think that would have been the case.</p>    <p><a name="p245" class="para" id="p245">245.</a> In my judgment, the exposed reinforcement bars detected in October and November 1997 were symptomatic of the pressure PCL and MMLwere facing from September 1997 onwards to complete the erection of the cladding in time for the OP inspection. As a result of thatpressure, hacking off was hurriedly done by PCL, exposing reinforcement bars on occasion. Once hacked off, an area would straightawaybe handed over to MML. MML, although fully aware (as mentioned above) of the presence of exposed reinforcement bars, did not insiston the relevant areas being properly treated with cement mortar, but simply proceeded to put up stone panels. MML did not regardthe treatment of the exposed rebars as its responsibility. In such circumstances, it is difficult to see how periodic supervision,no matter how conscientious, would necessarily have detected the areas of exposed rebar unless GWA happened to come by just beforeMML covered up the relevant part of the concrete wall. Once a stone panel was put up, the area behind it would not be visible andany exposed rebar there could easily escape detection.</p>    <p><a name="p246" class="para" id="p246">246.</a> Third, Linfield criticises GWA for failing to obtain from PCL a complete set of photographs evidencing all repair work done to exposedrebars since the discovery of the problem in October and November 1997. Why (Linfield asks) did GWA not press for the photographs?</p>    <p><a name="p247" class="para" id="p247">247.</a> But GWA made it clear at Site Meeting No.54 on 17 December 1997 with (among others) PCL, TDA, MML and Mr. Lu present that a completeset of photographs had not been provided and, as far as GWA was concerned, repair mortar had not been sufficiently applied to Houses1 to 5<sup>7</sup>. GWA then pointed out that (in contrast to what Mr. Watkins said was the usual practice in Hong Kong) the contractor had only informedGWA of hacking and repairs "half way through the process". GWA further mentioned the consequences of "future water leakage or ruststaining" if repairs were not now effected to concrete areas already covered by stone panelling. It therefore seems that, far fromshirking responsibilities, GWA gave a full report and warning to Linfield of the defects in PCL's concrete works, including exposedreinforcement bars.</p>    <p><a name="p248" class="para" id="p248">248.</a> At the meeting on 17 December 1997 Mr. Lu could not have been under any illusions as to the problem. That he was fully aware of theexistence of exposed rebars and the risk posed by them is in any event shown by a letter dated 4 December 1997. There Mr. Lu wroteto PCL:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"You and your staff always promise to finish certain work 'by tomorrow'. I am tired of hearing the same empty statement. I saw manyphotos of the concrete walls with rusty steel bars on the surface. I will hold you fully accountable for any water leakage and damageto the stonework caused by such poor workmanship in the future. The site is like a garbage dump with rats running around. This isintol[e]rable."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p249" class="para" id="p249">249.</a> Fourth, complaint is made about the existence of honeycombing, embedded timber and unplugged anchor and bolt holes in the concrete.On honeycombing and embedded timber, these do not seem to have been prevalent. I doubt that even increased supervision would necessarilyhave picked them up. Similarly, there may have been instances of unfilled and unplugged tie-bolt holes. It is unclear how extensivethe this problem was. Mr. Hartog only cited one instance to his knowledge. I do not think that isolated examples support a conclusionthat GWA's supervision of concrete works was inadequate or negligent. As to unused anchor holes left unplugged on concrete walls,again I do not think that proper supervision would necessarily have noticed this. A replacement anchor hole would be drilled nextto a rejected one and a stone panel would be fixed over the rejected bolt hole as soon as the replacement anchor position was ready.A supervisor, unless present just before an unplugged hole was covered by a stone panel, would not spot the anomaly.</p>    <p><a name="p250" class="para" id="p250">250.</a> In summary, in light of the 4 observations just made and given that Linfield's own expert advances no substantive criticism in relationto exposed rebars and does not condescend to particulars as to when or how GWA failed to supervise sufficiently in accordance withthe good practice expected of an RSE, I am unable conclude that GWA acted unreasonably or negligently in the discharge of its dutiesas RSE.</p>    <p><a name="p251" class="para" id="p251">251.</a> I now more briefly consider supervision in relation to the erection of cladding generally. Linfield says that GWA was responsiblefor supervision of the installation of the stone panels.</p>    <p><a name="p252" class="para" id="p252">252.</a> Linfield's counsel point to the condition in the Building Authority's approvals of the fixing details for the cladding systems toHouses 1 to 6 that "qualified site supervision" be provided. More precisely, the condition typically imposed was as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Qualified site supervision of the cladding works including fabrication, erection and examination of the structural elements/ fixings,by an experienced and competent person, should be provided to ensure that the works are carried out in accordance with the plansapproved and that the required standards are complied with."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p253" class="para" id="p253">253.</a> There is a debate between Linfield and GWA as to whether "qualified site supervision" had to be provided by GWA or whether it wasenough to comply with the condition for there to be supervision by (say) a clerk of works or a resident architect. I do not thinkthat I need to decide that dispute conclusively. The condition relates to "structural elements/fixings" and GWA accepts that, independentlyof the condition imposed by the Building Authority, GWA had a duty as RSE under the BO to engage in periodic supervision of the erectionof structural elements (including fixings).</p>    <p><a name="p254" class="para" id="p254">254.</a> In their closing submissions, Linfield's counsel initially focus on 3 complaints in relation to the stone cladding system. Havingdiscussed those matters, Linfield's submissions then list out other specific breaches. I shall make observations in this sectionon the 3 initial criticisms made. I consider the specific breaches alleged in the next section of this Judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p255" class="para" id="p255">255.</a> First, Linfield's counsel argue that GWA failed to ensure through supervision that the concrete surfaces of the Property's externalwalls were flat so that angle brackets could lie squarely on them without the use of shims (which were not provided for in MML'sdrawings). This is in essence a criticism relating to the hacking off of concrete to enable stone panels to be properly aligned.I have dealt with this above.</p>    <p><a name="p256" class="para" id="p256">256.</a> Second, Linfield's counsel refer to the employment of undersized angle brackets. Linfield's counsel say, following Mr. Hartog, thatthere were numerous undersized angle brackets spread around the site. But "numerous" is imprecise and impressionistic. There arebetween 8,000 and 10,000 angle brackets per house on the Property. What is "numerous" may therefore still only be a small proportionsof the large number of angle brackets used on site. I do not think that I can deduce anything in relation to GWA's discharge of itsduty of supervision from Mr. Hartog's general remark.</p>    <p><a name="p257" class="para" id="p257">257.</a> Third, Linfield's counsel criticise GWA for failing to ensure through supervision that dowel pins were vertically inserted into thepin holes of stone panels. On this I agree with GWA's counsel that the complaint relates to MML's workmanship and not to a matterof structural detail for which GWA had responsibility.</p>    <p><a name="p258" class="para" id="p258">258.</a> Before moving on to deal with specific breaches alleged by Linfield, by way of a general comment, I should state my view that, justas I cannot find fault with GWA's supervision of concrete works, it seems to me that no complaint against GWA in relation to thesupervision of the fixing of the cladding to the Property can be substantiated. I reject Linfield's submission that GWA as RSE wasresponsible for supervising the fabrication or cutting of the stone panels, the drilling of holes into the same or the selectionof particular panels for use as cladding.</p>    <p class="heading">D.3 Specific breaches <sup>8</sup></p>    <p class="heading">(1) Failure to advise on the appointment of a specialist consultant [B2.1]</p>    <p><a name="p259" class="para" id="p259">259.</a> I do not think that GWA had a duty to advise on the engagement of a specialist structural engineer in the circumstances of this case.In approving MML's calculations, I do not believe that GWA fell below the standard of competence required of an RSE. The task ofreviewing MML's calculations was not beyond GWA's competence.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Inadequate FOS of 3 [B2.2-2.4]</p>    <p><a name="p260" class="para" id="p260">260.</a> This has been discussed above.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) Thermal movement and installation tolerances [B2.5]</p>    <p><a name="p261" class="para" id="p261">261.</a> Linfield suggests that GWA ought to have noticed that MML's design did not allow for thermal movement and should have rejected thedesign on this basis.</p>    <p><a name="p262" class="para" id="p262">262.</a> This complaint goes towards the "buildability" of MML's design. For the reasons discussed above, I do not think that designing forbuildability (whether in terms of thermal movement or otherwise) formed part of GWA's responsibility for structural detail. But,even if that last view is wrong, for the reasons given below, the breach would still not be made out.</p>    <p><a name="p263" class="para" id="p263">263.</a> This complaint appears to relate to 3 matters:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) MML's use of epoxy to fix dowel pins in their designated holes in a stone panel.</p>        <p>(2) MML's failure to use plastic cushions in between stone panels.</p>        <p>(3) MML's failure to provide for sufficient space between stone panels to allow for lateral expansion of the stone.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I do not think that any of the 3 matters form a basis for faulting GWA.</p>    <p><a name="p264" class="para" id="p264">264.</a> On the first matter, a difficulty with using epoxy to fix a pin in a hole is that the epoxy might then hold the stone panel so rigidlyin place as to hinder thermal movement. Mr. Hartog suggested that it would have been better to hold stone panels in place throughthe use of dowel pins inserted into nylon sleeves. But, as Mr. Manzoni has submitted, the evidence suggests that MML's proposed methodof fixing was commonly used in Hong Kong at the time. It may not be the best method and a nylon sleeve may have been a superior alternative,but the material before me does not go so far as to suggest that an epoxy fitting was a negligent design at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p265" class="para" id="p265">265.</a> On the second matter, Technical Specification cl.6.5.13 provided for the use of plastic cushions between stone panels. MML simplydid not install these. Had the Technical Specification been followed there ought to have been sufficient room to cater for thermalexpansion between stones. I do not think that GWA can be liable for not rejecting a design which could well have been adequate hadplastic cushions been placed as stipulated in the Technical Specification.</p>    <p><a name="p266" class="para" id="p266">266.</a> On the third matter, there may be substance in Mr. Watkins' tentative suggestion that, from an engineering perspective, thermal movementis more likely to cause bowing of a stone panel rather than outward expansion at its edges. Indeed, if there were thermal movement,Mr. Watkins believed that it would be a "very small part of a millimetre". Mr. Hartog stressed a need to design for thermal expansion.But Mr. Hartog being an architect rather than an engineer, I am far from certain that in light of the Technical Specification MML'sdesign was negligent.</p>    <p class="heading">(4) Failure to make allowance in the design for predictable planes of weakness in angled limestone panels [B2.6]</p>    <p><a name="p267" class="para" id="p267">267.</a> This allegation goes towards the choice of stone for angled panels. Poor choice of stone led to cracking of corner panels. I do notthink that the choice of particular stone panels for use in the cladding was within GWA's sphere of responsibility.</p>    <p class="heading">(5) Failure to select appropriate type of material -- Poiseul B5 thin veneer not suitable for Hong Kong [B2.7]</p>    <p><a name="p268" class="para" id="p268">268.</a> This has been discussed above.</p>    <p class="heading">(6) Lack of buildability of the dowel pins as the fixing mechanism [B2.10]</p>    <p><a name="p269" class="para" id="p269">269.</a> See above on buildability and the use of epoxy rather than nylon sleeves to fix dowel pins in stone panel holes.</p>    <p class="heading">(7) Design not permitting non-destructive replacement of stone panels [B2.11]</p>    <p><a name="p270" class="para" id="p270">270.</a> I do not think that this was within GWA's responsibility. It does not relate to structure. MML's fixing system was one in commonuse in Hong Kong. In the circumstances here, GWA cannot be blamed for approving a commonly-used design. The evidence in any eventsuggests that in any given area of cladding some (but perhaps not all) panels could be removed without destruction.</p>    <p class="heading">(8) Failure to provide sufficient concrete cover to reinforcement bars [C1.1]</p>    <p><a name="p271" class="para" id="p271">271.</a> See the discussion on exposed rebars above.</p>    <p class="heading">(9) Failure to construct and remove concrete formwork properly, resulting in formwork timber being left embedded in the concrete ofthe structure [C1.2]</p>    <p><a name="p272" class="para" id="p272">272.</a> This does not appear to have been prevalent. I do not think that the allegation is sufficient of itself to suggest negligence ofsupervision on GWA's part. In any event, the evidence is to the contrary. There were repeated warnings by Mr. Pisano to PCL aboutthe poor quality of the latter's concrete formwork.</p>    <p class="heading">(10) Failure to make good unused anchor bolt holes [C1.4]</p>    <p><a name="p273" class="para" id="p273">273.</a> See the discussion above.</p>    <p class="heading">(11) Failure to protect steel reinforcement bars which were exposed along the top edges of the concrete balustrade and parapet walls[C1.5]</p>    <p><a name="p274" class="para" id="p274">274.</a> See the discussion on exposed rebars above.</p>    <p class="heading">(12) Failure to properly construct the window openings, resulting in openings being widened by jack hammering, exposing reinforcementand failure to reinstate the structure surrounding the window openings following jack hammering [C1.6 and 1.7]</p>    <p><a name="p275" class="para" id="p275">275.</a> I do not believe that the setting out of windows formed part of GWA's responsibilities.

Essentially, it is suggestedin this particular that GWA should have anticipated that MML would cut corners by using epoxy to glue together broken stones or byusing foreign material (for instance, washers, newspapers, timber) rather than plastic cushions in the areas between stone panels.For the reasons already given, I do not think the criticism is tenable.</p>    <p class="heading">(18) Angle bracket fixings and pins rigidly grouted into slots leading to 'pop-out' fractures [C2.8]</p>    <p><a name="p281" class="para" id="p281">281.</a> See the sections above on buildability and the use of epoxy rather than nylon sleeves to fix dowel pins in stone panel holes.</p>    <p class="heading">(19) Failure to design adequately and install angle bracket facings in plane resulting in asymmetrical contact between the stone edgesand brackets [C2.9]</p>    <p><a name="p282" class="para" id="p282">282.</a> This concerns buildability and design assumptions.

Liability of BHP and PCL for contribution</p>    <p><a name="p288" class="para" id="p288">288.</a> Given my conclusion in relation in GWA's case, it is unnecessary to decide whether BHP or PCL are liable to make contribution. Thecontributory proceedings should therefore be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p289" class="para" id="p289">289.</a> It is tempting, given the evidence which the Court has heard, to determine the question of the liability of BHP and PCL to make contributionin the event that I am wrong in holding that GWA has not been in breach. But I think that such course would be undesirable sincethere are ongoing arbitration proceedings wherein Linfield's claims against BHP and PCL have yet to be adjudicated. In such circumstance,it would be better if I said as little as possible on whether (in my view) BHP and PCL would be liable to Linfield to make contributionin respect of "the same damage" if I had found GWA to have been in the wrong. In finding that GWA is not liable and in dismissingthe contributory proceedings brought by GWA and BHP to cover the contingency of their being found liable, I should not be taken tohave in any way decided whether BHP or PCL have breached any contractual or common law duty owed to Linfield.</p>    <p class="heading">F. Linfield's damages against MML</p>    <p><a name="p290" class="para" id="p290">290.</a> That leaves the question of the quantum of Linfield's damages against MML. Linfield claims $42,139,629 ("Sum A") against MML. SumA represents loss of rental said to have been incurred in consequence MML's defective stone cladding before, during and after theperiod of remedial work to Houses 1 to 6. Linfield also claims various sums representing the cost of remedial work. Those sums includethe amount of $23,478,547.44 ("Sum B"), the total adjusted cost (for example, net of the cost of granite) of replacing external limestonecladding with granite</p>    <p><a name="p291" class="para" id="p291">291.</a> On loss of rental, Linfield relies on the evidence of Mr. C. K. Lau. Mr. Lau breaks down loss of rental into 3 periods: before repairfrom September 1999 to November 2000 ($4,771,955), during repair from December 2000 to April 2002 ($21,920,083) and during a periodof marketing following repair ($15,447,592). Although I accept that lost rent due to Houses 1 to 6 being out of the market duringrepair work was probably a foreseeable head of contractual damage at the time of MML's entry into its Warranty to Linfield, in myjudgment Linfield's claim in this respect is over-inflated.</p>    <p><a name="p292" class="para" id="p292">292.</a> Thus, for instance, by all accounts the rental market for luxury properties between 1998 and 2000 was a difficult one. The Courtmust be careful not to attribute to MML's breach the effects of the Asian financial crisis and the dramatic fall in demand for deluxeunits such as Houses 1 to 6. Mr. Lau's model does not take sufficient account of the real possibility that, even if there had beenno need for remedial work on the Property, one or more Houses would not have found tenants in any case.</p>    <p><a name="p293" class="para" id="p293">293.</a> Further, Mr. Kong stated in Court that remedial work was prolonged by some 6 months due to problems with the contractor. Accordingto Mr. Kong, repairs might also have begun a little earlier. The scheduled repair period for Houses 1 to 5 was 7 months and 4 monthsconcurrently for House 6. In the event the period of remedial works ran for some 17 months for Houses 1 to 5 and 7 months for House6. The delay in the remedial works cannot be attributed to MML. Linfield would instead have a claim in liquidated damages in respectof such delay.</p>    <p><a name="p294" class="para" id="p294">294.</a> Given the above considerations, I prefer the evidence of Mr. Williams. He gave evidence for BHP, but was cross-examined by Ms. Cheng.His evidence was adopted by GWA. In my view, Mr. Williams convincingly argues that, Houses 1 to 6 having been re-marketed as newafter their repair, the inability of the units to fetch high rents is symptomatic of prevailing market conditions, not the resultof stigma attaching to the Property by reason of the repairs. Mr. Williams notes that the potential tenants for Houses 1 to 6 declinedsignificantly post-1997 as a result of less generous corporate rental allowances.</p>    <p><a name="p295" class="para" id="p295">295.</a> Mr. Williams ventured 3 alternative scenarios to take account of his views. Those scenarios also factor in the longer time takenfor the remedial works. GWA's counsel pressed the virtues of scenario 1 upon me. This assumed that Houses 2 and 3 continued vacantafter repair due to market conditions. On this scenario, lost rent would be about $10.86 million. Mr. Williams himself preferredscenario 2 which produces a loss in rental of $15.9 million as the most realistic scenario. In light of that evidence, I should alsochoose scenario 2 as the best estimate of Linfield's likely lost rental due to MML's breach. I accordingly award $15.9 million underthis head instead of Sum A.</p>    <p><a name="p296" class="para" id="p296">296.</a> As for cost of repair, I accept that it made sense to replace the entire cladding system, rather than simply repair defective limestonestone panels. I come to this conclusion because of the prevalence of MML's defective workmanship throughout Houses 1 to 6. I alsobear in mind the intractable presence of mould and fungus and the fact that, due to stylolites, there was significant cracking andspalling among the stone panels chosen by MML for use in Houses 1 to 6. Seen in this light, the decision to replace the stone panelswith granite seems reasonable. In my view, in carrying out such decision, Linfield was not guilty of a failure to mitigate.</p>    <p><a name="p297" class="para" id="p297">297.</a> I would therefore award damages under the head of repair cost in the amount of Sum B.</p>    <p><a name="p298" class="para" id="p298">298.</a> Linfield claims other sums by way of rectification costs. But those amounts do not seem to be attributable to MML's breach. For instance,there are claims (among others) for window repair works in the amount of $1,943,967.72; for waterproofing works to the Property'ssuperstructure in the amount of $2,537,894.91; for concrete repair works in the sum of $927,826.86; and for "interior remedial works(except granite)" for the amount of $4,048,568.19. None of these claims derive directly from MML's failure properly to install theexternal cladding works.</p>    <p><a name="p299" class="para" id="p299">299.</a> Damages for the amount of $39,378,547 (that is, Sum B + $15.9 million rounded down to the nearest dollar) are awarded to Linfieldin respect of MML's breach of its Warranty.</p>    <p class="heading">G. Expert evidence</p>    <p><a name="p300" class="para" id="p300">300.</a> Before concluding this Judgment, I should say a few words about some of the expert evidence. Expert evidence played a crucial partin the determination of liability in these proceedings. On the whole I have preferred the evidence of the experts called by GWA andBHP to those called by Linfield.</p>    <p><a name="p301" class="para" id="p301">301.</a> Mr. Hartog gave evidence on the condition of the stone panels at the Property following their installation by MML. He also commentedon the nature of limestone and stylolites. I found such evidence helpful. But, beyond such general topics, I found Mr. Hartog's evidenceless helpful. His report was long and rambling. It was not easy to discern his principal points among a forest of words. Substantialparts of the report seemed more in the nature of advocating a particular position, instead of impartially assessing an expert issue.This was cause of great concern to me. I considered that, since he had played a significant part in the events leading to Linfield'sdecision to replace the cladding system and commence proceedings against TDA (going so far in correspondence with Mr. Lu as to ascribefraud on the part of Dr. Ho), Mr. Hartog's views had to be treated with much caution when assessing the rights and wrongs of thevarious parties.</p>    <p><a name="p302" class="para" id="p302">302.</a> Mr. Fred Ho's evidence struck me as largely assertive, rather than reasoned. I felt that he was inclined to be more partisan thanimpartial. I did not find his evidence impressive. On the whole, I preferred the evidence of Mr. Watkins, who was more balanced andready to concede points against the interests of GWA when it seemed reasonable and appropriate to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p303" class="para" id="p303">303.</a> A significant part of the trial was occupied with a consideration of a back analysis in Mr. Watkins' Supplementary Report of thestrengths of individual stone panels used in the Property. I regarded such analysis as being submitted by GWA in support of an argumentthat, even if GWA had been negligent in approving MML's design and calculations, such failure would not have justified the replacementof the whole cladding system. At most, had a rigorous analysis been conducted (as Linfield contended at trial ought to have been),it would only have shown (according to Mr. Watkins) that 177 panels (1.5%) failed to meet a FOS of 6 (based on mean strength).</p>    <p><a name="p304" class="para" id="p304">304.</a> Mr. Watkins' analysis depended the following assumptions (among others):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) That the Testconsult, Corived and BRE results could be amalgamated to form a pool of 51 samples;</p>        <p>(2) That, assuming a normal distribution, in the equation x<sub>k</sub> = x<sub>m</sub> - kÏ (where x<sub>k</sub> is the characteristic flexural strength of a stone, x<sub>m</sub> the mean strength, and Ï the standard deviation of a sample of test results), the constant k could be taken to be equivalent to1.64; and,</p>        <p>(3) That the position of Houses 1 to 6 was such that the external panels of each house would be subject to certain specified windpressures and suctions.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Mr. Fred Ng challenged assumptions (1) and (2), but accepted assumption (2) without qualification.</p>    <p><a name="p305" class="para" id="p305">305.</a> Despite Mr. Fred Ng's acceptance of assumption (2), Ms. Cheng cross-examined Mr. Watkins on the basis that assumption (2) was wrongand k should be taken as 2.07. Mr. Watkins accepted that, based on a strict reading of the British Standards Institution's Guideto Statistical Interpretation of Data (BS 2846: <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3:</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/123B#p1975" class="autolink_findacts">1975</a>; ISO 3207-1975) one should use k = 2.07, but he thought that the use of 1.64 was the conventional approach.</p>    <p><a name="p306" class="para" id="p306">306.</a> Although it is unnecessary for me to determine the validity of Mr. Watkins' analysis in light of my conclusions, I note the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) I do not think Mr. Fred Ng's criticism of the polling of test results would assist Linfield. If only the BRE results are pooled(as AFE itself seems to have done), there is in fact a higher mean strength and the resulting calculations would be more favourableto GWA's case.</p>        <p>(2) In light of Mr. Ng's acceptance of k = 1.64, I do not think that I can fault Mr. Watkins' analysis for not proceeding on the basisof k = 2.07. It appears that this is an area where engineers can reasonably have different views as to the conventional or practicalapproach to take.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) I accept Mr. Watkins' assumptions on wind loads. I do not think that they were unreasonable assumptions to make.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p307" class="para" id="p307">307.</a> I have already mentioned my reasons for preferring Mr. Williams' evidence over that of Mr. Lau.</p>    <p><a name="p308" class="para" id="p308">308.</a> Mr. Mann's evidence on the cause of water leakage into the Property was brief and to the point. I entirely accept it.</p>    <p><a name="p309" class="para" id="p309">309.</a> GWA's counsel complain about the inclusion of the 2nd AFE Report in the trial bundle. This document was in essence an expert reportprepared at Linfield's instruction in contemplation for use at trial to advance Linfield's case. However, its author was not putforward by Linfield as a witness and not subjected to cross-examination. For those reasons, I have treated this document with circumspection.Despite being critical of the report, GWA's counsel relied on some points made there when such supported GWA's case. I thereforedo not think that one should ignore the report altogether. Nonetheless, I did not think that I could accord significant weight tothe views advanced therein.</p>    <p class="heading">IV. CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a name="p310" class="para" id="p310">310.</a> There will be judgment for Linfield against MML in the amount of $39,378,547. The damages claimed against MML were not definitivelyparticularised until July 2004. I therefore do not believe that it is appropriate to award interest from the date of the writ untildate of judgment. Interest is to run on the amount from date of judgment at the judgment rate until payment.</p>    <p><a name="p311" class="para" id="p311">311.</a> Linfield's claim against GWA is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p312" class="para" id="p312">312.</a> GWA's contribution claims against TDA, PCL, MML and BHP are dismissed. BHP's contribution claims against PCL and MML are dismissed.BHP obtained judgment on liability against TDA in default of discovery by TDA of any documents. The trial was effectively also thehearing of BHP's case on quantum against TDA. BHP not being liable for contribution, it obtains no quantum from TDA.</p>    <p><a name="p313" class="para" id="p313">313.</a> There will be a Costs Order Nisi in the following terms:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) PCL is to have its costs of BHP's claim against PCL. PCL's own costs are to be taxed if not agreed. I shall refer below to suchtaxed costs as PCL's costs.</p>        <p>(2) There will be no costs order in respect of BHP's claims for contribution or indemnity against TDA and MML.</p>        <p>(3) BHP is to have its costs of GWA's claim against BHP. BHP's own costs are to be taxed if not agreed. I shall refer below to suchtaxed costs as BHP's costs. In addition to payment of BHP's costs, GWA is to indemnify BHP against the amount of PCL's costs.</p>        <p>(4) There will be no costs order in respect of GWA's claims for contribution or indemnity against TDA and MML.</p>        <p>(5) GWA is to have its own costs of Linfield's action against GWA. GWA's own costs are to be taxed if not agreed. I shall refer belowto such taxed costs as GWA's costs. In addition to payment of GWA's costs, Linfield is to indemnify GWA against the amounts of PCL'scosts and BHP's costs respectively.</p>        <p>(6) Linfield is to have the costs of its action against MML, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>        <p>(7) Sub-Â§(5) has the consequence that Linfield will bear PCL's and BHP's costs. Such result will be without prejudice to any argumentby Linfield in these proceedings that, consequent on the outcome of Linfield's arbitration against PCL and BHP, Linfield should beentitled fully to recoup those costs from PCL and BHP.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p314" class="para" id="p314">314.</a> The parties have liberty to apply in relation to my Order as a whole.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(A.

But no one queried the bona fidesof the Testconsult results at the time and it seems to me highly speculative to say that samples were drawn from stones other thanthe Poiseul B5 delivered to Hong Kong for use on the project.</p>    <p>6 Mr. Fred Ng did not clarify the connection between hacking off and leaking windows. GWA neither set out the windows nor checkedtheir setting out. The latter job is typically the responsibility of a clerk of works. As far as leakage through the Property's windowsis concerned, I accept the evidence of BHP's expert, Mr. Mann, that there were 2 primary causes of water ingress. First, there wasinadequate sealing of the gaps between the concrete wall and windows of the Property. Window openings in the concrete were too widefor the units installed in them. Second, there was a lack of detailing in respect of the flashings that should have been fixed aroundeach window opening. Neither cause appears to me to be attributable to GWA.</p>    <p>7 There is no evidence of exposed rebars in House 6, although some hacking off was done to the concrete walls there.</p>    <p>8 For ease of reference, I provide the reference number given to a particular complaint in Linfield's Particulars of Claim.</p>    <p> </p>    <appeal>Appeal by the Plaintiff to Court of Appeal.
