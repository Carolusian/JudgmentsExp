They also join BEA in its appeal in CACV 189/97 againstthe Judge's order that BEA's claim against the 1st Defendant in the action Tsien Wui Marble Factory Ltd (TW) be dismissed.

He argued that this was a misconception of the position. This burden had to be discharged by thePlaintiff who had to prove that his cause of action was not time barred. He particularly placed reliance upon the passage at p.30of the Judgment of Ralph Gibson LJ in <strong>London Congregational Union v. Harriss &amp; Harriss</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20ALL%20ER%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 ALL ER 15:</a></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It seems to me that on this part of the case the submissions of counsel for the defendants are correct and that the point is decidedin favour of the defendants by the Court of Appeal in <em>Cartledge's</em> case. The point was not argued in the House of Lords but no doubt was cast on the correctness of the decision. The onus lies on theplaintiffs to prove that their cause of action accrued within the relevant period before the writ. The judge, therefore, not havingbeen referred to the authority, misdirected himself. By a respondent's notice the plaintiffs have contended that if the judge haddirected himself properly in accordance with the law laid down in <em>Cartledge's</em> case on the evidence he must have come to the same conclusion. This contention was based on the passage in Lord Pearce's speech,cited above, in which Lord Pearce added a gloss to what had been said in the Court of Appeal by Harman and Pearson LJJ. Counsel forthe plaintiffs argued that the plaintiffs had proved 'an accrual-of damage' within the six-year period before the writ by provingthe existence of damage within that period and that, on tendering that proof, the burden passed to the defendants 'to show that theapparent accrual of a cause of action is misleading and that in reality the cause of action accrued at an earlier date'. I cannotaccept this contention. It confuses the existence, or continued existence, of damage or its consequences with accrual of damage,which is the coming into existence of damage. In my judgment, the burden on a plaintiff is to show that, on the balance of probabilities,his cause of action accrued, ie came into existence, on a day within the period of limitation. If he shows that, then the evidentialburden would, as stated by Lord Pearce, pass to the defendants to show, if they can, that the apparent accrual of the plaintiffs'cause of action was misleading etc. On the facts of this case, as is apparent from the passage which I have cited from the judgmentof the judge, the plaintiffs did not tender evidence which showed that on the balance of probabilities the damage had been causedto the plaster within the period of six years from the writ. The evidence was equally consistent with damage having been caused outsidethat period. The plaintiffs therefore failed to prove that the cause of action in respect of the damp-proofing had accrued withinthe relevant period and, in my judgment, therefore the defendants are entitled to succeed on that part of their appeal. I would wishto hear counsel as to the effect on the award of damages of allowing the appeal to that extent."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Mr. John Scott, S.C. for BEA's reply to this was that the Judge had been correct in his analysis of the position. He mainly reliedupon the Victorian case of <strong>Pullen v. Gutteridge &amp; another</strong> [1993] 1VR 15 p.27. The Full Bench said at p.73 of the report:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...There is, however, a good deal of authority supporting the view that the plaintiff bears the onus of proving that time has notrun even in cases where the statute merely bars the remedy. Some of the decisions that have been cited for this view are found onexamination to be explicable as concerned with the need for the plaintiff to prove that the case falls within an exception allowedby the statute. So <em>Beale v. Nind</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281821%29%204%20B%20%26%20Ald%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1821) 4 B. &amp; Ald. 568</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=106%20ER%201044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">106 E.R. 1044</a>, a case of alleged acknowledgement, and <em>O'Connor v.

But there are other cases which cannot be explained in this way and whichsupport the proposition that it is the plaintiff who bears the burden of proving that his cause of action arose within the limitationperiod. The first is <em>Hurst v. Parker</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281817%29%201%20B%20%26%20Ald%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1817) 1 B. &amp; Ald. 92</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=106%20ER%2034" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">106 E.R. 34</a> and the second is <em>Wilby v.

Mitchell</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281886%29%2011%20AC%20127" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1886) 11 App. Cas. 127</a>, at p. 135, in the speech of Lord Blackburn; his Lordship cited no authority. In <em>Cohen v. Cohen</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281929%29%2042%20CLR%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1929) 42 C.L.R. 91</a>, Dixon J. was unable to satisfy himself whether the cause of action had accrued within the limitation period but held that therewas an absolute acknowledgement sufficient to take the cause of action outside the statute of limitations. On the question of theburden of proof with regard to the time at which the cause of action accrued his Honour said this, at p. 97: 'Upon issue taken ona plea of <em>actio non accrevit infra sex annos</em> it was held that the onus of proof lay upon the plaintiff (<em>Hurst v. Parker</em> (1817) 1 Barn. &amp; Ald.92; <em>Wilby v. Henman</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281834%29%202%20Cr%20%26%20M%20658" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1834) 2 Cr. &amp; M. 658).</a> So, too, on a plea of <em>non assumpsit infra sex annos</em> (per Bayley J. in <em>Beale v. Nind</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281821%29%204%20B%20%26%20Ald%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1821) 4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 568</a>, at p. 571).'</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">As we have said, the case of <em>Beale v. Nind</em> is in our respectful opinion to be explained as concerned with the need for the plaintiff to prove that the case falls within anexception allowed by the statute if he wishes to escape from its operation. We return later to the other two decisions cited, <em>Hurst v. Parker</em> and <em>Wilby v. Henman</em>, and suggest that they should both be viewed as founded upon a misapprehension concerning the general rule for determining on whomthe burden of proof of an issue lay. Further authority for the view that it is the plaintiff who bears the burden of proving thathis claim is not statute-barred is what was said in <em>Cartledge v. E. Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%201%20QB%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 1 Q.B. 189</a>, at p. 202, by Harman L.J. and, at p. 208, by Pearson L.J. There is, in addition, the authority of the House of Lords, for on theappeal in that case ([1963] A.C. 758, at p. 784) Lord Pearce spoke of the 'initial onus' as being on the plaintiff to prove thathis cause of action was not statute-barred and of the passing of a burden to the defendant once the plaintiff has proved the apparentaccrual of a cause of action within the limitation period. This speech was concurred in by Lord Reid, at p. 771, by Lord Morris,at p. 775 and possibly by Lord Evershed, at p. 773. Against what was said in Cartledge v. E. Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd. is to be setthe citing by Lord Fraser of Tullybelton with apparent approval in the later case of <em>Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v. Oscar Faber &amp; Partners</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 A.C. 1</a>, at p. 18, of a passage from the speech of Lord Salmon in <em>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] A.C. 728</a>, at p. 771. This passage accepts that it is for the defendant to show that the claim is statute-barred, unless Lord Salmon's observationscan be explained on the basis, in accordance with what Lord Pearce said in <em>Cartledge</em>, that the plaintiff had proved an accrual of damage within the six years, so as to cause a burden to pass to the defendant. For in<em>Anns</em> cracking had occurred about two years before the issue of the writ. On the other hand, in <em>Pirelli</em> itself the cracking took place more than six years before the issue of the writ, so that this explanation is not possible here. Counselfor the defendants there conceded (at p. 3) that their clients bore the onus of proving that the damage occurred outside the limitationperiod, and, at p. 12, Lord Fraser dealt with the trial judge's finding in terms which appeared to accept that the defendants didcarry the onus. His Lordship was in effect speaking for the House of Lords.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In the cases which support the view that the plaintiff bears the burden the matter is often dealt with by way of <em>obiter dictum</em> only and in none of them is there any substantial discussion of the question. The body of authority is, however, such as to requirerespectful attention and in particular weight must be given to what was said in the House of Lords in <em>Cartledge v. E. Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd.</em> As regards <em>Cohen v. Cohen</em>, the words used by Dixon J. ('it was held that') leave us in doubt whether his Honour intended to endorse the proposition that theonus of proof lay on the plaintiff. With all respect to those who have thought otherwise, we cannot accept that it is the plaintiffwho bears the burden. It is for a plaintiff to plead and prove the elements of his cause of action. If the accruing of the causeof action in time is no part of the cause of action, the plaintiff need not allege or prove it. We refer to <em>Coburn v.

The Judge went on to consider the evidence of marks appearing on the surface of thegranite panels. This was in 1984 &amp; 1985. The marks did not at first seem to occasion any particular concern. It was not until1989 that a survey was undertaken by Mr. Michael TANG of Hong Kong Land who were at that time the managers of the building. Mr. TANGdid not have any specialised expertise in cladding. He noted some clipping and discolouration of panels but his overall conclusionwas that there were no major or significant defects observed. Some minor work was undertaken as a result of this in December 1989&amp; September 1990.

Oscar Faber and Patners</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 AC 1.</a></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In this case cracks had started to appear on a chimney which had formed part of an extension. The Defendants were the Architectswho were being sued for the negligent design of the extension. It was held that the discoverability of the cracks was not a relevantconsideration. Time began to run when the cracks first appeared. Lord Frazer considered Anns case at p.17 and analysed the positionin this way.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Counsel for the respondents argued that in <em>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] A.C. 728</a>, Lord Wilberforce, and the other members of this House who agreed with his speech, had approved of the observations in Sparham-Souterto the effect that the discoverability date was the date when the cause of action accrued. But I do not so read my noble and learnedfriend's speech. At p. 750 he simply narrated the conflict between the cases of <em>Dutton v. Bognor Regis Urban District Council</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%201%20QB%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 1 Q.B. 373</a> and <em>Sparham-Souter</em> without indicating any preference. He posed the question 'When does the cause of action arise?' and he answered it as follows, atp. 760:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'In my respectful opinion the Court of Appeal was right when, in <em>Sparham-Souter v. Town and Country Developments (Essex) Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20QB%20858" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] Q.B. 858</a> it abjured the view that the cause of action arose immediately upon delivery, i.e., conveyance of the defective house. It can onlyarise when the state of the building is such that there is present or imminent danger to the health or safety of persons occupyingit.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The only express approval in that passage is to the Court of Appeal's decision that the cause of action did <em>not</em> arise immediately the defective house was conveyed. His Lordship did not say, nor in my opinion did he imply, that the date of discoverabilitywas the date when the cause of action accrued. The date which he regarded as material (when there is 'present or imminent dangerto . . . health or safety') was, of course, related to the particular duty resting upon the defendants as the local authority, whichwas different from the duty resting upon the builders or architects, but I see nothing to indicate that Lord Wilberforce regardedthe date of discoverability of the damage as having any relevance. He was not considering the question of discoverability, no doubtbecause the main issue in the appeal by the time it reached this House was whether any duty at all was incumbent on the local authority:see p.751A. Three other noble and learned Lords expressed agreement with Lord Wilberforce. Only Lord Salmon delivered a separatereasoned speech and he clearly considered that the cause of action could arise before damage was discovered or discoverable, althoughhe recognised that proof might be difficult. He said, at p. 771B: 'Whether it is possible to prove that damage to the building hadoccurred <em>four years before it manifested itself</em> is another matter, but it can only be decided by evidence.' (Emphasis added). Neither Lord Salmon, nor the other Lords, seems tohave considered that he was dissenting from the majority view on that matter. In these circumstances I do not think that the majorityin Anns are to be taken as having approved the discoverability test applied in <em>Sparham-Souter</em>."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> It is significant to add that later in his speech (at p. 18) Lord Fraser went on to express the view that a negligent architect shouldnot be viewed in the same way as a negligent solicitor unless the building in question was "doomed from the start". It is by no meansclear what this meant or what was the rationale of this view.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> However what is clear is that Lord Fraser did not have the concept of economic loss in mind when he expressed this view.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> There is a further aspect of this case which is relevant to our deliberations. It was generally considered that the consequencesof the case led to a highly unsatisfactory situation. As a result legislation was introduced in an attempt to mitigate the effectof Pirelli. This was achieved by the Latent Damage Act 1986 which provided for S. 14A of the Limitation Act 1980. This amendmentwas adopted in Hong Kong in the form of S. 31 &amp; S.38A of our Ordinance.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"31.

Harriss &amp; Harriss</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20ALL%20ER%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 ALL ER 15</a></p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The main significance of this case was that although it followed Pirelli Sir Denys Buckley, who was in a minority, had the foresightto consider the claim which was being made in terms of economic loss. He said at p. 33:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the present case the contractual duty of the defendants as architects of the new church and hall must undoubtedly have been todesign a building complete with all necessary services, suitable and adequate for those uses to which it was intended to be put.In particular the defendants were bound to provide a drainage system capable of accepting and disposing of all foreseeable volumesof water. Their common law duty as expert advisers was to use due care and skill to ensure that whatever drainage system they devisedwould be adequate to discharge that function. They failed to do so, as subsequent experience showed. By the time when the defectbecame apparent any action in contract had become statute-barred. Consequently the plaintiffs sued in negligence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">When the building was handed over the plaintiffs acquired a building which incorporated an existing physical defect: they did notget what the defendants were under a duty to ensure that they would get. It may be said to have been a latent defect, because itmay not have been easily discernible, but it was an existing physical defect, not merely a risk that a physical defect might developin the future. If before any flooding occurred the plaintiffs had become aware of the defect, they could, in my judgment, have thereuponsued in negligence without awaiting the occurrence of physical damage. It would have become demonstrable that the plaintiffs hadsuffered economic damage in consequence of the defendants' negligence in the form of the expense to which they would necessarilybe put to remedy the defect, or in the form of the reduction of the realisable value of the property. The plaintiffs, in my judgment,unknowingly suffered that economic damage when the building was handed over to them. Their ignorance in this respect, however, wouldnot stop time from running from that time (see <em>Cartledge v E Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20All%20ER%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 All ER 341</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20AC%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] AC 758).</a> So, if I am right in thinking that the plaintiffs suffered damage when the building was handed over, their cause of action accruedthen and became statute-barred six years thereafter."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>4. <strong>D &amp; F Estate Ltd. v. Church Commrs For England</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20AC%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] AC 177</a></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> This case was stated to be the beginning of the counter revolution referred to by Mr. Thomas. The court was prepared to considerthe application of <strong>Donoghue v. Stevenson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] AC 562</a> to the liability of a builder of a permanent structure.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Lord Bridge had this to say at p. 206:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"These principles are easy enough to comprehend and probably not difficult to apply when the defect complained of is in a chattelsupplied complete by a single manufacturer. If the hidden defect in the chattel is the cause of personal injury or of damage to propertyother than the chattel itself, the manufacturer is liable. But if the hidden defect is discovered before any such damage is caused,there is no longer any room for the application of the <em>Donoghue v. Stevenson</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] A.C. 562</a> principle. The chattel is now defective in quality, but is no longer dangerous. It may be valueless or it may be capable of economicrepair. In either case the economic loss is recoverable in contract by a buyer or hirer of the chattel entitled to the benefit ofa relevant warranty of quality, but is not recoverable in tort by a remote buyer or hirer of the chattel.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">If the same principle applies in the field of real property to the liability of the builder of a permanent structure which is dangerouslydefective, that liability can only arise if the defect remains hidden until the defective structure causes personal injury or damageto property other than the structure itself. If the defect is discovered before any damage is done, the loss sustained by the ownerof the structure, who has to repair or demolish it to avoid a potential source of danger to third parties, would seem to be purelyeconomic. Thus, if I acquire a property with a dangerously defective garden wall which is attributable to the bad workmanship ofthe original builder, it is difficult to see any basis in principle on which I can sustain an action in tort against the builderfor the cost of either repairing or demolishing the wall. No physical damage has been caused. All that has happened is that the defectin the wall has been discovered in time to prevent damage occurring. I do not find it necessary for the purpose of deciding the presentappeal to express any concluded view as to how far, if at all, the ratio decidendi of <em>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</em> [1978] A.C.728 involves a departure from this principle establishing a new cause of action in negligence against a builder when theonly damage alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff is the discovery of a defect in the very structure which the builder erected."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Shortly prior to this (at.

The general thread of the criticisms was that the uncertaintieswhich inevitably were encountered had resulted in a proliferation of cases where artificial distinctions had had to be made to accommodatethe principles which had been propounded.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> There can be no doubt that their Lordships entirely rejected Anns principles.</p>    <p>6. <strong>Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 145</a></p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In this case the House of Lords considered the question of Agents owing a duty of care in Tort. This was in the context of litigationinvolving Lloyds Names. Consideration was given to the situation where there were concurrent rights in Contract and Tort. Of particularrelevance to this litigation consideration was given to the circumstances when economic loss may flow from the negligent performanceof duty by a party with whom a special relationship exists. Much assistance in this connection can be derived from a passage fromthe speech of Lord Goff at p. 180 of the report.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"From these statements, and from their application in <em>Hedley Byrne</em>, we can derive some understanding of the breadth of the principle underlying the case. We can see that it rests upon a relationshipbetween the parties, which may be general or specific to the particular transaction, and which may or may not be contractual in nature.All of their Lordships spoke in terms of one party having assumed or undertaken a responsibility towards the other. On this point,Lord Devlin spoke in particularly clear terms in both passages from his speech which I have quoted above. Further, Lord Morris spokeof that party being possessed of a 'special skill' which he undertakes to 'apply for the assistance of another who relies upon suchskill.' But the facts of <em>Hedley Byrne</em> itself, which was concerned with the liability of a banker to the recipient for negligence in the provision of a reference gratuitouslysupplied, show that the concept of a 'special skill' must be understood broadly, certainly broadly enough to include special knowledge.Again, though Hedley Byrne was concerned with the provision of information and advice, the example given by Lord Devlin of the relationshipbetween solicitor and client, and his and Lord Morris's statements of principle, show that the principle extends beyond the provisionof information and advice to include the performance of other services. It follows, of course, that although, in the case of theprovision of information and advice, reliance upon it by the other party will be necessary to establish a cause of action (becauseotherwise the negligence will have no causative effect), nevertheless there may be other circumstances in which there will be thenecessary reliance to give rise to the application of the principle. In particular, as cases concerned with solicitor and clientdemonstrate, where the plaintiff entrusts the defendant with the conduct of his affairs, in general or in particular, he may be heldto have relied on the defendant to exercise due skill and care in such conduct.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In subsequent cases concerned with liability under the Hedley Byrne principle in respect of negligent misstatements, the questionhas frequently arisen whether the plaintiff falls within the category of persons to whom the maker of the statement owes a duty ofcare. In seeking to contain that category of persons within reasonable bounds, there has been some tendency on the part of the courtsto criticise the concept of 'assumption of responsibility' as being 'unlikely to be a helpful or realistic test in most cases' (see<em>Smith v. Eric S. Bush</em> [l990]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20AC%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 A.C. 831</a>, 864 - 865, per Lord Griffiths; and see also <em>Caparo Industries Plc. v. Dickman</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 A.C. 605</a>, 628, per Lord Roskill). However, at least in cases such as the present, in which the same problem does not arise, there seems tobe no reason why recourse should not be had to the concept, which appears after all to have been adopted, in one form or another,by all of their Lordships in <em>Hedley Byrne</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] A.C. 465</a> (see, e.g., Lord Reid, at pp.483, 486 and 487; Lord Morris (with whom Lord Hodson agreed), at p.494; Lord Devlin, at pp. 529 and531; and Lord Pearce at p.538). Furthermore, especially in a context concerned with a liability which may arise under a contractor in a situation 'equivalent to contract,' it must be expected that an objective test will be applied when asking the question whether,in a particular case, responsibility should be held to have been assumed by the defendant to the plaintiff: see <em>Caparo Industries Plc. v. Dickman</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 A.C. 605</a>, 637, per Lord Oliver of Aylmerton. In addition, the concept provides its own explanation why there is no problem in cases of thiskind about liability for pure economic loss; for if a person assumes responsibility to another in respect of certain services, thereis no reason why he should not be liable in damages for that other in respect of economic loss which flows from the negligent performanceof those services. It follows that, once the case is identified as falling within the <em>Hedley Byrne</em> principle, there should be no need to embark upon any further enquiry whether it is 'fair, just and reasonable' to impose liabilityfor economic loss - a point which is, I consider, of some importance in the present case. The concept indicates too that in somecircumstances, for example where the undertaking to furnish the relevant service is given on an informal occasion, there may be noassumption of responsibility; and likewise that an assumption of responsibility may be negatived by an appropriate disclaimer. Iwish to add in parenthesis that, as Oliver J. recognised in <em>Midland Bank Trust Co. Ltd. v. Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20Ch%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] Ch. 384</a>, 416F - G (a case concerned with concurrent liability of solicitors tort and contract, to which I will have to refer in a moment),an assumption of responsibility by, for example, a professional man may give to liability in respect of negligent omissions as muchas negligent acts of commission, as for example when a solicitor assumes responsibility for business on behalf of his client andomits to take a certain step, such as service of a document, which falls within the responsibility so assumed by him."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> These observations by Lord Goff need also to be considered in the light of his comments at p.185 where he had in mind their applicationto professional advisors such as Architects &amp; Solicitors.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the result, the courts in this country have until recently grappled with the problem very largely without the assistance of systematicacademic study. At first, as is shown in particular by cases concerned with the liability for solicitors' negligence, the courtsadopted something very like the French solution, holding that a claim against a solicitor for negligence must be pursued in contract,and not in tort (see, e.g., <em>Bean v. Wade</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281885%29%202%20TLR%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1885) 2 T.L.R. 157)</a>; and in <em>Groom v.

It has to be said, however, that decisions such as these, though based on prior authority, weresupported by only a slender citation of cases, none of great weight; and the jurisprudential basis of the doctrine so adopted cannotbe said to have been explored in any depth. Furthermore when, in <em>Bagot v. Stevens Scanlan &amp; Co. Ltd.</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%201%20QB%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 1 Q.B. 197</a>, Diplock L.J. adopted a similar approach in the case of a claim against a firm of architects, he felt compelled to recognise (pp.204 - 205) that a different conclusion might be reached in cases 'where the law in the old days recognised either something in thenature of a status like a public calling (such as common carrier, common innkeeper, or a bailor and bailee) or the status of masterand servant.' To this list must be added cases concerned with claims against doctors and dentists. I must confess to finding it startlingthat, in the second half of the 20th century, a problem of considerable practical importance should fall to be solved by referenceto such an outmoded form of categorisation as this.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I think it is desirable to stress at this stage that the question of concurrent liability is by no means only of academic significance.Practical issues, which can be of great importance to the parties, are at stake. Foremost among these is perhaps the question oflimitation of actions. If concurrent liability in tort is not recognised, a claimant may find his claim barred at a time when heis unaware of its existence. This must moreover be a real possibility in the case of claims against professional men, such as solicitorsor architects, since the consequences of their negligence may well not come to light until long after the lapse of six years fromthe date when the relevant breach of contract occurred. Moreover the benefits of the Latent Damage Act 1986, under which the timeof the accrual of the cause of action may be postponed until after the plaintiff has the relevant knowledge, are limited to actionsin tortious negligence. This leads to the startling possibility that a client who has had the benefit of gratuitous advice from hissolicitor may in this respect be better off than a client who has paid a fee. Other practical problems arise, for example, from theabsence of a right to contribution between negligent contract-breakers; from the rules as to remoteness of damage, which are lessrestricted in tort than they are in contract; and from the availability of the opportunity to obtain leave to serve proceedings outof the jurisdiction. It can of course be argued that the principle established in respect of concurrent liability in contract andtort should not be tailored to mitigate the adventitious effects of rules of law such as these, and that one way of solving suchproblems would no doubt be to rephrase such incidental rules as have to remain in terms of the nature of the harm suffered ratherthan the nature of the liability asserted (see Tony Weir, XI <em>Int.Encycl.Comp.L.</em> ch.12, para. 72). But this is perhaps crying for the moon; and with the law in its present form, practical considerations of thiskind cannot sensibly be ignored."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> This latter passage provided some justification for Mr. Thomas to cite as authority some of the cases involving professional negligenceof solicitors which will be considered later where it is almost invariably the case that even if neither the solicitor nor the clientis aware of the act of negligence the right of action is deemed to accrue at the time when the professional services were rendered.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> A further case referred to by Mr. Thomas was <strong>Invercargill City Council v Hamlin</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20634" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 634.</a></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> This Privy Council case is an illustration of the alternative route which has been adopted running to a large extent counter to Murphy.The appeal which was based upon New Zealand Law proceeded upon the basis that Anns case was essentially still good law. It is ofimportance to this case as both Findlay, J and Mr. Scott place heavy reliance upon it. At p.18 of his judgment Findlay, J refersto the case and to principles drawn from Pirelli and from the <strong>Council of the Shire of Sutherland v.

There is a reversion back to the principle that where there is a latent defect in a building "the element of loss or damagewhich is necessary to support a claim for economic loss in tort does not exist so long as the market value of the property is unaffected."</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Mr. Thomas submitted that Invercargill, and the Australian and Canadian cases adopting a similar rationale had no application whateverto the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Mr. Thomas went on to submit that the professional negligence cases also assisted him. He argued that there was no logical reasonto differentiate them from claims being made for economic loss particularly where as in the present case the services which had beenperformed by P&amp;T had been of a professional nature. He referred to <strong>Forster v.

(as he then was) considered both the law of contract and tort at p.411and the logic of causes of action arising at the same time.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The matter may be tested. It is common ground, on the assumption that the plaintiffs' pleaded case is correct, that the defendantswere in breach of contract when they negligently advised and settled documents in 1971s and 1975. A cause of action then arose. Suppose,per impossible, that the plaintiffs had sued at once and before the later difficulties with Mr Fenton arose. They would have beenbound to succeed. If of opinion that the plaintiffs had suffered no damage, the judge would have awarded them nominal damages of40s or its modern equivalent. But it seems to me plain that the judge would not have done that on these facts. He would have assessedas best he could on the available evidence the loss fairly and reasonably flowing in the usual course of things from the defendants'breach of contract, reaching a figure that might have been large or small but would not have been nominal. I think that the plaintiffswere in argument inclined to accept that. If, in a contractual claim for negligence, the court would have awarded other than nominaldamages, l do not see how it can be said that an action in tort based on the same negligence would have been bound to fail for wantof any damage as an essential ingredient of the cause of action.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I do not think that there is, on the straightforward application of familiar principles, any escape from these conclusions. I am nottherefore surprised to find that other courts have also reached the same conclusions (see <em>Forster v Outred &amp; Co (a firm)</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20All%20ER%20753" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 All ER 753</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20WLR%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 WLR 86</a>, <em>Melton v Walker &amp; Stanger</em> (1981) 125 SJ 861, Baker v Ollard &amp; Bentley (1982) 126 SJ 593 and <em>Aikman v Hallett &amp; Co</em> (20 March 1987, unreported). It is pointed out, necessarily correctly, that the facts of those cases are different from those ofthe present, and in some the damage suffered by the claimant at the time of the execution of the agreement in question is perhapsmore obvious than in the present case. Each of the cases is, however, in my view inconsistent in principle with the plaintiffs' contentionin this case that they suffered no damage in 1971 and 1975.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I agree with what Neill LJ has said concerning <em>Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Faber &amp; Partners (a firm)</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20All%20ER%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 All ER 65</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 AC 1</a> and <em>Dove v Banhams Patent Locks Ltd</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20All%20ER%20833" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 All ER 833</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20WLR%201436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 WLR 1436</a>, the cases on which the plaintiffs principally rely.

The Court of Appeal held in <strong>Ko Ming Bor and Others v. Lo &amp; Lo</strong> Unreported being CA 41/96 that where solicitors had been negligent the cause of action arose at the time when the professional serviceswere rendered. The judgment in that case was delivered in October 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Mr. Thomas also referred as to the recent case of <strong>Nykredit Mortgage Bank Plc v.

Lord Nichollscommented on the practical difficulties which are encountered in some detail on p.1632.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Indeed, for the cause of action to arise only when the lender realises his security would be a highly unattractive proposition. Itwould mean that, however obvious it may be that the lender will not recover his money, he cannot start proceedings. He must waituntil he manages to sell the property, a process which may be protracted. This would be a surprising stance for the law to take.It would be all the more surprising when one has in mind that a lender's cause of action against his negligent valuer for breachof contract, as distinct from a claim in tort, arises when the negligent valuation is given. If disaster were evident and the lenderwere to sue his valuer for breach of contract without waiting until he had realised his security, it is inconceivable that the courtwould award only nominal damages. The court would do its best to assess the loss. This prompted the trenchant observation of BinghamL.J. in <em>D. W. Moore &amp; Co. Ltd v. Ferrier</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20WLR%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 W.L.R. 267</a>, 280:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'If, in a contractual claim for negligence, the court would have awarded other than nominal damages, I do not see how it can be saidthat an action in tort based on the same negligence would have been bound to fail for want of any damage as an essential ingredientof the cause of action.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">As Mr. Briggs submitted, no accountant or prospective buyer, viewing the loan book of a commercial lender, would say that the shortfallin security against outstanding loans to defaulting borrowers did not represent a loss to the lender merely because the securitieshad yet to be sold. Realisation of the security does not create the lender's loss, nor does it convert a potential loss into an actualloss. Rather, it crystallises the amount of a present loss, which hitherto had been open to be aggravated or diminished by movementsin the property market.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I can see no necessity for the law to travel the commercially unrealistic road. The amount of a plaintiff's loss frequently becomesclearer after court proceedings have been started and while awaiting trial. This is an everyday experience. There is no reason tothink that the approach I have spelled out will give rise to any insuperable difficulties in practice. In their practical conductof litigation courts are well able to ensure that assessments of damages are made in a sensible way. It is not necessary, in orderto achieve a sensible and fair result, to go so far asserting that the plaintiff has no cause of action, and hence may not issuea writ, until the assessment can be made with the degree of precision that accompanies a realisation of the security. Further, withinthe bounds of sense and reasonableness the policy of the law should be to advance, rather than retard, the accrual of a cause ofaction. This is especially so if the law provides parallel causes of action in contract and in tort in respect of the same conduct.The disparity between the time when these parallel causes of action arise should be smaller, rather than greater."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> It was Mr. Thomas' primary contention that BEA had a claim for economic loss at around the time when the cladding was completed andin any event no later than when the final certificates for the work were issued.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> Accordingly the claim being made by BEA against P&amp;T was time barred and Findlay, J had erred in holding that the claim couldstill be maintained.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Mr. Scott contended that following the transfer of sovereignty there was no good reason why any preference should be accorded toU.K. decisions rather than the decisions of Commonwealth Courts.

Mr. Scott submitted that his position had been prejudiced as a result of the differentapproach which was being adopted in the appeal to the way the case had been conducted before Findlay, J. In the trial the case hadgenerally proceeded upon the basis that the defects in the cladding had been latent defects. The Judge had not made a specific findingof fact on this although it could be argued that this was implicit in his overall findings. However in the appeal Mr. Thomas hadcontended when arguing his fall back position that the defects were patent defects. He pointed out that it would have been self evidentto any qualified observer of the cladding that there were not 13 mm gaps on every floor as was laid down in CP 298.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> This was a fatally flawed submission. One of the facts which had been agreed amongst all the Experts at the trial was that CP 298was not an absolute requirement even though it was referred to in the contract because of the objects of the code could be achievedby alternative means that would be acceptable. The matter was even more complicated than that. As the movement in the concrete wasat its most active in the first two months it could be the case that equivalence could be achieved with lesser tolerances if a periodof time had been allowed to elapse before the cladding was installed.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> There was also the evidence to the effect that considerable practical difficulties were encountered when attempts were made to surveythe cladding.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> A further issue which had not been satisfactorily resolved at the trial was whether there had in fact been any economic loss immediatelyafter the building had been completed. Mr. Scott submitted that certainly in the early stages the defects would not have been readilyapparent. If BEA had sold the building at that time there would have been no question of the purchase price being discounted to reflectthe cost of reinstating the cladding. The opposite contention was advanced by Mr. Thomas. He argued that it was clearly the casethat BEA had not got what it had bargained for namely a defect free cladding system.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> Mr. Scott made a further submission as to why BEA should be entitled to damages as a fall back position if his main contentions didnot find favour. He submitted that on the evidence the defective cladding constituted a danger to members of the public as the buildingadjoined other buildings and an open area in front was accessible to members of the public. Mr. Scott referred the parallel typeof claim for physical damage which Lord Bridge described at p.475 of his speech in Murphy:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I believe that these principles are equally applicable to buildings. If a builder erects a structure containing a latent defect whichrenders it dangerous to persons or property, he will be liable in tort for injury to persons or damage to property resulting fromthat dangerous defect. But if the defect becomes apparent before any injury or damage has been caused, the loss sustained by thebuilding owner is purely economic. If the defect can be repaired at economic cost, that is the measure of the loss. If the buildingcannot be repaired, it may have to be abandoned as unfit for occupation and therefore valueless. These economic losses are recoverableif they flow from breach of a relevant contractual duty, but, here again, in the absence of a special relationship of proximity theyare not recoverable in tort. The only qualification I would make to this is that, if a building stands so close to the boundary ofthe building owner's land that after discovery of the dangerous defect it remains a potential source of injury to persons or propertyon neighbouring land or on the highway, the building owner ought, in principle, to be entitled to recover in tort from the negligentbuilder the cost of obviating the danger, whether by repair or by demolition, so far as that cost is necessarily incurred in orderto protect himself from potential liability to third parties."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Mr. Scott argued that the Judge had been wrong to dismiss this claim simply on the basis that it was not possible to have two rightsof action available at the same time.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> It is by no means clear to me that there is good authority for the proposition advanced by Lord Bridge. Although it was followedin <strong>Morse &amp; Others v. Barratt (Leeds) Ltd.</strong> [1992] CON LJ 158 the proposition did not commend itself to Lord Oliver who said at p489 of Murphy:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My Lords, for the reasons which I endeavoured to state in the course of my speech in <em>D. &amp; F.

Whether, as suggested in the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Bridgeof Harwich, he could be held responsible for the cost necessarily incurred by a building owner in protecting himself from potentialliability to third parties is a question upon which l prefer to reserve my opinion until the case arises, although I am not at themoment convinced of the basis for making such a distinction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> It would also appear on the facts of the present case to have no application. P&amp;T rendered services as Architects and Surveyors.Their duty of care was to BEA. It did not extend to third parties who might sustain damages as a consequence of negligent professionaladvice. This alternative claim is not viable.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> It will be appreciated from all of this that one of the core issues of this appeal is the question as to whether the court shouldcontinue to follow the U.K. law on limitation or whether it should develop along similar lines to Commonwealth Countries such asNew Zealand, Australia and Canada.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> In the course of a persuasive submission Mr. Scott drew to our attention a considerable amount of material which suggested that thereasoning in Invercargill was to be preferred to that of the English cases. In particular he referred to an article in the Law QuarterlyReview by I.N. Duncan Wallace on the subject which contained references to the views expressed by Lord Coohe. He was strongly ofthe opinion that the Commonwealth approach had more to commend it.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> All of this has to be balanced with the advantages of the U.K. approach. It is instructive to consider the speeches of the Law Lordsin Murphy when they weighed the consequences which had flowed from Anns case. They concluded that the law had not developed in away which was conducive of clarity and certainty.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> What also perhaps more importantly needs to be borne in mind is that when Invercargill was decided the decision was based on NewZealand Law which was different to English Law as there were statutory provisions which had some relevance.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> In the final analysis we have to decide whether it would be right for us in effect to undertake what has been described in othercircumstances as judicial legislation. As stated earlier in this judgment when referring to Ko Ming Bor it was the common law inHong Kong at the date of the transfer of sovereignty that Murphy and the professional negligence cases were the line of authoritieswhich applied. This remained the law of the H.K.S.A.R.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> I am not convinced that a compelling case has been made out to justify the court in departing at this time from the English CommonLaw. I am satisfied that Mr. Thomas's analysis of the law is correct and that BEA had a right of action in tort for economic losswhen the construction of the building was completed or shortly thereafter. This being the case their claim against P&amp;T was timebarred. The result of this is that P&amp;T's appeal is successful.</p>    <p class="heading">BEA's Appeal</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> So far as Findlay, J's judgment was concerned there were 7 Grounds of Appeal in the supplementary notice of appeal lodged by BEA.During the course of the hearing Mr. Scott informed us that he did not propose to argue Grounds 4, 5 &amp; 6. He did not abandonthese grounds. However I am satisfied after hearing the submissions of Miss Gladys Li for TW that Mr. Scott was right not to arguethe grounds and that they cannot be sustained.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> That there leaves Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 7. They are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Having first held (on page 11 line H of the Judgment handed down on 25th June 1997) that the Respondent/First Defendant ('FirstDefendant') was responsible for the design of the fixing of the granite to the Bank of East Asia Building, the learned Judge erredin law in holding that the First Defendant was not liable for the failure by the First Defendant's independent contractor, Mr Ragaglini,to carry out the design with reasonable skill and care.</p>        <p>(2) The type of work for which the First Defendant was responsible was of an inherently dangerous nature, involving as it did theplacement of large and heavy granite panels at height adjacent to a pedestrian walkway in the Central District of Hong Kong Island.The said location was approximate to the boundary of the Plaintiff's site and to areas of pedestrian and vehicular passage. As amatter of policy, the law of Hong Kong should recognise such work as falling within the type of situation which could not found thedefence of delegation to an independent contractor to an action sounding in tort.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) Further or in the alternative, the learned Judge erred in law in holding (at page 15 line E of the Judgment) that the First Defendantdid not provide a guarantee of the design of the cladding system. The provisions of clause 2.15 of the Warranty provided by the FirstDefendant to the Plaintiff did not contemplate the subsequent execution of a separate document or agreement, the said Warranty beingthe only contemplated agreement between the Plaintiff and the First Defendant and executed with the express intention of providingprivity of contract between the said parties.</p>        <p>(7) Further or alternatively, the learned Judge erred in holding that the Plaintiff's claim in contract against the First Defendantwas time-barred. The basis of the said contractual claim was founded upon the Warranty which by express contract extended the statutoryperiod of limitation set forth in ss.4 and 31 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> CAP 347 and began to run against the Plaintiff only on expiry of the lifetime of the building."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> It is convenient to consider these grounds together.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> The Judge's finding of fact in relation to the design for the installation of the cladding was at p.6 of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI am left in no doubt at all that under the contract the parties contemplated that Tsien Wui would be responsible for designingthe system of fixing the granite panels to the concrete, and that this system included making proper allowance for movement. I rejectthe interpretation of Clause 2.15 that seeks to construe it as laying down a standard only for the design of the anchorages, or evenonly the material from which the anchorages would be made. Clause 2.24 supports the conclusion that Clause 2.15 seeks to impose astandard for the system It speaks of the shop drawings showing 'joints', the 'kind of control and thermal movement joints, the 'kindof pressure relieving joints', and 'jointing systems'. Mr Clayton argues that there is no evidence that the shop drawings were eversubmitted with Tsien Wui's tender.

The only difference is that, against Tsien Wui,the Bank still maintains a case on contract. Although Mr Scott concedes that the contractual claim against Palmer and Turner is timebarred, that against Tsien Wui, he says, is not. This is because, argues Mr Scott, the contractual claim against Tsien Wui is basedon a continuing warranty for the lifetime of the building so the limitation period does not begin to run until the end of the lifetimeof the building. I have already recited the terms of the warranty. It was that Tsien Wui had exercised and would exercise all reasonableskill and care in the design, the selection of materials and goods and in satisfying any performance specification or requirement.Clause 2.15 says that Tsien Wui 'will be expected to guarantee the fixing for the life of the building bearing in mind the typhoonconditions in Hong Kong.' The only thing we know about this guarantee is that Gammon did not want it. There is no evidence that itwas asked for, or given by Tsien Wui to anyone. Even if one assumes that, by tendering, Tsien Wui impliedly gave that guarantee tothe Bank, that is not the basis for the Bank's contractual claim. That claim is based fairly and squarely on the failure to exercisethe skill and care I have mentioned, and that only in relation to the satisfaction of any performance specification or requirement.Mr Scott expressly conceded that the claim is not based on an absolute obligation to guarantee that the cladding would not fail duringthe lifetime of the building. The failure to exercise skill and care upon which the claim is based could not have happened certainlyafter the cladding was completed in 1982."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> I do not see how it is possible on any fair reading of clause 2.15 to come to any other conclusion than the one arrived at by theJudge.

It never was and that was the end of thematter.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> The way that the Judge proceeded was to hold that TW owed a duty of care to adequately supervise Mr. Ragaglini's work. He put itthis way at p. 12 of his judgment.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In the ordinary course, a principal is not responsible in tort for the negligence of an independent contractor such as Mr Ragaglini.Mr Scott, however argues that the task that was delegated to Mr Ragaglini was not the sort of thing that can be delegated withoutthe principal remaining responsible. There is no doubt that the law does contemplate cases of this kind, although the selection ofthose cases seems to be somewhat arbitrary. All I can say is that I do not consider that the matter before me is the kind of casein which, as a matter of policy, the principal should be liable in tort for the negligence of his independent contractor.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Mr Scott also seeks to argue that Tsien Wui was itself negligent in that it failed to instruct Mr Ragaglini properly, it failed tocheck if Mr Ragaglini was properly qualified and it failed to ensure that Mr Ragaglini followed CP 298. These are particulars ofnegligence that should have been pleaded. They were not pleaded in spite of Tsien Wui asking specifically for such particulars. Itis too late, in my view, to seek to raise then now. In any event, I do not think these allegations can be said to be negligence.The Bank, through Palmer and Turner, knew about Tsien Wui's ignorance and that it would need to rely on Mr Ragaglini, Palmer andTurner knew just what Tsien Wui and Mr Ragaglini were going to do, Palmer and Turner knew that Mr Ragaglini was purporting to usesome American system, Palmer and Turner interviewed Mr Ragaglini, and Palmer and Turner gave its blessing to what Tsien Wui weredoing.

It is not possible to divorce the duty in tort from the duty in contract. This is apparent from a passage from the speechof Lord Goff at p.180 of <strong>Henderson v. Merrett</strong> cited earlier in this judgment and also from a later passage at p.192 of the same speech.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"So far as <em>Hedley Byrne</em> itself is concerned, Mr. Kaye reads the speeches as restricting the principle of assumption of responsibility there established tocases where there is no contract; indeed, on this he tolerates no dissent, stating (at p. 706) that 'unless one reads <em>[Hedley Byrne]</em> with deliberate intent to find obscure or ambiguous passages' it will not bear the interpretation favoured by Oliver J. I must confesshowever that, having studied yet again the speeches in <em>Hedley Byrne</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] A.C. 465</a> in the light of Mr. Kaye's critique, I remain of the opinion that Oliver J.'s reading of them is justified. It is, I suspect, a matterof the angle of vision with which they are read. For here, I consider, Oliver J. was influenced not only by what he read in the speechesthemselves, notably the passage from Lord Devlin's speech at pp. 528-529 (quoted above), but also by the internal logic reflectedin that passage, which led inexorably to the conclusion which he drew. Mr. Kaye's approach involves regarding the law of tort assupplementary to the law of contract, i.e. as providing for a tortious liability in cases where there is no contract. Yet the lawof tort is the general law, out of which the parties can, if they wish, contract; and, as Oliver J. demonstrated, the same assumptionof responsibility may, and frequently does, occur in a contractual context. Approached as a matter of principle, therefore, it isright to attribute to that assumption responsibility, together with its concomitant reliance, a tortuous liability, and then to inquirewhether or not that liability is excluded by the contract cause the latter is inconsistent with it. This is the reasoning which OliverJ., as I understand it, found implicit, where not explicit, in the speeches in Hedley Byrne. With his conclusion I respectfully agree.But even if I am wrong in this, I am of the opinion that this House should now, if necessary, develop the principle of assumptionof responsibility as stated in <em>Hedley Byrne</em> to its logical conclusion so as to make it clear that a tortious duty of care may arise not only in cases where the relevant servicesare rendered gratuitously, but also where they are rendered under a contract. This indeed is the view expressed by my noble and learnedfriend, Lord Keith of Kinkel, in <em>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 A.C. 398</a>, 466, in a speech with which all the other members of the Appellate Committee agreed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> I will now consider the question of limitation.

Construction ofthe building was commenced in 1981 and the certificate of practical completion was issued on 7th March 1983. The 2nd Defendants werethe architects who designed the building and had overall responsibility for the construction. The main contractor has not been aparty to this Action. The 1st Defendant was the Nominated Sub-contractor for the installation of the granite cladding.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> Action was commenced on 20th June 1994 against the 1st Defendant for breach of contract and in negligence relating to the designand installation of the granite cladding. On 25th May 1996, Action was commenced against the 2nd to 5th Defendants, also for breachof contract and in negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> The trial of this Action took place in May and June 1997 and on 25th June 1997 judgment was entered for the Plaintiff against the2nd to 5th Defendants for the sum of HK$38,502,951.85 being the cost of re-cladding the building and associated consultants' fees.The Action against the 1st Defendant failed and as a consequence, the third party proceedings which the 1st Defendant had broughtagainst the 2nd to 5th Defendants were dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">The issues on this appeal</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> There are two major groups of issues on this appeal. The first is whether the 1st Defendant is liable to the Plaintiff in tort and,as a consequence, liable to make contribution to any damages awarded against the 2nd to 5th Defendants. The other issues on thisappeal are whether any Action against the Defendants is statute-barred.</p>    <p class="heading">Liability of the 1st Defendant</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="pseudopara" id="p86">86.</a> Although any liability of the 1st Defendant would be to the Plaintiff in the Action, it was Counsel for the 2nd to 5th Defendantswho made the major arguments in favour of liability against the 1st Defendant. For the main part, Counsel for the Plaintiff was preparedto adopt the arguments of Counsel for the 2nd to 5th Defendants. Should liability on the part of the 1st Defendant be found, the2nd to 5th Defendants would claim contribution from the 1st Defendant as joint tortfeasors liable for the same damage.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> As I have indicated, the Action brought by the Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant was framed in contract and tort. There was nodispute in this Court that any Action in contract was statute-barred.</p>    <p><em>The damage complained of was economic loss</em></p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> The essence of the Plaintiff's complaint in respect of the cladding was that it had deteriorated to such an extent that it had tobe replaced with new cladding and new fixing means. The Plaintiff complained that there were semi-elliptical shaped spalls and crackingaround what were referred to as the "split tail" anchor positions of the fixing brackets which held the cladding panels in position.There was isolated vertical cracking and spalling particularly along the vertical stone panel edges and some at the mid span of thepanels. It was said that, as a result, the external granite cladding of the building was damaged and caused a threat or danger tothe health or safety of the occupants of, and other persons or property in the vicinity of, the building. As such, the damage whichwas the subject of complaint was damage to the building which had been constructed.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> It is unnecessary to trace the development of the law of negligence in relation to the question as to whether damage to a buildingconstitutes damage recoverable under normal principles of negligence or whether it constitutes economic loss. It suffices to saythat as a result of the more recent cases in particular <strong>D. &amp; F. Estates Ltd &amp; others v. Church Commissioners for England and others</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20AC%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 A.C. 177</a> and <strong>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 A.C. 398</a>, it is now settled that the damage occasioned by the defective construction of the building is to be considered as economic loss.The reason, put shortly, is that there has been no damage either to persons or other property; the building itself never existedotherwise than as a defective building. As such therefore, any loss which has been occasioned to the owner of the building is diminutionin the value of the building by reason of any defect.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> In this regard, there is a clear parallel with goods. If goods are made with a latent defect such that they cause damage, eitherto a person or other property, any loss is recoverable in negligence on the reasonable foreseeability test: see <strong>Donoghue v. Stevenson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) A.C. 562.</a> If, however, a product which is defective is manufactured, then short of unforeseen injury to person or property taking place, theonly loss which the purchaser or owner of that product has suffered is the cost of either rectifying the defect or, at worst, thewhole value of the product.</p>    <p><em>Recoverability of economic loss in negligence</em></p>    <p><a name="p91" class="pseudopara" id="p91">91.</a> The law of negligence in relation to the recovery of damages for economic loss has again been the subject of some development. Predicated,perhaps, in the case of <strong>Nocton v. Lord Ashburton</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1914%5d%20AC%20932" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1914] A.C. 932</a>, the recoverability of damages for economic loss based on the tort of negligence was thoroughly examined in the case of <strong>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] A.C. 465.</a> That case concerned the giving of faulty financial information by a bank. The House of Lords held that the economic loss which wassuffered by the Plaintiff could be recoverable where there was a proximity of the parties by reason of a special relationship. Therehad to be an assumption of risk as Lord Morris put it at p.502 of the report :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"My Lords, I consider that it follows and that it should now be regarded as settled that if someone possessed of a special skill undertakes,quite irrespective of contract, to apply that skill for the assistance of another person who relies upon such skill, a duty of carewill arise. The fact that the service is to be given by means of or by the instrumentality of words can make no difference. Furthermore,if in a sphere in which a person is so placed that others could reasonably rely upon his judgment or his skill or upon his abilityto make careful inquiry, a person takes it upon himself to give information or advice to, or allows his information or advice tobe passed on to, another person who, as he knows or should know, will place reliance upon it, then a duty of care will arise."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The Junior Books case</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> In the case of <strong>Junior Books Ltd. v. Veitchi Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20AC%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) A.C. 520</a> the requirement of a sufficiently close proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant and in particular the reliance upon skilland experience of the defendant was referred to by the House of Lords, see for example, Lord Roskill at p.546 B-D. That was a casewhere a sub-contractor who had installed defective flooring had been sued in negligence for the loss occasioned to the building ownerin having to replace the defective flooring. It was said that the relationship between the sub-contractor and the building ownerhad been in "as close a commercial relationship ..... as it was possible to envisage short of privity of contract." There had beenno direct contractual relationship but clearly specific reliance on the Defendant's skill had been placed by the building owner whohad had the building built for it. Because of the reliance on the flooring contractor's skill, there was that sufficient proximityrelationship.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> However, the decision in the <strong>Junior Books</strong> case was also in part based upon the reasoning in <strong>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] A.C. 728</a> which has subsequently been overruled in <strong>Murphy v.

Lord Bridge, for example, in his speech used the expression"special relationship of proximity" on at least five occasions.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> Whereas the <strong>Murphy</strong> case was concerned primarily with the liability alleged to be incurred by a local authority, the application of the principles ofthat case are clearly wider.</p>    <p class="heading">Was there a special relationship of proximity between the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff?</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> In order to determine whether there was a special relationship of proximity between the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff, 3 thingsmust be considered (a) what was the damage; (b) what was the cause of that damage and (c) whether there has been an assumption ofliability in respect of the subject matter of the cause of complaint. In respect of the damage, that, as I have already alluded to,was economic loss. The immediate cause of complaint was the defective cladding. Since the cladding was part of the building and thebuilding had only ever existed with that cladding, it was economic loss. Important for this case however is the next considerationnamely what was the cause of the defects exhibited by the cladding. In this respect, it is necessary to consider the facts as foundby the Judge below.</p>    <p class="heading">The findings of the Judge</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> The Judge first considered the question as to why the cladding failed. There were six experts who were called by the parties. Tosome extent, they were in agreement as to their evidence. There was a meeting of the technical experts prior to the trial and theyissued a record of their agreement. Save in three respects, their conclusions in the record of agreement were unanimous.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> The expert who had reservations on three of the points was a Mr. John Perry who had been called on behalf of the 2nd Defendant, Palmerand Turner. He alone put the blame for the failure of the cladding upon the manner of installation and not on the design. The Judgesaid that the impression he gained from Mr. Perry's evidence was that "he was arguing a case for (the architects) as an advocate,rather than giving evidence as an objective expert." The Judge having considered his evidence rejected it. The Judge's conclusionwas "that it was much more likely that the designer of the cladding system had simply made mistakes and that those mistakes weresuch that no competent designer purporting to have specialist skills in this field should have made."</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="pseudopara" id="p99">99.</a> In coming to his conclusion that the design of the cladding system was faulty the Judge did not identify precisely what those faultswere. One passage in the judgment which gives some clue to the factors which the Judge may have thought relevant was the passageon page 11 where, in speaking of the Italian architect who was called in by the 2nd Defendant, the Judge said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Even a cursory reading of CP 298 would have provided the guidance needed to avoid the errors into which Mr Ragaglini fell."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p100" class="pseudopara" id="p100">100.</a> It will be necessary to examine the nature of the design faults later; but for present purposes, it suffices to say that the defectivenature of the cladding was caused by design faults.</p>    <p class="heading">Was there an assumption of responsibility in respect of the design of the cladding system?</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="pseudopara" id="p101">101.</a> The Judge then went on to consider where the responsibility for the design of the cladding system lay. In examining the evidence,the Judge below quite understandably attached much more importance to the contemporaneous documents than the oral evidence of whathad happened something like 16 years before the trial of the Action. He examined the contractual documents and in particular Clause2.24 of the Specification which put on the cladding sub-contractor the responsibility for providing shop drawings of the typicaljoints and back-up material, the location and kind of control and thermal movement joints, the location and kind of pressure relievingjoints, the angles, cramps, dowels and other accessories, and the jointing systems and patterns. The 2nd Defendant's explanationfor imposing these tasks on the cladding sub-contractor was that they, the architects, did not have sufficient expertise to undertakethis work themselves. The Judge came to the conclusion that, as a matter of fact, during the period leading up to the acceptanceof its tender, Tsien Wui, the 1st Defendant, did undertake the responsibility for the design of the cladding system.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="pseudopara" id="p102">102.</a> The relevant dates in respect of the contract for the cladding system were as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="pseudopara" id="p103">103.</a> The tender documents are dated 16th February 1981. The 1st Defendant was a tenderer for the cladding system. If the tender were tobe successful there would be a sub-contract between itself and the main contractor. The tender documents included a form of agreementbetween the employer namely the Plaintiff and the sub-contractor which was required to be completed as part of the tender process.That Agreement provided, inter alia, as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Sub-Contractor has exercised and will exercise all reasonable skill and care in :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) the design of the Sub-Contract Works insofar as the Sub-Contract Works have been or will be designed by the Sub-Contractor; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b) the selection of materials and goods for the Sub-Contract Works insofar as such materials and goods have been or will be selectedby the Sub-Contractor; and</p>            <p class="quote">(c) the satisfaction of any performance specification or requirement insofar as such performance specification or requirement is includedor referred to in the tender of the Sub-Contractor as part of the description of the Sub-Contract Works."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p104" class="pseudopara" id="p104">104.</a> In paragraph 2.15 of the specification for the works it was provided that the fixing for the granite shall be in accordance withthe recommendations of C.P. 298:1972.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="pseudopara" id="p105">105.</a> By a letter of the 5th May, the contractor, Gammon, informed the 1st Defendant that its tender had been successful. It seems thaton the 18th May or thereabouts the direct Agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant which I have just referred to wassigned.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="pseudopara" id="p106">106.</a> The exact effect of that Agreement may be open to questions of interpretation particularly in respect of the words "will be designedby the Sub-Contractor" since subsequent events show that the 1st Defendant did not itself design the cladding system.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="pseudopara" id="p107">107.</a> The main contract between the Plaintiff and the main contractor was dated 25th May 1981 but the sub-contract between the main contractorand the sub-contractor Tsien Wui was not effective until August of that year.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="pseudopara" id="p108">108.</a> The judgment goes on to deal with the events which took place between the parties. One important matter which the Judge refers tois the letter of the 21st May from the contractor to the 2nd Defendant. That letter is important for two reasons. In the first place,the contractor made perfectly clear to the architects, the 2nd to 5th Defendants, that the 1st Defendant should not be responsiblefor the design work as it was outside the scope of its experience and indeed the relevant experience was not available in Hong Kong.The letter then went on to say that these matters were of no mean importance and had to be taken seriously not least because therehad apparently been failures of cladding systems in buildings overseas. Finally, the contractor refused, point blank, to accept theclause regarding any lifetime guarantee by the 1st Defendant and said that if such was required, it would have to be given directlybetween the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff. I should note here that that guarantee was apparently never given. This is again, perhaps,significant in view of the fact that it is referred to in paragraph 2.15 of the specification. The Judge noted in respect of thisletter that one of Palmer and Turner's employees appears to have put a note on the letter; that note, to my mind, indicates, perhaps,a lack of appreciation of the seriousness of the points that were made by the contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="pseudopara" id="p109">109.</a> The judgment then goes on to indicate how in a meeting of 5th June 1981 the contractor expressed serious concern about the fixingdetails of the external granite. The minutes recorded that the architect would liaise with the contractor and the 1st Defendant andadvise in due course. It was also agreed on the contractor's suggestion that the shop drawings would be submitted directly to thearchitect for inspection.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="pseudopara" id="p110">110.</a> On the 11th June, the 1st Defendant wrote to the contractor, with a copy to the architects, submitting shop drawings and saying thatthe final shop drawings as well as the fixing method will be re-submitted at the end of the month with the overseas consultants.It appears from that letter that it is clear that the parties were adopting what was called the "American Standards". Although thepapers do not contain any precise identification as to what those standards, it seems from the evidence that they were Marble Instituteof America standards. Later in June, the contractor wrote again to the architects in terms which could only be regarded as expressingconcern about the design process and the failure to follow the recommendations of CP 298. In early July, there was a meeting at theoffices of the architect between the 1st Defendant, someone from the main contractor and Mr. Ragaglini. Mr. Ragaglini was an independentarchitect engaged by the 1st Defendant. He came from Italy for the specific purpose of designing the cladding. At least one documentstill remains from that meeting which, as the Judge found, was on a balance of probabilities made by Mr. Ragaglini. Given the notationon it, I doubt that any other conclusion could have been come to. The Judge's conclusion in respect of all this was "In my view,the whole weight of the evidence points to Mr. Ragaglini having come to Hong Kong to design the system."</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="pseudopara" id="p111">111.</a> Although in the course of argument, the 2nd to 5th Defendants' Counsel attempted to suggest that simply because his clients had metMr. Ragaglini in a conference, it was not sufficient to show that his clients were aware that the design work for the cladding systemwas being done by Mr. Ragaglini as an independent contractor of the 1st Defendant, those submissions were made without any referenceto the evidence and come no way near being able to disturb the Judge's clear finding of fact. The Judge's conclusion at pages 11and 12 of his judgment was as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There is no doubt in my mind that, on the evidence of the experts, other than that of Mr. Perry, Mr. Ragaglini did not do his jobwith reasonable skill and care. Even a cursory reading of CP 298 would have provided the guidance needed to avoid the errors intowhich Mr Ragaglini fell. But Mr. Ragaglini was an independent consultant engaged by Tsien Wui, not an employee. Gammon and Palmerand Turner knew that Tsien Wui did not have the expertise to design the system itself. Even if the Bank did not know this directly- and it may have done because the minutes of the meeting of 16 April 1981 indicate the Bank's concern with supervision and thatit knew of some Italian involvement - it knew it through Palmer and Turner, who were the Bank's agents for just this sort of purpose.Palmer and Turner also knew that, to overcome this disability, Tsien Wui would engage an Italian expert. The Bank, through its agent,raised no difficulty about this, and, after interviewing him, approved of Mr. Ragaglini."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p112" class="pseudopara" id="p112">112.</a> Even if it is challenged by Mr. Thomas S.C. on behalf of the 2nd to 5th Defendants that there may not have been any specific approval,in the sense of an "imprimatur" from either the Plaintiff or the 2nd Defendant as to Mr. Ragaglini, it is clear that they acceptedMr. Ragaglini as the person undertaking the work, work which as I have already pointed out the 2nd Defendant was at pains to giveevidence that it was incompetent to do. Indeed the 2nd Defendant, as the architect on behalf of the Plaintiff, raised no objectionto what Mr. Ragaglini was doing or the drawings which they clearly knew he was preparing. The learned Judge went on at the foot ofpage 12 to say :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Bank, through Palmer and Turner, knew about Tsien Wui's ignorance and that it would need to rely on Mr. Ragaglini, Palmer andTurner knew just what Tsien Wui and Mr. Ragaglini were going to do, Palmer and Turner knew that Mr. Ragaglini was purporting to usesome American system, Palmer and Turner interviewed Mr. Ragaglini, and Palmer and Turner gave its blessing to what Tsien Wui weredoing. The Bank cannot now, in my view, criticise what Tsien Wui did, knowing what they were doing through Palmer and Turner, andapproving of it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p113" class="pseudopara" id="p113">113.</a> Against those findings which in my view are fully supported by the evidence, the argument put forward by the 2nd to 5th Defendantsand the Plaintiff in trying to impose tortious liability in negligence upon the 1st Defendant was to try to ascribe to the causeof action in negligence factors imported from the law of contract. If the 2nd to 5th Defendants and the Plaintiff were able to excludethe 1st Defendant's profession of a lack of any expertise in the design of the cladding, the correspondence, the meetings and theactions which actually took place and rely simply upon the contractual documents, they might be in a position to muster a case.</p>    <p class="heading">Whether liability in negligence can only be excluded by a contractual provision?</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="pseudopara" id="p114">114.</a> At the heart of the 2nd to 5th Defendants' argument lay the submission that when liability in negligence arises out of a specialrelationship the tortious duty of care can only be restricted or limited by a clearly worded "contractual provision". That contentionis wrong for two reasons. On a very facile plane, it elevates to a contractual status, and seeks to import concepts and rules fromthe law of contract to, the law of tort relating to negligence. In the second place, in relation to the action in negligence saidto arise out of a special relationship it confounds the question as to whether there has been an "assumption of responsibility" withthe question of whether there has been a disclaimer. The argument was founded upon quotations out of context from the speech of LordGoff in <strong>Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Limited</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 A.C. 145</a> and seeks to apply those quotations without regard either to what Lord Goff was saying or to the reasoning and the issues to whichthe relevant parts of his speech were directed.</p>    <p class="heading">The Henderson case</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="pseudopara" id="p115">115.</a> The <strong>Henderson</strong> case concerned preliminary issues in three Actions brought on behalf of Names against managing and members' agents at Lloyd's. Importantamongst those issues was whether the managing agents who were also members' agents owed Names a non-contractual duty to carry outtheir underwriting functions with reasonable skill and care. Other issues arose in the appeal but crucial to the questions whichLord Goff was considering in the passages from which quotations were taken which were relied upon by Counsel for the 2nd to 5th Defendantswas the issue as to whether tortious liability existed. One of the reasons why it was important to consider the existence of tortiousliability was that, if successful, the Names could take advantage of the more advantageous position on limitation in respect of tort.For the purposes of the appeal, there had been no dispute that there had been an implied term in the contracts between the Namesand the agents that a duty to exercise care and skill in the exercise of the relevant functions under the agreements was to be implied.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="pseudopara" id="p116">116.</a> It was against that background that the question had to be considered as to whether a like obligation rested upon the managing agentsin tort. If managing agents who were also members' agents owed such a duty of care in tort direct to the Names, the effect wouldbe that the direct Names would have alternative remedies in contract and tort against the managing agents; if the managing agentswho were not also members' agents owed a duty of care in tort to indirect names, there would be a corresponding right of action tothe indirect names notwithstanding a contractual connection between the indirect names and the managing agents.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="pseudopara" id="p117">117.</a> The argument on behalf of the agents which was presented to the House of Lords and with which Lord Goff was dealing was fundamental.It was said that a duty of care did not exist in tort because the imposition of such a duty upon the agents was inconsistent withthe contractual relationship between the parties. Lord Goff undertook an extensive analysis of the position in this regard. He notedfor example that in France the concurrence of claims in contract and tort was outlawed. The position in England had, at one time,been thought to be similar. Cases such as <strong>Groom v. Crocker</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1939%5d%201%20KB%20194" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1939] 1 K.B. 194</a> were cited as authority for that proposition. Indeed, such high authority as Sir Wilfrid Greene M.R. had held that "The relationshipof solicitor and client is a contractual one. It was by virtue of that relationship that the duty arose, and it had no existenceapart from that relationship."</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="pseudopara" id="p118">118.</a> It is unnecessary to go into whether or not the decision in Groom v. Crocker is explicable in the context of the law as to negligenceand the type of damage which was recoverable for that tort in 1939. It suffices to say that, as recorded by Lord Goff, it was notuntil the decision of Oliver J. in <strong>Midland Bank Trust Co. Ltd v. Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20Ch%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] Ch. 384</a> that a clear position was taken that a solicitor could be liable to his client for negligence in either contract or in tort.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="pseudopara" id="p119">119.</a> Lord Goff also referred to the position as it existed in a number of other jurisdictions including Ireland, New Zealand, Australiaand the United States of America. It is to be noted that a common theme running through those jurisdictions was that it is in onlycomparatively recent times that the concurrent jurisdiction in contract and tort was accepted.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="pseudopara" id="p120">120.</a> Before examining the historical and comparative law as to the ability to sustain concurrent actions in contract and tort, Lord Goffhad analysed the factors which gave rise in the law of tort to an action based on negligence for economic loss. Not unnaturally,Lord Goff took as his starting point the decision of the House of Lords in <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong>. He cited the passage in the speech of Lord Morris at pages 502-503 to which I have already referred.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="pseudopara" id="p121">121.</a> From that, Lord Goff went on to consider the principles which underlay the cause of action for the tort of negligence. In his analysis,it rested upon a relationship between the parties which could be general or specific to the particular transaction and which mayor may not be contractual in nature. Lord Goff acknowledged that in some cases criticism had been made of the concept of "assumptionof responsibility" as being "unlikely to be a helpful or realistic test in most cases". Nevertheless, he considered that in casessuch as those which he was considering recourse could be had to such a concept which had been adopted, in one form or another, bythe whole of the House of Lords in <strong>Hedley Byrne</strong>. He considered that an objective test should be applied when asking the question whether in a particular case responsibility shouldbe held to have been assumed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff; this was especially true in contexts concerned with a liability whichwas said to have arisen under contract or in a situation equivalent to a contract. On that basis, Lord Goff considered that therewas no difficulty in a person who had assumed responsibility being liable in damages in respect of economic loss which flowed fromnegligent performance of the relevant services. It is to be noted that at this stage, at page 181E of his speech, Lord Goff said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The concept indicates too that in some circumstances, for example where the undertaking to furnish the relevant service is givenon an informal occasion, there may be no assumption of responsibility; and likewise that an assumption of responsibility may be negativedby an appropriate disclaimer."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p122" class="pseudopara" id="p122">122.</a> That statement, apart from others, was latched onto by Counsel for the 2nd to 5th Defendants as being a statement of law that theassumption of responsibility might only be negatived by a contractual disclaimer. That however is clearly not what Lord Goff wassaying. In the circumstances of the cases which he was considering the starting points for considering the bases of the relationshipsbetween the parties were the contracts; there were no oral statements or other negotiations or pre-contractual or post-contractualdocuments which were being considered by the House at that stage. Lord Goff in commencing his consideration of this aspect of thecase had, as I have pointed out, based himself on the three-fold premise that where a person (1) possessed a special skill; (2) undertookto apply that skill for the assistance of another and (3) that other relied upon that skill, there were circumstances where the lawwould hold that there had been an assumption of responsibility. That assumption of responsibility was therefore quite irrespectiveof contractual terms, albeit the only known contact between the parties was contractual.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="pseudopara" id="p123">123.</a> Lord Goff was well alive to and mentioned many of the differences between the action in contract and the action for negligence. Atpage 185 of the report he alluded to the different rules as to remoteness of damage which are less restrictive in tort than in contractand to the availability of the opportunity to obtain leave to serve proceedings out of jurisdiction. He had previously referred tothe differences in the effect of the rules as to limitation of actions. Two features were referred to by Lord Goff which are particularlypertinent to the present case. One was the right of contribution between joint tortfeasors which would not be available to thosewho had severally broken their separate contracts. This was the guiding feature which encouraged counsel for the 2nd to 5th Defendantsto take up the cudgel so vehemently on the Plaintiff's behalf against the 1st Defendant. If the 1st Defendant's liability to thePlaintiff were simply in contract, limitation periods aside, the 2nd to 5th Defendants would be unable to claim contribution fromthe 1st Defendant. Naturally, of course, the period of limitation is also a highly relevant matter in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="pseudopara" id="p124">124.</a> I find it unnecessary to go through all the passages in Lord Goff's speech which Counsel for the 2nd to 5th Defendants relied upon.Many of them were tenuous in the extreme, even when the statements were taken out of context. But when seen in context, for examplethe passage at page 193, the argument was fallacious. The point Lord Goff was dealing with was the argument that a liability couldnot exist in tort as well as in contract. By saying that a person could contract out of liability for negligence, Lord Goff was notsaying that the only basis upon which assumption of liability in tort could not have occurred is if the Defendant had contractedout of it. He was merely saying that if he had contracted out of it, no liability would exist.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="pseudopara" id="p125">125.</a> The argument, as presented by Counsel for the 2nd to 5th Defendants, was to put the cart before the horse. It was to equate the absenceof an exclusion of liability for negligence in the contractual documents as being the sole ground upon which it could be said thatthere had been no assumption of liability.</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="pseudopara" id="p126">126.</a> In my view, however, the law of negligence is the law of negligence. It is not some sort of hybrid importing concepts from the lawof contract to suit the case of a co-defendant who wishes to claim contribution or a Plaintiff who wishes to found an action.</p>    <p class="heading">Application of the test of Lord Morris</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="pseudopara" id="p127">127.</a> Reverting to the three-fold test of Lord Morris in the <em>Hedley Byrne</em> case as approved and adopted by Lord Goff, it seems to me that the 1st Defendant did not possess any special skill in relation tothe design of the cladding and indeed the 1st Defendant had made perfectly clear to the relevant parties, both the 2nd Defendantand the Plaintiff, that it did not possess such skill and would need to employ a consultant. Nor was the result of the arrangementsbetween the parties that the 2nd Defendant would apply any such skill for the assistance either of the Plaintiff or the 2nd Defendant;the upshot of the arrangements was that the 1st Defendant would engage an overseas independent contractor to do the design work andthe 2nd Defendant would approve the design work. Still less was any reliance placed upon any skill that the 1st Defendant might besupposed to have had. The reliance was placed on Mr. Ragaglini's skills whom all parties knew perfectly well were being importedbecause the 1st Defendant (and for that matter the 2nd to 5th Defendants) did not have the relevant design skill in what appearsto have been a comparatively new type of construction. Very likely that skill did not exist in Hong Kong at all at that time.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="pseudopara" id="p128">128.</a> Although the conclusions which I have reached are expressed in a slightly different way to the way the Judge expressed them I considerthat the Judge came to the correct conclusion in respect of liability alleged against Tsien Wui.</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="pseudopara" id="p129">129.</a> There are 2 further aspects on this part of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="pseudopara" id="p130">130.</a> Having reached the conclusion that the 1st Defendant did not assume responsibility in the relevant respect the general rule thatan employer is not answerable for the wrongs or negligence of an independent contractor would apply.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="pseudopara" id="p131">131.</a> One further point raised by Counsel for the 1st Defendant was that no reliance was placed on the 1st Defendant in respect of thedesign of the cladding system because the 2nd Defendant was responsible for checking and approving the design details and the drawings.Hence any reliance was placed on the 2nd Defendant and not on the 1st Defendant. That seems to me a point which might be raised ifthe question as to the amount of any contribution between the tortfeasors were to be relevant. It does not seem to be a point whichwould absolve a party in the position of the 1st Defendant if the true analysis were that it had assumed responsibility.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="pseudopara" id="p132">132.</a> The factual basis, however, is slightly obscure. It was the 2nd Defendant's case that they had no expertise in respect of this typeof cladding and would also have relied on an overseas expert. It was put to Mr. Fong, the director of the 1st Defendant who appearsto have had in practice substantial control of that company, that he was well aware of the 2nd Defendant's admitted lack of expertise.There was, however, no finding in this respect.</p>    <p class="heading">The limitation period</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="pseudopara" id="p133">133.</a> Under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4">Cap. 4</a>, actions founded on tort shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of actionaccrued.

Those three components are as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The existence of a duty to take care which is owed by the defendant to the complainant;</p>        <p>(2) The failure to attain that standard of care thereby committing a breach of the duty; and</p>        <p>(3) Damage, which is both causally connected with the breach and recognised by the law, has been occasioned to the complainant.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Damage necessary for cause of Actin in negligence to accrue</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="pseudopara" id="p136">136.</a> For the cause of action in negligence to be complete, it is, therefore, necessary that damage should have been occasioned to theplaintiff. Three points could be made upon this. The first is that it must be relevant damage. The second is that it is of coursenecessary to identify the damage and thirdly, not all damage need have been suffered by the date of the commencement of the action,it being sufficient that damage has been suffered; recovery can be claimed on the basis of further damage that will be suffered.</p>    <p class="heading">The Nykredit case</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="pseudopara" id="p137">137.</a> The case of <strong>Nykredit Mortgage Bank PLC v.

In thecase the House of Lords considered the question of when a cause of action accrues in an action for negligence based on economic loss.Lord Nicholls at 1631D pointed out that naturally the first step in assessing when the first measurable relevant loss was sustainedwas to identify the relevant measure of loss. The next step in the process was to consider when that loss had occurred.</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="pseudopara" id="p138">138.</a> Although the House of Lords was considering the question of a negligent valuation and its effect on the value of a property, theprinciples which were applied appear to be applicable in other cases. Lord Nicholls pointed out that the moment at which a loss isrevealed will depend on the facts of each case. He went on to say that the difficulties may be evidential and practical but are notdifficulties in principle. It was not necessary in his judgment that the lender, for example, should have realised his security andfully quantified his loss: the Court would always do its best to assess a loss if disaster were evident and the plaintiff were tosue without waiting for the full effect of the damage.</p>    <p class="heading">Nature of the damage</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="pseudopara" id="p139">139.</a> As pleaded in the Statement of Claim, as I have referred to above, the damage in respect of which the claim is made is the economicloss consequent upon the physical damage occasioned by the faulty design of the external granite cladding of the building which hasresulted in the cladding having to be removed and replaced by new cladding. The learned judge below held that the root cause of thisphysical damage was a design fault. He rejected the evidence of Mr. Perry, the expert on behalf of the 2nd to 5th Defendants whoput the cause of the physical damage as faulty construction. In that rejection and in finding that the cause of the physical damagewas faulty design, the Judge implicitly also rejected the suggestion which had been made that the physical damage was due to theinherent weakness in the cladding.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="pseudopara" id="p140">140.</a> All experts called by the parties in the action in their record of agreement put the nature of the damage to the cladding as havingthree elements. First, there were structural movements which included creep, drying shrinkage and thermal movements. Then there wasthe movements of the cladding, which included swelling which was considered to be small compared with the thermal movements, thermalcyclic movement and then some very small effects of load distortion and stress relief resultant upon the stone having been quarried.Lastly, there were fixing movements which included load deflection distortion.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="pseudopara" id="p141">141.</a> These matters were not dealt with by the Judge in his judgment and hence in commenting on them, it is necessary to observe cautionin the absence of having seen and heard the witnesses. It is, however, possible to point out that one major consideration was theinitial drying shrinkage of the concrete frame of the building itself. The evidence was that in the initial period after the completionof a concrete building, drying shrinkage of the concrete takes places. According to Mr. Kinnear, whose evidence favourably impressedthe Judge, the shrinkage over the first year can apparently amount to approximately 1.5 mm per storey height. What is termed "longterm creep" can also account for a significant change in the dimensions of the building. There can be rotation of floors and beamsat the corners of the edges of the building and the long term creep can also cause shortening of columns. Again, this movement islikely to take place shortly after the completion of the relevant structure. A period of 4 to 9 months is suggested.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="pseudopara" id="p142">142.</a> The cladding of the Plaintiff's building is attached to the structure of the building by means of fixing brackets. Obviously oneof the important factors that has to be taken into account is how soon after the completion of the building the cladding is attached.In this case, the evidence, such as it was, indicated the cladding was attached very soon after the construction of the concretestructure of the building. The inevitable inference would be that substantial shrinkage and creep effects must have occurred afterthe cladding had been attached.</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="pseudopara" id="p143">143.</a> The effect of what is termed "cyclic thermal fatigue" is apparently progressive. The natural heating and cooling of the granite claddingcauses stresses to occur and over a period of time the granite fails. Its failure is apparently slow at first but quickens later.The Black Restenburg (or Impala) granite used for the cladding in the building was, it seems at least as much as any other material,prone to the effects of thermal movement and stresses.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="pseudopara" id="p144">144.</a> Before us attempt was made in the course of argument particularly on behalf of the 2nd to 5th Defendants to suggest that the causeof the cladding failure was a failure to follow, paragraph 3.9.4 of that Code of Practice C.P.298:1972. I do not consider that theevidence as it emerged showed that that was the sole cause of failure. It is true that in relation to compression joints which aredesigned to take up the differential movement between the concrete structure and the cladding, paragraph 3.9.4 sets out that a clear13 mm width of joint is considered to be the minimum per floor. Nevertheless, it was agreed by the experts "CP298 as a Code of Practicedoes not have a mandatory status nor does it apply to all cladding types. Some departures from its recommendations are permittedprovided performance equivalence can be demonstrated."</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="pseudopara" id="p145">145.</a> It seems that Mr. Ragaglini had suggested that 6 mm joints would be provided for each floor with a 20 mm joint every six floors.From what can be determined that was the specification adopted. Again from the contemporaneous documents it would seem that Mr. Ragaglinihad suggested that the American standards should be adopted. It is not clear what those American standards were, what provisionswere made for fixing the cladding to the structure in those standards or how they catered for the differential movements in the variousbuilding materials. Although the size of the joints would at first blush appear to be an obvious factor which may have led to theeventual breakdown of the cladding, the figures which were produced in the various reports by the experts would lead to the conclusionthat even here much would depend upon the circumstances and in particular perhaps the period for drying out allowed, or not allowed,between the completion of the concrete structure and the fixing of the cladding.</p>    <p><a name="p146" class="pseudopara" id="p146">146.</a> It seems that the cladding was not only fixed to the structure prior to the completion of the main concrete structure but the claddingcommenced when the concrete structure had reached nine to ten storeys, it seems that the cladding may have progressed faster thanthe construction of the building. The effect of the latter fact would have been to allow almost no time for the shrinkage to takeplace during drying.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="pseudopara" id="p147">147.</a> Furthermore, there were other departures from the stated recommendations in the CP298 including the thickness of the cladding panels.It seems also that the fixing system for the cladding itself may have contributed to the breakdown of the cladding panels. Here therigidity of the fixing system seems to me to have been very likely to have been a contributing factor. Furthermore, the use of asingle bracket with opposite pointing tails may well have had a significant effect. If separate brackets had been used, the compressionmight not have been so great.</p>    <p><a name="p148" class="pseudopara" id="p148">148.</a> In summary, it seems that the conclusion arrived at by the Judge below that the damage was caused by design failures was correct.The effect of the design failure was probably made worse by the shortness of time allowed for drying of the main concrete structure.The further point which emerges from this is that the damage was progressive. Indeed, even after the writ had been issued, it waslikely that the damage would become worse. In those circumstances, the Judge considered it correct to award damages on the basisof replacement of the whole cladding and its fixing system and did not confine damages to the replacement of those panels which werebroken.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="pseudopara" id="p149">149.</a> The approach of the House of Lords in the <strong>Nykredit</strong> case to the question when the cause of damage occurred was, as I have mentioned, to decide first what the damage was and then todecide when that occurred. This would not only seem to have practical logic as its basis but to have the support of prior authority.The Nykredit case involved the overvaluation of property leading to the Plaintiff loaning excess funds. The date at which the Plaintiffsuffered the loss was therefore not difficult to determine. More difficulty, perhaps, arises in the case where the economic lossarises from the construction of a building based on faulty advice if the faultiness of the design is not at once apparent.</p>    <p class="heading">When did the loss occur?</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="pseudopara" id="p150">150.</a> The question thus arises as to when the loss occurred. The relevant loss is the diminution in the value of the asset occasioned bythe defects in that asset. Specifically in this case the loss, whether it is quantified as the full value of the cladding itselfor as the costs of its repair is that occasioned by the defects in the design of the cladding system.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="pseudopara" id="p151">151.</a> There have been a number of dates which have been suggested in the course of argument as being the dates relevant as to when thedamage which gave rise to the cause of action occurred. Amongst those, the important ones are as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The date when the negligent advice was given and acted upon;</p>        <p>(2) The date when the building was completed and paid for by the Plaintiff with its design defects inherent;</p>        <p>(3) The date when physical damage first occurred to the cladding whether or not that damage was noticed or noticeable by the Plaintiffor anybody else;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) The date when the physical damage to the cladding was evident or should have been evident; and</p>        <p>(5) The date when the financial loss was suffered to the extent that the repairs were carried out and paid for.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p152" class="pseudopara" id="p152">152.</a> At least one of those dates can, in my view, be discarded at once. It is not necessary that the loss should have been capitalisedto the extent that the repairs had been paid for or that the building had been sold at a loss. As Lord Hoffmann said at p.1639 ofthe <strong>Nykredit</strong> case, relevant loss is suffered when the Plaintiff is worse off by reason of the breach of duty of care than otherwise he would havebeen. In principle, there seems to me to be no reason why a Plaintiff who has suffered economic loss by reason of defective designof the building he has acquired could not retain that property together with its defects and suffer the damage of having a buildingwith a design defect. He would be worse off by bearing the burden of that.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="pseudopara" id="p153">153.</a> Despite the fact that the damage which is the subject of the cause of action is economic loss, if that economic loss is predicatedupon a design defect, the question which the Court has to answer in deciding when the damage occurred is when the Plaintiff sufferedby reason of defects in the design. The quantum of damage may differ, of course, depending upon the particular facts. Given the constructionof a building, for example, the occurrence of physical damage may perhaps be dependent upon outside causative factors and physicaldamage may or may not occur during the life of the building. Obviously if no physical damage occurs, the quantum of economic lossis considerably reduced.</p>    <p><a name="p154" class="pseudopara" id="p154">154.</a> If the defect in the design is such that inevitable physical damage will occur then it might be that it could be said that the lawshould look upon that damage as having already occurred when the building constructed according to the defective design is constructed.</p>    <p class="heading">The Pirelli Decision</p>    <p><a name="p155" class="pseudopara" id="p155">155.</a> Attention was drawn by Miss Gladys Li S.C., Counsel for the 1st Defendant, to the case of <strong>Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Faber &amp; Partners (a firm)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 A.C. 1.</a></p>    <p><a name="p156" class="pseudopara" id="p156">156.</a> The <strong>Pirelli</strong> case concerned an action by a factory owner who had engaged a firm of consulting engineers to advise on the construction of an additionto their factory. The addition included a new 160 ft chimney. Although the chimney was designed and supplied by the sub-contractor,the consulting engineers accepted responsibility for the design. The chimney was pre-caste and had a refractory lining of a new materialwhich proved unsuitable. The chimney developed cracks and later had to be partially demolished and replaced. The defendant consultingengineers admitted negligent passing of the design. At least by the time the case reached the House of Lords, therefore, there wasno dispute between the parties as to the liability of the Defendants in negligence. Whether or not the liability was admitted onthe basis of <strong>Anns</strong> does not seem to matter because the nexus between the parties would indicate that there was a sufficiently close relationship ofproximity that a duty of care, breach of which would give rise to liability for economic loss, would almost certainly have arisen.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="pseudopara" id="p157">157.</a> Criticism was raised by Counsel for the other parties that that decision had been overruled, impliedly if not explicitly, by theHouse of Lords in giving the decision in the <strong>Murphy</strong> case. That criticism is wrong. It is based on extrapolation from quotations of sentences and parts thereof out of context and failsto address the true issues that were decided in either the <strong>Anns</strong> case, the <strong>Murphy</strong> case or the <strong>Pirelli</strong> case.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="pseudopara" id="p158">158.</a> When Lord Keith in the <strong>Murphy</strong> case said that the <strong>Anns</strong> decision should be overruled and that all cases following <strong>Anns</strong> should be overruled, that was in the context of the specific principle in the <strong>Anns</strong> case with which the <strong>Murphy</strong> case was concerned. That can be seen from p.472 of the <strong>Murphy</strong> case. Lord Keith considered that the <strong>Anns</strong> case was wrongly decided as regards the scope of any private law duty of care resting upon local authorities in relation to theirfunction of taking steps to secure compliance with buildings bye laws or regulations. Specifically the authority owed no duty ofcare to the purchaser of a house of which the local authority had had a statutory duty to examine the plans. That was the matterthat was being dealt with in the Murphy case and that is what was overruled. What can be said, however, is that caution needs tobe adopted in considering the case because of the distinction between physical damage and economic loss.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="pseudopara" id="p159">159.</a> The issue in the <strong>Pirelli</strong> case was whether the limitation period ran from the date when the physical damage occurred, or from the time when it ought reasonablyto have been discovered. In the words of Lord Fraser it was whether in an action founded on negligence in the design or workmanshipof a building time ran for the purposes of limitation from a date before the damage to the building was discovered or ought withreasonable diligence to have been discovered.</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="pseudopara" id="p160">160.</a> The main point on the appeal was whether the decision of the Court of Appeal in <strong>Sparham-Souter v. Town and Country Developments (Essex) Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20QB%20858" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] Q.B. 858</a> had been correct. In that case a house had been built with inadequate foundations. The Court of Appeal had decided that the causeof action did not accrue until such time as the plaintiff discovered physical damage caused by the bad work. In so far as any reliancewas made on anything said in the Anns case, there was a reference at p.17 to the fact that in the Anns case, the cause of actionwas said to arise when the building was in such a state that there was a present or imminent danger to the health or safety of personsoccupying it. Lord Fraser then went on at the foot of p.17 of the report to draw attention to the fact that in the case he was dealingwith that was not the basis of the damage relied upon.</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="pseudopara" id="p161">161.</a> The reasoning for the decision in the <strong>Pirelli</strong> case is however instructive. In overruling the <strong>Sparham-Souter</strong> case the House of Lords was influenced particularly by the reasoning in <strong>Cartledge v. E. Jopling and Sons Ltd.</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20AC%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] A.C. 758.</a> The principle in that case was that a cause of action accrued in respect of a wrongful act that had caused personal injury even whenthat injury was unknown and could not be discovered by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiffs in the <strong>Pirelli</strong> case argued that it was possible in some cases that there was a period when a flaw or defect was latent, that could be followed bya period when the flaw or defect existed in some physical form that had not been discovered or could not be discovered followed bya period when the flaw or defect was obvious. The Plaintiffs in the <strong>Pirelli</strong> case had argued that no parallel could be drawn with the reasoning in the <strong>Cartledge</strong> case because in the <strong>Cartledge</strong> case, the period of latency did not exist and on the finding of the Court in the <strong>Cartledge</strong> case, the damage had existed from day 1, even though it might not have been discoverable: see page 10 of the report where the plaintiff'sargument is reported.</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="pseudopara" id="p162">162.</a> Lord Fraser at page 16 pointed out that a man who had inhaled particles of dust may unbeknown to him suffer from pneumoconiosis.It was clear that if he was in such a condition even though that was unknown to him, he had suffered damage which, in appropriatecircumstances, would constitute damage for the purpose of founding a cause of action. Likewise, Lord Fraser said at letter C :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Just as the owner of the house may sell the house before the damage is discovered, and may suffer no financial loss, so the man withthe injured body may die before pneumoconiosis becomes apparent, and he may also suffer no financial loss. But in both cases theyhave a damaged article when, but for the defendant's negligence, they would have a sound one."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p163" class="pseudopara" id="p163">163.</a> On that basis, Lord Fraser considered that damage would have occurred even if the person wronged was not aware of it. Lord Fraserthen went on to reinforce his position by reference to Lord Pearce's statement in Cartledge at pp.778-779 where he pointed out thatit would be an absurd position if a man who was suffering from pneumoconiosis did not have a cause of action because he did not knowof it but did have a cause of action immediately upon the taking of an x-ray photograph which revealed the damage. Lord Fraser thendrew the distinction between damage which had occurred to the Plaintiff's body, for example, by inhaling dust and the latent defectin a building.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="pseudopara" id="p164">164.</a> It is apparent from his consideration that as far as he was concerned, the damage to a plaintiff's body by the inhaling of dust wasimmediate. As regards a latent defect, it seems that the Judge considered that it was a question of fact in each case as to whetherthe latent defect was such that damage to the building was inevitable. He said for example "unless the defect is very gross, it maynever lead to any damage at all to the building." He likened a latent defect not to damage which had occurred to a person's bodybut to a natural weakness in the body which may never develop into a disease or injury. It was in that context that he said thatthe cause of action would not accrue until damage had actually occurred. That damage might consist of cracks or other defects cominginto existence even though the cracks might be undiscovered and undiscoverable. In considering this, he then said : "There may perhapsbe cases where the defect is so gross that the building is doomed from the start, where the owner's cause of action will accrue assoon as it is built ....." He said almost exactly the same two pages later at the foot of page 18 of his judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="pseudopara" id="p165">165.</a> Clearly what Lord Fraser was considering was the question of when physical damage occurred. Implicitly he regarded the physical damageas being the foundation of the plaintiff's right of action. It depended on the nature of the latent defect as to whether that damagewould be bound to occur or was such that it might only occur. If it were bound to occur then the law could look upon that damageas having occurred since it was bound to occur. But if the physical damage was not bound to occur but might occur, then unless itoccurred, it was not damage for the purposes of his consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="pseudopara" id="p166">166.</a> For the purposes of the facts of the <strong>Pirelli</strong> case, it did not matter from the point of view of the expiry of the limitation period as to whether the date of the completion ofthe building was taken or the date when the cracks must have appeared unbeknown to the plaintiff. On either date, the limitationperiod would have expired. The approach in the <strong>Pirelli</strong> case was the same in principle as that in the <strong>Nykredit</strong> case : first the nature of the damage was identified and then the date when it occurred was identified.</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="pseudopara" id="p167">167.</a> By concentrating on physical damage as the cause of action rather than the economic loss caused by the creation of a building whichhad design defects sight may have been lost of the fact that even a building with a latent defect may be less valuable to its ownereven though physical damage may not have occurred. As an illustration if per chance the plaintiff had wished to sell its bank buildingimmediately upon the completion thereof and a purchaser had not only had a physical survey carried out but had inspected the buildingplans and discovered that a proper allowance had not been made for shrinkage, creep and thermal expansion and that the fixing meanswere an inappropriate design when taking into account the thickness of the cladding such that the cladding may well fail, the valueof the building may well have diminished. In such circumstances, allowance would no doubt be demanded by the purchaser for the potentialhazard to the cladding. In principle, I see no reason why an economic loss of that nature should not be recoverable. Such a conclusionindeed seems to be precisely that to which Lord Keith came in the <strong>Murphy</strong> case at page 466F. If that were correct, the cause of action in this case would arise upon the completion of the building and thepayment therefor by the Plaintiff since the Plaintiff would have obtained a building with an inherent latent defect which may ormay not give rise to physical damage.</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="pseudopara" id="p168">168.</a> Such a conclusion that the original design of the building was such that the building was defective does not seem at variance withthe finding of the Judge. He said at amongst other places :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I believe, it is much more likely, as the other experts say, that the designer simply made mistakes; mistakes that no competent designerpurporting to have specialist skills in this field should have made." (page 3)</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The cause of the damage was the design by Mr. Ragaglini, which was inadequate to cope with movement." (page 14)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p169" class="pseudopara" id="p169">169.</a> Evidently, the Judge below considered that the defects in the design were such that physical damage was likely to be brought about.On this basis, I consider that the point of time at which the Plaintiff suffered economic loss by reason of the defective designwas the date when it acquired and paid for the building with the defective design. For the purposes of this case I take that to bethe date of practical completion namely 7th March 1983.</p>    <p class="heading">Alternative approach on the basis of physical change</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="pseudopara" id="p170">170.</a> If I were wrong in that approach and it would be necessary in order to bring an action for economic loss because of a defective designor construction of the building to show that damage had actually occurred to the building or was an inevitable consequence, thenit seems to me that on the facts of this case that, even if it could not be said that damage had occurred upon the completion ofthe building, it must have been so approximately two years thereafter. The cladding work was completed in July of 1982 and the occupationpermit was issued on 9th November 1982. From the evidence of the expert witnesses and in particular Mr. Kinnear, the witness calledon behalf of the Plaintiff, it is apparent that the effects of shrinkage due to drying and creep would effectively have reached theirmaxima around two years after the construction of the concrete frame. On the dates given that must have taken place by about July1984. Thereafter, it would seem from the expert evidence and the agreed facts that the main cause of the effects of the breakdownof the cladding was the cyclical thermal movement.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="pseudopara" id="p171">171.</a> It was Mr. Kinnear's evidence, for example, in Appendix F of his report that between 1985 and 1990, there would have been no discernibleincrease in damage above that which was derived from the initial shortening of the building caused by shrinkage and creep in thefirst two years. As a graph which he has exhibited in Appendix F shows, there does appear to have been some damage to the claddingin those early years. Indeed it is evident from Mr. Kinnear's oral evidence that his view was that if any person had inspected thebuilding with a view to purchasing it, at least about 1986 there must have been spalls in the cladding which would have been sufficientto alert a potential purchaser to have asked for assurances of some kind and probably required an expert to look at the buildingand try to explain the defects. In view of the knowledge available at the time, it might have been difficult to have found the appropriateexpert but nevertheless his evidence was supported by other experts including in particular Mr. Shillinglaw.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="pseudopara" id="p172">172.</a> In any event, it seems to me, on Mr. Kinnear's evidence which was to the effect that after the initial failure of cladding, the Restenburggranite was likely to fail increasingly after a period of ten years hence even if the cladding of the building was not doomed tofailure from the very beginning i.e. 1982, it must have been doomed to failure and in all probability did fail after the initialshrinkage and creep had taken place i.e. 1984. This was particularly so because this would have partly been dependent, apparently,on the short period between the completion of the concrete construction and the fixing of the granite. In Mr. Fong's evidence itshowed that there was hardly any delay between the completion of the concrete and the fixing of the granite. On this basis, it seemsthat physical defects in the cladding would have emerged at least by 1985. On that footing, the cause of action would have accruedmore than 6 years before the 1st July 1991 and the action would have been statute barred.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="pseudopara" id="p173">173.</a> The findings of the Judge himself confirm his view that physical damage would have been occurred from about 1984. For example hesaid at page 22 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The view of the experts is that physical damage to the cladding system started to occur within the first few years after 1982. Fromthen, over the years, the physical damage got worse until, at some uncertain time, risk of injury to the public was unacceptable."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then at page 25 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Regarding the marks on the granite cladding in 1984 and 1985, I do not accept that any reasonable owner seeing these marks wouldhave concluded that there were defects in the cladding justifying the calling in of an expert."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p174" class="pseudopara" id="p174">174.</a> This latter passage appears to accept the existence of physical damage at that time but is dealing with the question of whether itwould have put the building owner on notice to make investigations as to the cause of the damage.</p>    <p><em>The Invercargill case</em></p>    <p><a name="p175" class="pseudopara" id="p175">175.</a> The Judge below decided the question of the limitation of action on the reasoning of the case of <strong>Invercargill City Council v Hamlin</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20624" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] A.C. 624.</a> The <strong>Invercargill</strong> decision was a decision of the Privy Council on an appeal from New Zealand. In short the basis of that decision was that the causeof action in negligence for economic loss did not accrue until the market value of the building was depreciated by reason of thephysical damage. As such the cause of action accrued when a reasonable owner of the building would have called in an expert to examinethe state of the building in respect of the defects found to exist. It was at that stage that the defects would have been obviousto a potential buyer and hence the market value of the house would then be depreciated.</p>    <p><a name="p176" class="pseudopara" id="p176">176.</a> There had there been a consistent line of authority in New Zealand upon which that decision was founded. The Privy Council referredto the <strong>Pirelli</strong> decision as an unfortunate decision, not merely because the outcome was unreasonable but because it was thought that criticisms werejustified that, the damage being economic loss, it was not until the loss had been actually suffered that damage had occurred andthe cause of action had accrued.</p>    <p><a name="p177" class="pseudopara" id="p177">177.</a> It seems to me that one important and fundamental distinction arises at least so far as Hong Kong is concerned. The changes effectedby inter alia <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> are modeled on the Latent Damage Act 1986. The purpose of that Act was to cater for the injustice that would occur by reason of arigid application of the <strong>Pirelli</strong> reasoning. Those amendments only have meaning if a cause of action could arise at a time when the Plaintiff were ignorant of theaccrual of his cause of action. There was no corresponding provision in New Zealand.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="pseudopara" id="p178">178.</a> Given the existence now of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> there is no need to strain an interpretation of the facts that would give the date of accrual of a cause of action that would beof practical benefit as opposed to injustice to a Plaintiff. Indeed to do so would perhaps be arbitrary. As has been pointed in respectof personal injuries it would be curious if a person, who does not originally know of latent damage, could have a cause of actiondependant on the chance acquisition of knowledge in respect of it. So too with a building, if it has a latent defect and it weresaid that the cause of action had not arisen because the building owner were unaware of the defect, it would be postponing the datetoo late to say the action only arose when a reasonable owner would become aware of the defect, since chance might give the ownerrelevant knowledge before that date. If it did, would the building owner not have a cause of action for the reason that a reasonableowner would not be aware of the defect or would not have been put on notice to make investigations? This was a point made by LordKeith at page 466F. Furthermore, logical though it might seem to base a cause of action for economic loss on the time when a reasonableowner might be expected to know of the cause of loss, which, for example, might diminish the sale value of his building, that logicalityloses some of its force when it is remembered that there is no duty of disclosure of defects on the seller of a building. Hence abuilding owner might know of the defect but it does not mean he has suffered any loss unless other people also know of the defect.</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="pseudopara" id="p179">179.</a> I would mention here that there seems to have been some confusion as to the effect of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">31</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>. At page 26 of the Judgment it is stated that the actions were brought within the time allowed by both sections. Since the sectionsare mutually exclusive and are dependent on different facts it is not easy to see how the actions could have been brought withinthe time limits of both sections.</p>    <p><a name="p180" class="pseudopara" id="p180">180.</a> Reliance was placed at page 21 of the Judgment below on a quotation which Lord Keith made in the <strong>Murphy</strong> case from the judgment of Deane J. in <strong>Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">157 C.L.R. 424.</a> The words quoted were ".... any loss or injury is sustained only at the time when [the defect] is first known or manifest." However,that passage was cited by Lord Keith for the purpose of considering whether the damage in the Anns case economic loss. Thus justbefore citing the passage Lord Keith said at page 466H:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"In my opinion it must now be recognised that, although the damage in Anns was characterised as physical damage by Lord Wilberforce,it was purely economic loss."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p181" class="pseudopara" id="p181">181.</a> The passage cited by Lord Keith was a long passage and dealt specifically with <strong>Anns</strong> and whether the damage there was economic loss. It concluded by saying that any loss incurred by reason of defective foundationsby a person who acquires an interest in a building was economic loss. Lord Keith then said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I find myself in respectful agreement with the reasoning contained in this passage, which seems to me to be incontrovertible.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">It being recognised that the nature of the loss held to be recoverable in Anns was pure economic loss, the next point...."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p182" class="pseudopara" id="p182">182.</a> Hence Lord Keith was considering the question of whether Anns was dealing with economic loss. This had been the crucial point inDeane J.'s judgment. The observations, which Deane J. had made in the passage cited, on the rival arguments as to the date of accrualof the cause of action were incidental and were not relevant in the <strong>Murphy</strong> case which was not a case where a limitation point was relevant.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="pseudopara" id="p183">183.</a> In my view the Judgment of the Court below dismissing the Action against the 1st Defendant should be upheld and the judgment againstthe 2nd to 5th Defendants should be set aside. An order nisi should be made that the costs here and below should be to the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="pseudopara" id="p184">184.</a> Since there is no liability on the part of the 1st Defendant, the third party proceedings also fail. Whereas normally the costs wouldbe payable in the first instance by 1st Defendant but recoverable against the Plaintiff, I consider that in view of the stance takenby the 2nd to 5th Defendants in trying to establish liability in negligence against the 1st Defendant, which has failed, the costsof all the Defendants both in the main action and in the third party proceedings should be dealt with as one.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Mayo, J.A.:</p>    <p><a name="p185" class="pseudopara" id="p185">185.</a> The result of this is that P&amp;T's appeal is allowed and BEA's appeal against TW is dismissed. An order nisi is made that BEA willpay all the Defendants' costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Simon Mayo)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Arthur Leong)</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="34%">(Anthony Rogers)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="33%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td style="text-align:center" width="34%">Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr. John Scott, Q.C. instructed by M/S Masons for Plaintiff</p>        <p>Ms Gladys LI, S.C. &amp; Mr. Peter Clayton instructed by M/S Denton Hall for 1st Defendant</p>        <p>Mr. Michael Thomas, S.C. &amp; Mr. Jonathan Harris instructed by M/S Mallesons Stephen Jaques for 2nd - 5th Defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <appeal>        <p><br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        Remarks:<br />        On appeal by the Plaintiff to the Court of Final Appeal: Appeal dismissed (majority) with costs.
