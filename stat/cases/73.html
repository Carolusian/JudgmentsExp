The 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants are collectively referred to as the âFrench Banksâ.  The Plaintiff by counterclaim, Creditor Co Limited (âCreditorCoâ),is the Defendant by original action.  The Plaintiff by original action and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by counterclaim is GDH Limited (âGDHâ).  In addition, there is an application by GDH to restore an Order 14A summonsfor direction issued against CreditorCo.  That application has been adjourned sine die for the parties to agree to the directionsto be sought after the determination of the French Banksâ applications.</p>    <p class="heading">The background to the Debt Restructuring Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings) Limited (âGDEâ) is a large investment company of the Guangdong Provincial Government (âGPGâ)with about 250 subsidiary companies (âGDE Groupâ).  One of its subsidiaries is a private company incorporated in France calledGD Invest SARL (âGDIâ).  In 1992, GDI entered into an agreement, called âCredit Bail Immobilierâ, with the French Banks forfinancing the acquisition of a hotel in Paris.  That agreement was effectively a lease and purchase agreement under which the FrenchBanks acquired the hotel and leased it to GDI, with an option for GDI to purchase the hotel after a fixed period of time.  Duringthe currency of the lease, GDI would make rental payment to the French Banks.  GDI would be liable in penalty if the lease was terminatedprematurely.  Credit Bail Immobilier was governed by French law.  It was an entirely French transaction entered into in France amongFrench parties.  GDIâs liability under the Credit Bail Immobilier was guaranteed by GDE under a First Demand Guarantee dated 21July 1992 (âGDI Guaranteeâ).</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>   In late 1998, the GDE Group defaulted on payment of their debts which totalled approximately US$4.9 billion.  The debt includedcontingent liabilities guaranteed by members of the GDE Group, which included GDEâs contingent liability to the French Banks underthe GDI Guarantee.  The GDE Groupâs creditors included approximately 170 banks and bondholders, along with trade and other debtors. The borrowings of the GDE Group had been used to fund investments, mainly in Hong Kong, the Peopleâs Republic of China (âthePRCâ) and Macau, which were of doubtful value and would be difficult to recover.  It is common ground that there was considerableimpropriety which led to the financial collapse of the GDE Group.  The PRC authorities feared that a failure to restructure the GDEGroup would have adverse impact on foreign lending into China and on the Hong Kong banking sector.  The GPG was also keen to avoidany investigation into the circumstances leading to the collapse of the GDE Group which such formal liquidation procedures of theGDE Group or any of its subsidiaries would bring. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Against that background, the GPG, the GDE Group and their creditors entered into negotiation for a restructuring arrangement.  Underthe arrangement, the GPG and its wholly owned company, GDH agreed to contribute to the pool of assets to be made available for distributionto the creditors of those members of the GDE Group which were being restructured.  Those assets included US$2 billion of debt arisingfrom the privatisation of the Dongshen Water Project which supplied water to Hong Kong, shares in the equity of the privatised companyand US$80 million cash (âRestructuring Considerationâ).  During the negotiation, it was envisaged that the creditors would beentitled to share in the Restructuring Consideration <i>pari passu</i>.  Failure by a creditor to agree to the restructuring arrangement and the ensuing claim procedure would mean that it would be unableto benefit from the additional assets made available by the GPG.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In October 2000, after two years of negotiation, the GPG exerted pressure on all the parties to finalise the restructuring arrangementby the end of the year on the basis that no financial provision would be available for the restructuring in the following year. It was only then that the procedure for dealing with contingent and unascertained creditorsâ claims was worked out, which includedGDEâs contingent liability under the GDI Guarantee.  As a result, the Debt Restructuring Agreement (âDRAâ) was finalised atbreakneck pace.  It was signed on 22 December 2000 among, <i>inter alia</i>, CreditorCo, GDH, the French Banks and other named parties.  However, not all the related companies of GDE were restructured underthe DRA.  In particular, GDI was not one of the restructuring companies. </p>    <p class="heading">The Debt Restructuring Agreement and Claims Procedure</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The DRA runs to 84 pages and 27 schedules with 41 pages of signatories.  Under the DRA, the Restructuring Consideration contributedby GPGwas transferred to and held by CreditorCo.  All claims would be assessed by the claims assessor, Messrs PricewaterhouseCoopers(âPwCâ).  To the extent relevant to these proceedings, part of the Restructuring Consideration was to be held as âGeneral ReserveDâ specifically designated for unadmitted unsecured restructuring claims.  Within the constraint of time, it was not possible toassess the amount of unadmitted unsecured restructuring claims which were either contingent or unascertained liabilities at the timeof signing of the DRA.  The assessment of the size of those liabilities was made by GDH and PwC.  Due to pressure of time, the liabilityto the French Banks was assessed on the basis of a worst case scenario, including default penalty for early determination of theCredit Bail Immobilier which would not normally be included in a liquidation claim.  US$15.5 million was set aside from the RestructuringConsideration for the purpose of meeting the French Banksâ claim of approximately US$23 million.  In fact, the maximum amount outstandingon the loan at that time, excluding the default penalties, was only about US$13 million.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The claims procedure is set out in clause 10.1 of and Schedule 14 to the DRA. Under the Claims Procedure, a creditor, describedas an âAccepting Creditorâ in the DRA, would file a proof of claim.  Such proofs had to be filed on or prior to 31 March 2002. The creditor would try to agree the amount of claim with PwC and the agreed amount would be distributed to the creditor.  If therewas a difference between the amount originally reserved and the amount actually distributed to that creditor, that difference wouldbe transferred to General Reserve D for the benefit of all creditors.  If the holder of an unadmitted unsecured restructuring claimdid not submit a proof of claim on or prior to 31 March 2002, the Restructuring Consideration reserved for such a claim would betransferred to GDH and might be distributed at the discretion of GDH to the creditor with the unadmitted unsecured restructuringclaim or otherwise applied by GDH for its own use and benefit, pursuant to clause 10.1(c) of the DRA. </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Where the guarantor was a restructuring company but the primary obligor was not (âUnrelated Guarantee Claimâ), the creditorhad the further choice of assigning its claim against the primary obligor to CreditorCo and proving for the entire amount in itsproof of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  There is no dispute that the French Banks acceded to the DRA because of GDEâs liability under the GDI Guarantee but that liabilitywas a contingent one and the amount was not admitted.  The French Banks were therefore treated as unsecured contingent creditorsfor the purpose of the restructuring, a list of which had been provided by Goldman Sachs, who represented the GPG in the restructuringarrangement.  Their claims were classified under the DRA as Unrelated Guarantee Claims because the claims were based on a guaranteewhere the guarantor is a company involved in the restructuring, i.e. GDE, but the primary obligor, i.e. GDI, is not. </p>    <p class="heading">The French Banks Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant played a leading role among the French Banks in relation to the DRA.  On 5 March 2002, GDH approached the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant by a strictly private and confidential letter and sought to discuss with them about a possible immediate settlement ofthe obligations of GDI.  GDH insisted that the French Banks should not submit a proof of claim as required by the Claims Procedure. On 8 March 2002, GDHâs solicitors, Messrs Richards Butler, wrote to the French Banks threatening that if a proof of claim waspresented, GDH would reconsider whether or not to make payments under the hotel lease agreement.  There were further discussionsbetween GDH and the French Banks.  On 14 March 2002, Messrs Richards Butler stipulated that the French Banks should not, <i>inter</i> <i>alia</i>, engage in any discussion with any one of the other creditors, CreditorCo, Creditor Management Co, PwC, the claims controller orwith any other person who would be likely to prevent GDH from receiving the sums for Restructuring Consideration. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 22 March 2002, James Law of PwC met with the French Banks and their legal advisers, during which James Law gave a presentationof the Claims Procedure under the DRA.  PwCâs purpose of the meeting was to ensure the French Banks abided by the Claims Procedureby submitting a proof of claim or to submit a nil proof of claim so that the provisions for the liabilities to the French Banks inthe Restructuring Consideration could be made available to other creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  After further discussions among the parties, the French Banks reached agreement with GDI and GDH on 27 March 2002 (âFrench BanksAgreementâ).  Under that agreement, GDI was to bring forward its purchase of the hotel from the French Banks under the Credit BailImmobilier and GDH would pay the purchase price on behalf of GDI in an amount calculated as representing the indexation applicableto the building and the increase on the residual value of the hotel.  As security for the premature termination of the hotel leaseand the purchase price, GDH would make an immediate payment of Euro 3.5 million to the French Banks.  In return, the French Banksagreed that they would not submit any proof of claim under the DRA.  In so agreeing, the French Banks disentitled themselves fromreceiving Restructuring Consideration under the DRA in respect of their entitlements arising under the GDI Guarantee.  Effectively,the French Banks reached a compromise with their primary obligor, GDI, which was not being restructured, that GDI would arrange forthe early discharge of its obligations via GDH.  Having so compromised their claim with GDI, the French Banks had no reason to claimunder the DRA and did not file any proof of claim.  By this arrangement, GPG was able to claw back US$15.5 million from the RestructuringConsideration set aside for the French Banksâ claims and make a saving of about US$10 million.</p>    <p class="heading">The original action and counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  CreditorCo took the view that the French Banks had entered into a side deal with GDH and refused to return to GDH the US$15.5 millionfrom the Restructuring Consideration set aside for the French Banks.  Then GDH commenced the original action against CreditorCo forbreach of the DRA.  CreditorCo denied it was in breach of the DRA and commenced action by counterclaim against GDH and the FrenchBanks.  CreditorCo relies on a cause of action in contract and another cause of action in tort against the French Banks.  The causeof action in contract is premised on the fact that the French Banks were parties to the DRA and that having settled their claimswith GDH were in breach of expressed or implied terms of the DRA by failing to submit a nil proof of claim to PwC under the ClaimsProcedure.  Had the French Banks submitted a nil proof of claim, it would enable the US$15.5 million in General Reserve D set asidefor the French Banksâ claim to be distributed to the other creditors on <i>pari passu</i> basis.  Thus, the French Banks subjected CreditorCo to GDHâs claim for return of US$15.5 million of its Restructuring Consideration. Secondly, CreditorCo alleges that by entering into the French Banks Agreement and by not submitting any proof of claim under theDRA, the French Banks conspired with GDH to use unlawful means to injure CreditorCo, the unlawful means being the breach of the DRA. In addition, CreditorCo also seeks rectification of the Creditor Accession Agreement dated 20 December 2000 based on mistake inthe amount of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs loan.  But this remedy is not relevant for the purpose of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendantâs application.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 11 June 2007, Master J Wong granted leave to CreditorCo under Order 11 rule 1(1)(c), 1(1)(d)(i) and 1(1)(f) of the Rules of theHigh Court (âRHCâ) to file and serve the counterclaim on the French Banks out of the jurisdiction.  The French Banks now seek,among other things, to set aside the above order of Master J Wong.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The French Banksâ central argument is that the restructuring arrangement was entirely contractual and the liquidation principlesand <i>pari</i> <i>passu</i> distribution have no application to the DRA.  They claim that they have an option under the DRA to submit a nil proof of claim onor prior to 31 March 2002 with the result that the surplus of the Restructuring Consideration set aside for the French Banks overthe assessed amount of the claims would be released for distribution among other creditors or not to submit any proof of claim withthe result that the entire amount of the Restructuring Consideration set aside for the French Banks would be returned to GDH in accordancewith clause 10.1(c) of the DRA.  Hence, the French Banks were not in breach of the DRA and were not liable in conspiracy.  They alsorely on other technical defences.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The legal principles applicable to an application for setting aside the service out of the jurisdiction under Order 12 rule 8 of theRules of the High Court</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The principles and procedures governing the grant of leave for service of a writ out of the jurisdiction and of setting aside suchservice are prescribed in Orders 11 and 12 of the RHC and are very well settled.  A plaintiff seeking to serve a writ out of thejurisdiction has to apply for leave by way of an <i>ex parte</i> application.  He has to show firstly that he has a good arguable case that his case falls within one of the subparagraphs of Order11 rule 1(1) so as to give the court jurisdiction to consider the application.  An arguable case is not sufficient: see <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2008</i>, para 11/1/8 and <i>A J Lucas (Hong Kong) Limited</i> <i>and</i> <i>Drill</i><i>t</i><i>ec Gut GmbH Grossbohrund Umwelttechnik</i>, HCCT No 36 of 2005, per Burrell J.  Though the court will not require proof to its satisfaction, it will require something betterthan a mere prima facie case.  This is a high threshold.  The court has no discretion to exercise any jurisdiction if this thresholdis not achieved: see <i>The Brabo</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%20AC%20326" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] AC 326.</a>  Where questions of facts are concerned, the court looks primarily at the plaintiffâs case and relies on the plaintiffâs dutyof full and complete disclosure at the <i>ex parte</i> stage. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Once the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction under one of the subparagraphs of Order 11 rule 1(1), it shall conduct an examinationof the merits.  It has to be satisfied that there is a serious issue to be tried both as to merits (if not already decided underthe first stage) and as to <i>forum</i> <i>conveniens</i> before exercising its discretion to grant leave to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction.  This is the lower degree of proof requiredto enable it to exercise its discretion to grant leave: see <i>Seaconsar Far East Ltd</i> <i>and</i> <i>Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islam</i><i>i</i> <i>Iran</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%203%20WLR%20756" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 3 WLR 756.</a></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  A defendant served with a writ out of the jurisdiction who disputes the courtâs jurisdiction may apply by way of an <i>inter parte</i> application to set aside the service under Order 12 rule 8.  The parties may file affidavits in support of or in opposition to theapplication to set aside the service.  To resist an application to set aside the service out of the jurisdiction, the plaintiff hasto show a good arguable case that his case falls within one of the subparagraphs of Order 11 rule 1(1) and that there is a seriousissue to be tried.  But he is not required to discharge the same high standard of proof as applicable at trial or at the <i>ex parte</i> stage.  The court will not resolve disputes of facts on affidavit.  The question whether the plaintiff has shown a good arguablecase is to be decided primarily by reference to the plaintiffâs evidence: <i>Tay Chao Wah &amp; Another v Singapore-Johore Express (Pte) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20HKLR%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 HKLR 19.</a>  The court will weigh the arguments on both sides.  A âgood arguable caseâ reflects that one side has a much better argumenton the material available.  It is the concept of the court being satisfied, or as satisfied as it can be having regard to the limitationswhich an interlocutory process imposes, that factors exist which allow it to take jurisdiction: <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure</i>, para 11/4/9. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  If the plaintiff succeeds in proving a serious issue to be tried, the defendant who seeks to set aside the service has to assumethe more onerous burden of showing that the plaintiffâs claim is liable to be struck out.  A similar approach was adopted by RecorderYu in <i>Ren Yun Liang</i> <i>&amp; O</i><i>thers</i> <i>and China Merchants Bank Company Limited</i>, HCA 1456/2005, unreported.  The court at interlocutory hearing will not enter summary judgment nor dismiss or strike out a claimif there is an arguable case on the facts or in law.  The court will not resolve disputed questions of fact on affidavit.  Thus,the court will be extremely cautious before striking out a claim if it does not have all the relevant facts or if the issues of factmay be interwoven with legal issues, or is in any way fact sensitive, or if the case raises an arguable point of law or if the principlesof law are not fully settled: see <i>Allen and Gulf Oil Refining Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20AC%201001" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] AC 1001.</a>  In this sense, a serious issue to be tried imposes a higher threshold on the defendant to prove the lack of one than on the plaintiffto prove there is one.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  If, on balance, the court is not satisfied that the plaintiff has shown a good arguable case that his case falls within one of thesubparagraphs of Order 11 rule 1(1) and a serious issue to be tried or if the court is satisfied that the plaintiffâs case is boundto fail on the merits, the leave granted at the <i>ex</i> <i>parte</i> stage will be set aside.  In the instant case, there are no significant material factual disputes between the parties.  The factualallegations of the parties are consistent with one another.  For reasons as I shall explain below, there cannot be any doubt thatCreditorCoâs counterclaim falls within subparagraphs (1)(c), (1)(d)(i) and (1)(f) of Order 11 rule 1.  Furthermore, it is not theFrench Banksâ contention that CreditorCo failed to discharge the burden of showing a serious issue to be tried.  The question iswhether the French Banks have discharged the burden of showing CreditorCoâs counterclaim is so devoid of merit to the extent thatthe counterclaim should be struck out and hence the service of the writ ought to be set aside.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Legal principles applicable to an application for stay of proceedings on jurisdictional ground</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Apart from challenging the service of the writ as aforesaid, a defendant, who does not wish to dispute jurisdiction or who has failedto have the service set aside, may apply for stay of the proceedings under the courtâs inherent jurisdiction.

I consider that application has effectively beenabandoned.  </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  The bone of contention between CreditorCo and the French Banks is whether the French Banks have shown that there is no serious issueto be tried in respect of CreditorCoâs counterclaim.</p>    <p class="heading">Order 11 rule 1(1)(c) - necessary or proper party ground</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Rule 1(1)(c) permits service out of the jurisdiction if the claim, or in this case the counterclaim, is brought against a personduly served within or out of the jurisdiction and a person out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party.  In the originalaction, GDH sued CreditorCo for breach of the DRA by failing to transfer the Restructuring Consideration set aside for the FrenchBanks to GDH.  CreditorCo denied it was in breach and averred that on the true and proper construction of the DRA the French Banksand GDH had breached the DRA and counterclaimed against GDH and the French Banks for breach of the DRA and for conspiracy.  Withoutgoing into the merit as to the proper construction of the DRA, it is plainly obvious that common questions of fact and law arisein the claim and counterclaim.  CreditorCoâs case by counterclaim against GDH as well as that against the French Banks is foundedon the same set of facts, namely the partiesâ obligation under the DRA, the making of the French Banks Agreement between GDI, GDHand the French Banks and all surrounding circumstances.  The central issue as between all the parties is what is the true and properconstruction of the DRA. </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  CreditorCo is entitled to bring a counterclaim against GDH under Order 15 rule 2 without the need to bring a cross action.  Likewise,it must also be entitled to bring a counterclaim against the French Banks, if they were within the jurisdiction, under Order 15 rule3 as any other person who is liable to CreditorCo along with the GDH in respect of the subject matter of the counterclaim on thebasis that they are the other parties to the French Banks Agreement which is relied on by CreditorCo as breach of the DRA and conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The court has a duty under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16(2)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Ordinance</a> to exercise its jurisdiction in every cause or matter before it so as to secure, as far as possible, that all matters in disputebetween the parties are completely and finally determined and all multiplicity of legal proceedings with respect to any of thosematters is avoided.  The legislative intent behind the section is the avoidance of all multiplicity of legal proceedings: see <i>McGowan v Middleton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2011%20QBD%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 11 QBD 464.</a> </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Not only that the French Banks have not given any good reasons why the issues between the French Banks and CreditorCo could notbe conveniently disposed of together, it is only too obvious that serious disadvantages may arise if the action against the FrenchBanks and the action against GDH are allowed to proceed concurrently in two different jurisdictions.  There will be the risk of inconsistentjudgments; the risk of injustice to the parties since neither court would have the full picture nor all the evidence; and unnecessaryduplication in time, costs and evidence: see <i>The Abidin Daver</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 AC 398.</a>  In addition, as there is an allegation of conspiracy or secret agreement, separate trials are particularly inappropriate: see <i>Donohue v Armco Inc and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20All%20ER%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 All ER 749.</a>  Separate trials will be a potential disaster from a legal point of view.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The description ânecessary or proper partyâ encompasses a wide and elastic class of person: see <i>The Eras Eil Actions</i> [1992] 1 LL 570.   It includes persons who can be described in general terms by looking at Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6(2)(b).</a>  It includes persons who ought to have been joined by the plaintiff as co-defendant or co-plaintiff or whose presence before thecourt is otherwise necessary.  It includes even persons against whom the plaintiff may wish to claim no relief so long as he is aperson between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connectedwith any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the court it would be just and convenient to determineas between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause of matter.  When common questions of law or fact ariseand a person could have been joined under Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 4</a>, that person is a proper party: see <i>United Film Distribution v Chhabria</i> [2001] 2 All Ern Comm 865.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Not only that there are common questions of fact and law involved in the claim and counterclaim, the counterclaim is clearly anintegral part of the defence.  It is just and convenient that CreditorCoâs counterclaim against the French Banks and GDH shouldbe determined once and for all in the same proceedings.  The French Banks are clearly necessary and proper parties to the action. I am well satisfied that CreditorCo has shown a good arguable case that its case falls within Order 11 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1(1)(c).</a></p>    <p class="heading">Order 11 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1(1)(d)(i)</a> - contract made within the jurisdiction</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  CreditorCo also seeks to rely on Order 11 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1(d)(i)</a> as one of the grounds for service out of the jurisdiction.  Its contention is that the DRA was a contract made in Hong Kong and thecounterclaims against the French Banks are claims brought to enforce or otherwise affect a contract or to recover damages for breachof contract made in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr Manzoniâs argument, which Mr Chan also adopts, is that there were 41 pages of signatories to the DRA including numerous overseasparties and it is impossible to show that the DRA was made in Hong Kong.  Since the DRA was entered into by numerous parties allover the world, the fact that some of the parties might have signed the DRA elsewhere other than in Hong Kong is of little significance. There is no dispute that the DRA was negotiated between parties, most of whom were located in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong was the geographicalcentre of the restructuring negotiations.  The French Banks signed the DRA by their agents in Hong Kong under powers of attorneyexecuted in France.  By all indications, the DRA was concluded in Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Mr Chan advanced the further argument that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was not involved in the negotiation of the terms of the DRA at all; that it was only brought in at a very late stage tosign the DRA and that the DRA was not signed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant but by its agent in Hong Kong under a power of attorney executed in France.  But, there is no dispute that the DRA wassigned by a duly authorised agent of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant in Hong Kong.  The fact that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant did not take part in the negotiation and that the power of attorney giving authority to its agent to sign the DRA was executedin France are totally irrelevant.  I dismiss such argument as nebulous.  I am satisfied that the Court has jurisdiction to grantleave to serve the counterclaim out of the jurisdiction under Order 11 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1(1)(d).</a></p>    <p class="heading">Order 11 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1(1)(f)</a> - tort causing damage within the jurisdiction</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Order 11 rule 1(1)(f) permits service out of the jurisdiction in respect of a claim founded on a tort and the damage was sustained,or resulted from an act committed, within the jurisdiction.  Two conditions must be satisfied: a tort was committed and the damagewas sustained in Hong Kong or resulted from an act committed here.  Where the tort involved international elements, the double actionabilityrule applies: see <i>Kuwait Oil Tanker Co SAK and another v Al Bader and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20All%20ER%20%28Comm%29%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271.</a>  To obtain leave for service out of the jurisdiction under this subparagraph, the plaintiff must show that the tort complained ofwas of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed within the jurisdiction and the act must not have been justifiableby the law of the place where it was done.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  CreditorCoâs case on the conspiracy claim is based on the entry into the French Banks Agreement which was executed in France andgoverned by French law.  The French Banks contend that it is incumbent on CreditorCo to show that such acts would be actionable underthe law of France and that CreditorCo has failed to show a good arguable case that the tort of conspiracy as alleged falls withinrule 1(1)(f).  In addition, Mr Manzoni further submits that an applicant seeking leave to serve a writ out of the jurisdiction underthis rule bears the burden of adducing evidence on foreign law and may not rely on the presumption that foreign law is the same aslocal law. </p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  With respect, that proposition is neither founded upon authority nor hallowed by practice.  In fact, I find it absurd that a partycan rely on the presumption at trial but not at pre-trial or interlocutory proceedings.  In <i>Kuwait Oil Tanker</i> <i>Co SAK and another v Al Bader</i> <i>and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20All%20ER%20%28Comm%29%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271</a> at 336, Nourse LJ said at paragraph 184:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSince English courts proceed on the basis of a presumption that foreign law is the same as English law unless the contrary is provedas a fact, it seems clear that, whether or not the claimant incorporates in his pleading an averment that the matters relied on arecivilly actionable under the lex loci delicti, the burden in practice lies upon the defendant to plead and prove that his conductwas not actionable under the lex loci delicti.  That being so, the debate appears to be a somewhat arid one.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Thus, in practice, the burden is upon a defendant to plead and prove that its conduct is not actionable under the <i>lex loci delicti</i>.  Otherwise, the court applies the well-known presumption that foreign law is the same as local law unless the contrary is provedas a fact.  This rule and practice of pleading must apply equally in an application for leave under Order 11.  To hold otherwisewould render the presumption, which undoubtedly applies in substantive trial, inapplicable during pre-trial proceedings.  That wouldrender the presumption nugatory and cannot be right.  Hence, in my view, the burden is on the French Banks to prove by expert evidencethat the conspiracy counterclaim is not actionable under the <i>lex loci delicti</i> or how French law differs, if at all, from Hong Kong law.  The French Banks have utterly failed in discharging the burden of proof. The presumption therefore applies.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Furthermore, under Hong Kong law, damage is an essential ingredient of the tort of conspiracy: see <i>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</i> (19<sup>th</sup> Ed 2006) para 25-137.  Thus, on CreditorCoâs case, Hong Kong law is the <i>lex loci delicti</i> and the tort was completed and damage suffered in Hong Kong where CreditorCo is based.  Arguably, the principle of double actionabilityhas no application and does not undermine CreditorCoâs case for leave to serve the counterclaim out of the jurisdiction under Order11 rule 1(1)(f).</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Thus, howsoever, CreditorCoâs case is considered, it has at least shown a good arguable case that the conspiracy claim falls withinrule 1(1)(f) for grant of leave for service out of the jurisdiction. </p>    <p class="heading">The issue</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The primary dispute between the parties is whether the Restructuring Consideration set aside to meet the French Banksâ contingentclaim should be transferred to GDH or be retained by CreditorCo for distribution on a <i>pari passu</i> basis to all GDE creditors, other than the French Banks who did not submit any proof of claim. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  CreditorCoâs contractual counterclaim is based on breach of express or implied terms of the DRA.  In particular, it relies onparagraph (I) of the preamble, clause 10.1(a), paragraphs 1, 2 and 59 of Schedule 14 as containing the express terms which were breachedby the French Banks.  It is CreditorCoâs contention that on a true and proper construction of the DRA, clause 10.1(a) and paragraphs1 and 2 of Schedule 14 impose an obligation on the French Banks to submit their claims to PwC and be bound by the Claims Procedureset out in Schedule 14.  Furthermore, Mr Chua SC, counsel for CreditorCo, submits that if there is arguable ambiguity on the trueand proper construction of the DRA it is not appropriate for summary determination.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Manzoni relies on clause 10.1(c) which provides for the event of a creditor not submitting a proof of claimon or prior to 31 March 2002.  He argues that clause 10.1(a) is to be construed as giving the French Banks an option or a right tosubmit a proof of claim and to share in the Restructuring Consideration.  Hence, he submits that only if the French Banks submita proof of claim would they be bound by the Claims Procedure in Schedule 14, but they were free not to submit any proof of claimor a nil proof of claim.  The effect, according to Mr Manzoni, is that if the French Banks submitted a proof of claim, albeit a nilone, the part of the Restructuring Consideration set aside for the French Banks would fall into the pool for distribution by creditors,but if the French Banks did not submit a proof of claim, that part of the Restructuring Consideration would have to be returned toGPG or GDH.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Thus, the issue is what is the true and proper construction of the DRA, in particular clause 10.1(c), or more precisely, whetherthe French Banks have shown that the construction as contended by CreditorCo is so unarguable that its counterclaim ought to be struckout. </p>    <p class="heading">The relevant provisions of the Debt Restructuring Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The partiesâ argument revolved around the following provisions of the DRA: paragraph (I) of the preamble; clause 1which providesfor the definitions of the various terms used in the DRA; clause 10.1 which provides for the Claims Procedure and paragraphs 1, 2and 59 of Schedule 14 which are the Rules of the Claims Procedure.

Interpretation of a contract is the ascertainment of the meaning which the contract would convey to a reasonableperson having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which theywere at the time of the contract.  It is not the same as interpretation of the meaning of the words used in the contract. </p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Mr Chua SC emphasises the importance of construing a contract against its factual matrix rather than purely on internal linguisticconsideration.  The factual matrix includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the documentwould have been understood by a reasonable man.  It does not usually include evidence of negotiations and mere subjective intentsince the proposed terms may have changed in the course of the negotiation.

It is a fundamental principle of insolvency law that an insolvent companyâs assets should be distributed <i>pari passu</i> among creditors of the same class.  Any payment or distribution to creditors of the same class which is not <i>pari passu</i> is contrary to public policy.  He refers to Lord Crossâ dicta in <i>British Eagle</i><i>International </i><i>Air Lines Ltd and Compagnie Nationale Air France</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20WLR%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 WLR 758</a> at 780H:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn such a context it is to my mind irrelevant that the parties to the âclearing houseâ arrangements had good business reasonsfor entering into them and did not direct their minds to the question how the arrangements might be affected by the insolvency ofone or more of the parties.

A contract must be construed as a whole andwith common sense.  The court is unlikely to hold that an interpretation accords with the partiesâ intention if a constructionis contrary to common sense.  In that regard, in construing a commercial contract, the court will favour a commercially sensibleconstruction for such an approach is more likely to give effect to the intention of reasonable commercial men: see <i>Mannai Investment Co Ltd And Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 749</a> at 771B.  Counsel have no dispute about these principles.  Their difference lies in the conclusion to be drawn from the applicationof these principles to the facts of the present case. </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Adopting these principles, CreditorCo argues that the restructuring arrangement as equivalent to a liquidation or a notional liquidation. Hence, it takes the view that the normal liquidation principles of <i>pari passu</i> distribution of assets should be the basis and understanding of how the Restructuring Consideration ought to be distributed and seeks,in the alternative, to imply terms to give effect to that proposition.  The French Banks do not accept that contention.  They takethe position that the restructuring arrangement was entirely contractual in nature and the <i>pari</i> <i>passu</i> principle of distribution of assets on liquidation has no place in construing the DRA.  They argue that clause 10(1)(c) of the DRAhas express terms which deal with the circumstances which have occurred and that those terms should be applied and there is no roomfor implying any other terms which would alter the effect of the express terms.  With these principles and the partiesâ respectivepositions in mind, I turn to consider the true construction of the DRA.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Mr Chua SC refers me to the preamble and clause 10.1(a) of the DRA which respectively state that the Accepting Creditors âagreeto accept the Restructuring Considerationâ and âagree to the submission to the Claims Procedure.â  He also refers to paragraphs1 and 2 of Schedule 14 which respectively provides that the Accepting Creditors âagree to submit to, and be bound by, the ClaimsProcedureâ and âshall submit a Proof of Claimâ.  He emphasises on the use of the mandatory term âshall submit a Proof ofClaimâ in paragraph 2 of Schedule 14.  He submits that this is strong and clear language that the French Banks were obliged tosubmit a proof of claim.  He also submits that all provisions including Schedule 14 are integral part of the DRA and no particularprovision is to take priority. </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Manzoni submits that Clause 10.1(c) unequivocally prescribes for the transfer of the Restructuring Considerationto GDH in the event of a creditor not submitting a proof of claim.  This provision is reproduced in identical terms in paragraph3 of Schedule 14.  In introducing these provisions, the parties must recognise an Accepting Creditorâs liberty not to submit aproof of claim.  Hence, he submits that what is mandatory under paragraph 2 of Schedule 14 relates to the form to be used in submittingthe proof of claim, i.e. Exhibit A or Exhibit B as appropriate.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  On the factual background, there is no dispute that the GDE Group suffered a financial collapse involving considerable amount ofimpropriety and the GPG was keen to restructure the GDE Group so as to avoid formal investigation into the circumstances leadingto the collapse of the GDE Group.  The basic theme of the restructuring was that the remaining businesses of the GDE Group wouldbe reorganised with the GPG making available additional assets by way of the Restructuring Consideration for rateable distributionto creditors of the GDE Group.  After two years of negotiation and towards the end of October 2000, the GPG required that the entirerestructuring be completed in the calendar year 2000 on the basis that the provision was in the GPGâs budget for 2000 but not forthe following year.  Hence, the DRA was concluded at a breakneck pace.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Even against that background, I am quite unable to agree that the purpose of the DRA was a notional liquidation so that the <i>pari passu</i> principles applies regardless of the express provisions of the DRA.  Firstly, there is the very important distinction between thepresent case and an ordinary liquidation in that the shareholder of the GDE Group contributed additional and very substantial assetsin the form of Restructuring Consideration to bring about the restructuring.  The Restructuring Consideration is an additional assetoutside the pool of assets belonging to the members of the GDE Group to be restructured.  Secondly, the liabilities which the presentaction relates were unascertained and unadmitted contingent liability under the GDI Guarantee in respect of the liability of a primaryobligor, which is a non-restructuring company, i.e. GDI.  Even according to the affidavit filed on behalf of CreditorCo made by MrSterling of Allen &amp; Overy in the United Kingdom, who presumably had significant input in the drafting of the DRA, there is adifference between the restructuring arrangement under the DRA and an ordinary liquidation.  Mr Sterling accepted that the restructuringarrangement under the DRA is a negotiated arrangement, which is different in effect from an ordinary liquidation.  He also recognisedthe significance that under the negotiated arrangement, the shareholder, i.e. GPG, contributed additional assets to the pool of assetsto be made available for distribution to creditors.  Hence, he said that explained the difference in approach between an ordinaryliquidation and the negotiated arrangement when a creditor failed to file a proof of claim.  Mr Sterling said in paragraph 28 ofhis affidavit:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â28.   Clause 10(1)(c) of the DRA was a negotiated provision.  Its intention and effect is to provide the finality which would otherwisebe lacking because of the absence of formal liquidation proceedings.  Its commercial effect is, however, different from the finalitywhich would be achieved through a final dividend notice or a bar date because in the latter situation, if a creditor does not proveits claim, all other creditors benefit rateably from the failure to prove by that particular creditor, whereas under the finalitymechanism under Clause 10(1)(c) it is the shareholder which benefits from the failure to prove.  GDH was a new company establishedby GPG for the purposes of the restructuring.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Thus, in effect Mr Sterling agreed with Mr Manzoni that the restructuring arrangement under the DRA is a contractual liquidationrather than a notional liquidation in that it was a negotiated arrangement in which the shareholder, who effectively is a third party,contributed additional and significant assets to the pool of assets to be made available for distribution to creditors.  Mr Sterlingalso agreed that under the restructuring arrangement, unlike an ordinary liquidation, where a creditor did not prove its claim, theasset was to be returned to the shareholder, i.e. GPG or GDH, and not for <i>pari passu</i> distribution among the other creditors.  In my view, the factual background does not support any intention that the <i>pari passu</i> principle is to apply under all circumstances.  In fact that had all along been the position of PwC.  On 7 March 2002, PwC wroteto the French Banks as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf you believe that you will receive full repayment from the primary obligor and will therefore not need to claim under the guaranteewe would still ask you to complete a form with âNilâ shown as a claim amount.  Once a nil form is received by us the restructuringconsideration previously set aside in Reserved D for your bank can be released to all financial creditors (to be distributed at alater date to all HKPropertyCo shareholders).  Should you not complete any form by 31 March 2002 the restructuring considerationpreviously reserved for you will be paid to the Guangdong Government.  It is critical therefore that you complete this form, in orderthat the restructuring consideration can be released to the financial creditors.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  However, Mr Sterling then made a twist in his argument and went on to draw a distinction between failing to prove a claim throughinadvertence and deliberate failure.  He said in paragraphs 29 and 30 of his affidavit:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â29.   If a creditor fails to prove its claim through inadvertence then Clause 10(1)(c) applies and the Restructuring Considerationin respect of the claim of that creditor must be transferred to GDH.  Although it is unusual that the shareholder should receivea benefit from the âestateâ when creditors remain unpaid, it is understandable in this situation in which GPG as the shareholderwas contributing a significant part of the value â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">30.  However, the language used in relation to the Claims Procedure is mandatory and it was not open to an Accepting Creditor deliberatelyto choose not to prove its claim because it had an undisclosed side deal with the shareholder, the effect of which is both to breachthe pari passu principle and to produce an unagreed benefit for the shareholder when creditors remain unpaid in full.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p>His argument is not that because of the factual matrix, the <i>pari passu</i> principle applies in all cases of a creditor failing to submit a proof of claim.  His argument is that on the true construction ofclause 10.1(c), the <i>pari</i> <i>passu</i> principle applies only in case of inadvertent failure to submit a proof of claim but does not apply if the failure is deliberatebecause the creditor was engaged in a side deal with the shareholder.  He relied on what he called the mandatory language of clause10.1(c) in support of his argument.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Firstly, as for the side deal and breach of the <i>pari passu</i> principle as alleged by Mr Sterling, the <i>pari passu</i> principle only applies to distribution by creditors of the assets in the pool of assets belong to the companies to be restructured. The Restructuring Consideration is not asset originally belonging to the GDE Group.  It is additional asset contributed by the GPGfor the purpose of the restructuring.  Thus, the <i>pari passu</i> principle cannot apply to such part of the Restructuring Consideration which by the express term of clause 10.1(c) ought not to bein the pool and ought to be returned to the shareholder, if no claim was submitted in respect of that contingent liability.  Thisis accepted by Mr Sterling.  Furthermore, in this case, the primary obligor of that contingent liability was not one of the membersof the GDE Group to be restructured.  There is nothing to prevent the French Banks from settling that liability with the primaryobligor which was not one of the companies to be restructured.  A settlement with the primary obligor which is a non-restructuringcompany could not be regarded as a settlement with the shareholder of the restructuring companies.  Such a settlement cannot be describedas a side deal.  If, as a result of that settlement, the contingent liability is extinguished, it is up to the French Banks to submita nil proof of claim or not to submit any proof of claim at all.  I think PwCâs letter of 7 March 2002 precisely described thecommon intention of the parties under clause 10.1(c) of the DRA.  With respect to Mr Sterling, I am quite unable to make any senseout of his distinction of inadvertent or deliberate failure to submit a proof of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  In PwCâs letter to the French Banks dated 29 March 2002, PwC changed its position and said that it would recommend to CreditorConot to release the part of the Restructuring Consideration to GDH.  This is a clear change from a neutral position to one bendingin favour of the creditors.  PwC was seeking to persuade the French Banks to file a nil proof of claim so as to engineer a situationdesired by the creditors, i.e. the part of the Restructuring Consideration reserved for the French Banks would fall into the poolfor distribution among the creditors.  In effect, the twist in Mr Sterlingâs argument is to impose an obligation on the FrenchBanks to act to the best interest of and in good faith to the other creditors.  That is not an obligation recognised by Hong Konglaw.  In keeping with the principles of freedom of contract and the binding force of contract, in English contract law there is noprinciple of good faith of general application: see Atiyah, <i>Introduction to the Law of Contract</i> (5<sup>th</sup> ed, 1995) p 212.  In <i>Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stilletto Visual Programmes Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20QB%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 QB 433</a>, Bingham LJ said at 439:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[I]n many civil law systems, and perhaps in most legal systems outside the common law world, the law of obligations recognisesand enforces an overriding principle that in making and carrying out contracts parties should act in good faith.  This does not simplymean that they should not deceive each other, a principle which any legal system must recognise; its effect is perhaps most aptlyconveyed by such metaphorical colloquialisms as âplaying fairâ, âcoming cleanâ or âputting oneâs cards face upwards onthe table.â  It is in essence a principle of fair open dealing â¦ English law has, characteristically, committed itself to nosuch overriding principle but has developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I think the above dicta precisely summarises the current position under Hong Kong law.  The obligation of good faith only exists wherethe parties are in some kind of a fiduciary relationship such as parties to an insurance contract, partnership contract and employmentcontract.  In the present case, I do not think the French Banks owe any obligation to act to the best interest of or in good faithto the creditors.  They were free under clause 10.1(c) not to submit a proof of claim.  They were free to make their choice accordingto their best interest or discretion and were therefore not bound to make a nil proof of claim as urged on them by PwC or as nowargued by CreditorCo.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Turning back to the language used in the relevant provisions of the DRA, I do not think the language supports Mr Sterlingâs contentioneither.  It can hardly be argued otherwise that the various clauses in the DRA govern the partiesâ rights and liabilities whereasSchedule 14 only provides for the rules and procedures in respect of claims made under the relevant provisions of the DRA.  Paragraph2 of Schedule 14 is perhaps the only provision where the word âshallâ is used in connection with submission of a proof of claim. The word âshallâ is not used in paragraph (I) of the preamble or clause 10.1.  Under clause 1.1, âclaimantâ as distinguishedfrom âAccepting Bank Creditor and Other Creditors and any other Person who accedes to the DRAâ is defined to mean a person makinga claim pursuant to clause 10.1 and Schedule 14.  This suggests that not until a creditor submits a proof of claim in accordancewith clause 10.1 and Schedule 14 and becomes a claimant would he submit to the claim procedures but he was free whether to submita proof of claim.  In his choice to submit a proof of claim, he is entitled to act unfettered in his own interest and according tohis own discretion.  It is impossible to read into clause 10.1(c) words importing the very fine distinction urged by Mr Sterling.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Mr Chua SC emphasises the importance of the factual background.  The background may assist the reasonable man to choose betweenthe possible meanings of words which are ambiguous and in extreme occasions even to conclude that the parties must for whatever reason,have used the wrong words or syntax: see <i>Mannai Investments Co Ltd And Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 749.</a>  The language used in the DRA is unequivocal and unambiguous.  Clause 10.1(c) clearly provided for what would happen if a creditordid not submit a proof of claim on or prior to 31 March 2002.  Nothing could be clearer.  It is argued that because of the pressureexerted by the GPG, the parties had to conclude the DRA at breakneck pace.  Despite the extremely short time allowed for the partiesto reach agreement on this very complex DRA, it is, nevertheless, a very detailed document running up to 84 pages with 27 schedules. It was prepared by a very reputable legal firm specialised in corporate liquidation and restructuring.  It is a legal document. It must have been carefully reviewed, apart by the draftsman, by numerous legal experts of the parties, who must be supposed tohave chosen their words with care.  There is nothing to suggest that the parties have used wrong words or syntax.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The clear intention of the parties as revealed by the language of clause 10.1 is that while a party to the DRA agreed to the submissionto the Claims Procedure, he is not under a contractual obligation to submit a proof of claim, but if he did submit a proof of claim,he would be bound by the Claims Procedure set out in Schedule 14.  Accordingly, I have to agree with Mr Manzoniâs submission thatthe word âagreeâ used in paragraph (I) of the preamble and clause 10.1 could not have been intended to be mandatory.  It merelyconveys the agreement to submit to, in the sense of being bound by, the Claims Procedure in Schedule 14, if indeed the French Bankssubmitted a proof of claim in accordance with the Claims Procedure and became claimants.  But the French Banks were free not to submitany proof of claim.</p>    <p class="heading">The implied terms</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  CreditorCoâs alternative case is based on implied term.  In paragraph 6 of its Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, CreditorCoseeks to imply the following terms into the DRA:</p>    <blockquote>        <p> â6.1.  That each party shall do all such things as are necessary on its part to enable the other parties to have the benefit ofrights under the DRA.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>  6.2.   That each party shall refrain from conduct prejudicing the other partiesâ benefit to rights under the DRA.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>6.3.  That each Accepting Creditor who holds an Unadmitted Unsecured Restructuring Claim agrees to: (a) use all reasonable endeavoursto file a Proof of Claim on or prior to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2002, and/or (b) act in good faith at all times in respect of such Unadmitted Unsecured Restructuring Claim.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p>The essence of the implied terms is an obligation to act in good faith to the other parties and to use all reasonable endeavours tofile a proof of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  It is trite law that there are only three ways that a term can be implied into a contract: implication as a matter of law; implicationto give the contract business efficacy; and implication to reflect the common unexpressed intention of the parties.  There is noargument that these terms are implied as a matter of law.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  On business efficacy, the DRA is primarily concerned with the consequences of submission or non submission of a proof of claim. If a submission was made in respect of a claim, the relevant part of the Restructuring Consideration would fall into the pool for<i>pari passu</i> distribution among all creditors; if no submission was made, it would be returned to the GPG or GDH.  The DRA works just as wellwith or without the proposed implied terms.  The implied terms do not improve the efficacy of the DRA as a whole.  It makes no differenceto the operation of the DRA whether an Accepting Creditor uses all reasonable endeavours to submit a proof of claim or not.  If hesubmits one, certain consequences will follow.  If he does not submit any, another set of consequences will follow.  Reasonable endeavoursto submit a proof of claim cannot improve the efficacy of the DRA.  I agree with Mr Manzoni that the terms proposed by CreditorCocould not be implied as a matter of business efficacy.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The operation of good faith is not a necessary element of the DRA for the purpose of giving it business efficacy.  As I have alreadymentioned, there is no principle of good faith of general application under our contract law and a party is free to act to the bestof its interest.  In the circumstances, it is difficult to imply an obligation to act to the best interest of the other parties ornot to do anything which may prejudice their interest to give business efficacy to the DRA.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  CreditorCoâs case could only be built on the basis of a common unexpressed intention of the parties.  By way of general observation,the DRA took two years to negotiate.  The parties were all represented by international financial and legal advisers.  The termsof the DRA were all negotiated.  The partiesâ financial and legal advisers must have knowledge that the obligation of good faithis not a principle recognised by English law.  As submitted by Mr Manzoni, no English lawyer would simply assume a common unexpressedintention to use good faith in a contract as detailed as this.  If such an obligation was intended, the parties would have set itout in detail.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  As for the implied obligation to using reasonable endeavours to file a proof of claim, the principal difficulty of CreditorCoâsargument is that no term could be implied if it is contrary to any express term.  There is no express obligation to file a proofof claim under the DRA on which the implied obligation of reasonable endeavour to file a proof of claim and good faith could be tagged. On the contrary, the parties have by careful deliberation decided what would happen in the event that no claim was submitted onor prior to 31 March 2002.  That was clearly provided for in clause 10.1(c) and reproduced in paragraph 3 of Schedule 14.  Havingreached agreement as to what would happen to the Reconstruction Consideration in that eventuality and having documented it, it couldnot have been the partiesâ common intention to be concerned with reasonable endeavour to file a proof of claim or good faith.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  As submitted by Mr Manzoni, what CreditiorCo seeks to imply is to re-write the DRA in an impermissible way.  Mr Sterling seeks tolimit the operation of clause 10.1(c) to circumstances when non-submission of a proof of claim was inadvertent but not if it wasdeliberate.  There is nothing in the DRA or in the surrounding circumstances to suggest such a fine distinction.  It is inconceivablethat such a fine distinction could have been recognised by the large number of parties to the DRA and that those parties could haveheld any common unexpressed intention in the terms as suggested by CreditorCo.  Indeed as the parties had reached agreement thatif they did not file a proof of claim, the Restructuring Consideration would revert to GDH, it is difficult to see how they couldalso have a common unexpressed intention that they would use reasonable endeavour to file a proof of claim or a nil proof of claim.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  I think the implied terms contended by CreditorCo is wholly unarguable.</p>    <p class="heading">Serious issue to be tried - contractual counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The construction of the DRA and the implied terms contended by CreditorCo is wholly unarguable.  On the true construction of clause10.1(c), the French Banks had the choice to submit or not to submit a proof of claim.  They were under no obligation under the DRAto act in the best interest of the creditors by submitting a nil proof of claim.  They were not in breach of any express or impliedterms of the DRA by entering into the French Banks Agreement and not to submit any proof of claim. </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  There are other arguments advanced by Mr Manzoni such as that CreditorCo is not an agent of the other creditors and has no rightto bring the claim on behalf of the other creditors, or that it suffered no damage because in whatever event it has to release theRestructuring Consideration.  I agree with Mr Chua SC that those issues are arguable.  I do not find it necessary to deal with themhere as I have reached the conclusion that the construction of the DRA and the terms sought to be implied by CreditorCo is simplyunarguable.  I am satisfied that the French Banks have shown that there is no serious issue to be tried under the contractual counterclaim.</p>    <p class="heading">Serious issue to be tried - conspiracy counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  CreditorCoâs case under the conspiracy counterclaim is that the French Banks conspired with GDH to use unlawful means to injureCreditorCo.  The unlawful means alleged by CreditorCo was the breach of express or implied terms of the DRA.  Mr Manzoni acceptsthat it is arguable that a breach of contract can constitute an unlawful means for the purpose of this tort.  However, in view ofmy conclusion that CreditorCoâs contractual counterclaim is unarguable, it must necessarily follow that the French Banks were notguilty of having engaged in any unlawful means against CreditorCo.  CreditorCoâs counterclaim in conspiracy must also fall withits counterclaim for breach of contract.  It is likewise unarguable. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Counsel are in disagreement as to whether in proving such a conspiracy, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant intended tocause him economic loss, either as an end in itself or as the necessary consequence of achieving some ulterior motive, and whetherthe defendantâs belief as to the effect of its action could constitute a defence.  I accept these are arguable issues which arenot finally settled.  But, these arguable issues can add nothing to undermine the French Banksâ argument that CreditorCoâs conspiracycounterclaim is unarguable.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  For the above reasons, I find CreditorCoâs counterclaim against the French Banks is wholly unarguable.  Accordingly, I allow the2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendantsâ appeal and set aside the service of the concurrent writ out of the jurisdiction on them.  I also make an order <i>nisi</i> that the Plaintiff by counterclaim shall pay the costs of the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants by counterclaim, such costs are to be taxed, if not agreed.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Though GDH, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by counterclaim, is not a party to these applications, it was brought into the hearing by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant by counterclaim.  Theattendance of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by counterclaim is unnecessary and it ought to realise that.  Thus, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by counterclaim is partly responsible for the costs wasted and should not be entitled to the full costs of its attendance. Accordingly, I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant by counterclaim shall only pay 50% of the costs of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by counterclaim.</p>    <p>                                                                        </p>    <p>                                                              </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> (Anthony To)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td style="text-align:center">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr. Joseph Chu, of Messrs Linklaters, for the Plaintiff by original action and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by counterclaim</p>        <p>Mr. Chua Guan Hock, SC and Mr. Hew Yang Wahn, instructed by Messrs Allen &amp; Overy, for the Defendant by original action and thePlaintiff by counterclaim</p>        <p>Mr. Charles Manzoni, instructed by Messrs Deacons, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant by counterclaim</p>        <p>Mr. Alfred H.H.
