By a Tenancy Agreement dated 16th September 1997 written in Chinese, the Plaintiffsas landlords let the flat and the car-parking space to the Defendant for a term of 2 years commencing from 1st October 1997 to 30thSeptember 1999 at a rent of HK$22,000 per calendar month exclusive of rates and management fees payable in advance on the first dayof each and every calendar month.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The Defendant is an architect by training. He works as an in-house architect for one of the two electricity companies in Hong Kong.He rented the premises as a residence for himself and his family, comprising his wife and two children who were 2 years old and 3months old at the material time. According to the Defendant whose evidence in this regard I accept, starting from early January 1998,water began to drip or leak from the ceiling of the flat during or after rainfall. This resulted in several complaints made by theDefendant to the first-named Plaintiff (Mr. Tsang) over the telephone. In fact, the leakage problem was not restricted to Flat 9Cwhich is situated on the top floor of Welcome Gardens. Similar leakage problems were also discovered in Flat A, Flat B and Flat Don the same floor. A neighbouring flat owner actually complained to the Incorporated Owners of Welcome Gardens about the problem.And the matter was discussed in a meeting of a management sub-committee of the Incorporated Owners on 20th February 1998. The sub-committeeagreed that the leakage problem in the top floor flats was due to the want of repair of the main roof of the building, and agreedthat immediate remedial action should be undertaken. But before it would recommend the Incorporated Owners to do so, it had to clarifythe ownership of the roof first. So nothing was done in the meantime to alleviate the leakage problem. The problem in Flat C deterioratedin around the end of April and beginning of May 1998 when the raining season began. According to the Defendant, there was a seriousleakage problem in the premises affecting the kitchen, the living room, and the 3 bedrooms. It is clear from the expert reports andthe photographs before me that in the kitchen, there was a damp patch with paint peeling off on the ceiling, from where water dripped.Moreover, according to the Defendant and his expert (Mr. Allan Lam), the problem was not restricted to the kitchen. In the livingroom as well as the bedrooms, very thin layers of water moisture were found on the ceiling soffit, and moulds were also found onthe walls and ceiling. The impression of the Defendant's expert who had visited the premises on 18th June 1998 was that the wholepremises was in a very 'damp condition'. According to the Defendant, during heavy rainfall or immediately thereafter, the walls inthe bedrooms were damp and wet, and since the beds were placed next to the walls, the beds and those sleeping on the beds were wetteddue to capillary action of the water. According to the Defendant, his children got sick allegedly as a result.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> Starting from 12th May 1998, the Defendant wrote various letters of complaint to Mr. Tsang regarding the condition of the premises.He held Mr. Tsang as the landlord liable for the condition of the premises and required Mr. Tsang to carry out immediate remedialaction. He said Mr. Tsang had agreed to do so over the telephone, but nothing much or effective was done.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> It is common ground that Mr. Tsang together with three other owners of the 9th floor flats instructed a surveyor, Mr. Dennis Wong,to inspect the 4 flats as well as the roof on 1st June 1998. So far as Flat C was concerned, Mr. Wong visited the flat, asked theoccupants the location where water leaked, and was told that the problem existed in the kitchen. He went to look at the kitchen andobserved that there were water drips and damp patch with paint peeling off on the ceiling in the kitchen. He did not, however, inspectthe other parts of the premises. According to Mr. Wong's report made following his inspection, the leakage problem occurred afterrainy days. The leaking locations were mainly found at the kitchens of the affected flats. According to Mr. Wong, rainwater mostlikely penetrated directly or by capillary action through the defective waterproof system beneath the tiles and the concrete slabon the main roof. Sometimes, water might seep into the weak points of the roof and could travel long distances before finding itsway out even through the minutest cracks. The weakest points as revealed were the cracks at the concrete kerb, joints of the tiles,cracks at the surface channels, the defective areas of the waterproofing layer, the cracked and porous area of the cement sand screedingand concrete slab etc. Mr. Wong recommended either partial re-roofing of the leaking areas or better still, a total re-roofing.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> It is also common ground that on 15th June 1998, Mr. Tsang instructed a contractor to apply a thin layer of waterproof coat on thatpart of the roof tiles immediately above the kitchen of Flat C. This, according to the Defendant and his expert, was not effectivein alleviating the difficulty experienced in Flat C. As I said, Mr. Allan Lam, the Defendant's expert, inspected Flat C on 18th June1998. Unlike Mr. Dennis Wong, he carried out a thorough inspection of the whole premises including the bedrooms. As I said, he observedthat there were very thin layers of water moisture on the ceiling in the bedrooms and the living room. He observed areas of mouldgrowth in the bedrooms and the living room. He found the flat to be in a very damp condition. He commented that he himself wouldnot have wanted to live in such a flat. He was of the view that the temporary waterproof coating applied on the roof tiles on 15thJune 1998 was not effective at all. By and large, he agreed with Mr. Wong's analysis of the cause of the leakage in the present case,but he took the view that the problem could only be solved by complete re-roofing.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> It is clear from the correspondence that the Defendant was not satisfied with the result of the temporary remedial work done on 15thJune 1998. He continued to press Mr. Tsang for taking further and more permanent remedial action.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> According to the correspondence and the minutes of the Incorporated Owners, a notice had already been put up by the IncorporatedOwners on 25th May 1998 that some remedial site action would be taken once the weather was fine. That was done pursuant to a resolutionpassed in a meeting of the Incorporated Owners back in April. At that time, they had also obtained a tender for carrying out theremedial work. But for some technicality, they required to obtain several more tenders. That apparently delayed the work. Moreoverit should be noted that according to the evidence the weather in June 1998 was bad and no effective remedial work could be carriedout under those circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Apparently towards the end of July, Mr. Tsang was advised by the Incorporated Owners that re-roofing to remedy the water-leakingproblem would be carried out in the coming one or two weeks. This is evidenced by a letter written by Mr. Tsang to the Defendanton 28th July 1998. In fact according to the minutes of the management sub-committee of the Incorporated Owners held on 1st August1998, they were still seeking further tenders from interested contractors, with a view to obtaining the best price for carrying outthe work.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In the meantime, the Defendant felt that he could tolerate the situation no more, and decided to vacate the premises. This he andhis family did on 27th July 1998. By a letter dated 4th August 1998, he so informed Mr. Tsang. By a separate letter dated 6th August1998, he returned the keys to Mr. Tsang. The Plaintiffs did not accept the unilateral termination of the tenancy by the Defendant.They regarded it as a wrongful repudiation of the same. By a letter dated 12th August 1998, the Plaintiffs through their solicitorswrote to the Defendant to accept his wrongful repudiation of the tenancy agreement. The parties could not resolve their dispute,and this action was commenced.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> In this action, the Plaintiffs claim for the arrears of rent and management fees from 1st July 1998 to 11th August 1998 when the(alleged) wrongful repudiation was accepted. The Plaintiffs also claim for various sundry expenses in arrears. Moreover, at one stage,the Plaintiffs commenced distraint proceedings against the Defendant for recovery of arrears of rent for the month of July. However,before the bailiff proceeded to distrain the premises, it came to the notice of the Plaintiffs (on 10th August 1998) that the Defendanthad already vacated the premises. A sum of $4,000 being legal costs and disbursements for the distraint proceedings was incurredby the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs claim against the Defendant this sum of money.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> Further, the Plaintiffs say they have incurred a sum of $3,500 to repair and repaint the wallpaper and doors which were in need ofrepair after the Defendant vacated the flat. The Plaintiffs also spent a sum of $6,500 on the wooden flooring, the kitchen door andthe clothes drying rack as required by a new tenant found by the Plaintiffs after the Defendant left the premises, as well as removingthe Defendant's cabinet left in the flat. After the Defendant moved out of the flat, the Plaintiffs managed to find a new tenantto rent the premises from 16th September 1998 at a rent of $14,280 per month inclusive of rates and management fees. In this action,the Plaintiffs therefore claim against the Defendant for the loss of or difference in rentals for the remainder of the Defendant'sterm of tenancy up to 30th September 1999. On top, the Plaintiffs also claim for the agency fees and stamp duty incurred in re-lettingthe premises to the new tenant.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> On the other hand, the Defendant counterclaims against the Plaintiffs for their failure to remedy the water leakage problem. He counterclaimsfor the professional investigation fees of Mr. Allan Lam, the medical expenses for treating his children, the deposits paid underthe tenancy agreement with the Defendant, a sum of $235,200 being compensation for "nuisance-free premises for remaining period oforiginal tenancy agreement", agency fee for renting a new flat after moving out from the Plaintiffs' flat, removal expenses as wellas refund of rates.</p>    <p class="heading">Condition of the Premises</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> I accept the evidence of the Defendant and his expert Mr. Allan Lam regarding the condition of the premises at the height of theproblem, i.e. between May and July 1998. The Defendant was the person who resided in the premises at the material time. He gave first-handevidence as to what the condition of the premises was like at the time. Mr. Allan Lam inspected the premises on 18th June 1998. Heinspected every part of the premises. Although the photographs he took were less than satisfactory, I have no reason to doubt thegeneral accuracy of his report, or for that matter, his recollection of the actual condition of the premises at the time of his inspection.Like his counterpart, Mr. Dennis Wong, Mr. Lam is an experienced authorized person who has carried out many water leakage remedialwork before.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> On the other hand, Mr. Tsang only visited the premises on 10th August 1998 after the Defendant had vacated the premises. He saidhe did not find any leakage problem within the premises. But there is no evidence before me regarding the weather condition betweenlate July and mid-August in 1998. Mr. Tsang said 2 days before his visit, Typhoon Signal No. 3 had been hoisted. Again I have noevidence regarding the actual rainfall brought by the typhoon. Mr. Tsang said after he re-let the premises to the new tenant, therewas no complaint from the new tenant. That may well have been so but most probably this was due to the fact that from the end ofAugust to early September, the Incorporated Owners hired a contractor to carry out rather extensive remedial work to the main roofand apparently this proved to be quite effective in rectifying the problem. By a "certificate" dated 17th April 1999, the chairmanof the Incorporated Owners certified that there was no report of water leakage since the completion of the remedial work on 5th September1998.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> As regards Mr. Dennis Wong, as I said, he had inspected the kitchen of the flat in question in quite some detail. He had also lookedat the living room of Flat 9C. But his approach was to focus on those locations were complaints of water leakage were made by theoccupants. So he admitted in the box that he did not thoroughly inspect the condition in the living room. He also frankly admittedin his second report prepared for the purpose of this litigation as well as in the witness box that he had not inspected the 3 bedroomsat all.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The upshot of all these is that there is really nothing to contradict the direct and first hand evidence given on oath by the Defendantand Mr. Allan Lam. More importantly, I find them to be truthful witnesses in this regard. I find that the condition of the premisesat the material time was that as described by them in evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Responsibility for the main roof</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> Who was responsible for maintaining the main roof, the lack of repair to which caused the water leakage problem in Flat C? The Plaintiffsare the co-owners of the Welcome Gardens. The Deed of Mutual Covenant in question did not give the right to exclusive possessionof the main roof to any of the co-owners. The main roof is therefore a common part of the building. This also accords with the definitionof "common parts" in section 2 of and the First Schedule to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344">Cap. 344</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> Had the Plaintiffs been given the right to exclusive possession of the main roof, they would have been responsible for taking reasonablecare to maintain the main roof: See for instance <strong>Orient Trading House v. Kat Tak Investment Co. Ltd</strong>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20HKLR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] HKLR 513.</a> However, whether they were given the exclusive right to possess the roof would not, in my view, matter. So long as they are the <em>co-owners</em> of the main roof, they would be under a duty, together with the other co-owners, to maintain the main roof. And if due to the lackof maintenance and repair to the main roof, an occupier of Flat C was affected by water leakage problem, they would be liable tothe occupier under the general law of <em>tort</em>, even if they were <em>not</em> the landlords of the occupier. And according to Orient Trading House, as the Plaintiffs were the landlords, they would (in addition)be under a duty (under <em>contract</em> and <em>tenancy law</em>) to the tenant to take reasonable care to maintain the roof, and their failure to do so would have landed them in liability towardsthe tenant.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> But the situation in the present case is different. The co-owners have incorporated themselves into an Incorporated Owners of WelcomeGardens pursuant to the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>. One of the important legal consequences of the incorporation is set out in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the Ordinance:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"When the owners of a building have been incorporated under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8</a>, the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the owners in relation to the common parts of the building shall be exercised and performedby, and the liabilities of the owners in relation to the common parts of the building shall, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance,be enforceable against, the corporation to the exclusion of the owners, and accordingly-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) any notice, order or other document which relates to any of the common parts of the building may be served upon the corporationat its registered office; and</p>            <p class="quote">(b) any proceedings in the tribunal in respect of any of the common parts of the building may be brought and pursued by or againstthe corporation."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Further, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18</a> (1) (a) of the Ordinance provides that: "the corporation shall maintain the common parts and the property of the corporation in astate of good and serviceable repair and clean condition".</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Thus it is clear that after the incorporation, the Incorporated Owners has the right over the main roof and has the duty to maintainthe main roof, all "to the exclusion of the co-owners" including the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Thus the factual distinction of the present case from a case like <strong>Orient Trading</strong> is that the water leakage problem in the present case had its source in a part of the building that was under the exclusive controland management of the Incorporated Owners, rather than the landlord.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> As a matter of legal analysis, the present case is no different in nature from a case where water leaked from an upper floor occupiedexclusively by another flat owner; or to take an extreme hypothetical example, a case where water was sprayed into the flat throughits window from a neighbouring high-rising building.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> So prima facie, the complaints of the Defendant should be directed against the Incorporated Owners. His landlords, the Plaintiffs,were like him, victims of the water leakage problem, caused by the condition of the main roof in relation to which the IncorporatedOwners had the exclusive statutory right and duty to carry out the necessary maintenance and repair.</p>    <p class="heading">Tenancy Agreement</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> If this is so, what is the possible justification for the Defendant's refusal to pay rent or his moving out of the premises withoutthe consent of the Plaintiffs? (It should be added here that originally the rent for July was not paid. But after commencement ofproceedings, the Plaintiffs obtained summary judgment against the Defendant for payment of the rent for the month of July up to 27thJuly 1998 when the Defendant vacated the premises together with payment of the pro-rata management fees and rates. The judgment hasbeen satisfied by the Defendant.)</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Can a duty to maintain the demised premises in a certain condition be made out from the landlord and tenant relationship, or canthe tenant argue that the landlord was under a duty to do repair pursuant to the Tenancy Agreement? The Tenancy Agreement in questionobviously did not provide for any duty on the part of the landlord to carry out any repair. So the Defendant can only succeed ifhe can pray in aid the general law.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> It was accepted by Mr. Cheung, Counsel for the Plaintiffs, that the premises were let as furnished premises. In that case, therewas an implied warranty that the premises were fit for habitation at the commencement of the tenancy. Mr. Cheung argued that thepremises were indeed fit for habitation at the commencement of the tenancy in September 1997. The leakage problem only arose in Januaryor February 1998. I agree with Mr. Cheung's submission. There is no or no sufficient evidence before me to suggest that the leakageproblem was a pre-existing one. The evidence before me suggests that the problem only started in January 1998. In any event, thereis no evidence before me that back in September 1997, the premises were in a condition as poor as that observed in May to July 1998.The Defendant, himself an architect, did not notice any problem when he decided to rent the premises. He did not make any complaintuntil the beginning of 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28</a> ï¼ As regards the implied covenant for quiet enjoyment, in my judgment, it does not help the Defendant either. The implied covenantwould only catch acts or omissions interfering with the tenant's ordinary and lawful enjoyment of the premises by the landlord orthrough the lawful acts of anyone claiming through or under him or by title paramount. As I said, by law the rights and liabilitiesin respect of, and in particular the duty to maintain and repair, the main roof lied with the Incorporated Owners. The acts or omissions,if any, of the Incorporated Owners could not be attributed to the Plaintiffs as landlords. So this implied covenant does not assistthe tenant at all.</p>    <p class="heading">Oral agreement to repair</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> The Defendant argued that if there was no duty under the Tenancy Agreement or general law on the part of the landlord to repair,and if the general law of tort did not assist him (because only the Incorporated Owners had the rights and duties relating to themain roof), there was nonetheless an oral agreement reached with the landlords (as represented by Mr. Tsang) that the landlords wouldbe wholly responsible for carrying out the remedial work. He relied on a series of correspondence between the parties from 12th May1998 to 25th July 1998 before he eventually vacated the premises. In particular, the Defendant relied on a letter dated 9th June1998 he wrote to Mr. Tsang. It referred to a telephone conversation between the Defendant and Mr. Tsang on 6th June 1998. The letterwent on to say as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I would like to record the following agreements agreed by both parties during the above conversation.</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1) The owner shall take the whole responsibility to repair the waterproofing works at roof to a satisfactory standard and the saidworks will be started asap or once the weather is fine.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(2) The owner will take immediately action to repair the kitchen ceiling in order to improve the existing condition.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(3) The owner agreed to have a rent reduction to the tenant after the completion of the above works and the owner will take the currentmarket rate at the surrounding areas for his reference of a rent reduction. The extra money of previously deposit will be refundedto the tenant once the rent reduction have been agreed.</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(4) The owner and the tenant agreed to terminate the tenancy agreement (CR. no. #872/233156), which was made on 24th September 1997,at the end of September 1998, if the rate of the rent reduction cannot be agreed by both parties as mentioned on the above item 3."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Firstly, the accuracy of the above extract of what had been agreed was doubtful. In my judgment, according to the correspondenceand Mr. Tsang's evidence in this regard (which I accept), there was no agreement to reduce rent or terminate the tenancy, and paragraphs(3) and (4) above were wrong in so far as they suggested that an agreement had been reached. More importantly, in my view, this lettermust be read in its proper context. I shall not repeat in detail the correspondence passing between the parties, amongst which theletter of 9th June 1998 was but one. As I mentioned above, the Incorporated Owners had by a notice dated 25th May 1998 stated thatit would take immediate remedial site action, weather permitting. This really, in my view, set the scene.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31</a> ï¼ The Defendant as the tenant of the building must have been aware of the attitude of the Incorporated Owners. Moreover, this wasspecifically pointed out to the Defendant by Mr. Tsang in his letter dated 4th June 1998. So both sides knew that the IncorporatedOwners had assumed the duty to repair the roof. This also accorded with common sense. The water leakage problem was caused by thecondition of the main roof. It affected not only Flat 9C but other flats on the 9th floor as well. The main roof was not occupiedor controlled by any of the flat owners in the building in question. Even to a layman, it should have been apparent that the mainroof was a common part of the building under the control of the building management, i.e. the Incorporated Owners in the presentcase. It was simply just right for the Incorporated Owners to assume responsibility for repairing the main roof. Moreover, it musthave been apparent to the Defendant that the Incorporated Owners was run by a committee and elected members. As a co-owner of thebuilding, Mr. Tsang would have some say about how the affairs of the Incorporated Owners would be run. But that would only be anindirect and limited say in a meeting of the Incorporated Owners. Mr. Tsang by himself could not have been able to dictate what theIncorporated Owners should or should not do or when things should be done, at least in the absence of resort to legal action againstthe Incorporated Owners which would be a drastic step to take from any angle. Moreover, as an architect himself, the Defendant musthave realised that the leakage problem in Flat C could not be eliminated by work unilaterally done by Mr. Tsang to that part of themain roof immediately above Flat C. Any work would have to cover other parts of the main roof, if not the upper extremities of theexternal walls of the building as well. It would not have made good or reasonable sense to require or expect Mr. Tsang to carry outthe work all by himself.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Against all these, one should look at the alleged oral agreement. In my view, the so-called oral agreement as evidenced by the correspondence,on its proper construction and reading, was no more than an acknowledgement by Mr. Tsang that he would use his best to ask the IncorporatedOwners to carry out the necessary remedial work as soon as possible and practicable. Nothing further than that was assumed or agreedto by Mr. Tsang.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> On the evidence before me, Mr. Tsang had together with 3 flat owners on the 9th floor instructed a surveyor (Mr. Dennis Wong) tocarry out an inspection of the flats affected and to prepare a report for submission to the Incorporated Owners. They had also togetherhire a firm of solicitors to press the Incorporated Owners for action. Mr. Tsang had retained a contractor to paint a layer of waterproofcoat on that part of the main roof immediately above Flat 9C. Mr. Tsang had attended some of the relevant meetings of the IncorporatedOwners. In my view, there is nothing to suggest that Mr. Tsang had not done his best to ask the Incorporated Owners to take action.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> Moreover, even assuming that Mr. Tsang had failed to do so, that failure, in my judgment, did not cause the Defendant any loss. Itis clear from the documents and in particular the minutes of the meetings of the Incorporated Owners and its sub-committee that theIncorporated Owners had a procedure to follow and adopt. They met to discuss the matter, they reviewed the complaints from the flatowners and the lawyers and the surveyors, they clarified the title to the main roof, they called for tenders, reviewed them and calledfor further tenders, in order to get the best possible price. They had a balancing exercise to do, i.e. balancing on the one handthe problems experienced by the affected flat owners and occupiers, and on the other the need to carry out the work as economicallyas possible bearing in mind that all the co-owners of the building (whether affected by the water leakage problem or not) had toshoulder the cost. In short, they took their time to consider and eventually adopt the measure to take, and moreover there was theweather condition to consider. Bearing all these in mind, even assuming (which in my judgment was not the case) Mr. Tsang did notdo his best to ask the Incorporated Owners to take action, that did not result in any delay or loss to the Defendant. The matterwas quite simply beyond the control of Mr. Tsang.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> Mr. Cheung also argued that a mere agreement on the part of a landlord to do some repair work does not by itself prove that therehad been a change or a transfer of the burden of repair: <strong>London Hospital Governors v. Jacobs</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%201%20WLR%20662" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] 1 WLR 662</a>, 637 per Lord Evershed M.R.; <em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em> (4th ed. reissue) Vol. 27(1) para. 328. I agree but everything would depend on the actual facts and circumstances of each case. Butthis does reinforce my view that in the present case, one should be very slow to conclude that Mr. Tsang had, despite the generallaw and the position of the Incorporated Owners, agreed to shoulder the burden to carry out the extensive work to repair.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Mr. Cheung further argued that had Mr. Tsang really agreed to carry out repair work to the main roof by himself, that duty wouldnot be an absolute one. All that he was required to do would be to take reasonable care. That of course would depend on the trueand proper construction of the agreement reached. But in the absence of very specific words, I would tend to agree with Mr. Cheung'ssubmission. As pointed out in <strong>Orient Trading House</strong>, at common law a landlord is not an insurer of the safety of his tenant or his goods. Defect is not synonymous with fault. He mustexercise reasonable care to see that that part of the building remaining in his possession and control is maintained in a reasonablygood condition. This duty arises out of the relationship of landlord and tenant. And in the absence of a very specific wording inthe alleged agreement, I would have construed the agreement to repair to be no more than an agreement to take reasonable care todo remedial work. Mr. Cheung went on to argue that his clients had discharged the duty by instructing a contractor to paint a thinlayer of waterproof coat on that part of the roof immediately above Flat 9C. The more permanent remedial work was done in end ofAugust. In my view, if Mr. Cheung were forced to argue at such a level, his clients' case would be quite problematic. It is commonground amongst the experts that the area of application of the waterproof coat was too small given the nature of the leakage. Inother words, Mr. Tsang ought to have instructed the contractor to paint the layer of waterproof coat on the adjacent parts of themain roof as well as a temporary measure to prevent water from leaking into Flat 9C. Just painting that portion of the main roofabove Flat 9C would not be sufficient. Water could seep into the main roof from the unprotected portions of the main roof and bycapillary action find its way into Flat 9C.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> Mr. Cheung also argued that there was no consideration for the alleged agreement given that his clients otherwise had no legal dutyto carry out any repair at all. But compromising the tenant's complaints could possibly supply the necessary consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> But as I say, in my view, the true construction of the so-called agreement between the parties was no more than that Mr. Tsang acknowledgedthat he would do his best to ask the Incorporated Owners to carry out the remedial work as soon as possible and practicable. He didnot personally undertake to do the work himself. In fact, I doubt very much whether Mr. Tsang had the right to go up to the mainroof to carry out the work, in the light of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 16</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">18</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p class="heading">Frustration</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> This was not pleaded or argued before me. In my view, the water leakage problem in Flat 9C, though serious, did not amount to a frustratingevent. The flat could still be occupied and used, and the problem was solved by early September 1998. See generally <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (28th ed.) Vol. 1 paras. 24-050 to 24-053.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion on liability</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> What is the result? In my judgment, the Defendant was not entitled to vacate the premises. His problem was caused by water leakagefrom the main roof, the responsibility to repair which lied exclusively with the Incorporated Owners. The Incorporated Owners mayor may not have failed to regularly maintain the main roof, and they may or may not have delayed in carrying out remedial action.The Incorporated Owners is not before me in this action, and I say no more than what I have already said. But one thing is clear.I can find no duty on the part of the Plaintiffs, the landlords, whether under the general law, under the Tenancy Agreement in question,or under the so-called oral agreement, to maintain the premises in any condition, or to carry out the necessary repair or rectificationwork. This being the case, the Defendant had no right to unilaterally vacate the premises, thereby wrongfully terminating or repudiatingthe Tenancy Agreement. The Plaintiffs were entitled to accept the Defendant's wrongful repudiation of the Tenancy Agreement. Andthe Defendant is therefore liable for the legal consequences. I come to this conclusion not without some sympathy to the positionof the Defendant and his family. But as I pointed out above, the responsibility for maintaining and repairing the main roof liedexclusively with the Incorporated Owners.</p>    <p class="heading">Quantum</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The Defendant did not dispute the amounts claimed against him in the final submission. He only disputed liability. This was confirmedtwice by the Defendant to me during final submission. In any event, the Plaintiffs' claims are well supported by documents.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> In my judgment, the Plaintiffs are entitled to claim the following items and amounts:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="90%">            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top">Arrears of rent (1.7.98 - 11.8.98)</td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="20%" valign="top">$29,807</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top">Management fees (1.8.98 -11.8.98)</td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="20%" valign="top">$277</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top">Utility and sundry expenses</td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="20%" valign="top">$3,517</td>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top">Costs in distraint proceedings</td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="20%" valign="top"><u>$4,000</u></td>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>                <td style="text-align:right" width="20%" valign="top"><u>$37,601</u></td>                <td width="20%" valign="top"></td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p>From it, I should deduct a sum of $21,827 being the partial summary judgment obtained by the Plaintiffs against the Defendant pursuantto Master Poon's Order. Thus the net sum is <em>$15,774</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Further, the Plaintiffs are entitled to the following, namely, loss of or difference in rentals of $121,433 between 12.8.98 and 30.9.99[$22,000 x 13 months &amp; 19 days - $14,280 x 12.5 months (16.9.98 - 30.9.99)]; loss in rates in the sum of $4,999 between 1.10.98and 30.9.99, and $10,634 being loss in management fees between 12.8.98 and 30.9.99. The total is <em>$137,066</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Furthermore, the Defendant is liable for the agency fees and stamp duty incurred by the Plaintiffs in re-letting the premises toa new tenant in a total sum of <em>$7,571</em>. The Plaintiffs incurred $3,500 in making good the premises after the Defendant vacated the premises and incurred another sum of$6,500 to fix or slightly improve the premises in order to make it attractive and acceptable to the new tenant. In my judgment, thePlaintiffs had done their best to re-let the premises to the new tenant. I have no reason to doubt that the new rent reflected thethen current market rent bearing in mind the downturn of the economy since late 1997. I accept that the slight improvement done tothe premises was necessary in order to make the premises acceptable to the new tenant. Therefore I award the further sum of <em>$10,000</em> for the repair and improvement work.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Thus the total amounts to $170,411 ($15,774 + $137,066 + $7,571 + $10,000). Credit should be given for the rental deposit of $44,000paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs. Thus the net sum is $126,411. In other words, I give judgment in favour of the Plaintiffsagainst the Defendant in the net sum of <em>$126,411</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> I also award interest on this sum of $126,411 at a rate of 8% per annum. I do not think a higher rate of interest should be awardedin this case given that it is not a commercial case. As for the interest period, I note that a substantial part of the net judgmentcomprises the difference in rentals for the remainder of the original term of tenancy. Therefore interest on this portion shouldnot begin to run, as argued by Mr. Cheung, from the date following the acceptance of the wrongful repudiation by the Defendant on12th August 1998. By that date, the bulk of the difference in rentals had not even been incurred. For the ease of calculation, Iwould award interest from 1st February 1999 to the date of judgment and thereafter at the judgment rate. I choose 1st February 1999because this is approximately located at the mid-point of the remainder of the un-expired term of the original tenancy, and the differencein rentals comprised the bulk of the judgment sum recovered by the Plaintiffs against the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The result might, at first glance, seem harsh to the Defendant who and whose family had suffered because of the water leakage problem.I have already explained above the law and its application in this case. I shall not repeat myself. But it should be noted that afterthe Defendant moved out from the premises, he rented a slightly bigger flat at a very much reduced rate (also due to the downturnof economy). The new flat had no leakage problem. So in a sense, the result of this litigation is simply that he has to, as it were,disgorge the "gain" in rentals he thus earned after July 1998, and more or less be restored to the same position he would have beenin had he not prematurely and wrongfully vacated the suit premises.</p>    <p class="heading">Counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> I formally dismiss the counterclaim.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> I make an order nisi that the Defendant do pay the Plaintiffs their costs of this action (including the counterclaim) to be taxedif not agreed.
