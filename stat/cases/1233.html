Introduction</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  These two actions were heard together as they are having common issues of law and fact.  The main dispute for determination at trialis whether the loan in DCCJ 858 of 2009 (â1<sup>st</sup> actionâ) (âthe NPCL Loansâ) and the interest payment (âthe NPGL Interestâ) in DCCJ 859 of 2009 (â2<sup>nd</sup> actionâ) were time-barred.  In addition, the Defendant in the 2<sup>nd</sup> action contended that it did not owe any interest payment to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Plaintiff, Silver Gem Industrial Limited (âSGILâ) was and still is controlled by Mr. Sin Lam Kwong (âSinâ).  Sin investedinto the respective defendants, namely National Pharmaceutical Company Limited (âNPCLâ) and National Pharmaceutical (Group) Limited(âNPGLâ) by making various loans in the name of Silver Gem to them.  The Plaintiff claims against NPCL for the balance of theNPCL Loans in the sum of HK$350,000 in addition to the interest accruing from 15<sup>th</sup> January 1996 to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2008 in the sum of $465,754.48.  It also claims against NPGL in the sum of HK$318,533.43, being the interest payment accruedbetween 1995 and 1997 for various loans advanced in 1995 in the total amount of $2,250,000.00.</p>    <p class="heading">B.           BACKGROUND</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  NPCL was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1966.  Silver Gem was incorporated in 1989 with Sin as one of the first directors. NPGL wasincorporated in 1993.   NPCL was and still is the wholly owned subsidiary of NPGL.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> action, on 15<sup>th</sup> January 1996, Silver Gem advanced a loan in the sum of HK$700,000 (â1<sup>st</sup> NPCL Loanâ) to NPCL which was for the purpose of business development of NPCL and was repayable on demand and with interest payableat 12% per annum.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 15<sup>th</sup> April 1997, NPCL repaid HK$150,000 to Silver Gem as partial repayment of the First NPCL Loan and Silver Gem extended the outstandingamount, HK$550,000 to NPCL as a further loan on the same terms as the 1<sup>st</sup> NPCL Loan (â2<sup>nd</sup> NPCL Loanâ).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  NPCL repaid HK$200,000 to Silver Gem on 26<sup>th</sup> January 1998 as partial repayment of the Second NPCL Loan, leaving the balance of the principal, HK$350,000 and the interest outstanding. Silver Gem alleged that since 1<sup>st</sup> April 2003, NPCL changed and reduced the interest rate from 12% per annum to 6% per annum.  NPCL did not challenge the outstandingbalance and interest but she contended that the said amount, including interest, was time-barred.  This is the main dispute of the1<sup>st</sup> action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> action, on divers dates between 10<sup>th</sup> March 1995 and 4<sup>th</sup> December 1995, Silver Gem advanced various loans to NPGL in the total sum of HK$2.25 million.  The said loans were injected intoNPGL for the purpose of financing a manufacturer in Peopleâs Republic of China known at the material time as Pan Yu National PharmaceuticalCompany Limited.  HK$2.25 million was fully repaid on or before 15<sup>th</sup> April 1997.  However, the Plaintiff said that the loans were subject to an interest rate of 12% per annum while NPGL denied thatthey were subject to interest.  Further, NPGL contended that even if the loans were subject to interest payment, it was time barredas the cause of action accrued in 1995 when the loans were made (the Writ was issued on 23<sup>rd</sup> February 2009).  These are the main disputes of the 2<sup>nd</sup> action.</p>    <p class="heading">C.           ISSUES</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The main issue, which is common to both actions, is whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> NPCL Loan and interest thereon and the NPGL Interest were time barred pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>, Laws of Hong Kong?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In addition to the point of limitation, in respect of NPGL Interest, whether the NPGL loan was subject to a rate of interest of12% per annum?</p>    <p class="heading">D.      DISCUSSION</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4</a> (1) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> provides that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â<i>The following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued, thatis to say-</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>(a)  </i> <i>actions founded on simple contract or tort;</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>(b)  </i> <i>actions to enforce a recognizance â¦;</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>(c)   </i> <i>actions to enforce an awardâ¦;</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>(d)  </i> <i>actions to recover any sum recoverable by virtue of any Ordinance or imperial enactmentâ¦ â     </i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The background of this case shows that the Parties did not have material factual disputes. Silver Gem called Sin to testify whileNPCL and NPGL called Mr. Ho Thi Sun to testify.  They referred to some account documents and stated their views on those documents. I do not intend to set out the factual matrix unless those are relevant to the point of limitation. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  To begin with, the limitation period begins to run from the â<i>date on which the cause of action accrued</i>â.  Mr. Chan, Counsel for the Defendant, submitted that in a case where the date of repayment of a loan was not agreed upon or theloan was repayable on demand, the cause of action accrued when the loan was made. see: <i><u>Lee Siu Fong Mary v. Ngai Yee Chai</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%201%20HKC%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 1 HKC 157</a></i> at Â§10 per Cheung JA; see also <i><u>McGhee, Limitation Periods (5<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2006)</u>,</i> Â§10.014; <i><u>Chitty on Contracts (30<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2008)</u>,</i> Â§28-036. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In respect of the interest claims in both actions, Mr. Chan submitted that Silver Gemâs claims on interest arising from the relevantloans are also time-barred.  It is propounded that once the right to recover the principal sum is time-barred, any claim to interestarising from that principal sum is also time-barred because interest is accessory to the principal, see: <i><u>Cheang Thye Phin v. Lam Kin Sang</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1929%5d%20AC%20670" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1929] AC 670</a> at 676-677 per Lord Warrington; <u>Elder v. Northcott</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%202%20Ch%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] 2 Ch 422</a> at 427-430 per Clauson J; <u>Chitty on Contracts (30<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2008)</u>, Â§28-038.</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It seems to me that on the Plaintiffâs own case, the 2<sup>nd</sup> NPCL Loan has no fixed repayment terms and is said to be repayable on demand.  During cross-examination, Sin confirmed that thiswas Silver Gemâs case. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  As a result, Mr. Chan submitted that whether referring to the relevant dates of the 2<sup>nd</sup> NPCL Loan advanced on 15<sup>th</sup> April 1997 or the last partial repayment on 26<sup>th</sup> January 1998, the 2<sup>nd</sup> NPCL Loan and the interest thereon were time-barred.  The same equally applies to NPGL Interest when the principal loans were advancedin 1995 and the loans were fully repaid on 15<sup>th</sup> April 1997.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Mr. Leung, counsel for the Plaintiff, did not challenge the above legal propositions.  But he submitted that the outstanding loansand interest in both actions were not subject to any limitation of time.  When the Court sought to clarify with him whether it wasthe Plaintiffâs case that there was an agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant to exclude the application of limitationperiod, he answered âNoâ.  In short, I do not see there is any legal or factual basis to suggest that the outstanding loans andinterest were not subject to any limitation of time.  I do not accept his argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  That is not the end.  In respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> NPCL Loan, the Plaintiff sought to rely on the audit confirmation dated 4<sup>th</sup> July 2007 and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 23(3)</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">24</a>(1) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> to suggest that <i>âthere was a part payment or an acknowledgment of debtâ</i> and the limitation period begins to run from 4<sup>th</sup> July 2007 and hence the 2<sup>nd</sup> NPCL Loan was not time barred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The point of acknowledgment of debt was not pleaded by the Plaintiff and the Defendant submitted that it amounts to âtrial byambushâ and this Court should not allow the Plaintiff to take the Defendant by surprise.  See: <i><u>Busch v. Stevens</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20QB%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 QB 1</a></i> at 7-8 per Lawton J; <i><u>Jacob &amp; Goldrein, Pleadings: Principles and Practice (1990)</u></i>, p.161.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It seems to be right.  However, I also note that evidence was adduced in relation to the descriptions of the said audit confirmationand the Defendant also relied on those evidence, especially the only witness for the Plaintiff, Sin confirmed that the handwrittenwords appear therein seems to suggest that receiver of the audit confirmation disputed the debt of HK$350,000.  I do not see theoverall justice should prevent me from considering that part of evidence, which may be relevant to the point of acknowledgment ofdebt. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  As a result and for completeness sake, I shall come to the point of acknowledgement of debt. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 23</a> (3) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> provides that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â<i>Where any right of action has accrued to recover any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim, or any claim to the personal estateof a deceased person or to any share or interest therein, and the person liable or accountable therefore <u>acknowledges the claim or makes any payment in respect thereof, the right shall be deemed to have accrued on and not before the dateof the acknowledgment or the last payment</u>â¦â  </i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 24</a> (1)(2) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> provides that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â<i>(1) Every such acknowledgment as aforesaid shall be in writing and signed by the person making the acknowledgment.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><i>(2) Any such acknowledgment or payment as aforesaid may be made by the agent of the person by whom it is required to be made under<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23</a>, and shall be made to the person, or to an agent of the person, whose title or claim is being acknowledged or, as the case may be,in respect of whose claim the payment is being made.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I should set out the descriptions of the said acknowledgment or audit confirmation before I deal with the partiesâ submissions:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1)  It is stated to be âAudit Confirmationâ dated 4<sup>th</sup> July 2007, sent by S.

In effect,he asked me to ignore the handwritten words and the lines crossing out the figure of HK$350,000.00.   I do not accept this approachespecially his witness also confirmed that the effect of the handwritten words amount to disputing the debt. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In the present case, the fair reading of the audit confirmation itself reflects that NPCL was disputing the debt on the ground thattheir record did not show the debt.  It does not constitute an acknowledgment by the debtor of a liability to pay outstanding amountsto a creditor for the purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23(3).</a>  If, according to what Mr. Leung said it is an acknowledgment, it seems to me that it is a qualified or equivocal acknowledgmentthat is not sufficient for the purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23(3).</a>  The Plaintiffâs contention on the acknowledgment of debt under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23(3)</a> must fail too.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  For all the above reasons, both of the Plaintiffâs claims were time barred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The Defendant also contended that leaving aside the limitation point, on evidence, the NPGL Loans were not subject to interest asalleged by the Plaintiff.   My view is this.  Firstly, the Plaintiff relied on a time loan record that Sin said that he retrievedfrom NPGL or it was prepared by NPGL.  In that document, in so far as the NPGL loans are concerned, the heading of 7<sup>th</sup> column is âinterestâ and â12%â appears in the rows below.  However, the last column is âinterest payableâ and â0âappears in the rows below.  I also note that the last 11 rows of the last column of âinterest payableâ state the amount rangesfrom $24,000 to $456,000 that apparently showing interest payment owed to some other shareholders.  But in so far as the interestpayable to Silver Gem, it is stated to be â0â.  I do not see how the Plaintiff could rely on this document to support its claimwhen it is also clear that the interest payable is â0â in relation to NPGL Loans, bearing in mind that interest payable to somecreditors ranges from $24,000 to $456,000.  None of the party called the person who prepared the time loan record.   On plain readingof the document, unless I ignore the last column, that I should not, I am of the view that there is insufficient evidence to showthat the NPGL Loans were subject to a rate of 12% per annum and therefore interest is payable on the basis on 12%.  In so far asthe Plaintiffâs reliance on some receipts showing 10% interest rate was chargeable on the NPGL Loans, it is unknown who preparedthe receipts dated between March and December 1995.  They also conflict with the Plaintiffâs pleaded version of 12%.  I do notattach weight to those receipts. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Further, the Audited accounts of NPGL for the years ended 31<sup>st</sup> March 1999, 31<sup>st</sup> March 2000 and 31<sup>st</sup> March 2001 do not show that NPGL owed Silver Gem any interest.  Sin accepted this during cross-examination.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Moreover, Sin gave a statement to the police on 10<sup>th</sup> January 2006 where he acknowledged that NPGL no longer owed Silver Gem any money.  While Sin tried to explain during re-examinationthat by âmoneyâ, he meant the principal debt and not the interest, I am of the view that as a matter of logic and common sense,when a debtor still owes him interest payment, he should not have said: âthe debtor does not owe me any moneyâ, bearing in mindthat he was an experienced businessman.  I do not accept his explanation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Against the weight of the objective documentary evidence, there is only Sinâs evidence that the interest is outstanding and payableby NPGL to Silver Gem.  In the circumstances, the only reasonable conclusion is that NPGL does not owe any interest to Silver Gemeither as alleged or at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In respect of the credibility and reliability of the Partiesâ witnesses, by reason of the above analysis, I do not accept Sinâsevidence and I accept the evidence of the Defendantâs witness unless there is no conflict between the parties.  Sinâs evidencewas unreliable.  He relied so much on the documentary evidence that he did not know who prepared them.  Nor those documentary evidenceadvanced his case. </p>    <p class="heading">E.
