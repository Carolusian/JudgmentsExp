Originally, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party made 48 requests of SC and 15 requests of the Reply.  The Defendant voluntarily filed its answers on 6 March 2007 and on 10April 2007 respectively.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party found some of the answers not satisfactory and it pursued 24 of the answers to the requests in respect of SC and 14 of thosein respect of the Reply further.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> The answers which the Defendant has given and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party considers them to be unsatisfactory, can be broadly summarised into the following types:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(A) The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party is seeking for evidence;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(B) The Defendantâs pleadings have sufficiently and clearly set out in the SC;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(C) The requests are misconceived and premature: the parties have not yet proceeded to discovery, interrogatories or the exchangeof witness statements;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(D) The 3<sup>rd</sup> Partyâs requests relate to matters of law and evidence and the Defendant is not, therefore, obliged to answer.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> I must say Mr. Sheppardâs view on the general concept is correct: the necessity of the requests is much reduced by the practiceof exchanging witness statements.  The cases of the parties are clearly set out therein.  I always approach the requests for furtherand better particulars with some suspicion.  It can easily develop into lengthy unnecessary satellite litigation that the court doesnot encourage.  I will only order delivery of further and better particulars where such order is necessary for disposing the matterfairly or for saving costs.  With this in mind, I proceed to consider each request made and the answer given.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Statement of Claim filed by the Defendant</u></p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 3(1)</u></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> In paragraph 8 of the SC, the Defendant alleged that âthe 3<sup>rd</sup> Party engaged the Defendant to promote and market its investment products â¦â¦â.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party expressly sets out in what way the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party was involved in paragraphs 5 to 10 and also in paragraph 14 of the Defence.  It also denies paragraph 8 of SC.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party requests for particulars as to how the Defendant was engaged, whether it was oral or in writing and the circumstances underwhich its engagement was made.  The Defendantâs reply is that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Partyâs request is not appropriate as it is asking for evidence and the matter is sufficiently pleaded in paragraph 8 of the SC.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> I have considered Paragraph 8 carefully I can hardly decide whether the engagement was oral or in writing and the circumstances theDefendant was engaged.  It is a legitimate request.  I do not consider it to be a search for evidence.  I allow Request 3(1).</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 4</u></p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> I accept the Defendantâs argument that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Partyâs request is in effect an interrogatory application.  The Defendant has answered that âenhanced broker commissions/rebatesâis a non-exhaustive illustration.  This leads me to think what are the others.  And can the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party prepare its case without knowing the others?</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Once the answer given is that there are others, the answer forms part of the pleading.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party should be informed of other encouragement to prepare its case.  I consider the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party is entitled to a satisfactory answer to Request 4.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 10</u></p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> In paragraph 12 of the SC the Defendant alleged it entered into agreement with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party pursuant to the âTerms of Businessâ.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party asked whether the agreement was oral or in writing.  The Defendant said that the request is a request for evidence and thatthe 3<sup>rd</sup> Party itself has clearly pleaded to it in paragraph 14 of the Defence.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> I have considered paragraph 12.  For the same reason as set out in paragraph 6 above I allow the Request 10.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Requests 12, 14(2) and 17</u></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> In paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 of SC the Defendant pleaded that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party should act in good faith and with reasonable care and skill in the marketing, promotion, administration and management of theinvestments.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party asks for particulars of the circumstances and legal basis on which it is contended that such a term is so implied.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The answers to these requests are of the standard type given by the Defendant that they are sufficiently set out in the differentparagraphs.  I have considered the different paragraphs and agree with Mr. Beresford that the different paragraphs are âbald allegationsâ. I do not know how and in what way such duties arose, I can only guess as set out paragraph 12 that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party owes such duties as introducer and broker.  The Third Party can hardly prepare its case to meet the allegations without a clearanswer.  I allow the Requests 12, 14(2) and 17.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 13</u></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> In paragraph 13(b) the Defendant claims that the fund should be administered and managed in such a manner not to unduly prejudicethe investors over and above that contemplated, highlighted, stated or otherwise cautioned in its marketing and other promotionalmaterial.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party asks the Defendant to identify the matters to which the allegation relates.  The Defendant seems to say that the issue canbe addressed after discovery.  I wonder how the discovery will help.  I am of the view that the request for particulars is an appropriateway.  I allow Request 13.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 15</u></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> In paragraph 15 of the SC it is stated that there was an agreement between the Third Party and the Plaintiffs with respect to theadministration and management of the fund etc.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party requests the Defendant to identify the agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> The Defendantâs reply is that the particulars are sufficiently pleaded in paragraph 15.  I do not think that the Defendant hasanswered the request.  I still do not know whether the agreement is oral or in writing and how the agreement was created.  I allowrequest 15.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 18</u></p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> In Paragraph 16 of the SC, it is pleaded that the Third Party owed both the Defendant and the Plaintiffs a duty in tort to exercisedue diligence and with reasonable care and skill.  I am not sure how the non-contractual duties arose.  Was it because the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party was the alleged introducer and broker?  It is difficult for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party to prepare its case without knowing the basis.  I allow Request 18.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Requests 21, 24 and 25</u></p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> I agree with Mr. Beresfordâs view that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party is entitled to know which were marketing and promotional materials, information, statements and representations provided andrelied upon by the Defendant.  Without the identification of the facts, statistics, statements and representation that had been reliedon by the Defendant and/or might have been relied on by the Plaintiff, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party hardly knows what wrong was committed.  I accept that the Plaintiffs seem to have suffered loss.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party is only liable if it can be demonstrated that some wrong was committed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> The Defendantâs general answer is that upon complete discovery the Defendant shall provide further particulars.  I do not knowhow the discovery will assist.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> In respect to Request 25, the Defendant gave a positive averment in its answer that the Plaintiffs relied upon all the Third Partyâspositive assertions and illustrations contained in the documents.  I still find it too vague to serve the purpose of setting outthe Defendantâs case.  I allow Requests 21, 24 and 25.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Requests 26, 27, 28 and 32</u></p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> I accept Mr. Beresfordâs submission that the allegations of negligence have been rolled up in paragraph 27.  However, I think thatthe allegations are not beyond comprehension and one knows what the Defendantâs case is.  I refuse Requests 26, 27, 28 and 32.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 29</u></p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> I do not think the Defendantâs answer is evasive and that is what the Defendant knows about the matter.  Is it contradictory? It is not something I will comment on at this stage.  I refuse Request 29.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 35</u></p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> In paragraph 28 of the SC, the Defendant alleged negligent representation by the Third Party that the CMI Geared with Profits Fundwas guaranteed.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party asks what was the negligent representation.  The Defendant answered that the particulars are sufficiently set out and particularizedin paragraph 27.  I have read paragraph 27 several times but I cannot find anything related to the negligent representation.  I allowRequest 35.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 36</u></p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It consists of 2 requests: (a) to identify to which pleaded cause of action the avertment of knowledge is relevant, and explain itsrelevance and (b) the facts, documents or overt acts on which the Defendant intends to rely in support of the allegation that theThird Party had the knowledge.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> I find that the averment is relevant to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Partyâs alleged breach of contract and tortuous duties, if any.  I find that request 36(a) is satisfactorily answered.  I do notallow Request 36(a).</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> I do not think the Defendant has adequately answered Request 36(b): I do not know what facts, documents or overt acts the Defendantrelies on to make the Defendant think the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party had knowledge or ought to have knowledge.  I allow Request 36(b).</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 38</u></p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> This request is linked with requests 15, 17 and 18.  If they are satisfactorily answered, this request is not necessary.  I do notgo further into it.  As I have allowed 15, 17 and 18, I also allow Request 38.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 39</u></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> I note the 3<sup>rd</sup> Partyâs point in the request that if it was a deliberate and intentional act of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party to harm the interests of the Plaintiff and others, it could not be negligent.  But, I think it could also be lack of good faithor without reasonable care for the interest for the Plaintiff or others.  I agree that the request is misconceived.  I do not allow39.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Requests 42 and 43</u></p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> These requests are the same as request 39.  Similarly, I do not allow 42 and 43.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 48</u></p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> I agree that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party is entitled to know the basis of the plea of indemnity.  If it is a contractual indemnity, which clause does the Defendantrely on?  If it is a statutory one how is it invoked?  I allow Request 48.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><u>Reply filed by the Defendant</u></p>    <p class="heading"><u>Requests 2 and 3</u></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> In paragraph 6(a) and (b) of its reply, the Defendant states that it is unable to plead to paragraph 8(3), (4) and (5) of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Defence.  The reasons of its inability to plead or to âadmit, not admit or deny any of the matters set out in the Fund Guidepleaded in paragraph 5 (or 8) of the Third Party Defenceâ are that âparagraph 5 (or 8) neither pleads nor refers to any suchFund Guideâ and that âsuch facts are beyond its sphere of knowledgeâ.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> All the brackets in the above quotations are my insertions to make them more intelligible.  Both paragraphs 5 and 8 refer to theFund Guide with particulars and it is not right that the Defendant cannot plead to it.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Mr. Sheppard in his written submission concedes that âthis is an issue that can be clarified, in due course, when the pleadingsare amended, as will be the case after discovery and/or interrogatoriesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> As the Defendant has conceded that it can plead and the pleading requires amendment I do not think it is necessary to pursue therequest further.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Request 4</u></p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The request is made in respect of paragraph 7 of the Reply.  That paragraph 7 is a reply to paragraph 12 of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Defence.  In turn, that paragraph 12 can be regarded as a defence to paragraph 6 as well as indirectly to paragraph 12 of theDefendant Statement of Claim.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party has made Requests 1 and 22 on the two paragraphs of the Statement of Claim.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Party does not follow up those two requests after answers given.  I am sure that the discovery by exchange of lists of documentsand exchange of witness statements will help to define the Defendantâs case in that respect.  I do not allow the request.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Requests 5 and 6</u></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> For request 5, for the same reason as paragraph 35 above, I do not allow the request.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> I allow Request 6 as the particulars are something which the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party must know before it can prepare its case.  I allow Request 6.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Requests 7 and 8</u></p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> I do not allow Request 7 as the discovery by exchange of documents and witness statements will define the Defendantâs case.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> I allow Request 8 as the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party wants to know clearly what is the express term or how it is implied.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Requests 9 and 10</u></p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> In paragraph 11 of the Reply, the Defendant pleads that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party owed the tortuous duties to individual investors as particularized therein.
