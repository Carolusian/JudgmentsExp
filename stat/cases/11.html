(âEsquireâ) of its crown jewel of a building in May 1987 at the insistence of the Defendant, its banker, The Hong Kong AndShanghai Banking Corporation Limited (âthe Bankâ) to a close associate of the Bank, was such as amount to sufficient impropercrossing of line in the behaviour of a bank so as to impose a liability on the bank to its former customer, Esquire.  The compliantof Esquire consists of the behaviour of the Bank amounting to:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Economic Duress</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) Undue Influence</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) Intimidation and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The complaint is met by Defences of:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(A) No breach</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(B) Release of liability by contractual agreement</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(C) Defence of time bar under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> in respect of some of the complaints.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">MATERIAL FACTS </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> This is a case where a proper and correct understanding of the material facts is essential to the analysis of the legal consequencesof the actions of the parties. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> The main company of the Esquire Group, Esquire was first founded by Sabahagchand Choithramanni Gurdas (âGurdasâ) in 1965. Gurdaswas the 50% shareholder of Esquire and the other 50% of Esquire was held by his brother Sabahagchand Choithramani Arajan (âArjanâ).The business of Esquire was in consumer electronics products.  From 1970 onwards, the business grew quickly so that by the earlymid ninety-eighties the Esquire Group with Esquire as its head enjoyed an annual turnover in excess of HK$500 million and was well-knownin Asia and Middle East as one of the largest traders of electronics products.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> The banking relationship between the Esquire Group and the Bank went back to the seventies. By the late seventies, the Bank was themain banker of the Esquire Group, although by the time the Esquire got into difficulties, the Esquire Group was also maintainingbanking relationship, but on a much smaller scale, with other banks.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> In the late seventies the Esquire Group with the encouragement and support of the Bank expanded rapidly, but not only in its corebusiness of electronics products.  It expanded also into properties. In October 1981, the Bank financed 100%, (with one third ofthe financing on a 2 year short-term basis) Esquireâs purchase of the property Li Fung House (âthe Propertyâ) at the priceof $180 Million. The Property was mortgaged to the Bank and charged with $300 Million, the banking facility granted. The Bank ofcourse enjoyed the usual rights of a mortgagee and the material Charge and Mortgage and the material Debenture and Mortgage containedamongst others, the usual right to require payment from Esquire of all sums outstanding upon demand in writing, the right and powerof sale, the right and power to appoint receiver.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> This purchase at the top of the market and at the very very high price of $180 Million, when Esquire Group was only able to use itself4 of the 16 floors of the Property, turned out to be what eventually sank the Esquire Group. This unwise financing of the purchaseof the Property by the Bank (when prime was 20% and Bankâs loan was at 2.25% above prime [1/47]), was what led to the Restructuringby all the bank creditors of the Esquire Group, less than 2 years after the purchase. The fact that this purchase was made at thevery top of the market could be seen from Exhibit P2, which shows the valuation of the Property moving from $170 Million in October1981, then down in February 1983 to $105 Million, then further down to $80 Million in January 1985, before it started moving up inJuly 1985 to $115 Million, in June 1986 to $130 Million, in December 1986 to $135 Million, and then rapidly up to $157 Million on6<sup>th</sup> March 1987 and to $161 Million on 25<sup>th</sup> March 1987.  The approval of the financing of the purchase was made by officers at the top of the Bank. The subsequent actions bythe Bank to cause the sale of the Property (complained by Esquire) might suggest that the senior management of the Bank wished tosee that this mistake of Bankâs finance and exposure be corrected. Whether this was done improperly by the Bank is the crucialquestion in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The loan taken out by Esquire for the purchase of the Property required a heavy debt servicing of $31 million per year which theEsquire Group could not meet from its trading activities. By mid 1983, the Esquire Group found that it was necessary to seek restructuringof its loans from its bankers. A restructuring agreement was therefore entered into between the Esquire Group (including Gurdas andArjan as Guarantors) and some five creditor banks. This restructuring agreement dated 22<sup>nd</sup> February 1984 [1/93-133] (â1984 Restructuring Agreementâ) was to be effective from 13<sup>th</sup> September 1983 and was to expire on 31<sup>st</sup> December 1984.  Five Banks were parties to this 1984 Restructuring Agreement, namely the Bank, Bank of America (âBAâ), BanqueNationale de Paris (âBNPâ), BCCI Finance International Ltd. (âBCCIâ) and Indian Overseas Bank. The Lead Bank in this Restructuringwas naturally the Bank, as the largest amount owing by the Esquire Group was to the Bank, to which was mortgaged the most valuableasset of Esquire namely the Property. The loans outstanding to the Bank by the Esquire Group as stated in the 1984 RestructuringAgreement totaled some $309 Million, whereas the loans outstanding to the other banks were $24 Million (BA), $23 Million (BCCI),$14 Million (BNP) and $15 Million (Indian Overseas Bank), a total of only $76 Million.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Contemporaneous with the 1984 Restructuring Agreement, as amongst the five banks, they signed an Inter-Bank Agreement [2/79-92] dated22<sup>nd</sup> February 1984 (â1984 Inter-Bank Agreementâ) which provided the rights and limitations of the five banks, as to who and what couldbe done or not done vis-Ã -vis:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>each other;</p>        <p>the Esquire Group and;</p>        <p>the assets of the Esquire Group

Inter-Bank Agreement, the three Accounts specifically provided for in the1984 Restructuring Agreement (the Working, Property and Escrow Account) became the vital means of Esquireâs operation, businessand survival. And in terms of the Indebtedness of Esquire to the Bank which becomes the vital focusing point in this Action, theNon-Property Portion came to be known as the Hardcore Frozen Debt.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The 1984 Restructuring Agreement was extended (except for BA) for 7 months from January 1985 to end of July 1985 as evidenced byletters from other banks to the Bank [4/1083, 1086, 1088] and the Minutes of the Meeting on 29/3/85 [2/173].   The reason for thedelay in extending the 1984 Restructuring Agreement was because of the difficulties encountered towards the end of 1984.  BA didnot have confidence in continuing with the Restructuring and wanted out, or in other words BA wanted to be bought out.  This eventuallydid happen, with BA being bought out by the Bank in April 1985 [2/189].  With BA debt bought out by the Bank, the Bank imposed evengreater control on the Restructuring and over the affairs of the Esquire Group.  A system of tight financial control by Peats (actingas the accounting watch-dog of the Bank) was in place and improved and Esquire was required in late 1984 to take on Mr. Ratnam asthe new Group General Manager, so as to better administer its business.  The reason why there was no formal 1985 restructuring agreementwas because it took time for the Bank to negotiate with BA to buy out BA but at the time of the buy out, the Bank did not tell theother banks of the terms of buy out. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> Earlier in September 1983, the supervision of the Esquire Group accounts was given to the Bankâs centre under the department ofCredit Control Division (âCCDâ).  The customer Esquire was however in Mongkok and the relationship was with Mongkok Branch. Theaccounts of Esquire were therefore still being kept and managed at the Mongkok Branch.  So although CCD had taken up the supervisingcontrol at the cetnre, because Esquire was still actively trading from Mongkok and the Mongkok Branch was very much involved in theactivities of Esquire, there was to a certain extent, a large amount of overlap between the Mongkok Branch and CCD.  This managementoverlap explained the considerable conflicts between CCD and Mongkok Branch as could be seen from the sizable documentation createdinternally. The Memo of Selway-Swift to Bamford of Mongkok dated 23<sup>rd</sup> September 1985 [288-9] suggesting that the one central point of control and discussion should rest with CCD and not with Mongkok,was a prime example of this turf tussle.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The personnel of CCD involved with Esquire were as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top">(1)</td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top">Account Manager CCD were respectively Wallis, then Sommerfield, then Carruthers and;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top">(2)</td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top">supervising them as Assistant Managers CCD were respectively Robertson and then Budd and;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top">(3)</td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top">above them in turn as Manager CCD were respectively Pullen and Penketh, with Pullen being the key player in the whole saga and mostof the time playing behind the scene (including in this Trial where he did not give evidence and to put up the senior face of theBank) was;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top">(4)</td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top">Selway-Swift, Assistant Manager Corporate Banking.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="100%" align="left" valign="top" colspan="2">At the Mongkok Branch, the personnel involved were:-</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top">(A)</td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top">Gregoire followed by his successor Wheeler as Deputy Manager, Mongkok and;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" align="left" valign="top">(B)</td>                <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top">above them was Bamford as District Manger, Mongkok.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> The 1985 Restructuring Agreement was further extended from August 1985 to end of 1985 by subsequent meeting minutes and letters.These were followed by the Heads of Agreement [4/1221(1)-(2) &amp;1223-5] which was effective from December 1985 to 29<sup>th</sup> September 1986. Clause 4 of Heads of Agreement is material as it provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe existing property debt continues to be segregated, negotiated separately and kept apart from the restructuring of the tradingcompanies except in the event of full repayment of the property debt in which case the property may be applied against the frozentrading debt.

He proposed that the Esquire not be liquidated (with realization of security) and that Esquire be allowed to continue to trade.He also referred to the Bank in respect of the Hardcore Frozen Debt, making provision for an additional $50 Million during the firsthalf of 1986 ($40 Million having being provided by the Bank at end of 1985) and thereby leaving after the second provision only $60Million of the Hardcore Frozen Debt not provided [357].</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The above strategy was followed up by Pullen with his Memo dated 28<sup>th</sup> May 1986 [367-8] where he asked for senior managementâs decision as to whether (1) to allow Esquire to trade and in the meantimecontinue with the policy of making further provisions for the Hardcore Frozen Debt ($40 Million provided end December 1985 and $50Million to be provided June 1986) and (2) to transfer the whole Esquire Accounts from Mongkok to the Head Office at CCD.  The topmanagement of the Bank apparently accepted the recommendation of Selway-Swift and Pullen and the Esquire Accounts were moved fromMongkok to CCD and thereby giving the total freedom to CCD to effect the momentous actions which gave rise to this Action.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> On 30<sup>th</sup> October 1986, Esquire and the Bank entered into a Restructuring Agreement (â1986 Restructuring Agreementâ) dated 30<sup>th</sup> October 1986 [2/442] covering the period from 30<sup>th</sup> September 1986 to 30<sup>th</sup> September 1987.

It was a central feature of the Restructuring Agreements thatnet profits in the Working Account earned by Esquire from its frantic trading was to be paid out of the Working Account every monthto the Escrow Account, from which distribution would be made to each of the Lender Banks in reduction of their debts under the LenderâsPortion (the Hardcore Frozen Debt in the case of the Bank). The new facility granted by the Bank was to enable Esquire to trade butthe price was that Esquire had to pay for such facility at the current commerical rate. The problem encountered was that the (Non-Property)Hardcore Frozen Debt was not being seriously reduced as that debt was âthe result of serving those loans from trading linesâ[232].  That is why if one compares the (Non-Property) Hardcore Frozen Debt stated in the 1984 Restructuring Agreement at $127 Millionand the figure of $190 Million for the same (Non-Property) Hardcore Frozen Debt stated in the Memo dated 15<sup>th</sup> July 1985 [232], a little more than one year later, that Hardcore Frozen Debt had gone up.  Esquire contends that this figure wasswelled because of wrongful charging of interest and wrongful non-crediting the Hardcore Frozen Account for amounts received by theBank from the Escrow Account as will be seen later.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Much of the time in 1985 to 1986 was taken up with three questions, the first being whether to sell or not to sell the Property andat what price; the second being the state of the accounts and their management and their accuracy; and third being the poor stateof the trading activities resulting in âblockedâ lines under the trading facilities so that Esquire could not trade.  So faras sale of Property was concerned, the problem was that the market was still low in 1985 to mid 1986 and a sale of the Property wouldnot even cover the Property Loan, let alone the (Non-Property) Hardcore Frozen Debt.  So far as the state of the accounts was concerned,there were a great deal of disagreement between CCD and Mongkok in particular as to the way Mongkok had debited the (Non-Property)Hardcore Frozen Account.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> From as early as 1985, internally in the Bank between CCD and Mongkok they were discussing the correctness of charging interest onthe (Non-Property) Hardcore Frozen Account.  Esquire also from 1985 to early 1986 was quietly investigating the correctness of the(Non-Property) Hardcore Frozen Debt.  In October 1986 Esquire first queried about the correctness of the Hardcore Frozen Debt figureof the Bank and suggested that Esquire was overcharged by some $30 Million and this is what came to be known as the $30 Million Overcharge. The Bankâs Internal Memo of October acknowledged there was overcharge [430].</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The series of discussions in respect of the $30 Million Overcharge eventually resulted in two meetings on 12<sup>th</sup> March 1987 when Sommerfield stated that the Hardcore Frozen Debt was $201 Million being $189 Million Hardcover Frozen Debt plus another$12 Million being the Bank of America Buyout benefit of the Bank.  Sommerfield demanded the sale of the Property and it is allegedby Esquire that Sommerfield threatened that unless Esquire agreed to the sale, the Bank would make the demand on Esquire and wouldsell the Property and finish off and liquidate the Esquire Group.  That same night of the 12<sup>th</sup> March, Gurdas of Esquire surrendered to the Bank and agreed to the sale of the Property. Thereafter the Bank required Esquire tosign the Power of Attorney giving the Bank and its subsidiary, Management, the total power to sell the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> The Property was sold to Bethlehem Management Ltd. (âBethlehemâ) at $180 Million.  It was not known to Esquire at the time thatthe Property was sold to a close associate of the Bank nor that it was sold, what it subsequently found out to be, in alleged unduehaste. As a reward for Esquireâs agreement to the sale of the Property, the Bank âforgaveâ the $30 Million Overcharge fromthe Hardcore Frozen Debt and also did not insist on the $12 Million BA Buyout benefit.  A number of further restructuring agreementsalso followed Esquireâs agreement to sell.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> By accident, Esquire found out in June 1994 the close relationship between the Bank and Bethlehem, the buyer and Esquire complainedabout the sale to amongst others, Miss Emily Lau the Legislator who took the matter up with the Chairman of the Bank and also withsenior Government officials. The Bank reacted very quickly and negatively to such complaint. Demand for immediate repayment of allloans and facilities was made by the Bank and shortly thereafter Esquire was put into liquidation.  This Action was brought by Esquireand continued (in liquidation) with the approval of the Company Court against the Bank in respect of the sale of the Property. Thecomplaint made in this Action is that the Sale was as result of, firstly the breach of fiduciary duty, secondly of economic duress,thirdly undue influence and fourthly intimidation.</p>    <p class="heading">ISSUES ON TRIAL OF LIABILITY</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The Trial took up some 24 days and was limited to Trial on Liability.

Breach of fiduciary duty is considered in equity a form ofequitable fraud.

A fiduciary must act in goodfaith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict;he may not act for his own benefit or for the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal.

What is equally important is the factualcircumstances bearing on the alleged breach of such fiduciary duty. While circumstances can often easily identify a breach of theNot to Profit Duty, in respect of alleged breach of the Non-Conflict Duty (using that expression of Ma J. in the <i>Kao Lee</i> case), it is often controversial.  It is therefore necessary first to examine what is the basis of the Non-Conflict Duty.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Lord Upjohn in <i>Phipps v Boardman</i> at page 123 referred to the wider rule, said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ that a person in a fiduciary capacity must not make a profit out of his trust which is part of the wider rule that a trusteemust not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then Lord Upjohn quoted the celebrated passage of Lord Cransworth in <i>Aberdeen Railways v Blaikie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Macq%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Macq. 461</a>, 471:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ to enter into engagements in which he has, or can have, a personal interest, conflicting or which possibly may conflict, withthe interests of those whom he is bound to protect.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and said at page 124:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe phrase âpossibly may conflictâ requires consideration.

What equity is seeking to prevent is the dilution of the loyaltyobligation and the purpose of the prohibition against conflict is, like all equity rules against equitable fraud, to prevent possibleabuse.  The two key concerns of equity are prevention of abuse and appropriate remedy to deal with abuse having taken place.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The test therefore of a breach of a fiduciary duty is really two fold, firstly is there an interest either of the person in the fiduciaryposition or of another person connected with that person in fiduciary position which will conflict with the duty and secondly willa reasonable person regard there is a real sensible possibility of conflict between such interest and the duty or in the words ofDeane J. in <i>Chan v Zacharia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR 178</a>  âsignificant possibility of conflictâ (page 198-9).</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> In  <i>Newgate Stud Co. v Penfold</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/$(division)/$(year)/$(decno).html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] EWHC 2993</a> this was said about fair dealing at paragraph 242:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn my view, the resolution of this issue lies in the fiduciary the burden of showing, in a case where the fiduciary does not havea personal interest in the transaction but where on the facts there exists a real risk of conflict between duty and personal loyalties,that the transaction was demonstrably in the best interests of the company or others to whom he owes the duties.  This assumes thatthe beneficiaries have not given their informed consent.  It is an application of the fair dealing rule, rather than the self-dealingrule. In ex parte Forder (1881) 25 Sol. Journ. 720, a question arose as to the validity of a sale which had been made by a trusteein bankruptcy of part of the property of the bankrupt.  The sale was made to buyers, one of whom was the trusteeeâs under-age son. The contract was not binding on the son by reason of his minority, and the sale was also at an undervalue. While deciding the caselargely on those grounds, the Court of Appeal took a broader view.  Lord Selbourne LC said:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMany authorities had laid down emphatically, not only with regard to trustees generally, but with regard to assignees in bankruptcyin particular, that they could not exercise the power of sale given to them for the benefit of creditors directly or indirectly forthe benefit of themselves or for anyone so connected with them as to stand in a position more advantageous than an ordinary purchaser.ââ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The long history of equityâs protection of the interest of the principal/beneficiary by the rule of fiduciary duty is no more thanto ensure that the loyalty owed to the principal/beneficiary by the fiduciary is in no way diminished. The insistence of the ruleon non-conflict is because human nature being what it is, the rule is necessary to prevent a man from being swayed by interest therebyovercoming or even diluting his duty of loyalty.      </p>    <p class="heading">Applying the Law on Fiduciary Duty</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> The contest at the trial between the parties on the Issue of Fiduciary Duty is whether firstly there was the existence of the fiduciaryduty alleged by the plaintiff and secondly whether there was a breach of such a fiduciary duty.  In respect of the alleged breachof the fiduciary duty, there was a further dispute as to whether the breach was a breach of the self-dealing rule or whether it wasa breach of the fair-dealing rule.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> It is in the context of the aforesaid disputes on fiduciary duty that consideration of facts is essential and in particular, thecontractual relationship of the parties in so far as such contractual relationship might have an impact on the existence and scopeof the alleged fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> The first relevant contractual relationship between the parties is that of mortgagor and mortgagee. The Property was mortgaged tothe Bank and under the Mortgage there is clearly the contractual power of the Bank to sell the Property itself but such sale wouldbe by the Bank in its capacity as mortgagee and for the mortgageeâs own interest with its attendant right and liability as mortgageeselling a property.  Such sale by the Bank would not be in a representative capacity. There is nothing in the Mortgage contract whichprecludes the Plaintiff owner from selling the Property or engaging an agent (including the Bank) to sell the Property, always ofcourse subject to the consent of the Bank mortgagee. The subsequent de-facto arrangement (after the March 1987 meetings) wherebythe Property was sold by the Bank acting as agent of the Plaintiff sat comfortably with the Mortgage.  The alleged fiduciary dutyof the Bank was therefore in no way inconsistent with the Mortgage contract.   </p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The second relevant contractual relationship between the parties is that under relevant Restructuring Agreement, various rights andrestrictions were imposed. At the hearing, neither the Bank nor Esquire pointed to any contractual provision in the RestructuringAgreements and in particular the 1986 Restructuring Agreement which is in conflict with the existence of the alleged fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> The third relevant contractual relationship between the parties is that under the Power of Attorney dated the 14<sup>th</sup> April 1987.  By that Power of Attorney the Plaintiff appointed the Bank and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Management, the wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, to be its Attorneys to do the following acts:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1. To sell (whether by private contract, auction or other method whatsoever) all that property brief particulars of which are setout in the Schedule hereto â¦. upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the attorneys or either of them shall think fitin their sole and absolute and unfettered discretion.â                            </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Although the power conferred on the Bank under the Power of Attorney was in very wide terms, this does not in any way detract fromthe alleged fiduciary duty arising from the confidential relationship âgiving âspecial opportunityâ, referred to by Mason,J. in the <i>Hospital</i> case.  Paragraph 1 of the Power of Attorney in fact suggests the existence of the fiduciary duty because of the following matters:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">[1]</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the proposed sale by the Bank was for and on behalf of the Plaintiff, in a representative capacity;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">[2]</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">there was trust and confidence by the Plaintiff in the Bank;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">[3]</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">complete power and discretion was conferred by the Plaintiff on the Bank for the proposed sale;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">[4]</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the exercise of that power/discretion so conferred would affect the interest of the Plaintiff in a legal and practical sense;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">[5]</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the exercise of that power and discretion by the Bank gave the Bank a special opportunity to exercise such power/discretion to thedetriment of the Plaintiff;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">[6]</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the Plaintiff was in such circumstances vulnerable to abuse by the Bank of its power/discretion of sale.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> It seems to me that the Power of Attorney confirms and is strong evidence of the existence of the fiduciary duty and not disaffirmativeof or inconsistent with the existence of the fiduciary duty.

In order to achieve the best possible price for the subject property, we recommend that the Property by given fullexposure in the market prior to disposal.â [541]</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It will be noted that the independent expertâs strong advice, that to achieve the best possible price, the Property be given fullexposure in the market prior to disposal, was not eventually followed by the Bank.   </p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> The advertisement for the sale of the Property appeared in the newspaper in the second week of April 1987, apparently pursuant toa revised first stage of press advertisement from 7<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup> April [564] and the Sales Brochures also started going out to selected potential buyers at around that time [636-691].  The revisedmarketing was to push the original marketing timetable forward by one week.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> At the time of such sales activity, the Bank also put down quickly and strictly an attempt by Plaintiff not to sign the requiredPower of Attorney [577].  By letter dated 14<sup>th</sup> April 1987 [605] the Plaintiff made one last attempt to qualify the required Power of Attorney but that failed immediately and miserably. With no card left to play, the Power of Attorney was signed by Esquire on the 14<sup>th</sup> April 1987 [608-611].</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> By letter dated 23<sup>rd</sup> April 1987 to the Bank [692-4], Management made its first report on the actions taken by Management on the proposed sale and theresponses received.  Two offers were received one at $130 Million and another at $158 Million and both were considered too low. It is to be noted that the mailing list [636-691] attached to the aforesaid report (â1<sup>st</sup> Reportâ) shows a total of 445 potential buyers to be sent the brochures and that up to 23<sup>rd</sup> April 1987, sales brochures went out up to No. 287 on that list.  In other words there were at least another 150 potential buyersyet to be sent the sale brochures.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> That 1<sup>st</sup> Report, under Action to be Taken, referred to an advertisement of half a page to be placed on the 1<sup>st</sup> of May so as to enhance exposure of the property.  It further referred to a second stage of the advertising campaign which wouldcommence on 23<sup>rd</sup> April.  This date of 23<sup>rd</sup> April is of course the planned start of the second stage of press advertisement (22<sup>nd</sup> April to 20<sup>th</sup> May) set out in the Marketing Proposal of Management.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> It would appear that as part of the second stage of press advertisement, instructions for 4 sets of advertisements in the Chineseand English papers were given by Management [724] and these were to appear on 23<sup>rd</sup> April, 27<sup>th</sup> April, 29<sup>th</sup> April, 30<sup>th</sup> April, 4<sup>th</sup> May and 5<sup>th</sup> May.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> The Ho Family of the Hang Seng Bank which became the Purchaser of the Property was already making tentative offer for the Propertyas least as early as 28<sup>th</sup> April 1987, because by letter dated 29<sup>th</sup> April 1987 [723] from Management to Mr. Leung of Hang Mow Investment Co. Ltd. (Hang Mow being a property company of the Ho Family)there was reference to the letter dated 28<sup>th</sup> April 1987 (copy of which is not before the Court).  In Managementâs letter dated 29<sup>th</sup> April 1987 [723] to the Ho Family, Management informed the Ho Family that  offer in the region of $175-180 would be seriously consideredby the vendor, which in this context meant Esquire, the owner of the Property, on whose behalf both Management and the Bank werecarrying the sale. </p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> By letter dated 30<sup>th</sup> April 1987 to the Bank [726] Management made its second report to the Bank (â2<sup>nd</sup> Reportâ) on the marketing progress of the Property.  First it reported that the marketing campaign was continuing and the pressadvertising would end on the 5<sup>th</sup> May. Secondly it reported the marketing received good response from a large number of companies. Thirdly it referred in particularto three parties out of the large number, namely the Canadian interest, Koon Wah Mirror Co. and Hang Mow Development Co. Ltd.  Fourthly,it referred to a written reply by Management to the interest of Hang Mow and enclosed a copy of that written reply which was theletter dated 29<sup>th</sup> April [723].  Fifthly it referred to the further actions still to be taken by Management.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> 30<sup>th</sup> April (the date of that letter at 726) was a Thursday.  There was no written reply by the Ho Family to that 29<sup>th</sup> April 1987 [723] letter of Management, according to the documents placed before the Court.  Remarkably for a deal of this size andimportance, there was according to the documents placed before the Court, no written offer to buy the Property by Hang Mow or bythe Ho family or any company purporting to represent the Ho Family.  No document of a written offer to Management of 29<sup>th</sup> or 30<sup>th</sup> April or 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> May was shown to the Court.  There was also no explanation offered to the Court as to whether such document did exist but was nolonger in the possession of the Bank, Management or the Ho Family. </p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> The press advertisement according to the advertising plan of Management was to appear on the 30<sup>th</sup> April, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> May.  There is no evidence placed before the Court as to whether these advertisements in fact appeared or some of them were cancelledas result of the Bank deciding to sell to the Ho Family and if so when they were cancelled.  It is however clear that the sale tothe Ho Family was decided upon before the planned sales campaign had run its full course.  With the last press advertising to appearon 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> May, one would normally expect that at least a week to two weeks should be given for the appropriate responses to come in, followedby discussions with the interested buyers. </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> That the Bank and the Ho Family were anxious to quickly formalize the agreed sale and not wait for the marketing sale to run itsfull course, was clear.  By letter dated 5<sup>th</sup> of May 1987 [729-731], Messrs C. Y. Kwan for the Ho Family was writing to solicitors for the Bank, Messrs Johnson Stokes &amp; Mastersetting out all the terms agreed and enclosing a cheque of $1 million and asking for the conveyancing documents and the draft Saleand Purchase Agreement.

Kwan is important as it shows not only that the Ho Family for the Buyer wanted to close the deal very fast but thatthe two persons at the very high level of Hong Kong Bank and Hang Seng Bank were so intimately involved with this special fast sale(Wrangham for the seller and Lee for the buyer) that they were specially copied in on this important letter.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> Following upon this letter of 8<sup>th</sup> May, the sale took place in less than the 14 days proposed in the 8<sup>th</sup> May letter.  Completion took place on 21<sup>st</sup> May with the formal Sales and Purchase Agreement signed on 16<sup>th</sup> May 1987. The parties signing the Agreement was Bethlehem Management Ltd. of the Purchaser and Esquire (Electronics) Ltd. as theVendor.  The almost lightning speed at which this sale of the Property (an investment property and not a unique house) by the Bank(on behalf of Esquire) to the Ho Family (Bethlehem Management Ltd. being a Ho Family company) took place was to say the least mostunusual. </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> At the Trial, it was agreed that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the Purchaser Bethlehem, was a Ho Family company;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the Ho Family was a substantial minority shareholder in Hang Seng Bank whereas the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank was the majorityshareholder in Hang Seng Bank;</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left"> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(3)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">the Plaintiff, Esquire did not know at the time of the Sale that the Bank on behalf of Esquire had sold the Property to the Ho Family.It was many years later by accident that Esquire found out that the Ho Family of Hang Seng Bank, a junior partner of the Bank, hadbought the Property.</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> The two questions which arose from the above factual account of the sale of the Property by the Bank on behalf of Esquire are, firstlywhat is the scope of the fiduciary duty and secondly what was the breach if any of the fiduciary duty.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> So far as the scope of Fiduciary Duty owing by the Bank to Esquire is concerned, there is nothing in the factual circumstances whichmight suggest that the extent of the Fiduciary Duty should be less than the full duty of loyalty and good faith normally owing byan agent to the principal.  The sale under the Power of Attorney was of course by the Bank not as mortgagee but in a representativecapacity as I have referred to earlier in my analysis by reference to the <i>Hospital</i> case.  I therefore do not see that the scope of fiduciary duty of loyalty and good faith owing by the Bank to Esquire is in any waydiluted or less complete than would be in any other caser of an owner asking an agent to sell his property and the fact that theBank was also the mortgagee did not in any way change or diminish the fiduciary duty.  An owner was entitled to expect the agentto do the best and sell the property at the best possible price realizable, having regard to the then market condition.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> The then market condition is most relevant in the consideration of the breach of fiduciary duty and in my view Esquire has rightlystressed the importance of the strong rising market. After the property market hit the bottom in early 1985, it started climbingat first steadily from mid 1985 to late 1986.  The market then started taking off in early 1987 so that by 14<sup>th</sup> April 1987 when the Power of Attorney was given to the Bank, it was a strong rising market and was just at the late beginning ofa long bull market which did not hit the peak until 1994. The expert called in for the valuation Knight Frank was of that opinion(âcurrent bullish market sentimentsâ [541]) and the BI Appraisals property graphs [1/350 &amp; 1/368 as revised] confirm thatit was a strong rising market in April and May 1987 (which did not hit the peak until 1994 rising from an index of 40 in 1987 toindex of 240 in 1994 for office and from 57 in 1987 to 382 in 1997 for retail premises) when the Bank made the decision abruptlyto sell at $180M to the Ho Family.  I accept of course the point made by Mr. Fok that one could not use hindsight and that the Bankdid not know that the market would continue to rise so strongly.  But on the other hand the Bank must also be under a fiduciary duty,doing the best for the principal owner of the Property not to be blind to the commercial reality which suggested that the marketwas very strong and gaining strength and that there was nothing to be lost by taking its full and proper time to realize the Property,specially when a buyer was practically offering to pay the asking price, a sign as I suggested to Mr. Fok in the final closing submissionhearing that the asking price was set too low.     </p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The relevant question on breach of fiduciary duty in this case is whether the manner, the person of the purchaser and its relationwith the Bank, and the price of the sale by the Bank amount to a breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty and good faith.  The conflictof interest and duty alleged by Esquire is of two categories, the Not to Profit Duty and Non-Conflict Duty.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> In a series of submissions by lawyers for Esquire (not noted for either their learning or good judgment or helpfulness to the Court)Esquireâs case on breach of fiduciary duty was cast unrealistically high. I will first dispose of some of the bad points beforeI proceed to consider what is really the heart of this part of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> The submission was repeatedly made that there should be no sale during that time in 1987 at all and that because of the rising markettherefore the Bank should refrain from selling or should delay the selling in a substantial way (by say at least a few months ifnot longer).  I of course accept that there was at that time from early 1987 a rising market which was called bullish. But once Esquireaccepted that there should be a sale (albeit under pressure and/or undue influence) and signed the Power of Attorney appointing theBank and Management to sell the Property then, the Bank could not be faulted for taking appropriate steps from April onwards to effectthe appropriate sale.  The real question for me is whether the Bank effected an inappropriate sale, namely with undue haste and toa close friend.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> On the other hand, I equally reject the suggestion that because the Bank was a mortgagee therefore the Bank was entitled to sellat any time of its choosing and in any manner of its choosing as mortgagee.  The fact is that the Bank did not sell as mortgageeand did not exercise its power as mortgagee to sell (which would involve having regard to the Restructuring Agreement and the Inter-BankAgreement, nice and probably some messy questions as to whether the Bank was entitled, without notice to the other banks and withoutthe formalities required under these Agreements, to unilaterally sell the Property at a time of its choosing and in a manner of itschoosing).  Not only did the Bank not wish to sell as mortgagee, but the Bank went to considerable trouble to disguise to the fellowbanks in the Restructuring, that it was Esquire which wished to sell the Property and that is why the Bank instructed Esquire inits letter dated 27<sup>th</sup> March [562] on what Esquire should say to the other banks on the sale of the Property and to make no mention of the negotiations(namely Esquireâs resistance to sale). The Bank chose not to sell as mortgagee but instead for its own good reason relied on thePower of Attorney (to ensure that it had total control and could dictate the sale absolutely) and that is why the Power of Attorneywas required from Esquire.  The sale therefore by the Bank was not pursuant to the mortgagee power but in its representative capacityas agent for Esquire, with its attendant fiduciary duty.        </p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> It was suggested by Counsel for Esquire that there was a breach of self-dealing rule in that under highly technical Listing Rules,the Ho Family company, Bethlehem Management Ltd. could be said to be either an associate party or a connected party of the Bank andtherefore the sale by the Bank was to a party connected with the Bank.  The self-dealing rule is to prohibit a person in a fiduciaryposition from himself dealing in the transaction and thereby gain an advantage.  The agent therefore cannot buy himself or througha company in which he was interested because he stands thereby to profit from it. There is no evidence that the Bank itself has anyinterest in Bethlehem Management Ltd.  This is simply the private company of the Ho Family, which was of course a junior partnerin the Hang Seng Bank with the Bank being the senior partner. Such partnership was of long history dating to the time when the HoFamily sold its controlling interest in Hang Seng Bank to the Bank.  The relationship between the Bank and the Ho Family was admittedto be very close.  Their partnership in the Hang Seng Bank and the fact that the Ho Family members as well as the senior managementof the Bank have been sitting on the Board of Hang Seng Bank was merely evidence of such close association. But in my view, thatdoes not mean there was a breach of the self-dealing rule as the Bank was not the buyer and could not in any shape or form be saidto have a personal financial interest in the buyer. I regret that the Plaintiff had made the elaborate but unnecessary argument setout in Chapter 15 of the Closing Submissions of the Plaintiffâs legal team relating to breach of self-dealing rule and in my viewthis submission was made based on a misplaced understanding of the true function of the self-dealing rule.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> The real complaint which can be made against the Bank is the breach of the fair-dealing rule or what I prefer to call the Breachof the Non-Conflict Duty. Mr. Fok seeks to dilute this Non-Conflict Duty by suggesting that it is necessary for the agent or trusteeto have some personal interest in the purchase itself and asked the question of what interest did the agent have in the transaction. But as I have attempted to show earlier, what is important is the non-dilution of the duty by the agent and a conflict with someother personâs interest will result in a dilution of the duty of loyalty and in that situation, there is a breach of the fiduciaryduty.  The use of the words âor anyone elseâs interestâ in the passage cited earlier in the <i>Kao Lee</i> case and âor for the benefit of a third personâ in the passage cited earlier in the <i>Mothew</i> case must not be overlooked. If Mr. Fok is correct in his submission, then it does not matter how much the loyalty duty is affectedor diluted, an agent can sell to his own sister or wife.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> The core complaint in this case can be summarized in my view by one short statement, namely a senior partner has no business sellinghis principalâs property to his junior partner in a private sale.  The partners can be partners in a law firm or a business ora bank such as the Hang Seng Bank.  Selling in a private sale to a junior partner by a senior partner who is selling as agent isno better than the agent selling his principalâs property to the agentâs family, whether wife, children or sister.  All suchsales give rise to a real sensible possibility of conflict between the interest of the agentâs partner or family and the duty ofthe agent to his principal.  Any objective third party will regard such sale as not appropriate. </p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> The unusualness or inappropriateness of the sale by the Bank to the Ho Family was in fact not unknown to the Bank. What is in myview extraordinary in this whole business of the Bank selling as agent, this very valuable asset (belonging to a principal) in arising market to a junior partner is the speed with which the parties wished to close the deal (obviously seen to a be a most beneficialdeal for the Ho Family) so that the Bank did not even bother to allow the market to absorb the second round of press advertisementsand Sales Brochures which Management in its letter dated 30<sup>th</sup> April said would be done.  There was no evidence placed before the Court whether this in fact took place, namely the sending of theSales Brochures to the 150 prospective buyers and the appearing of the press advertisement on the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> May. If they were cancelled, then even a worse inference must be drawn suggesting that no further marketing was to be done becausethe Bank did not wish any other prospective buyer to appear on the scene, for in such case, the Bank might be forced to sell to someoneelse at a higher price or the Ho Family would be forced to pay a higher price than $180 Million.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Mr. Fok would like me to read nothing sinister or unusual into the unseemly haste to close the purchase.  I regret I must retainmy good common sense and commercial sense.  The unseemly haste and the copying of the letter of 8<sup>th</sup> May by C.Y. Kwan to Mr. Wrangham and Mr. Q.W, Lee for me is the most powerful evidence that the two partners (as Sellerâs agentand Buyer) knew that this good deal for the Ho Family had to be closed quickly, at the expense of course of Esquire. The great riskof not closing the deal very quickly was obvious.  Not only would there be the strong possibility of potential buyers from the secondround of marketing making a higher bid but there was considerable risk that existing potential buyer or even new buyer (who got tohear about the Property) would come in to bid against the Ho Family and thereby either possibly depriving the Ho Family of buyingthis good Property or at least forcing the Ho Family into paying a much higher price for the Property.  A fast closing of the dealwill preclude in a bullish rising market, all possibility of a higher price being realized for the Property.  The conflict whichwas not only real but was acute was therefore resolved against the principal by the Bank and the fiduciary duty of the Bank of totalloyalty was regrettably sacrificed.  This for me is a most unhappy page in the history of the Bank.  I hold and I find that therewas a breach of the fiduciary duty by the Bank in that it sold the Property to the Ho Family in the way it did.  The unseemly hastewith which the Bank sold the Property to the Ho Family was merely an aspect of the inappropriate sale by the Bank to the Ho Family.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> Esquire was ignorant throughout of the breach of the fiduciary duty because the Bank which was under a duty to disclose to Esquirethat it was selling the Property to its junior partner (the buyer Bethlehem Mangement Ltd. being the family company of its juniorpartner, the Ho Family) and that the sale to the junior partner was done at undue haste.  Appropriate and full disclosure was necessaryso that Esquire might give its informed consent.  No such disclosure was made which thereby made the breach of fiduciary duty complete. In Finn on <i>Fiduciary Obligations</i> at page 242 this was said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA fiduciary can, of course, prevent an incipient conflict from arising by obtaining the consent of his beneficiary to his privatedealing after making a full disclosure.  The effect of such a consent is to displace the fiduciaryâs duty for the purposes of thatdealing.  The disclosure required is of all material facts and information which could affect the consent given by the beneficiary.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>As will be seen later this failure to make the material and full disclosure was a fact material to Esquireâs right of action whichwas concealed by the Bank from Esquire in circumstances where the Bank knew that the selling of the Property to Bethlehem was inappropriateand when the breach of fiduciary duty was such that it was unlikely to be discovered for some time (in the absence of material andfull disclosure by the Bank to Esquire).</p>    <p class="heading">Contractual Waiver or Release</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> The waiver and release term and condition in the Bankâs facility letters dated 25<sup>th</sup> September 1992 [849] and 31<sup>st</sup> January 1994 [854] provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn consideration of the above, each of the borrowers and guarantors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally ... waives and releases[HSBC] from all claims, if any, arising out of or in connection with credit facilities or other financial accommodation previouslymade available and any action taken or omitted to be taken by [HSBC] in relation thereto.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> The aforesaid Waiver Clause is a standard Hong Kong Bank waiver term and condition to be found in the Bankâs facility letters andis not specifically written for any misdeed by the Bank in respect of the sale of the Property. The narrow question in respect ofthe Waiver defence is whether the Waiver Clause is sufficiently wide as to cover the present complaint of breach of fiduciary duty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> It is firstly to be noticed that there was no reference in that Waiver Clause to either the Power of Attorney of 14<sup>th</sup> April 1987 or to the sale of the Property.  The subject matter of the Waiver Clause or purported release is credit facilities orfinancial accommodation.  The scope of the purported release is any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Bank in relation tothe subject matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The short answer to the Waiver Clause defence is that neither the subject matter nor the scope of the purported release is sufficientlywide or clear as to operate upon the present claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  The Waiver Clause being an exclusion clause mustbe construed strictly and I accept therefore the submission of Esquire that the Bank falls far short of satisfying this Court thatthe present claim for breach of fiduciary duty is barred by the Waiver Clause.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Putting the waiver defence in the form of waiver by election or estoppel by representation will not assist the Bank in this defence. There was, simply in my view, no clear representation or wavier that Esquire was giving up or would not be pursuing its claim forbreach of fiduciary duty arising out of the sale of the Property.</p>    <p class="heading">Limitation Defence</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> The breach of fiduciary duty took place in May 1987 and the Writ in this Action was issued on 3<sup>rd</sup> November 1994 and therefore more than 6 years after the alleged breach.  The Bank relies on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> as its limitation defence.  The Plaintiff disputes that the statutory limitation defence applies and contends further that it willbe unjust to apply it in the circumstances because Esquire throughout was under the thumb of the Bank which had concealed the breach. In addition to the above contentions, Esquire has a formidable reply to the limitation defence, namely that even if limitation canand should be applied by analogy, limitation time is extended because of concealment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> I will first consider the Plaintiffâs âknockoutâ reply to the limitation defence, namely that limitation time is postponedunder <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a> of the Ordinance because of concealment by the Bank.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26</a> reads as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â(1) Subject to subsection (4), where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Ordinance,either ---</p>        <blockquote>            <p>(a) the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(b) any fact relevant to the plaintiffâs right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant; or</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(c) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake,</p>        </blockquote>        <p>the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud, concealment or mistake (as the casemay be) or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>â¦..</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) For the purposes of subsection (1), deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discoveredfor some time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> In <i>Cave v Robinson Jarvis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20AC%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 AC 384</a> Lord Millett said of the equivalent of our <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26</a> thus at page 394E:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦.

But I do not agree that that renders subsection (2) otiose, A claimantwho proposes to invoke <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(1)(b)</a> â¦ must prove the facts necessary to bring the case within the paragraph.  He can do so if he can show that some facts relevantto his cause of action has been concealed from him either by a positive act of concealment or by a withholding of relevant information,but in either case, with the intention of concealing the fact or facts in question.  In many cases the requisite proof of informationmight be quite difficult to provide â¦.. Subsection (2), however, provides an alternative route.  The claimant need not concentrateon the allegedly concealed facts but can instead concentrate on the commission of the breach of duty.  If the claimant can show thatthe defendant knew he was committing a breach of duty, or intended to commit the breach of dutyâI can discern no difference betweenthe two formulations; each would constitute, in my opinion, a deliberate commission of the breachâthen , if the circumstances aresuch that the claimant is unlikely to discover for some time that the breach of duty has been committed, the facts involved in thebreach are taken to have been deliberately concealed for subsection (1)(b) purposes.  I do not agree with Mr. Doctor that the subsection,thus construed, adds nothing.  It provides an alternative, and in some cases what may well be an easier, means of establishing thefacts necessary to bring the case within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 32(1)(b)."</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> In the more recent judgment of <i>Williams v Fanshaw Porter</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20WLR%203185" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 WLR 3185</a>, the Court of Appeal threw further light on the proper construction of that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(1)</a> (the equivalent of our <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26).</a>  Park J. said at page 3193G this:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦ There are four points on the wording of the paragraph which should be noted. (i) The paragraph does not say that the rightof action must have been concealed from the claimant: it says only that a fact relevant to the right of action should have been concealedfrom the claimant. (ii) Although the concealed fact must have been relevant to the right of action, the paragraph does not say, andin my judgment does not require, that the defendant must have known that the fact was relevant to the right of actionâ¦. All thatis essential is that the fact must actually have been relevant, whether the defendant knew it or not. (iii) The paragraph requiresonly that any fact relevant to the right of action is concealed. It does not require that all facts relevant to the right of actionare concealed. (iv) The requirement is that the fact must be âdeliberately concealed.â  It is, I think, plain that, for concealmentto be deliberate, the defendant must have considered whether to inform the claimant of the fact and decided not to. I would go furtherand accept that the fact which he decides not to disclose either must be one which it was his duty to disclose, or must at leastbe one which he would ordinarily have disclosed in the normal course of his relationship with the claimant, but in the case of whichhe consciously decided to depart from what he would normally have done and to keep quiet about it.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> In an elaborate analysis, Mance L.J. described at paragraph 37 on page 3201, the two possible interpretations of the mental elementrequired under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(1)(b):</a> a more limited reading of deliberate concealment of a fact in circumstances where the defendant realises that the fact has some relevanceto an actual or potential claim against him and a wider reading where any deliberate concealment should carry the consequence attributedby <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(1)(b)</a>, even though the defendant did not realise that the fact concealed had any relevance to any actual or potential wrong doing.  </p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> The questions therefore under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26</a> are, firstly what are the facts which are material to the right of action which had been concealed and secondly was the concealmentof these facts deliberate or alternatively was the commission of the breach of duty deliberate in circumstances in which it was unlikelyto be discovered for some time.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> Applying the above law to the facts of the case, I find as a fact that the following facts are material to the right of action (breachof fiduciary duty by the Bank):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) the fact that the buyer, Bethlehem Management Ltd. was a Ho Family company;</p>        <p>(2) the fact that the Bank and the Ho Family are partners in Hang Seng Bank and are closely connected in business with Mr. Wranghamof the Bank and many Ho of the Ho Family sitting together on the board of Hang Seng Bank;</p>        <p>(3) the fact that the Bank as agent of Esquire was selling the Property to the family company of Ho Family, its junior partner inHang Seng Bank;</p>        <p>(4) the fact that the sale to the family company of the Ho Family by the Bank its partner was done in undue haste and without theProperty being fully marketed Bank.

I find further as a fact that the Bankknew that the sale of the Property to Bethlehem Management Ltd. was inappropriate and was in conflict with its duty of loyalty andgood faith to its principal Esquire.  I find that the Bank deliberately did not reveal to Esquire Facts (1)(3)(4) above, even thoughit was the Bankâs duty to disclose the aforesaid facts to Esquire and to obtain its informed consent. Finally I find as a factthat the Bank knew that the breach of fiduciary duty in circumstances described earlier was unlikely to be discovered for some timeand this was in fact the reason for the Bankâs concealment.  Subsequent events in fact confirmed that Esquire did not have anyidea of what had happened or that its trusted Bank had committed breach of fiduciary duty. It was entirely by a fortuitous accidentthat Mr. Ratnam read about Bethlehem Management Ltd. in 1994 and thereafter made the connection with the Ho Family and the Bankâsconnection to the Ho Family. Subsequent discovery brought out more of Facts (1)(2)(3)(4).</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> My conclusion is therefore that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> has been established by the Plaintiff. Having decided that the limitation defence fails in any event, because of the concealment,it becomes unnecessary to decide the difficult legal question of the applicability of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(7)</a>, namely applying limitation by analogy. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> If I had not decided the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a> concealment issue in favour of the Plaintiff, I would have deferred the matter of application of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(7)</a> to the Trial on Remedy and Relief.  Elaborate argument had been dressed to the Court on the impact of the learned judgment of <i>Cia de Seguros Imperio v.

The application of limitation by analogy is a matter of great technical complexity requiring the fullunderstanding of not only the equitable remedy or relief sought but also the history of equitable jurisdiction and its exercise andits relationship with the exercise of common law remedy and relief (see for example the 2001 Hochelaga Lecture by Professor Burrowson â<i>Fusing Common Law and Equity: Remedies, Restitution and Reform</i>).  The learned article on <i>Limitation by William Swadling</i> (Chapter 11) in <i>Breach of Trust</i> at page 319 to 351 and the textbook by <i>Brunyate on Limitation of Actions in Equity</i> (Cambridge University Press, 1929) show the extent of the learning in this area, not to speak of Pomeroy on <i>Equity Jurisprudence</i> 3<sup>rd</sup> edition and other textbooks referred to by Megarry VC at page 249 of <i>Tito v Waddell (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20Ch%20106" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 Ch. 106</a> (see also 250A). As relief and remedy has been hived off from this Trial, I have found it impossible, in justice to the parties,to decide on this aspect of the defence of the application of limitation by analogy, which in my judgment should be decided (if necessary)together with the decision on relief and remedy.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> In the circumstances, I conclude the Bank is not entitled to the limitation defence under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4(7)</a> and it follows that on the claim for breach of fiduciary duty, I find it established.</p>    <p style="text-align:center"><b>ECONOMIC DURESS</b></p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> Economic Duress is the second complaint of the Plaintiff.

At page 121D, this was said by Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon for the Dissent, on the 1<sup>st</sup> Requirement:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦ in life, including the life of commerce and finance, many acts are done under pressure, sometimes overwhelming pressure, sothat one can say that the actor had no choice but to act.  Absence of choice in this sense does not negate consent in law: for thisthe pressure must be of a kind which the law does not regard as legitimate.  Thus, out of the various means by which consent maybe obtainedâadvice, persuasion, influence, inducement, representation, commercial pressureâthe law has come to select some whichit will not accept as a reason for voluntary action: fraud, abuse of relation of confidence, undue influence, duress or coercion. In this the law, under the influence of equity, has developed from the old common law conception of duressâthreat to life andlimbâand it has arrived at the modern generalization expressed by Holmes J. ââsubject to an improper motive for actionâ¦..â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then at page 121F, their Lordships said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>first step required of the plaintiff is to show that some illegitimate means of persuasion was usedâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> In <i>Pao On v Lau Yiu Long</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] A.C. 635</a> the Privy Council was at the pioneer stage of developing the English law of economic duress.  This was said by Lord Scarman at page635-6:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦ American law â¦. Now recognises that a contract may be avoided on the ground of economic duress.  The commercial pressurealleged to constitute such duress must however, be such that the victim must have entered the contract against his will, must havehad no alternative course open to him, and must have been confronted with coercive acts by the party exerting the pressure â¦  Americanjudges pay great attention to such evidential matters such as the effectiveness of the alternative remedy available, the fact orabsence of protest, the availability of independent advice, the benefit received, and the speed with which the victim has soughtto avoid the contract.  Recently two English Judges have recognized that commercial pressure may constitute duress the pressure ofwhich can render a contract voidable â¦.  Both stressed that the pressure must be such that victimâs consent to the contract wasnot a voluntary act on his part.  In their Lordshipsâ view, there is nothing contrary to principle in recognising economic duressas a factor which may render a contract voidable, provided always that the basis of such recognition is that it must amount to acoercion of will, which vitiates consent. It must be shown that the payment made or the contract entered into was not a voluntaryact.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It will be seen that subsequent decisions analysed the elements of economic duress (coercion of will which vitiates consent) somewhatdifferently.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> <i>The Universal Sentinel</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20AC%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] A.C. 367</a> is important not only because it is one of the few authorities where the plaintiff victim was seeking to recover a benefit extractedfrom him but because both Lord Diplock and Lord Scarman expressed their views on the various important aspects relating to economicduress.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> Lord Diplock first pointed out at page 377 D &amp; E that the novel aspect of <i>The Universal Sentinel</i> is that there the action was brought by ITF not in tort, but as money had and received.

Reveal two elements in the wrong of duress: (1) pressure amounting to compulsion of the will of the victim;and (2) the illegitimacy of the pressure exerted.  There must be pressure, the practical effect of which is compulsion or the absenceof choice.  Compulsion is variously described in the authorities as coercion or the vitiation of consent.  The classic case of duressis, however, not the lack of will to submit but the victimâs intentional submission arising from the realization that there isno other practical choice open to him.  This is the thread of principle which links the early law of duress (threat to life or limb)with later developments â¦.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> Then at page 401 Lord Scarman made the following well-known statement:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIn determining what is legitimate two matters may have to be considered.  The first is as to the nature of the pressure.  In manycases this will be decisive, though not in every case.  And so the second question may have to be considered, namely, the natureof the demand which the pressure is applied to supportâ¦. Duress can, of course, exist even if the threat is one of lawful action:whether it does so depends upon the nature of the demand.  Blackmail is often a demand supported by a threat to do what is lawful,e.g. to report criminal conduct to the police.  In many cases, therefore âWhat one has to justify is not the threat but the demandâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> In <i>Crescendo Management v Westpac</i> (1988) 19 NSWLR at page 46A, McHugh JA said this about illegitimate pressure:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âPressure will be illegitimate if it consists of unlawful threats or amount to unconscionable conduct.  But the categories are notclosed.  Even overwhelming pressure, not amoungting to unconscionable or unlawful conduct, however, will not necessarily constituteeconomic duress.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> <i>The Evia Luck</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20AC%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 A.C. 152</a> is of particular relevance late when I come to consider the restitutional character of economic duress.

(as he then was) in <i>Huyton v Cremer</i> [1999] 1 Lloydâs Rep. 620 as a significant decision because it contained much perceptive analysis of the law of economic duress. He discussed mala fides or the lack of belief in the position adopted in applying pressure.  This is directly related to the qualityassessment of whether the pressure applied is illegitimate an example of which is when it is known by the victim that the pressureis illegitimate and also known by the oppressor as being illegitimate. The more both parties appreciate that the pressure is illegitimate,the greater is the compulsion and oppression and more unjust is the succumbing by the victim when both the oppressor and the victimknew that the victim had no practical option or choice but to surrender to the victimisation or economic duress.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> The Judge after elaborating on the nature of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Requirement at page 636, turned at page 637-8 to the question of illegitimate pressure (1<sup>st</sup> Requirement) and the question of significant cause (2<sup>nd</sup> Requirement) and the inter-relationship between the 1<sup>st</sup> Requirement and 2<sup>nd</sup> Requirement. After referring at page 635 to the relevance of bona fides and to the relevance of the reasonableness of the positionadopted by the alleged oppressor to the legitimacy of the pressure, he said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦. A party who perceives that the other party is acting in bad faith may be more likely to feel exposed and coerced.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then he said towards the end of the page 636 that the description by Lord Goff in non absolute terms in <i>The Evia Luck</i>:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âleaves room for flexibility in the characterization of illegitimate pressure and of the relevant causal link.

(as he then was) referred to the âCourtâs assessment of the qualitative impact of the illegitimate pressure objectivelyassessedâ.  I would prefer to reformulate the critical assessment a little bit differently and to concentrate on the objectivequalitative assessment of the action (normally it would be the pressure/threat) and then together with the other two factors (conditionof the oppressor and condition of the victim) so as to be able to arrive objectively at a qualitative assessment of the impact ofthese three factors on the victim and on the victimâs action (generally speaking surrender).</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> I say surrender because generally that is the result of the pressure, whether legitimate or illegitimate.  It is not the qualityof the result which informs us whether it is economic duress but it is the quality of the pressure which should provide the key.The more outrageous the pressure or threat, the more likely such pressure/threat is illegitimate. A reference to the decided caseswill tell us that pressure/threat such as murder (<i>Barton</i> case) and ITF blacking of ships (<i>Universal Sentinel</i> and <i>Evia Luck</i>) are considered illegitimate.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> Often threat is the constituent of the oppressorâs action which the Court should examine. This is because unlike unconscionableconduct (conduct of the stronger party over the weaker party) or undue influence (quality of assent of the weaker party under undueinfluence) [see <i>Commercial Bank of Australia v Amadio</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 447</a> at 461 per Mason, J and at 474 per Deane, J], threat as a form of undue pressure is normally the basis of economic duress. Unduepressure is applied because there would otherwise be resistance to the demand of the oppressor and resistance must be overcome byundue pressure. But threat, whether express or implied, is not the only form of undue pressure to qualify as illegitimate pressure.Deliberate misstatement, deliberate concealment or omission such as to create undue pressure on the victim can all qualify as illegitimatepressure. It is essentially the quality of the pressure knowingly applied improperly by the oppressor on the victim which is important.When the pressure is applied mala fide or without genuine belief in its validity or unconscionably, such pressure is often illegitimate.Undue pressure applied improperly (to overcome resistance to demand) is therefore for me the hallmark of economic duress and thequality of undue pressure knowingly applied (to overcome resistance) should be the centre of focus to ascertain whether there hasbeen economic duress. Translated into common parlance, it is the character of âthe stickâ that is required to be closely examined,and not the character of âthe carrotâ.</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> In the light of the aforesaid considerations, it seems to me that it is possible to delineate certain types of situations which willgive high indicia (not conclusive) of economic duress. A tentative list could include the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1)   The undue pressure was applied made mala fide by the oppressor;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2)   The oppressor did not bona fide believe in the validity of the undue pressure;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3)   The undue pressure of the oppressor was unconscionable;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(4)   The undue pressure and the demand were more than mere commercial pressure between the strong and the weak;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(5)   The victim was in a protective position vis-Ã -vis the oppressor when the undue pressure was made;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(6)   The undue pressure applied amounted to equitable fraud and was against conscience.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> The law on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Requirement (pressure is significant cause of victimâs action) and the law on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Requirement (pressure gave victim no real choice) is each sufficiently clear.  Having regard to the facts of this case, it is unlikelythat the law on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Requirement and the law on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Requirement will give rise to any disagreement between the parties on these two Requirements.  The major dispute is in respect ofthe legal scope of the 1<sup>st</sup> Requirement and whether the facts of this case comes within the proper legal scope of the 1<sup>st</sup> Requirement.</p>    <p class="heading">Application of the Law: Did the Bank exert Economic Duress</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> At the Trial, whether economic duress was exerted by the Bank was rightly focused on the occasion of the meetings in March 1987 (âMarchMeetingsâ) and that nightâs telephone calls.  Esquire concentrated on one principal pressure/threat and reference was also madeto two subsidiary pressure/threats (which were not pleaded) made by Sommerfield at the March Meetings.  The principal pressure/threatwas that the Bank insisted (at the March Meetings and in the night telephone call with Gurdas) that Esquire was owing $30 MillionOvercharge (Interest Overcharge and Escrow Payment Overpayment) and threatened that Bank would make demand including this $30 MillionOvercharge and the Bank would liquidate/finish off Esquire as result. The two subsidiary pressure/threats were that the Bank wouldadd on to the total debt of Esquire the extra $12 Million written-off debt of BA and that the Bank threatened to liquate the homeof Arjan.  For ease of reference I will refer to these three threats as respectively, âthe $30 Million Overcharge Threatâ, âtheBA Extra Debt Threatâ and âthe Arjan Home Threatâ.</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> On Esquire claim of economic duress, this court is only concerned with the $30 Million Overcharge Threat and not with the BA ExtraDebt Threat or the Arjan Home Threat. But in order to properly appreciate the significance and the effect of the $30 Million OverchargeThreat, it is necessary to first recount the history relating to all these 3 threats. </p>    <p class="heading"><u>$30 Million Overcharge Threat</u></p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> The 30 Million Overcharge Threat is really a shorthand for threats in respect of two separate overcharge, one overcharge of the HardcoreFrozen Debt (also referred to Hardcore Frozen Account) of some $15 Million in relation to interest (hereinafter referred to as âInterestOverchargeâ) and one overcharge of the Hardcore Frozen Debt or Account of $15 Million in respect of repayment from the Escrow Accountwhich should have been credited to the Hardcore Frozen Account from money received by the Bank from the Escrow Account (hereinafterreferred to as âEscrow Payment Overchargeâ). Together they make up a total of roughly $30 Million and for convenience this twoovercharge items had been referred to collectively as the $30 Million Overcharge.  At the Trial, Mr. Fok suggested that it was inappropriateto call it $30 Million Overcharge and that it might be more appropriately called $30 Million Over-statement or $30 Million Over-claim.In my view, there is nothing wrong with the label Overcharge because the Hardcore Frozen Account was charged already with the wrongfigures which Bank was refusing to correct or even to acknowledge were wrong and to be corrected.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> The exact figures of the Interest Overcharge $14,883,815.85 and of the Escrow Payment Overcharge $15,423,632.77 can be seen in theInternal Memo of the Bank [496-8] dated 15<sup>th</sup> December 1986 from Wheeler, Deputy Manager of the Bankâs Mongkok Office to Sommerfield, the Account Manager of the Credit Controlat the Head office.  This Memo was sent as result of the internal inquiry made by the Bank to ascertain exactly how much Esquirewas overcharged by the Bank. (The Memo also made reference to the sum of $15,423,632.77 being transferred from Hardcore Frozen Debtto Working Account but that was without the knowledge and approval of Esquire and the other banks, nor did that make it less of anovercharge by the Bank of the Hardcore Frozen Debt under the Escrow Payment Overcharge, specially when the Bank did not see fit totell Esquire of this Memo and its contents.)  The internal inquiry started back in 1985 by the Bank but assumed urgency when Esquirecomplained in October 1986 that there was a $30 Million Overcharge [409 and 411].</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> There was the Interest Overcharge by the Bank in the Hardcore Frozen Debt because under the Restructuring Agreement no interest wassupposed to be charged for that relevant period and this Interest Overcharge was recognized by the Bank as early as August 1985 [270].There was the Escrow Payment Overcharge because total repayment of some $15 Million was made by Esquire from the Escrow Account butthe Bank having initially credited these repayments to the Hardcore Frozen Account then unilaterally and without knowledge or consentof Esquire debited the Hardcore Frozen Account $15 Million (moving the sum to the Working Account) and therefore failed to properlyreduce the debt in that Hardcore Frozen Account. In the letter dated 18<sup>th</sup> October 1986 [423] from Esquire to the Bank addressed to Wallis (the predecessor of Sommerfield in Credit Control of the Bank) boththe Interest Overcharge and the Escrow Payment Overcharge were explained to the Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> The Mongkok Branch was involved with this internal inquiry and Esquireâs complaint of the two Overcharges, because the Overchargeswere effected at the Mongkok Branch where the accounts were maintained.  As a result of the examination by Wallis on the aforesaidcomplaint letter of Esquire, he wrote an Internal Memo dated 23<sup>rd</sup> October 1986 [429-431] to Wheeler of Mongkok Branch.  On Interest Overcharge he wrote:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â2) d) It would appear that HSBC has to refund Esquire the interest charged from 13Sept-31Dec83. We should be grateful if you wouldcalculate the advise us the amount of interest charged from 13Sep-31Dec83 on frozen accountâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p>On the Escrow Repayment Overcharge he wrote:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âd) iii) However we need to be able to advise Esquire where that $16.4 Million (received from escrow) was applied. If you can proveit went to Property debt reduction so well and good-if not then it must have been applied to interest and in which case HSBC willhave to refund them $16.4M by reducing their frozen debt.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> The reference to refund was of course a figure of speech, because what was complained was that the Hardcore Frozen Account showeda debt which was $30 Million too high, and ought to be $158 Million instead of $188 Million. This Memo was copied also to the bossof Wallis, J. Diccon Pullen.  Pullen at page 431 wrote these important words:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦.  This is just one of many issues which continue to be discussed with Gurdas.  However it might represent a special negotiatinggiveaway as we press Gurdas further.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Pullen did not give evidence at the Trial but what he said in the Memo about âa special negotiating giveaway to press Gurdasâwill turn out, by reference to subsequent events, to be central to the whole question of illegitimate pressure.  I read Pullen tomean, by his words a special negotiating giveaway as a means or weapon to press Gurdas to sell. That faced with the legal necessityto correct and refund to the Hardcore Frozen Account, the Interest Overcharge and the Escrow Repayment Overcharge, the Bank was notto admit or reveal to Esquire the true position but the Bank was to deliberately misstate or misrepresent to Esquire that the Bankwas entitled to the $30M Overcharge and on that basis the Bank was to use the non-entitled $30 Million Overcharge as negotiationgiveaway in exerting pressure on Gurdas to agree to the sale of the Property.  It seems to me that when this important manuscriptnote is viewed with the benefit of subsequent documents and events, my above reading of the Memo is a cogent and fair reading andwill lead to my eventual conclusion that Pullen was the dark hand which moved this economic duress business. Certainly by this Memoon page 431 Pullen had laid down the road-map for the Bank as to the substance and the manner of the pressure which should be appliedon Esquire to force Esquire to sell the Property. Subsequent events would show that this road-map was followed by Sommerfield. Theimportant question is whether what Pullen had devised and what Sommerfield executed was illegitimate as having crossed the line,for a banker and by the Bank.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The BA Extra Debt Threat</u></p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> In the Memo dated 23<sup>rd</sup> October there was a reference [430] to the Bank of America debt and linking that to the $30 Million Overcharge. What happened wasthat Bank of America was bought out in 1985 by the Bank as Bank of America wanted out of the Restructuring and was threatening troublewith the Restructuring, which was against the Bankâs interest as the Bank at that time was hugely overexposed with the Esquireindebtedness. The Bank wanted Esquire, to work hard under the Restructuring, so as to pay off the debt owing by Esquire. The originaldebt of $22 Million owing by Esquire to the Bank of America was largely written off by Bank of America accepting a payment of $8Million from the Bank.  The buyout by the Bank from the Bank of America was at 36% of the original debt. The Bank however wishedto appear to the other creditors as having bought out the Bank of America at a lower price of 20% [see Notes of Meeting with otherbanks on 28<sup>th</sup> May 1985 at page 222]. The reason for this is so that if and when necessary the Bank could negotiate to buy out the other banks alsoat 20% or lower.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> As the Bank only paid $8 Million for a debt which was originally $22 Million, the question arose in 1985 immediately after the buy-outas to how the Bank would like to book that debt. In the Internal Memo dated 24<sup>th</sup> April 1985 [190], Hamilton of Credit Operations was asking Budd of Credit Control about how to book the BA debt.  He said that âifthe debt of $14 Million is to be forgiven the entries would simply be the HK$8M loan and payment to Bank of America.â This waswhat happened because the books of the Bank in respect of Esquire thereafter showed the debt of BA owing by Esquire at $8 Millionand not at $22 Million (if $14 Million was not to be forgiven to Esquire). In the Internal Memo dated 7<sup>th</sup> August 1985 [247], the BA debt of Esquire to the Bank was shown at $8 Million not $22 Million. The same was also shown in Memo dated23<sup>rd</sup> August 1985 [265], Memo dated 27<sup>th</sup> February 1986 [347].</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> In a letter dated 12<sup>th</sup> August 1986 from Wallis to Esquire, the account of the debt of Esquire was stated to be $8 Million under Frozen Debt Account (â004â)in respect of the BA Debt, and not $22 Million [384].  This was therefore the clearest statement from the Bank to Esquire which wasrelied upon by Esquire that the BA Debt due from Esquire to the Bank was $8 Million.  It was simply a confirmation by the Bank toEsquire that it had agreed to the request by Esquire that the benefit of the buy-out be passed to Esquire as referred to by Esquirein its letter to the Bank dated 24<sup>th</sup> October 1986 [432]. There could be no going back by the Bank from this position openly stated to Esquire by the Bank. </p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> Esquire therefore was rightly surprised when the Bank raised for the first time in October 1986 the argument that the BA Debt wasnot $8 Million but another $14 Million more. This was at the time when the Bank realized that it had to repay some $30 Million toEsquire on the $30 Million Overcharge or at least the $15 Million of the Interest Overcharge. The letter dated 21<sup>st</sup> October 1986 [428] was the first time that the Bank raised the argument that the BA Debt was not $8 Million but $22-3 Million andit coincided exactly with the time when the Bank found that it had no answer to the $30 Million Overcharge. The BA Extra Debt of$12 Million was an invention created by the Bank to defend the hopeless position of $30 Million Overcharge.</p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> That there was in reality no substance to this BA Extra Debt can be seen from what happened after Esquire surrendered and agreedto sell. There was not even any write-off of the BA Extra Debt (which the Bank threatened earlier to use as set-off).  There wasnothing to write off as in the books of the Bank it was never taken on. The Restructuring Agreement of April 1987 made no mentionwhatsoever of the BA Extra Debt or its write-off (see Clause 2.05 on page 698 and Schedule 3 on page 702). </p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Arjan Home Threat</u></p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> Arjan the brother of Gurdas owned a flat which was mortgaged to the Bank. That mortgage was part of a number of securities held bythe Bank, but not connected to the loan by the Bank to Esquire or to the mortgage of the Property. It is a minor security in termsof value but it has the strategic value of giving the Bank a great deal of leverage in forcing Esquire and in particular Gurdas todo what the Bank desired should be done. A forced taking away of Arjan flat by itself made no sense and was not expressly within,or permitted by, the Restructuring Agreement.  A threat to liquidate Arjanâs flat is therefore a resort by the Bank to an inappropriateor illegitimate method. Sommerfield regarded the Arjan flat as of great strategic value because of its psychological impact on thewill of Esquire to resist demand of the Bank. In Sommerfieldâs handover instructions to his successor dated 12<sup>th</sup> May 1987 (âSommerfield Handover Instructionsâ), he singled out the Arjan flat as being of great leverage value and boasted howhe succeeded with pressing Gurdas to agree to sell âafter I told his negotiating team I would make demand and start âpickingoffâ properties starting with Arjanâs flatâ [744]. It will be noted that this important matter was not recorded in the Marchmeeting Notes of Sommerfield at [509-510, 518-9] and its absence can only be explained by the appreciation of Sommerfield that suchaction in respect of Arjanâs flat constituted illegitimate pressure.  </p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> The scene is now almost set for the Bank to increase the pressure to force Esquire to sell. But before I do that, I should firstdescribe the condition of Esquire, followed by a description of the condition of the Bank.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Condition of Esquire/Protective Relationship &amp; Esquire Witnesses</u></p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> Esquire which was once a strong growing company went downhill steadily after the purchase of the Property.  The Restructuring fora company when debts were owing to many banks was like putting the company into a straight jacket. The Restructuring Agreements tookall freedom away from Esquire. There was very little ability to move because all actions were dictated and had to be approved bythe Lead Bank which in this case was the Bank. In the case of a Restructuring such as this in Hong Kong, with the Lead Bank beingthe Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, there was realistically not even a possibility of finding alternative finance to replace the LeadBank in the middle of a restructuring. Not only were trading and other financial activities dictated and restricted by the Bank butthere was a system of tight control placed so that money could only go in and out of designated controlled special accounts. Accountantslike Peats were there to regularly monitor the activities. Targets had to be met and regular minimum sums had to be paid and theoverall control was handled by the special department of Credit Control.  Esquire was not only in hospital as a patient (ânursedback to healthâ in the words of Sommerfield in his Witness Statement para. 6) but was for a long time including the critical periodunder our inquiry at the Trial, in the quasi Intensive Care Unit of Credit Control to make sure it would not expire.  Esquire thereforein 1986/1987 was not only weak but uniquely weak and under the financial care of the Bank and was dependant on the Bank.  This wasmuch more of a case of a bank given confidential trust because of âcombination of status, goodwill and knowledgeâ in the <i>Lloydâs Bank v Bundy</i> sense.  Esquire was in this case, so dependant on the Bank that it was wholly vulnerable to all adverse actions taken by the Bank,its carer.</p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> It may be convenient at this stage also to indicate my view of the key players of Esquire (and later of the Bank) who gave evidenceat the Trial.  I do it in the context of a Trial taking place some 17 years after the events in 1987 with all the handicap such lapseof time entails. But in my view, the considerable documentation (even though some such as the critical important Meeting Notes andPhone Call Notes of Sommerfield of 12<sup>th</sup> March, are not complete or accurate records e.g.:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) missing reference at [518-9, 520-521] to the Arjan Flat Threat which was clearly recorded in Sommerfieldâs Handover Instructionsat [744];</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) what took place during the night call between Gurdas and Sommerfield as described by Gurdas but covered up and disguised in theexpression âamongst all the b.s.â in the Night Calls Note at [511] and;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(3) the lack of reference to Sommerfieldâs demand for Gurdas in that night telephone call to come back to Hong Kong immediatelyto sign the Power of Attorney in the Night Calls Note at [511] but reflected in Sommerfieldâs letter to Esquire of 9<sup>th</sup> April 1987 reminding Gurdasâ previous commitment to sign the Power of Attorney [577])</p>    </blockquote>    <p>put before the Court and the context of the differences between the parties, renders the assessment of evidence, in this very uniquecase, less a matter of assessing whether someone could or could not recollect the particular details of a conversation than the overallassessment of the character of the persons involved and in the light of such assessment, to make determination of what truly happened.And the character of persons, specially someone like Sommerfield or Ratnam or Gurdas, does not change with the years.</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> I start with Mr. Ratnam as a witness.  For me, he was undoubtedly, an honest and reliable witness. He was an outside man who wascalled in to assist Esquire when Esquire got into serious difficulty and he was a man approved by the Bank.  I find his evidencetotally credible if not, time and again, much too generous to the Bank, specially when he was pressed in cross-examination. Wheneverthere is any difference between his evidence and that of Sommerfield, I have no doubt I prefer the evidence of Ratnam.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a> Gurdas the big boss and proprietor of Esquire also gave evidence at the Trial. Gurdas was accused of being completely unethical.I do not find this to be the case. He could be mistaken on the minor detail for example on the matter of the sequence of telephonecalls that night of 12<sup>th</sup> March. He could be graphic sometimes as for example in his describing Sommerfield in the March telephone call thrusting a shotgunâsbarrel down the mouth of Gurdas when Gurdas was still trying to resist  the sale of the Property. But on the whole, I accept hisevidence and I believe what he said largely represented what happened. The evidence of Gurdas is of course important, specially asto his resistance and his surrender, because it was his resistance to sale which must be overcome and not that of Ratnam who wasafter all merely a hired-hand (albeit a senior hand).  There is no doubt that Gurdas could be vocal and could also be persistent,as demonstrated when he subsequently made complaint representations about the sale of the Property to Eldon and to Emily Lau. Butthis perhaps illustrates that he genuinely believed Esquire was wronged by the Bank (Robertson said he âwhinedâ in 1988 aboutbeing forced to sell) and that what he complained at the time and what he subsequently told the Court, was the truth.    </p>    <p class="heading"><u>Condition of the Bank &amp; Bankâs Witnesses</u></p>    <p><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a> The Bank on the other hand was not only strong but mighty. It had been for a long long time the premier bank in Hong Kong and wasalso the quasi-Government Bank.  In Hong Kong, there could be few position more influential or powerful or prestigious than beingChairman of the Hong Kong Bank.  No business or businessman dared to cross the Hong Kong Bank and even fellow bankers in Hong Konghad to give away to this top bank. </p>    <p><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> Vis-Ã -vis Esquire, the Bank was not only all powerful but almost god-like in 1986/87.  Esquire being financially sick required thefinancial IC Unit care of Credit Control.  The Bank was effectively Esquireâs only lifeline and it was unrealistic to think thatEsquire could ever find another bank or group of banks to replace the lifeline of the Bank.  Without the Bank, Esquire would simplysink and die.</p>    <p><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a> The god-like position of the Bank of course did not come unearned. The Bank was well organized in its structure. In terms of thepower structure of the Bank in its dealings with the affairs of Esquire, the document Exhibit P1 entitled Names and Ranks (hereinafterreferred to as âthe Bankâs Ranksâ) shows the two divisions in the Bank dealing with Esquire. On the Mongkok Branch side, therelevant persons were Wheeler (Deputy Manager, Mongkok) and his boss Bamford (District Manager, Mongkok). On the Head Office side,there was Wallis and his successor Sommerfield (Account Manger, CCD).  Then above Account Manger, CCD there was Robertson and hissuccessor Budd as Assistant Manager, CCD.  Pullen as Manager, CCD was above them and was in a critical position as he was the linkto Selway-Swift the Assistant Manger, Corporate Banking. Above Selway-Swift there was the Wrangham the General Manager.</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a> I should also at this stage indicate my assessment of the two officers of the Bank who gave evidence at the Trial. Sommerfield wasan American banker who joined the Bank quite young and he was a junior officer at the relevant time. His shrewdness and intelligencecame through not only in the documents he wrote at the time but throughout the Trial.  He gave his evidence carefully, cleverly,calmly and well thought-out.  He ranks amongst one of the most formidable witnesses that I have ever seen in all my 35 years in thelaw. He is a man who thinks hard about problems and thinks far ahead. The subtlety of his mind and of his character can only startto be appreciated, the longer one is exposed to him, to his words on paper and to him in person giving evidence.  Where it is critical,his evidence must be scrutinized carefully and often when necessary, rejected. The style and the contents of the Sommerfield HandoverInstructions reveal a great deal about the character and quality of Sommerfield and his mind. This and his contemporaneous notes(often not wholly reliable as with the March meetings Notes and the Night Calls Note) are to be contrasted with the low-key and oftencalm mild-manner evidence he gave orally in Court. I regret that in the critical areas in this case, his oral evidence cannot beaccepted. His intelligence and shrewdness makes his ruthlessness even more formidable. Unfortunately Sommerfield did not put hisintelligence to the beneficial use of morality. His amorality which he advanced with his superior intelligence and subtle charactermade his threats that much more formidable, intimidating and deadly.  Where his evidence conflicts with that of Gurdas and Ratnam,I prefer the evidence of Esquireâs witnesses.</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a> Selway-Swift is a totally different kind of witness and person.  He was of course a senior and important banker and even in 1987he was already a very experienced and influential banker in Hong Kong.  He is capable and he is clever, but he does not have thecritical intelligence or the subtlety of Sommerfield and he was made of rougher stuff.  He was more blunt and under pressure he gavemore away. For me he was the ugly face of capitalism and I regret that much of what he said was not acceptable to me, whether interms of what happened or in terms of what he represented to the Court as legitimate or normal behaviour for a banker in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a> Pullen did not give evidence nor did Wrangham.  There was no Pullen answer to Interrogatories (see paragrtaph 11-12 of 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit of Susan Sayers sworn on 29<sup>th</sup> October 2003 [251]).  Both of them played important roles in this saga and in the case of Pullen very significant role. What I saytherefore in this judgment about them could only be from inferences fairly drawn from all the documents and the surrounding circumstances. I am not sure either of them came out well. Pullen as I will say later is the Machiavellian who behind the scene was amorally dictatingthe course of action for young Sommerfield who was the executioner. âSpecial giveawayâ is the euphemism used by Pullen to describedeliberately telling a lie to the other side and then using that lie as the pressure to force the other side to surrender.  The techniqueis to say to Esquire I will forgive your sin if you will sell, when the other side had never sinned in the first place.  Wranghamallowed himself to be involved in a sale of the Property to a junior partner of the Bank which like his subordinates he must haveknown was quite inappropriate.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>The Making of the Threats, the Quality of the Threats and its effect on Esquire</u></p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a> Having set out the conditions of the parties and the subject matter of the principal threat and the two subsidiary threats, it isnow possible to proceed with describing the events from late 1986 which led to the exercise of the pressure by the Bank on Esquireto sell the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a> In a meeting of the 28<sup>th</sup> October 1986 between the Bank (Wallis) and Esquire (Gurdas), Wallis of the Bank (who was handing over to Sommerfield) admitted thatEsquire might be right about the Interest Overcharge and that the Bank was still investigating about the Escrow Overcharge [435].</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> Pursuant to the âspecial negotiation giveawayâ road-map of Pullen on 23<sup>rd</sup> October, the Bank wrote on 28<sup>th</sup> October [438] to Esquire giving notice that if necessary the Bank would offset the BA Extra Debt against the $30 Million Overcharge. This was written when the Bank knew that there was no valid basis to the $30 Million Overcharge or at the very least to the InterestOvercharge in the $30 Million Overcharge.  Instead of directly admitting that the error on the $30 Million Overcharge, the Bank saidthat it was still investigating.</p>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a> In the meeting between Sommerfield and Gurdas on 25<sup>th</sup> November 1986, the question of the $30 Million Overcharge and the BA Extra Debt were directly raised by Gurdas who wanted the Bankto acknowledge that there was the $30 Million Overcharge and that there was no BA Extra Debt.  In the Memo of Sommerfield [476] Sommerfielddescribed the correction of the $30 Million Overcharge and the BA Extra Debt as euphemistically âforgivenessâ.  If there wasno sin, there was nothing to forgive.  Sin, like the $30 Million Overcharge and the BA Extra Debt, was invented by the Bank to providea scope for forcing Esquire to agree to the Bankâs demand.</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a> It is to be noted that Sommerfield had fully followed the road-map of Pullen and under option 2, Sommerfield said âGurdas couldagree to sell.  We might offer some concessions on the money issues in return.â [476] The âgiveawayâ card of Pullen was alreadyplayed by Sommerfield in his first meeting as Account Manager. From them on, it was merely the increasing of the pressure by theBank until Esquire put up their hands in surrender.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a> The next Memo of Sommerfield to the higher ups in the Bank dated 25<sup>th</sup> November 1986 [484] is important. I will set out the relevant parts as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2) Method of marketing:  Initially for sale by private treaty with maximum publicity.  I fell the property will be so popular thatwe will, after three or four weeks marketing, decide to take it to private tender.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>3)  Current market conditions: While Senior Management feel the market is âtoppishâ, I have spoken to both Colin Lam (Henderson)and Raymond Kwok (Sun Hung Kai) to seek their opinions. Both feel that property prices generally and in TST commercial areas arelikely to rise.  If one agrees with them, then on should either market the property now at a value well in excess of current valuations(20%-30%) or hold until after Chinese New Year.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>With the above in mind, the options appear to be as follows:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>1) Enter into possession and market immediately â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>2) To convince G. to sell voluntarily.  This may be possible in two ways:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>a) To offer the following concessions:-</p>            <blockquote>                <p>i) Acceptance of his claim that $30M owing to us is not in fact owing (heâs probably correct)</p>            </blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>ii) Acceptance of his request to allow him the âbenefitâ of the BofA assignment (approx $16-17M)</p>            </blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>iii) Forgiveness of further debt</p>            </blockquote>            <p>b) To offer lesser monetary concession as above â¦â¦</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>I recommend option 2(b) provided we obtain suitably worded written undertaking.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>I would be grateful to receive your instructions on which action to follow. If you wish to offer forgiveness of debt, kindly advisehow much we are willing to forgive, and I will negotiate accordingly.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a> Pullen wrote in his own hand [484] in answer to the above Memo the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âAs previously discussed.  âConvinceâ G to market property now but negotiate minimum concessions.  February 1987 sale acceptable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a> As can be seen at each step of the way, Pullen was the dark hand which guided Sommerfield forward and in his written Note, Pullenwas giving instructions to Sommerfield, not only to press Gurdas to sell but in so pressing, to assert that the Bank was entitledto the $42 Million ($30 Million Overcharge and $12 Million for BA Extra Debt) and then use the $30 Million Overcharge to negotiatefor Gurdasâ agreement to sell and to give as little away of that $30 Million Overcharge as possible.  </p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a> The Memo dated 15<sup>th</sup> December 1986 [496-7] which I have referred to earlier (with figures of Interest Overcharge and Escrow Payment Overcharge) was sentby Wheeler of Mongkok Branch to Sommerfield. This Memo made it clear that Esquire was right both on the Interest Overcharge as wellas on the Escrow Overcharge.  Sommerfield however with knowledge of this Memo did not inform Esquire that the Bank would be correctingthe $30 Million Overcharge mistakes or at least the Interest Overcharge mistake or even that the Bank has received the result ofinvestigation on the $30 Million Overcharge.  Sommerfield simply buried that Memo.</p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a> In the letter to Esquire from Sommerfield dated 28<sup>th</sup> January 1987 no mention was made about the Bank knowing that Esquire was correct about the $30 Million Overcharge or at least aboutthe Interest Overcharge or about the result of investigation.</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a> On 26<sup>th</sup> February 1987, Pullen had lunch with Gurdas according to the handwritten note of Pullen on [503] at which meeting apparently Gurdaswas still asking for the âforgivenessâ presumably referring to $30 Million Overcharge correction whereas Pullen wanted the propertyto be sold.  Then sinisterly, Pullen wrote âSuggest this suitable situation for Oliner to come up with dealâ.  The âdealâwas of course sale of property in exchange for âforgivenessâ or Bankâs agreeing to some part or all of $30 Million Overchargebeing corrected or âforgivenâ.  Oliner was an American lawyer who was supposed to be working for Esquire but who the Bank regardedas being a lawyer who could be manipulated by the Bank and probably at important moments might have divided loyalty and might speakfavourably of the Bankâs proposals.  At the Trial, Oliner was labeled by Esquire of being an enemy disguised as a foreign lawyer,planted by the Bank inside Esquire.  Oliner was in fact made a defendant in an abortive High Court Action brought in 1994 by Esquire(see Exhibit D2).  Although I would not go as far as agreeing with Esquire that Oliner was deliberately planted by the Bank insideEsquire, I believe that the Bank did have a close relationship with Oliner and certainly had not been harmed in any way by Olinersitting on the other side of the table. </p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>&gt; The shrewd idea of Oliner coming up with the deal proposed by Pullen in his Memo was in fact implemented as Oliner was at theMarch meetings sitting across the table from the Bank.  As again, Pullen succeeded in manipulating for events to move forward accordingto his road-map.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a> Gurdas left Hong Kong sometime before the 12<sup>th</sup> March Meeting and he was therefore absent at that Meeting on 12<sup>th</sup> March 1987.  There were altogether three Meetings and two night telephone calls. There was consensus between the parties that the1<sup>st</sup> Meeting took place in the morning of the Thursday the 12<sup>th</sup> of March [509-510].  The second meeting also took place on Thursday (12<sup>th</sup> March) but in the afternoon [518-519].  There were then two telephone calls that night of 12<sup>th</sup> March, one between Ratnam and Sommerfield and one between Sommerfield and Gurdas calling from India [511] when Gurdas surrendered.Then finally there was the 3<sup>rd</sup> meeting on Monday the 16<sup>th</sup> of March [520-521] when the concession to sell was formally made.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a> I accept the evidence of Gurdas that his departure from Hong Kong was well known to the Bank but the Bank did not tell him that itwas  going to insist on the sale of the Building at the 12<sup>th</sup> March meeting. Esquire suggested that the Bank deliberately chose to spring on the insistence of the Sale of the Property when Gurdaswas away to put maximum pressure on Esquire and Gurdas, whereas the Bank said that it was quite plain to Esquire that at the planned12<sup>th</sup> March Meeting the sale was to be the topic of discussion and not just future restructuring and that Gurdas deliberately stayed away.</p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a> I must say that I prefer Esquireâs version. In terms of sophistication, I have no doubt forward-thinking and the craftiness wereall in the Bankâs camp and in the person of Sommerfield and Pullen. Ratnam was straight and Gurdas was too rough and emotionalto have the sort of cunning to deliberately stay away when the crucial meeting to decide on the sale would be held in his absence.I read Gurdas to be the sort of person who would want to be there to resist as much as he could and in fact his objection to thesale was well known to Pullen to Sommerfield which made it even more tempting for the Bank to hold the March meeting in his absence.In my view, it is ridiculous to think as Sommerfield said that Gurdas would keep away deliberately in the hope that it might givehim more time to think about his response or as an indication that Gurdas did not take this concern of the Bank seriously. As eventsturned out, the Bank gained from Gurdasâ absence which suggest that there is more substance in Esquireâs contention  (not withstandingwhat Sommerfield stated in his Memo at 518 (âG left â¦ at exactly the time he should have stayedâ).  I find as a fact that theBank knowing of Gurdasâ planned business trip, scheduled the meeting on the 12<sup>th</sup> March when the Bank could spring on Ratnam the insistence for sale and execute the road-map of Pullen. It worked brilliantly becauseRatnam could never resist like Gurdas.  Ratnam is a calm and quiet gentleman who would cave in much more easily than Gurdas. In myjudgment, 12<sup>th</sup> March meeting was planned by the Bank to give itself the maximum leverage and it did.</p>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a> The 12<sup>th</sup> March morning meeting was attended by Khan of Arthur Young, Oliner the American lawyer and Ratnam on the Esquire side while the Bankâsside was represented by Robertson, Assistant Manager of CCD, Carruthers (who was going to take over from Sommerfield) and Sommerfieldboth of CCD.  The subject matter of the Meeting was the restructuring of the debt. The figure presented by Esquire for the restructuringwas $86 Million for Property Loan (no dispute), $125 Million for Trading Lines (no dispute) and $159 Million for Hardcore FrozenDebt (inclusive of BA Debt of $8 Million).  Whereas the Bank stated that the Hardcore Frozen Debt of Esquire was $188 Million or$201 Million if inclusive of BA Debt. The difference between the $201 Million and $159 Million is $42 Million which is made up of$30 Million Overcharge and $12 Million for Extra BA Debt. In other words, the Bank was stating and representing that under the HardcoreFrozen Debt, $30 Million Overcharge was rightly owing by Esquire (and therefore not to be corrected) and that in addition the Bankalso stated and represented that under the Hardcore Frozen Debt, the BA Debt of Esquire to the Bank was not $8 Million but $20 Million,thereby creating an extra $12/13 Million to make up the $201 Million of Sommerfieldâs stated Hardcore Frozen Debt.  SommerfieldâsNote of the Meeting then showed the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦ we then informed the company of the basic principles we wished to observe in a restructuring:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p>1) Hardcore debt was $201M</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>2) All properties were to be sold or refinanced in full by another institution.</p>        </blockquote>        <p>Within these parameters we were willing to be flexible.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a> The statement or representation made by the Bank that under the Hardcore Frozen Debt, $30 Million Overcharge was correctly owingby Esquire to the Bank and that in addition another some $12 Million was also correctly owing in respect of the Extra BA Debt wereclearly deliberate misstatements. The Bank went beyond what was commercially acceptable when it deliberately made misstatement andmisrepresentation. The Bank did not care about truth or legality. It was making its stand on both the $30 Million Overcharge andthe $12 Million BA Extra Debt ($201M).  The Bank did not and could not have a genuine and bona fide belief in the accuracy or correctnessof the statement of the Hardcore Frozen Debt being $201 Million.</p>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a> The Hardcore Frozen Debt of $201 Million of Sommerfield included the $15 Million Interest Overcharge.  In relation to the InterestOvercharge, such statement and representation of $201 Million being the Hardcore Frozen Debt was both deliberately incorrect andwrong and known by the Bank to be so. Sommerfield admitted that he knew it was wrong (Transcript Day 25 page 89).  In the contemporaneousnotes of the Bank, there were repeated written admissions by the Bank that the Bank had overcharged the Hardcore Frozen Account the$15 Million Interest Overcharge [270, 429-431, 435, 484, 496-7, 529]. Even in his Memo dated 16<sup>th</sup> March, Sommerfield said at 513:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â2. Our hardcore figure is inflated by $15M interest charged but not due and owing arising from incorrect entries passed in late1983â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Knowing of the incorrectness of the Interest Overcharge by the Bank, Sommerfield still saw fit to make the statement and representationof the correctness of the $30 Million Overcharge (âour hardcore â¦.. $201M) [509].  In relation to at least the Interest Overcharge,Selway-Swift also admitted in evidence that it was dishonest.  But he not only condoned it, he approved of the misrepresentationso as to provide a basis for the âspecial giveawayâ.</p>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a> The only reason such statement of correctness of $30 Million Overcharge was made was for the purpose of forcing Esquire to agreeto the sale of the Property and âthe carrotâ offered by the Bank was to âforgiveâ this imaginary debt of $30 Million.  TheDemand made was clearly to sell and the pressure/threat used was otherwise the Bank was to maintain that Esquire owed the $30 Millionin the Hardcore Frozen Debt which both the Bank and Esquire knew that Esquire did not owe to the Bank.  It is a paradox of this caseand the devilâs work that âthe stickâ of $30 Million Overcharge is also âthe carrotâ of forgiveness of $30 Million Overcharge.</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a> The morning meeting of 12<sup>th</sup> March was adjourned to enable Esquire to take instructions from Gurdas who was away. But it was adjourned with only breathing spacegiven by Sommerfield to Ratnam, as Sommerfield scheduled the second meeting to be held that same afternoon.  There was no necessityfor such urgency except to apply more pressure. By insisting on the meeting that same afternoon, Sommerfield kept the pressure up.  </p>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a> The second meeting took place the same afternoon of Thursday the 12<sup>th</sup> March with only Ratnam and Oliner attending for Esquire and Carruthers and Sommerfield for the Bank.  Ratnam informed the Bank thatGurdas did not want to sell whereas the Bank not only insisted that the Property must be sold but said no time was to be given, noteven to try to do a re-finance.  When the Esquire team came back after a 15 minute break repeating the Gurdas further instructionsof no sale, the impasse prompted Sommerfield to issue the threat, namely either agreement to sell within 24 hours or else the Bankwould make the full demand on all loans and sell everything and called the Restructuring into default and liquidate Esquire.</p>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a> The evidence of Ratnam at the Trial is that he was shivering in his pants [T7/140] when the threat and Demand were made by Sommerfieldand he was genuinely fearful.  I believe him.  I also believe that the word such as âfinish offâ or âliquidateâ must havebeen used by Sommerfield.  It is totally in keeping with the character of Sommerfield, whose style of business operation was revealedin his contemporaneous Memos.  Ratnam did not know Sommerfield or the Bank or Pullen as we have now come to know them.  Sommerfieldwas there to execute the âroad-mapâ of Pullen and this âroad-mapâ involved unfortunately the creation of a fictional $42Million ($30 Million Overcharge plus $12 Million BA Extra Debt), a fictional $30 Million ($30 Million Overcharge), a fictional $15Million (Interest Overcharge) and linking them with the threat of liquidation on a total of $201 Million Hardcore Frozen Debt statedby the Bank.  The Bank let it be known to Esquire that the Bank was prepared to go through with that threat which I believe, as Ratnamdid, it was not an empty threat.  Sommerfield I find also made the threat about Arjanâs home being taken away.  As Sommerfieldadmitted in his evidence [TRS 16/66], the sale of the Property was the âdeal pointâ and all his pressure and effort at the meetingwas directed towards achieving the âdealâ of Esquire agreeing to sell.  It is to be noticed that the same word âdealâ wasused by Pullen in his manuscript February Lunch Note [503].   </p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a> Sommerfieldâs Note of that 2<sup>nd</sup> Meeting at [519] reads:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â<u>Strategy</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>1) Push the company hard on their one basic principle so that:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>a) Either we obtain agreement to sell</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>b) Or we obtain a better deal going forward with the properties</p>        </blockquote>        <p>2) To push hard we require to escalate by:</p>        <blockquote>            <p>a) Making demand</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>b) âPicking offâ non-core properties, e.g. the Wing On Shop, Arjanâs flat.â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>Making demand is of course referring to making demand for repayment and repayment meant in this context repayment on all debts whichfor the Bank was debt on trading line, the Property Loan, and the $201 Million on the Hardcore Frozen Debt which included the $30Million Overcharge.  That is of course how making demand was understood by Gurdas when Sommerfield referred to it on the 12<sup>th</sup> March and how Sommerfield wanted it to be understood, notwithstanding the admission of Ratnam that Sommerfield did not mention thefigure of $201 Million when he said he would issue the demand. Sommerfield certainly did not at the Meetings and in his telephoneconversation that night with Gurdas confined his threatened demand to any specific debt, such as for example the Property Loan. Thiswould defeat the whole purpose of the exercise as he was there to secure the agreement to sell and it was only by the threat of $30Million Overcharge which he was using as âthe stickâ that he could maximize his pressure. To refer to $201 Million for HardcoreFrozen Debt and then to switch to a threatened demand confined to the Property Loan would make no sense. Further, in the contextof threatened liquidation and finish off of Esquire as uttered by Sommerfield (which I find established as a fact), a threat of ademand for a limited sum (a fraction of the total amounts outstanding) was not what was understood at that time by Esquire (in particularby Gurdas) or what was said and conveyed by Sommerfield. The Bank could of course stagger the demands just as it could stagger theproperties it would repossess as indicated in the Arajan flat boast of Sommerfieldâs Handover Instructions. But the threat madeby Sommerfield and understood by Esquire was that demands were to cover all loans.  For me this scenario which Mr. Fok painted ofSommerfieldâs threatened demand confined to only the Property Loan is not real. In my assessment, Sommerfield was a master in whathe did. He used the word âescalateâ in this Memo. It is the vocabulary of someone who had thought hard about pressure and wasprepared to maximize pressure until the demand to sell was met. I have no doubt, despite the repeated protestation of no wrong-doingby Sommerfield, that he did apply the illegitimate pressure alleged by Esquire, knowing that he was not justified in relying on thefigure of $201 Million Hardcore Frozen Debt (which included the $30 Million Overcharge) and with knowledge that with such unfairpressure, Gurdas will eventually succumb which was what happened.</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a> The Note of Sommerfield of that 2<sup>nd</sup> Meeting showed that there were many stops to that meeting, first when Ratnam and Oliner left the room for 15 minutes and then 20minutes after the meeting ended Ratnam asked Sommerfield to return to ask for grace period until Monday as they were not sure ifthey could contact Gurdas within the 24 hours allowed by Sommerfield. Sommerfieldâs reply shows the quality of the man and theway he could turn the screw tighter and tighter.  He said he would issue the demand (for repayment) tomorrow (meaning Friday 13<sup>th</sup>) but would take no further action (meaning liquidation) until Monday the 16<sup>th</sup>. This arrangement gave the company time to contact Gurdas while the Bank âloaded our gunâ in the language of Sommerfield. Themethodical way that Sommerfield turned a lie of the $201 Million Hardcore owing ($30 Million Overcharge plus $12 Million BA ExtraDebt) into a threat of liquidation based on those debts was calculated to have the maximum psychological effect and when coupledwith the 24 hours deadline in the absence of Gurdas caused not only panic in the hearts of Ratnam and Gurdas but such fear that compelledRatnam and Gurdas not even to wait until the next morning to respond to the final threat of Sommerfield.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a> That same Thursday night of the 12<sup>th</sup> March Ratnam telephoned Sommerfield at 10 p.m. to inform him that Gurdas would agree to sell. Gurda telephoned Sommerfield from Indialate that night and at the end of that long telephone conversation with Sommerfield, after resistance failed, agreed to sell.  Sommerfieldliked to underplay that telephone call with Gurdas (both in his Night Calls Note and in his evidence) but I believe what Gurdas saidabout the call and it must have been an unpleasant call. It is to be noticed that the capitulation was total as there was not evenany attempt by Gurdas in his telephone call to negotiate the amount of the forgiveness of the $42 Million which the Bank said wasstill due.     </p>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a> It is only through careful analysis which I have attempted to carry out above, that the very high quality of the pressure appliedcan be fully understood and appreciated. It was the devilâs work and commands what I can only call awe and horror for the totallack of morality or legality. It was pressure calculated to achieve not only the objective of Gurdas agreeing to sell but also theobjective of the Bank giving the least away (per Pullen). Imagine what would have happened if Sommerfield was honest with Esquireand acknowledged that the total Hardcore Frozen Debt including the BA Debt was $159 Million and that the Bank wanted Esquire to sellthe Property.  It is perfectly possible then Esquire would refuse to sell or would require, if pressure of liquidation is applied,a forgiveness by the Bank of say $15 Million to $25 Million (say combination of front-end and back-end) from the $159 Million HardcoreFrozen Debt. The difference in the outcome even if Esquire agreed to sell would have been very different but Sommerfield would thenbe doing it the legitimate way with fair commercial pressure.  But that would be outside the road-map of Pullen.</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a> It was argued by Mr. Fok that the Bank in any event had the right both under the Mortgage and the Restructuring Agreements to sellthe Property and that therefore either no economic duress was applied or that even if it was applied it has no consequence.  I haveconsiderable doubt that the Bank had on the 12<sup>th</sup> March 1987 an absolute right to sell the Property without reference to the other Lenders.  If the other banks had been properly informedI believe that the Bank would find it very difficult to carry out the sale in the manner it did to Bethlehem.  But assuming thatthe Bank did have such a right to sell, the important part to remember is that the Bank for good reason preferred not to use thatright but instead wished to persuade Esquire to agree to sell and the Bank had been thinking long and hard about how to âconvinceâGurdas to agree to sell.  As Sommerfield said in his Memo dated 16<sup>th</sup> March [512], there were only two options open to the Bank, Bank enter into possession and sell as mortgagee or Bank persuade Esquireto sell.  A sale by a mortgagee is a forced sale and would always be less attractive to a buyer and generally speaking would alsofetch a lower price as well as much more fraught with problems. All the internal Bank memoranda in 1985 and 1986 about persuadingEsquire to sell suggest that the Bank preferred that Esquire agreed to a sale. That is why the Bankâs senior officers went to somuch trouble from late 1986 onwards to plan this âConvinceâ Guardas to sell.  I therefore reject any notion that because theBank had the power of sale under the Mortgage therefore it did not use economic duress.</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a> If the Bank did use economic duress, then notwithstanding that it also had the right to sell under the Mortgage (but did not exerciseit), there must be a liability in law for such economic duress.  What the Bank and Sommerfield did was in my view, way outside whatwas permissible or ordinary commercial pressure.  It was wrongful, inequitable, against the conscience and not bona fide.  It waswhat in chancery court called fraud or equitable fraud and this was particularly objectionable when Esquire was under the Bankâsprotection and care, being in a vulnerable position.  This is where the Court of equity would always extend its protection to preventabuse by an oppressor and when the oppressor is as high as the Bank, the necessity for protection is more, not less. </p>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a> What Sommerfield did was to follow a policy of CCD headed by Selfway-Swift who was well aware of what was being done as he had admittedin his Interrogatory [1/268] but unfortunately which he seemed to forget when he was giving oral evidence. The misrepresentationin relation to the $30 Million Overcharge Threat was part of a larger pattern of standard of behaviour of CCD.  Selway-Swift saidthat it was acceptable and almost everyday practice for banker to make misrepresentations to fellow bankers. I do not accept thatis factually correct. For me the statement is so outrageous that I will not accept it unless a large number of bankers in Hong Kongswear to me (which I believe is unlikely ever to happen) that this is so and even then, this does not make it right.  Bankers likeall professionals are supposed to hold to certain standards.  They are likely to be breaking the law, if they make deliberate misstatements,whether to fellow bankers or to customers or to third parties. To customers, it is even worse, for reasons too obvious to elaborate.I believe that this aspect of the evidence of Selway-Swift is the maverick statement of a banker and all the more regrettable comingfrom a former senior banker. This is exactly the sort of conduct which is answered by the expression âagainst the conscienceâof the court. The Courtâs duty in such circumstances, is to ensure that no victim of such conduct will go away without remedy.</p>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a> It was argued by Mr. Fok that the Bank was entitled to make demand on the trading line or the Property loan and that was what causedfear in the heart of Esquire and made Esquire agreed to the sale. But that was not what happened. The Bank did not confine itselfonly to a threat of cutting the trading line or making demand only on the Property loan. The Bank relied on the $201 Million HardcoreFrozen Debt knowing how unfair and outrageous it was and knowing that was how it was perceived by Esquire. This is what made pressureworse in the sense discussed by Mance J. in the <i>Huyton</i> case and made the pressure more illegitimate.   </p>    <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a> It was also argued by Mr. Fok that the lack of protest and the positive steps taken by Esquire, after the March Meetings and agreementto sell suggests that there was no illegitimate pressure. Strictly it is not entirely accurate to say that Esquire did not protest.The file note of Robertson dated 24<sup>th</sup> November 1988 certainly indicated that Gurdas âwhinedâ about the Bank âforcingâ him to sell [834]. Furthermore, the so-calledno protest or positive actions seems to ignore the reality of the wholly vulnerable position Esquire was in. The Bank had shown itshand in what it was capable of doing. Esquire was dependent on the Bank both for continued restructuring as well as for continuedgranting of trading line.  Esquire was in no position to protest on the illegitimate sale forced upon Esquire or hoped to achieveanything by protesting at that stage. It was after all still under the influence and control of the Bank. It was dependent on theBank for the continued support in many ways, including  the continuation of trading lines and the entering into renewed restructuringin 1987 and in 1988.  Sommerfield said of the sale âthe method and price of which are to be dictated byâ the Bank.  The Bankdid dictate totally and completely the sale.</p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a> In fact, subsequent events showed the risk involved in protest.  In 1994 as soon as Esquire raised with Emily Lau the propriety ofthe sale to the Ho Family, the Bank took action to demand repayment of all loans which was then followed by liquidation of Esquire. The reprisal by the Bank was swift and deadly. The Bank demonstrated that Esquire lived at âthe graceâ of the Bank.  I thereforedo not regard any lack of protest as indication that there was no economic duress.  In fact, the silence in the circumstances couldbe said to strengthen the case of economic duress. I therefore conclude that on the 1<sup>st</sup> Requirement that illegitimate pressure amounting to compulsion was applied by the Bank, which led to the sale of the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a> As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Requirement of Economic Duress, I am of the judgment, having regard to the fact that Gurdas resisted for a long time Bankâs wishto have the Property sold) that but for the illegitimate pressure, Esquire would not have agreed to the sale of the Property. Mr.Fok however argued that it was really the threat of the Bank that it would exercise its power of sale as mortgagee which caused Gurdasto agree to the sale and not the pressure or threat relating to the $30 Million Overcharge. But in my view, this was not really whathappened. I do not accept after the Bank had tried for so long that the agreement of sale was achieved merely by the Bank threateningthat it would use its power of sale as mortgagee. The Bank always had that power and could require Gurdas to agree to sell by threateningto use that power of the mortgagee and this was well known to Gurdas.  The Bank chose for a long time not to use that route for anumber of reasons. In my view, although at the back of the mind of everyone in the March meetings that this would be the nuclearweapon which the Bank could employ, what caused the resistance of Gurdas to crumble was the unreasonable, intimidating and deliberatelycapricious manner of Sommerfieldâs illegitimate pressure, namely the $30 Million Overcharge Threat.</p>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a> If the March Meetings had taken a different form, with the Bank coming out openly that there was at least no $15 Million InterestOvercharge but the Bank still wanted a sale and with a threat of using the power of Mortgagee, I am not sure that the outcome wouldbe the same. There would certainly be no same night surrender. In my view, what has substantially caused even someone as robust asGurdas (not the mild Ratnam, the employee in this context) to crumble is to see the Bank in the position of Sommerfield taking upthe extreme, unreasonable and intimidatingly capricious position of insisting on $15 Million Interest Overcharge.  Mr. Fok submittedthat there was no evidence or cogent evidence that the $30 Million Overcharge was causative of the surrender.  The evidence of Gurdaswhich I accept contradicts that submission. Mr. Gurdas on Day 9 at Transcript page 111 after the purported admission relied uponby Mr. Fok in his final submission at line 15-16, then said the following (line 17-25):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âQ. That is why the $30 Million discrepancy had absolutely nothing to do with your decision to write that letter on 21<sup>st</sup> March 1987?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>A. No. It is a combination of two. Do not take words from my mouth. As I have said, it is true that I was on the floor, I could notunderstand the $30 million, whether l owed them or not. The problem is did I owe the bank $30 million? I did not know that.  DidI know it in 1994, I did not know. Did I know now? After discovery I was trying to figure out where is the mistake.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Notwithstanding the very firm submissions on this made to me by the Bank, I am satisfied that the illegitimate pressure applied bythe Bank was a significant cause of Esquireâs agreement to sell the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a> The 3<sup>rd</sup> Requirement of Economic Duress is that the illegitimate pressure applied did not give the innocent party any real choice. Again thefacts speak for themselves.  In the controlled and protected position of Esquire and given the deadline of 24 hours, there was reallynothing Esquire could do but to surrender.  There was no realistic possibility of finding an alternative finance to take over fromthe Bank.  Sommerfield had played his cards so well that all exits were blocked and there was no realistic alternative open to Esquireexcept to agree to the demand of the Bank.  In this respect, I do not regard liquidation as an acceptable alternative for Esquire.It is like accepting the bullet in the case of duress of person.</p>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a> For all the above reasons, I am of the judgment that economic duress by the Bank has been established.</p>    <p class="heading">Waiver of Economic Duress</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a> Earlier I have given my reasons why the contractual waiver and release term did not provide any defence to the claim of Esquire inbreach of fiduciary duty.  In my view, the contractual waiver and release term equally provides no defence to the claim in EconomicDuress.  Economic Duress or any breach of duty is nowhere referred to in the Waiver clause and it would indeed be against all principle,to construe the Waiver Clause as being sufficiently wide to cover the claim in Economic Duress.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a> Equally there was no representation in the Waiver Clause that Esquire would not make any claim for Economic Duress in compellingEsquire to sell the Property.  There could be no basis for any estoppel. </p>    <p class="heading">Is Economic Duress a Cause of Action other than Tort and is it time barred (if tort)</p>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a> It is clear having carefully re-read the papers and in particular the Opening Skeleton of Mr. Fok and Mr. Fung dated 19<sup>th</sup> February 2004 (where there was only reference to limitation in relation to Fiduciary Duty and in relation to economic duress beinga tort) and the Final Skeleton Argument of Mr. Fok and Mr. Fung dated 5<sup>th</sup> March 2004 (limitation defence confined to economic duress if tort, para. 9 and para. 120) that the limitation defence of the Defendantin respect of the claim for Economic Duress was limited to the defence that if it was a tort such cause of action in tort was barredunder section 4(1) of the Ordinance.</p>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a> The way that the limitation defence was run gave rise to the three related questions under this Heading.  The three questions are:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Does economic duress give rise to a cause of action;</p>        <p>(2) If it does, is it limited to the cause of action in tort;</p>        <p>(3) If it is only a cause of action in tort, is it time barred under section 4(1) of the Ordinance.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>There is no disagreement between the parties that if economic duress is only a tort, then it is time barred under section 4(1) ofthe Ordinance. The real question is whether economic duress is anything other than tort or in the words of Mr. Fok, does it giverise to any cause of action at all.  Question (2) if properly answered will also cover Question (1).</p>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a> What then is economic duress and what causes of action does it give rise to?  In the leading text book <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 18<sup>th</sup> edition, the Contents page shows that there was Chapter 24 on Economic Torts but it only includes Intimation and not economic duress.There was in fact no specific section in <i>Clerk and Linsell</i> dealing with economic duress.  In <i>Halsburyâs Laws of England</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> edition, economic duress is considered under the heading of Restitution in Volume 40(2) and not in the volume under Tort. </p>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a> There is of course no dispute that duress in its very early days was a creation of common law although very limited in its scope,which explains the remarks of many judges in many of the cited cases referring to âduress at common lawâ (e,g. per Lord Hoffmanin <i>Attorney-General v R</i>).</p>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a> What is important is whether the early form of duress when it subsequently became economic duress took on a different colour andif so what colour. The origin of how the court came to give remedy for duress is illuminating in informing us of what is the realnature of economic duress.  In <i>Barton v Armstrong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20AC%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] A.C. 104</a>, Lord Cross said this at page 118D-Eâ:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThe scope of common law duress was very limited and at a comparatively early date equity began to grant relief in cases where thedisposition in question had been procured by the exercise of pressure which theChancellor considered to be illegitimate â althoughit did not amount to common law duress. There was a parallel development in the field of dispositions induced by fraud. At commonlaw the only remedy available to the man defrauded was an action for deceit but equity in the same period in which it was buildingup the doctrine of âundue influenceâ came to entertain proceedings to set aside dispositions which had been obtained by fraud,There is obviously analogy between the setting aside of a disposition for duress or undue influence and setting it aside for fraud.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a> It has been well recognized that suits for remedy arising out of duress had been entertained by the equity jurisdiction.  <i>Meager Gummow &amp; Lehane on Equity</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> edition said this at page 5:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThe equitable jurisdiction, of enormous importance, comprised: (i) the recognition, protection and development of uses and trustsâ¦(ii) the enforcement of contract on principles unknown to common law â¦  (iii) interference with the rigidity of the law in caseswhere the presence of fraud, forgery or duress would render the enforcement of strict legal rights unconscionable.â  </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a> In <i>Barton v Armstrong</i>, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon said this at page 121D:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â.. in life, including the life of commerce and finance, many acts are done under pressure, sometimes overwhelming pressure, sothat one can say that the actor had no choice but to act.  Absence of choice in this sense does not negate consent in law: for thisthe pressure must be one of a kind which the law does not regard as legitimate.  Thus, out of the various means by which consentmay be obtained - advice, persuasion, influence, inducement, representation, commercial pressure â the law has come to select somewhich it will not accept as a reason for voluntary action: fraud, abuse of relation of confidence, undue influence, duress or coercion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The juxtaposition of fraud, abuse of relation of confidence, undue influence, duress or coercion suggest that these are all mattersenjoying the protection of the equity court or rather which the equity court generally considers as various species of fraud knownto equity. </p>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a> Lord Goff in <i>The Evia Luck</i> at page 169B referred to:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âconduct does not have to be tortuous to constitute duress â¦ this is so even at common law, and still more so if one has regardto the equitable doctrine of undue influence as an extended form of duress â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a> Professor Cope in his book on Duress, Undue Influence and Unconscionable Bargains even suggested at page 61 thus:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThus it is apparent that duress now consists of coercion of anotherâs will exercised by means of a wrongful act or threat.  Theprinciples that the courts are applying in relation to these claims do not differ in any respects from those applied by equity incases which belong to what is referred to as the first class of undue influence.  The discussion of this class of undue influencein the next chapter will strive to make this apparent.  There is therefore good reason for subsuming all of the duress cases underthe heading of the first class of undue influence and in so doing the old common law kinds of duress such as threats to the personwould constitute but an extreme example of an actual exercise of undue influence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Professor Phang in a learned 2003 article in the Restitutional Law Review made a similar suggestion.  Professor Birks in his article<i>âOn the Nature of Undue Influenceâ</i> in Beatson &amp; Friedmann on Good Faith and Fault in Contract Law, however argued that undue influence should be subsumed and treatedas duress.  The difference between duress and undue influence was in fact explained in <i>Mutual Finance Ltd. v Wetton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%202%20KB%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 2 K.B. 389.</a>  The diversity of academic views simply highlights the closeness of the two rules, economic duress and undue influence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a> In <i>Royal Bank of Scotland v.

Indeed in this case, it might well be possible for Esquire to argue that the proceeds of sale of the Property which the Defendantpocketed was money had and received of the Plaintiff which is recoverable in restitution.  That is of course a matter to be decidedwhen it comes to Remedies and Reliefs. What is indisputable is that economic duress is now a permanent feature on the landscape ofrestitution and equity.  This being the case, the argument of the Bank seems to be that either economic duress, if anything at all,gives rise <u>exclusively</u> to a cause of action in tort or alternatively that economic duress gives rise to no cause of action and therefore being incapableto be the subject matter of any remedy.</p>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a> So far as the second possible argument is concerned, I will say that it is not tenable today in 2005, having regard to the developmentof the law and I will dignify such argument if any, with the following quotation from the judgment of Eveleigh J in <i>B &amp; S Contracts and Design Ltd. v Victor Green Publications Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20ICR%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] ICR 419</a> at page 423-4:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âIt is not necessary to consider precisely the meaning of the word âlegitimateâ in that context.

In <i>The Universal Sentinel</i>, Lord Diplock recognized that economic duress was not a tort per se.  He said at page 385B:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âThe use of economic duress to induce another person to part with property or money is not a tort per se, the form that the duresstake may, or may not be tortious.  The remedy to which economic duress gives rise is not an action for damages but an action forrestitution of property or money exacted under such duress and the avoidance of any contract that had been induced by it; but wherethe particular form taken by the economic duress used is itself a tort, the restitutional remedy for money had and received by thedefendant to the plaintiffâs use is one which the plaintiff is entitled to pursue as an alternative remedy to an action for damagesin tort.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Lord Scarman however held that economic duress was actionable as a tort, if it caused damage or loss [400]. </p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a> In <i>The Evia Luck</i>, Lord Goff said this:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦ But once, the contract was avoided, the money paid under it was recoverable in restitution, on the ground either of duressor possibly of failure of consideration.  It was not, in my opinion, necessary for the owners, even if the duress relied upon bythem was in fact tortious, to base their claim on waiver of tort, nor have they done soâ¦.â  </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a> It seems to me therefore that even if a conduct might be tortuous, the claim made for relief arising out of economic duress doesnot have to be necessarily framed in tort and often is not.  I have earlier come to the conclusion that I found established economicduress. The Remedies and Reliefs arising out of this still has to be determined.  It is not my understanding that the claim of EconomicDuress in this Action was made in tort.  Even if some of conduct of the Bank was tortuous, there was also a breach of duty in theform of Economic Duress, for which the Court has the power and the duty to grant the appropriate Remedy, not based on tort. I findthat there is no substance in this defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:center"><b>UNDUE INFLUENCE</b></p>    <p class="heading">The Law on Undue Influence</p>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a> Going to first principles:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âundue influence is one of the grounds of relief developed by courts of equity as a court of conscience.

I start first with the what has alwaysbeen accepted and emphasized in <i>Goldworthy v Brickell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20Ch%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 Ch 378</a> at 405 that relation of banker and customer is not one which ordinarily gives rise to the presumption of undue influence.  But thisis not a case of presumption of undue influence.  This is a case of actual undue influence and for that it is necessary to go tothe particular relationship and the actions of the Bank on Esquire. Unlike economic duress where the events could be confined toa narrow compass around the 12<sup>th</sup> March, the claim of undue influence covered a longer period, from an earlier time and extended to beyond 12<sup>th</sup> March, beyond the 14<sup>th</sup> April when the Power of Attorney was signed, and extended all the way up to the actual sale taking place as all the events duringthat period throw light on whether actual undue influence was exercised by the Bank. </p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a> To understand what led to the sale taking place, it is first necessary to examine in somewhat greater detail of what the Bank wasdoing when Esquire debts were required to be restructured.  The Bank had overlent to Esquire and the security in the hands of Esquirewas obviously insufficient to cover the outstanding loans. Restructuring was agreed amongst the bank creditors so that given time,some of the debts of Esquire could be repaid (by Esquire earning profits from its trading) and the value of the securities couldimprove with the recovery of the property market.  This was preferable to all the banks than taking the pain of liquidation at thattime when everything was down.  The reason why the Bank extended trading line to Esquire during the Restructuring is for purely selfishreason, namely firstly so that Esquire could earn profits from which repayment of debts could be made and secondly so that the Bankcould also make profit from the facilities given under the trading lines. This in fact happened, at least during certain periodsof the Restructuring. But the price Esquire had to pay for the Restructuring was a total loss of freedom.  The Lead Bank was theDoctor in total control and the further watch-dog employed was the Controller Peats (subsequently Arthur Young).</p>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a> From the Bankâs perspective, it had to salvage itself from a horrible position.  First, the Bank was not willing to take a hugehit at one go by pushing Esquire to immediate liquidation in 1983 and that is why the Bank agreed to the Restructuring. The Banktherefore required time to make provisions for the debt of Esquire which was likely to be unrecoverable, namely the Hardcore FrozenDebt. (Apparently, provisions was made by the Bank in the sum of $40 Million at end of 1985, $50 Million in mid 1986 and furtherprovisions later [357])  Secondly, the Bank needed time for the property market to recover so that the value of the securities couldrise sufficiently to enable realization of sufficient high values at least relative to the loans outstanding.  This is the reasonwhy the Bank did reject possible sales in 1984 and 1985.  By late 1986 when the market has started seriously to recover that wasalso the time when the Bank pushed hard for sale.  Thirdly, the Bank relied upon the trading of Esquire to generate profits bothto enable some repayments to be made but also to generate to the Bank the banking profits from the trading lines being granted oncommercial terms (namely Bank was earning very good money on the interests from the trading lines). Fourthly, the Bank must ensurethat a constant monitoring was taking place so that Esquire was made to work hard to earn trading profits and to create banking profitsfor the Bank and so that Esquire would not get into trouble on the trading.  The property side also had to be looked at constantlyboth in terms of valuations and possible sales as well as on the current property income and expenditure. Fifthly, the Bank musthave a system of control and supervision so that Esquire could be constantly put in line and be told what to do and this is wherethe CCD came in. Patients under CCD care must behave and the documentation from 1984 to 1987 clearly show how time and again CCDhad dictated to Esquire what to do and what not to do.  In the period when there was much shared control between Mongkok Branch andCCD, Bankâs control at times might not be not so tight. But when CCD persuaded the top in mid 1986 to allow CCD to be the exclusivecentral control (per Pullen Memo of 28<sup>th</sup> May 1986 [367-8]) and that combined with the Sommerfield assuming his job at the CCD in or around September/October 1986, the picturechanged radically. With Sommerfield as the Account Manager, CCD in direct charge and with Pullen giving directions in the backgroundin CCD, the control and supervision of Esquire took on a different dimension and it was total and complete. It is against this backgroundof the Bankâs tight control and Esquireâs total dependence on the Bank that one can now examine the question of Actual UndueInfluence.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Bankâs Capacity to Influence</u></p>    <p><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a> My earlier account of the superior position of the Bank made it clear that the Bank in the context of Hong Kong and vis-Ã -vis Esquirewas almost god-like.  It was not only the premier bank in Hong Kong, it was not only the banker for a long time of Esquire, it wasthe Lead Bank in the Restructuring and therefore it had the power of financial life and death over Esquire.  I have no doubt, thatthe Bank did have the capacity to influence.  I would go further.  In my view, the Bank also had the capacity in the circumstancesto dominate Esquire.  Ratnam described how every cheque of Esquire had to be endorsed by the Bank. Selway-Swift described the âstraightday to day controlâ of the Bank [357].  The Bank immediately put down any attempt of Esquire not to sign the Power of Attorney. Events show that Esquire was dependent on the Bank and time and again had to rely on the Bank to do the right thing by its patient/customer. What Esquire did not know is that confidence in the Bank was misplayed and that the Bank not only had no qualm about deceiving itscustomer such as Esquire but also had no qualm about deceiving its fellow banks in the Restructuring, to whom it also owed differentfiduciary duties. The examples of the Bank instructing Esquire not to tell the other banks about the threat (ârecent negotiations)and telling the other Banks about buyout at 20% (instead of 36%) and under what is called âthe Robertson letter disputeâ [802,816 and evidence of Selway-Swfit/Transcript Day 18] misrepresenting to the other banks on the January 1988 Restructuring that therewas no $30 Million write-off (which is untrue), all these simply illustrate the extent that the Bank could dictate to Esquire whatto say or not to say or what to do or not to do.  I hold that the Bank did have the capacity to influence.  </p>    <p class="heading"><u>Was Influence Exercised</u></p>    <p><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a> In the previous analysis of the facts relating to Economic Duress I described the events leading up to the fateful telephone callsthe evening of 12<sup>th</sup> March when Esquire surrendered to the demand of the Bank.  In another part of the Judgment relating to Breach of Fiduciary Duty,I also analyzed the events leading up from the meeting of the 16<sup>th</sup> March (the Monday after the Thursday night calls) up to the actual Sale of the Property.  These events and the documents placed beforethe Court show repeatedly, clearly and methodically how the Bank controlled, directed and required Esquire to do what the Bank desired.</p>    <p><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a> The use of the euphemistic word âConvinceâ by Pullen in his handwritten note on [484] is one of the many indications that theBank was exerting its maximum to influence Esquire in the sale desired.  The case of the Plaintiff is of course that the Bank wentbeyond mere persuasion but resorted to economic duress. This is not a case where a transaction carried out apparently without resistancesuch as gift to charity was impeached.  This is a case where the transaction was carried out with resistance and is now being impeached.There is no doubt that the Bank exercised influence (in addition to overt illegitimate pressure).        </p>    <p><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a> For me one of the most convincing manifestation of actual undue influence was how the Bank could impose upon Esquire to sign thePower of Attorney and gave to the Bank carte blanche to enable the Bank to dictate the sale absolutely and in such a way that enabledthe Bank to keep Esquire ignorant afterwards that the sale effected in Esquireâs name by the Bank was a sale to the Bankâs partnerand in undue haste.  I hold therefore that Influence was used by the Bank on Esquire.</p>    <p class="heading"><u>Was Influence Undue</u></p>    <p><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a> The critical question on claim of actual Undue Influence is whether the influence was Undue. Unfortunately, there is very littleanalysis or discussion in the decided case or even in the textbook as to what is meant by Undue and what is the scope of Undue. Undueis the opposite of due. Due means proper, appropriate or what ought to be done.  Undue suggests improper, inappropriate, or whatought not to be done and these are all qualities in equity relating to use of undue influence which is against the conscience ofthe court.</p>    <p><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a> As I see it what, equity as a court of conscience, seeks to protect is the abuse of relationship where one party has the capacityto influence the other party to enter into a transaction which is not the result of free exercise of independent and informed judgmentand in situation where the transaction is not what the other party wanted to do but did it unwillingly and because of the dominantparty. The essence of Undue Influence is the unfair exploitation of the ascendancy in the language of Lord Hoffman in <i>Attorney-General v R</i>.  Once ascendancy is established, the key words are unfair exploitation.</p>    <p><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a> Was there exploitation and was it unfair. Unfairness generally comes with exploitation and what therefore it is necessary in my judgmentto concentrate on is whether in influencing or âconvincingâ Esquire to sell, there was unfair exploitation by the Bank over itsascendancy so that the actual agreement to sell was secured by an inequitable means.</p>    <p><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a> Another way of looking at it is to ask, as said by Lindley in the famous <i>Allcard</i> case, was there some unfair and improper conduct, some coercion from outside, some overreaching, some form of cheating.                                  </p>    <p><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a> A review of the events from mid 1986 up to the actual date of sale will undoubtedly show that the Bank, taking advantage of its ascendancyand dominion over Esquire, by unfair and improper means, coercive and overreaching and deceiving, secured the sale of the Property. Misrepresentations were made by the Bank.  Lies were told by the Bank.  Threats were uttered by the Bank.  Unilateral actions weretaken by the Bank.  In fact the Bank was aware of the impropriety of what it was doing and that is why the Bank asked Esquire totell the other banks, if asked, an untruth namely that it was Esquire itself which wanted to sell and not to tell the other banksabout âthe recent negotiationsâ which is of course Sommerfield euphemism for the threats forcing Esquire to sell. (see letterdated 27<sup>th</sup> March 1987 [562] from Sommerfield to Esquire at paragraph âd)â).  In my mind, there is no question that the actions of the Bankwere Undue or that the Influence it exercised was Undue.  The Conscience of Court of Equity is aroused by the Undue Influence ofthe Bank.    </p>    <p class="heading"><u>Did Exercise of Undue Influence bring about the Sale</u></p>    <p><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a> This is not a case where there might be any doubt as to whether it was the Undue Influence which was the significant cause of thetransaction.  Without the Undue Influence, there would be no sale of the Property.</p>    <p><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a> I am therefore satisfied that on the totality of the evidence, much of which is not even capable of being challenged, notwithstandingthat there was the banker and customer relationship, the Bank exercised Undue Influence on Esquire, the patient under its care therebycausing the Property belonging to Esquire to be sold.</p>    <p class="heading">Is Undue Influence a Cause of Action</p>    <p><a name="p237" class="para" id="p237">237.</a> The challenge by the Bank to Undue influence not being a cause of action is half-hearted.  No authority was cited in support.  Undueinfluence lies at the heart of the equitable jurisdiction of the court and because it is considered a species of fraud, setting asideof transaction was a matter of right and when such is not possible, then question of remedy has to be carefully considered.  Remedyfor Undue Influence is yet to be decided.  But I do not understand how it could be said that proven exercise of Undue Influence couldnot give rise to a cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a> If authority is required, I look no further than to firstly Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Pitt</i> where he said at page 208H:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦ disadvantage had to be shown, not as a constituent element of the cause of action for undue influence, but in order to raisea presumption of undue influence â¦..â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>and then to Lord Nicholls in <i>Etridge</i> at page 796A:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>ââ¦.. your Lordshipsâs House decided that in cases of undue influence disadvantage is not a necessary ingredient of the causeof action.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>There is no merit in this argument of the Bank. </p>    <p class="heading">Waiver of Undue Influence</p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a> The last defence of Waiver of Undue Influence can similarly be briefly dismissed.  I have said earlier in relation to both Breachof Fiduciary Duty and to Economic Duress that the Waiver Clause provides no defence to these claims.  By the same reasoning, I amalso of the view that the Waiver Clause provides no defence to the claim in Undue Influence. </p>    <p class="heading">Undue Influence â Limitation</p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a> Finally, for the sake of completeness and to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I also like to state under the part of my Judgmentdealing with Undue Influence, that in my view the case presented to me at the Trial by the Defendant did not rely on a defence ofstatutory limitation in respect of undue influence.  That this was so, was made clear:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) in the Outline of Defendantâs Opening Submissions of Mr. Fok and Mr. Fung dated 19<sup>th</sup> February 2004 where there was reference to statutory limitation in relation to fiduciary duty and in relation to economic duressbeing a tort but no reliance on statutory limitation in respect of Undue Influence (para. 111) and;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(2) in the Outline of Defendantâs Closing Submissions of Mr. Fok and Mr. Fung dated 5<sup>th</sup> March 2004, again statutory limitation defence was confined to fiduciary duty (para 9 and para. 121) and to economic duress if tort(para. 9 and para. 120) and there was no reference to statutory limitation defence in respect of Undue Influence (para 9 and 119-121).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a> As result of my misunderstanding, confusion was caused by questions being asked by the Court on statutory limitation on Undue Influence. In fact statutory limitation did not arise, as the case of the Bank ran at the Trial was not based on Undue Influence being barredby statutory limitation.      </p>    <p style="text-align:center"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></p>    <p><a name="p242" class="para" id="p242">242.</a> The conclusion reached by this Court on the Trial of Liability is that the Court is satisfied that liability has been establishedby Esquire against the Bank for its claim in respect of (1) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (2) Economic Duress and (3) Undue Influence.</p>    <p><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a> There must therefore be a Trial on Remedies and Reliefs.  I  direct that the parties do, within 3 weeks of the Handing Down of thisJudgment, make arrange for a hearing after the Summer Vacation when directions would be given on the further steps to be taken leadingto the Trial on Remedies and Reliefs including the extent that Management should take part in such Trial.     At that hearing, theparties can also address the Court if necessary on the matter of costs, the precise order to be made against Management and the questionof deferring any appeal from this Judgment until after the Trial on Remedies and Reliefs.  </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(William Waung)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Martin Lee SC, Mr Erik Shum, Mr Paul Harris and Mr Jeremy Chan, instructed by Messrs Ho Tse Wai &amp; Partners, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Joseph Fok SC and Mr Eugene Fung, instructed by Messrs Johnson Stokes &amp; Master, for the Defendants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>    <appeal>Appeal allowed:see CACV312/2005 dated 12 October 2006</appeal>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2005/573.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
