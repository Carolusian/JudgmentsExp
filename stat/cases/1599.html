The court will not even improvethe contract which the parties have made for themselves, however desirable the improvement might be.  The courtâs function is tointerpret and apply the contract which the parties have made for themselves.  If the express terms are perfectly clear and free fromambiguity, there is no choice to be made between different possible meanings: the clear terms must be applied even if the court thinkssome other terms would have been more suitable.  An unexpressed term can be implied if and only if the court finds that the partiesmust have intended that term to form part of their contract: it is not enough for the court to find that such a term would have beenadopted by the parties as reasonable men if it had been suggested to them: it must have been a term that went without saying, a term<i>necessary</i> to give business efficacy to the contract, a term which, though tacit, formed part of the contract which the parties made for themselves.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Some guidance can also be derived from the observations of Staughton LJ at page 3 of <i>Scottish Power Plc v.

If that was the ground of their decision,it appears to me to be contrary to the decision of this Court in the case of <i>Underwood, Son &amp; Pipe v. Lewis</i> <i>(1)</i>, in which it was held that the retainer of a solicitor in a common law action gives rise to one entire contract for the conduct ofthe action to its termination, and the solicitor cannot in the midst of the action throw up his retainer and sue for his costs alreadyincurred except in certain cases referred to in the judgment in that case.  The question here is whether in a case where a partnershipfirm employs a solicitor to conduct a common law action for them in the ordinary way, namely, on the footing that his contract isan entire contract to conduct it to the end, it is open to the partners to dissolve partnership inter se, and then to say that theaction was after that date no longer being conducted by the solicitor on their behalf.  It is no doubt open to a client whilst theaction is pending to withdraw the solicitorâs retainer.  I think, though it is not necessary to decide the point, that the dormantpartners might upon the dissolution have given notice to the plaintiff that he was no longer to conduct the action on their behalf,and that, if they had done so, they would not have been liable.  But in this case no such notice was given.

So, what is the position as to the termination of retainer where there is no entire contract?  The view expressedin <i>Cordery on Solicitors</i>, 5<sup>th </sup>ed. (1961), p. 96, is that in such a case one of the ways in which a retainer may be determined, without giving rise to a breach ofcontract, is âby discharge by the client <u>in the absence of any agreement to the contrary</u>,â, and that, among other things, would cover the case, for examples, where a solicitor had been employed to act in certain mattersfor some particular fixed period of time, for one year or any given period; and I refer to Sir Thomas Lundâs article on solicitorsin 36 Halsburyâs Laws of England, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (1961) p. 69, para. 98, where he is considering the period of retainer, and the view there expressed is ââ¦ that a term willalso be implied enabling the client to withdraw the retainer at any time,â and authorities are quoted in a footnote, all of which,I think, have been referred to by counsel.

Therewas amongst other considerations a risk that purchasers of the flats may not instruct his firm and instruct their own solicitors. In addition to this, there was also the risk that if the flats were not all taken up by purchasers and HA was required to take themback after the 20-month period referred to in the scheme, they may use their own in-house lawyers for the purchase which may resultin the plaintiff getting very little in the way of fees.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Mr Edward Chan also argued that the cases dealing with the rights of clients to terminate a retainer had limited application on accountof the fact as explained earlier in this judgment, the defendant would not be paying any legal fees.  It was intended that thesewould be borne by the purchasers of the flats.  This being the case, many of the reasons or justifications referred to by variousjudges as to why clients should be able to withdraw a retainer would have no application as the work in question would for the mostpart be performed for the purchasers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> After giving this matter careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that Mr Edward Chanâs submissions are well foundedand that a term should be implied in the contract between the parties that business efficacy required that the defendant should beheld to its bargain if the contract has not been frustrated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> I will now turn to the other question, namely whether the contract has been frustrated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> It was Mr Yuâs case that when the parties had entered into the contract in February 2000, it was clearly contemplated by everyoneconcerned that it would be subject to the PSPS.  The headings on the correspondence exchanged between the parties reflected this. Certainly it was not envisaged that the scheme would be discontinued.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> An important element of the scheme was that HA would nominate the purchasers and the price of each unit would be determined.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> It was clear from the announcement that PSPS was being discontinued and that there was no prospect of it being resumed in the foreseeablefuture.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> This being the case, the change in the Governmentâs policy meant that it was now impossible for the contract between the partiesto be concluded as originally anticipated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Mr Edward Chanâs answer to this was that if one had regard to the basic overall situation there had been no fundamental change.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> The defendant had developed the land.  While it was true that the PSPS had been discontinued, it had nonetheless proved to be possibleto obtain the Governmentâs permission to sell the flats on the open market.  As the flats could now be sold, it could not be saidthat the contract had been frustrated.  The only differences were that there was no restriction now on the price which could be chargedfor the flats and anyone who wished to purchase the flats could do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> So far as the plaintiff was concerned, it would be a relatively simple matter for his firm to modify the conveyancing documentationso as to make it applicable to the changed circumstances.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> What the plaintiff had been concerned with all along was simply the opportunity to undertake the conveyancing work for prospectivepurchasers.  As it now transpired there would be purchasers of the flats he just wished to have the benefit of the contract he hadentered into with the defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> The test to determine whether or not the performance of a contract has been frustrated is conveniently encapsulated in the commentaryat para. 23-007 in Volume I of the 29<sup>th</sup> Edition of â<i>Chitty on Contractsâ Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2004</i>.

These propositions, he stated,were âestablished by the highest authorityâ and were ânot open to question.â  The first proposition was that the doctrineof frustration has evolved âto mitigate the rigour of the common lawâs insistence on literal performance of absolute promisesâand that its object was âto give effect to the demands of justice, to achieve a just and reasonable result, to do what is reasonableand fair, as an expedient to escape from injustice where such would result from enforcement of a contract in its literal terms aftera significant change in circumstances.â  Secondly, frustration operates to âkill the contract and discharge the parties fromfurther liability under itâ and that therefore it cannot be âlightly invokedâ but must be kept within âvery narrow limitsand ought not to be extended.â  Thirdly, frustration brings a contract to an end âforthwith, without more ado automatically.â Fourthly, âthe essence of frustration is that it should not be due to the act or election of the party seeking to rely on itâand it must be some âoutside event or extraneous change of situation.â  Finally, a frustrating event must take place âwithoutblame or fault on the side of the party seeking to rely on it.ââ</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> I am satisfied that this is an accurate and complete statement of the law on this topic.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> It will be noted that one important aspect of this doctrine is that it is necessary to have regard to the position at the time ofthe intervening event.  In the instant case, that is the Governmentâs announcement in November 2002.  It would also appear notto be permissible to have regard to what subsequently transpires because once it is established that the contract has been frustratedit comes to an end forthwith.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Accordingly it is necessary to consider the position as it was in November 2002.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> At that time it was manifest that the PSPS scheme was being terminated and that the flats in the development could not be sold inaccordance with the scheme.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> On any realistic basis, the fact that the development was being undertaken as a PSPS scheme was of central importance and in my viewwent to the very root of the subject matter of the contract between the parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> It is also clear that the discontinuance of the scheme could not in any way be held to have been contributed to by the defendantthus making them in no way to blame for what transpired.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> In November 2002, it could not have been reasonably foreseen by anyone that the flats would in the future be sold in the privatesector.  If thought had been given to this, the most probable outcome would have been that the flats would have reverted to HA andthe plaintiff would have been unlikely to obtain the benefits from the contract he anticipated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> A further aspect of this matter is that it is not, in my view, proper to take cognizance of subsequent events whereby the defendantsought to mitigate losses.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Having regard to all of the evidence before me, I have come to the conclusion that the contract between the parties was indeed frustrated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The consequence of this is that the defendantâs application for summary judgment is successful and I so order.  It is of coursethe case that the plaintiff is entitled to his fees on a quantum meruit basis but that is not a matter strictly speaking with whichI am presently concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> I make an order <i>nisi</i> that the defendant will have their costs in this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(Simon Mayo)<br />            Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:left"> </p>        <p style="text-align:left">Mr Edward Chan, SC, leading Mr C.Y.
