before so doing, however, I should provide someindication of the background which led to the <i>ex</i> <i>parte</i> grant of this injunctive relief.</p>    <p class="heading">The factual background</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  This case is about a letter of credit fraud.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The plaintiff, UOB China is a bank; it is constituted under the laws of the PRC, and is an wholly-owned subsidiary of UOB, Singapore.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, which respectively I shall refer to as âDexingâ and âGuoâ, were customers of UOB, China; for present purposesI do not think that there is any doubt on the present evidence but that they can be characterized as fraudsters.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, ICT Company Limited (âICTâ) is a Hong Kong company, owned and managed by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, one Mr Peter Pohl.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On his own case, as revealed in his affidavit evidence, through the medium of ICT Mr Pohl runs, <i>inter alia</i>, that which he characterizes as a L/C documents processing business:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSince 2003, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant has been engaged in the business of processing L/C documents and monies on the instructions of its clientsâ¦</p>        <p class="quote">The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant [ICT] carries on business as a Commission Agent for various companies providing a fast service for the transfer of moniesobtained from letters of credit. One of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendantâs clients is the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant [Dexing] and through it, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant [Guo]â¦â (Pohl 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation, dd 5 May 2009)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The way this operation worked was as follows: indeed, there appears no dispute whatever as to its essential features, which areexemplified by the events of the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In outline, ICT was the beneficiary under 2 letters of credit, which can be referred to as âLC 204â and âLC 264â: in fact,the <i>modus</i> <i>operandi</i> in each instance was identical.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20se%20L" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">12.</a>  These LCâs</a> were opened by the plaintiff bank, UOB China, upon the application of its customer, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Dexing, acting through the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Mr Guo.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  As is apparent on their face, these LCâs represented the payment mechanism for 2 cargoes of Malaysian round logs to be shippedat a Malaysian port for carriage to, and discharge at, Nansha, China.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=14%20se%20L" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">14.</a>  These LCâs</a> were acceptance credits, because by their terms the plaintiff bank engaged, upon due presentation of the requisite documentation,to accept a draft drawn upon itself at 90 daysâ sight.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In each case the LCâs stipulated that the documents requiring to be presented in order to âtriggerâ the plaintiff bankâsobligation to accept a tenor draft were: (1) signed commercial invoice in 3 copies; (2) packing list in two copies; and (3) fullset of clean on board bills of lading.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It is admitted and accepted by Mr Pohl that ICT <i>never</i> had sold a cargo of Malaysian round logs to Dexing â a factual element of this case which is extraordinary, because the naturalimplication from the fact of ICT being named beneficiary under the credit was that ICT indeed was the seller, and that the creditproceeds were to reimburse the sale price for the cargo of Malaysian round logs.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Be that as it may. It is Mr Pohlâs position that for each of the two letters of credit in this case, Mr Pohl actually <i>created</i> a commercial invoice and a packing list and had ensured that these documents conformed with the requirements of the letters of credit.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  He also apparently received from Dexing and Guo bills of lading in respect of each purported shipment of Malaysian round logs, albeitâ as Mr Sussex observed during argument â it does not appear to have occurred to him how it was that Dexing, ostensibly the <i>buyer</i> of the rounds logs shipments, then should have been in possession of bills of lading, which, as documents of title, are held by theseller and are not handed over to the buyer, thereby permitting the buyer to take delivery, until the particular payment mechanismis satisfied: in this instance, of course, such payment mechanism was by LC as issued by the plaintiff bank.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In addition to creating the compliant invoice and packing list, Mr Pohl also drew a bill of exchange upon the plaintiff bank, andthen gave the three documents he thus had created to the Bank of China (âBOCâ) in Hong Kong, with a request that the documentsbe forwarded and presented to the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  It is worth emphasizing at this stage that BOC, which appears to be a bank with which Mr Pohl frequently has dealt in similar manner,itself assumed neither obligation nor engagement under the LC, and acted merely as presenting bank.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Upon the documents, as thus prepared, being remitted to the plaintiff through the banking system, and upon the plaintiff ensuringdocumentary compliance with the terms of the LC, the plaintiff then indicated to BOC its acceptance of the bills of exchange in eachcase in accordance with its engagement on the face of the LCâs issued to its customer, Dexing; thereupon UOB China became obliged,as a matter of contract, to pay the face value of the bill of exchange on maturity.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In other words, upon receipt of the compliant documentation, the payment obligations of UOB China, <i>qua</i> issuing bank, thereupon crystallized, and in due course payment was made.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  During argument much has been made of the position of BOC in this chain of events, and it has been asserted that BOC âknew fullwellâ precisely what was happening, and that which Mr Pohl/ICT were doing in terms of such âLC document processingâ.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Similarly, a good deal has been made of the fact that, upon the plaintiff bank determining that there had been compliant presentation,and thereafter notifying BOC that it had accepted the bill of exchange drawn upon it by Mr Pohl, monies thereafter immediately wereremitted from BOC to ICT/Mr Pohl, albeit in the form of a lesser sum than the face value of the bill of exchange; this was becauseBOC â which now knew (because UOB, China had confirmed it) that it was going to be placed in funds by the plaintiff â had discountedthe bill, the sum thus discounted reflecting the fact of payment earlier than the tenor of the bill (initially of 90 days, althoughthis period subsequently was extended with the agreement of the plaintiff bank.)</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  However, I wholly fail to see why the factual interposition of BOC, as ICT/Mr Pohlâs bank, makes a difference to the analyticalcase advanced by Mr Sussex on behalf of the plaintiff in terms of the tort of deceit, or that which often is referred to as <i>âDerry v Peakâ</i> fraud.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Nor do I understand why Mr Pohlâs frequent assertion that BOC allegedly well knew and appreciated his <i>modus operandi</i> should make any difference to the primary analysis in terms of the legal relationship between ICT/Mr Pohl on the one hand and UOB,China on the other.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I have no idea whether BOC in fact <i>did</i> know precisely what was happening â this is a factual assertion which Mr Pohl presumably wishes to establish at trial â but theineluctable fact is that there is no evidence whatever that the <i>plaintiff bank,</i> UOB China, was aware of the situation which was taking place by reason of the creative activities of ICT/Mr Pohl.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The short (and irrefutable) point is that ICT/Mr Pohl <i>never</i> have been customers of the plaintiff bank; accordingly, when documents, such as those admittedly created by Mr Pohl â whose âservice/agencyfeeâ doubtless covered the dual tasks of creation of the appropriate documentation and, in accordance with his principalâs instructions,the subsequent disbursement of the monies thus forthcoming, upon a discounted basis, from BOC â had named ICT as beneficiary, thetask of the plaintiffâs bills department solely was to check to ensure that there had been compliant documentary presentation.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  For present purposes, on the probabilities I also accept that the plaintiff does and did not keep records of ICTâs chop or authorizedsignatures; so far as the plaintiff issuing bank is concerned, which deals only in documents, ICT is no more or less than one ofthe many counterparties to transactions entered into by customers, such as Dexing/Guo, of the plaintiff bank.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Accordingly, if the foregoing analysis be accurate, as I believe it to be â indeed it follows directly upon the factual matrixas admitted to/sworn by Mr Pohl in his affirmations filed upon this application â then it must follow that whatever be the relationship/understandingbetween ICT/Mr Pohl on the one hand, and Dexing and Guo on the other, the business Mr Pohl describes on oath necessarily involvedthe creation of documents containing representations which Mr Pohl knew to be untrue â ICT had purchased no consignments of Malaysianround logs from Dexing â and thereafter presenting them under the relevant letters of credit with the intention that such representationsbe relied upon by the issuing bank, UOB China, in deciding whether to comply with its contractual payment obligations under the termsof the credits.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Lest it be suggested â and at bottom I do not think realistically that it can be â that the plaintiff bank was aware of whatwas going on, for present purposes I reject any such suggestion.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The reason for this conclusion is clear: if â as occurred in this case â Dexing/Guo did not place UOB China in funds to coverthe LC amount, the issuing bank effecting payment under the LC effectively is left high and dry, given that the Trust Receipt purportedlygiven to the bank by the fraudsters (and which otherwise would have constituted a form of security for the bank over the cargo itself)obviously was nugatory, since in these instances there was no cargo; nevertheless the plaintiff bank had paid out on the very documentscreated, upon the instructions of Dexing/Guo, by Mr Pohl, and thereafter the funds thus received had been disbursed by Mr Pohl uponthe instructions of the fraudsters.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I have taken some time to rehearse the undisputed facts, and the analysis which I believe necessarily follows consequent upon thesefacts, because these matters impact upon the argument for discharge of the Mareva injunction granted by this court in April 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I turn, therefore, to the main planks of this argument as mounted by Mr Barlow SC on behalf of ICT/Mr Pohl.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Material non-disclosure</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Mr Barlowâs main thrust on this application was that the deponent, Mr Lamplough, of the plaintiffâs solicitors, had been guiltyof material non-disclosure, and that on this basis alone the injunction as now in place should be discharged.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The court has been reminded of the relevant principles, which are tolerably well-known: see, for example, <i>Citibank NA v Express</i> <i>Ship Management Services Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%201184" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 1184 (CA)</a>; <i>Wah</i> <i>Nam Holdings Co Ltd v Excel Nobel Development Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%203%20HKC%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 3 HKC 118 (CA).</a></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr Barlow fiercely criticized Mr Lamplough for the manner in which the plaintiffâs fraud case had been developed in the affidavitleading the <i>ex parte</i> application; indeed, Mr Barlow suggested that the application should not even have been made <i>ex parte</i>, and that it would have been open to the plaintiff to have come to the court <i>ex parte</i> on notice, after the banks had closed.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  For my own part, I considered this latter argument somewhat ambitious; the plaintiff bank undoubtedly had suffered a major fraudat the hands of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, Dexing and Guo, and clearly ICT/Mr Pohl had been players/participants in the events that had unfolded, whereby the bankhad been caused significant loss, and thus it does not, and indeed did not, strike me as unusual or unwarranted that an applicationfor <i>Mareva</i> relief, in the case of an obvious LC fraud, should have been mounted precisely as occurred.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr Barlow lambasted Mr Lamplough for the manner in which the generally endorsed writ had been pleaded: a âblunderbuss approachâwas his colourful description, and true it is that one way or another Mr Lamplough had included in his draft writ just about everyconceivable cause of action.</p><br clear="all" />    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  However, I do not criticize him for that. At this early stage it is impossible to know all the details, and for the pleader notto cast his net wide would be irresponsible from a practitionerâs viewpoint. And in any event, this is the Commercial Court, whereinniceties of pleading generally are subsumed within considerations of robust and practical action, particularly when it comes to theplaintiffâs solicitor attempting to mitigate the effect on his client of an obvious LC fraud.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  So I do not think there is anything in this point. The fact that causes of action which assumed greater profile at the <i>ex parte</i> stage assume less profile later in the case, and that other causes of action, such as the tort of deceit, begin to swim more compellinglyinto the frame at a time when the factual matrix more precisely is known â Mr Pohl to-date has filed no less than 3 explanatory/justificatoryaffirmations â does not seem to me greatly to matter, and certainly does not justify discharging an injunction on the basis ofmaterial non-disclosure.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Leading counsel for the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants also laid emphasis upon the âspeculativeâ nature of Mr Lamloughâs affidavit leading the application, pointing outthat certain important assertions were unsourced, at least in terms of strict compliance with Order 41, rule 5, RHC, and that no-onefrom the plaintiff bank, UOB China, then had seen fit to depose to any of the matters upon which Mr Lamplough deposed on the basisof his information and belief, but self-evidently absent direct personal knowledge of any of these unfortunate events.</p><br clear="all" />    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  These points are reasonably made, but in my view they do not get his client home in terms of material non-disclosure/discharge.In addition criticisms were mounted of the lack of particulars of fraud â in particular, here, the use of the words â presumablyunwittinglyâ in the affidavit narrative to characterize the presumed position of BOC in passing on to UOB, China the LC documentscreated for presentation under the relevant credit by Mr Pohl, but in my view this criticism has no particular resonance in the ânon-disclosureâscheme of things; the state of mind of BOC officers is nothing to the analytical point vis-Ã -vis the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants on the one hand and UOB China on the other.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I repeat that at this early stage the defrauded plaintiffâs solicitor frequently possesses the bare minimum of hard informationto go on, and whilst he must be sure that allegations of fraud are not made irresponsibly absent reasonable (and objectively justifiable)evidential foundation, the fact that not unreasonable speculative assertion ultimately turns out to be unfounded in fact, or indeeddifferent in emphasis, does not strike me as fatal.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Mr Barlow also made much of the oversight, subsequently expressly acknowledged by Mr Lamplough, to include within the documentsplaced before the court at the <i>ex parte</i> stage a letter dated 7 April 2009 from Singapore solicitors Rajah &amp; Tan, who earlier on that same date had sent Mr Pohl a firstletter inquiring as to his role in this fraud, as the result of which Mr Pohl had picked up the telephone and had purported to explainto the Singaporean solicitor what had happened from his viewpoint. Thus, this âmissingâ 2<sup>nd</sup> letter had recounted the solicitorâs version of that which Mr Pohl had told him over the telephone; the opening paragraphs of thisletter read:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDear Mr Pohl,</p>        <p class="quote">LETTER OF CREDIT: SCMLC 00264 (âTHE LETTER OF CREDITâ)</p>        <p class="quote">BILL OF LADING NO HS-053B</p>        <p class="quote">We refer to our telephone conversation at around 1.00 pm this afternoon.</p>        <p class="quote">We understand from your explanation that ICT Company Limited (âICTâ) is in fact a commission agent for Guangzhou Dexing Ltd (âDexingâ).ICTâs arrangement with Dexing is to process documents (including letters of credit and bills of lading) received from Dexing inGuangzhou or Golden Sun/Golden Oriental in Singapore, including issuing invoices and packing lists for shipments, and to presentthe documents to the negotiating banks for payment. As you have explained, the payment received from ICT from the negotiating banksis paid according to Dexingâs instructions. You have also confirmed that ICT did not ever enter into any contract for the saleof timber to Dexing in respect of the captioned Letter of Credit or any other letters of credit.</p>        <p class="quote">In relation to the captioned Letter of Credit, you have indicated that ICT has been paid by Bank of China (Hong Kong) pursuant tothe negotiation and that the proceeds of the negotiation have been paid over to Dexing. You have further informed us that BOC (HK)was likely to be aware of the arrangement between ICT and Dexing. In any event, there was no back to back letter of credit issuedby BOC (HK) on your application.</p>        <p class="quote">As you may well appreciate, this is developing into a serious matterâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  At first blush, failure to exhibit this letter is a fair point, in that it shows that Mr Pohl then was responsive to queries abouthis role in the fraud, although it also should be noted that he appeared even then not to appreciate just what it was that he hadbeen doing vis-Ã -vis the plaintiff bank, and the manner in which his own actions on behalf of Dexing and Guo had engendered loss.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Be that as it may. <i>Prima facie</i> this at least was a runner in the non-disclosure stakes, but the force of the point substantially is dissipated when it is realizedthat, whilst Mr Lamplough admittedly had forgotten to include this 2<sup>nd</sup> letter of 7 April 2009 in the exhibits to his 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit, nevertheless the narrative of that affidavit deposes (at paragraph 55 thereof) to precisely the content of this 2<sup>nd</sup> Rajah &amp; Tan letter: the carriage to his paragraph commences âPohl telephoned Rajah &amp; Tan within an hour of the fax [Rajah&amp; Tanâs first letter of demand dated 7 April 2009 sent by fax] having been sent. In that telephone conversation, ICT confirmedthat:â¦.and thereafter is set out a prÃ©cis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> letter; this paragraph 55 further records that Mr Pohl and ICT âhave not cooperated with Rajah &amp; Tan any furtherâ.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  This latter statement now is corroborated by the affirmation of Maureen Poh, dated 31 July 2009. Ms Poh, who is an associate ofRajah &amp; Tan, the Singapore solicitors for the plaintiff bank, UOB, China, deposes to the fact that she was present during thetelephone conversation (held on speakerphone) between Mr Pohl and her colleague Mr Toh, of Rajah &amp; Tan, and corroborates Mr Lamploughâsversion of the substance of that conversation as contained in the 2<sup>nd</sup> letter, and goes on to recount how urgent requests were made of Mr Pohl for all relevant documents and correspondence pertinent tothe fraud, and that neither Mr Pohl nor any other representative of ICT responded to this request: âin the days following 7 April,the possibility of obtaining Mr Pohlâs co-operation diminishedâ.</p><br clear="all" />    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Ms Poh also says that thereafter Mr Toh and herself repeatedly had telephoned Mr Pohl (once more on the speakerphone) at the numberhe had given them, that in the afternoon of 8 April a woman had answered, and that when a request was made to speak with Mr Pohlâthis woman denied having any knowledge of Mr Pohlâ; having now read Mr Pohlâs 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation, Ms Poh believes that this woman was Mr Pohlâs wife. In the event, they did not hear from Mr Pohl after that, âtherepeated telephone calls to ICTâs offices were unansweredâ, it âsoon became clear that Mr Pohl was avoiding usâ, and thatnone of the requested documents were sent by Mr Pohl to their firm: âneither Mr Pohl nor ICT have coâoperated with Rajah &amp;Tan any further.â</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Accordingly, as matters stand, I do not see why the omission of the Rajah &amp; Tan 2<sup>nd</sup> letter is of material import, although from a nonâdisclosure viewpoint I accept that the position might very well have been differentif Mr Lamplough had not recounted in his affidavit the substance of this Pohl/Rajah &amp; Tan telephone conversation.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Additionally in the non-disclosure context, Mr Barlow mounted a strong attack upon the alleged failure of Mr Lamplough to draw thecourtâs attention to the obvious discrepancy in the appearance of the alleged chops and signatures of ICT and Mr Pohl as respectivelyappeared, in diverse forms it must be said, upon the face of the Purchase Contract (which Mr Pohl did not prepare) and on the faceof the Commercial Invoice (which he did).</p><br clear="all" />    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The point once again is fairly made, but I do not consider it bears the level of ânon disclosureâ significance now attributedto it by counsel. It seems to me that when faced with an obvious LC fraud of which the full details then remain unclear, save thatthe plaintiff bank has lost a good deal of money consequent upon presentation of false documents which refer to non-existent cargoes,it might reasonably be anticipated that chops or signatures on the associated documents are frauds, but given the plaintiffâs stateof knowledge at this preliminary investigatory stage, I do not consider that the clear discrepancy â to which the courtâs attentionwas not, I think, drawn by Mr Lamplough â would add much, if at all, to the discretionary evaluation the court is required to makewhen faced on an <i>ex parte</i> application relating to an LC fraud: one or the other probably was false (or perhaps even both), but attempted identification ofsuch falsity at that early stage would not have assisted, and in itself would have been a speculative exercise.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  At the end of the day, therefore, hard though Mr Barlow pressed the point, I decline to set aside this injunction on the groundsof material non-disclosure. Certainly there were inadequacies in Mr Lamploughâs affidavit leading the application, but none havebeen revealed as sufficiently compelling to warrant a discharge on the grounds of material non-disclosure, and accordingly I do notdo so.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  As a matter of fundamental approach, where there has been an obvious fraud perpetrated upon an issuing bank â as undoubtedly wasthe situation here â and when the plaintiff comes to the Commercial Court on an <i>ex parte</i> basis to request <i>Mareva</i> relief, evidential perfection clearly is unattainable, albeit the court nevertheless must be satisfied as to the essential case,even if subsequently it may transpire, after further investigation and the filing of appropriate evidence, that the manner of thefraud was not precisely as earlier had been surmised.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In fact, is one of the peculiar ironies of this case that no solicitor seized with obtaining Mareva relief for his client reasonablycould have anticipated that these two LC frauds took place in quite the manner that they undoubtedly did, and in my judgment theissue of nonâdisclosure should be viewed through the prism of the presentation of the misleading documents as were created by MrPohl precisely to achieve the result which was achieved, namely the dissemination of the LC monies from UOB China through BOC toMr Pohl/ICT, with, thereafter, remission to the fraudsters.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  It remains an extraordinary aspect of this case that in mounting this application, and in his sworn evidence, Mr Pohl even now doesnot appear to appreciate that his âcommission agentâ business involved creation of LC documents which on their face misrepresentedthe position to the issuing bank, and which, upon the basis of the representations made therein, thereafter acted to its detrimentby paying out under the credit absent being placed in funds and absent viable trust receipt security.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  I agree with and acceptthe submission of Mr Sussex that these are the classic ingredients of <i>Derry v Peak</i> fraud, whether or not the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants realized the position, and that it is likely that the only reason that ICT/Mr Pohl appear thus far successfully to haveoperated this business, in its present form at least, is that on every other occasion the issuing bank must have been put in fundsby the applicant for the credit, although on this particular occasion, consequent upon the nefarious activities of Dexing/Guo, theplaintiff bank indeed has been defrauded and has been left holding the financial baby.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  To this I would add the observation that I am unable to agree with Mr Barlowâs repeated contention, in argument, that for thesepurposes the representee is and was at all times BOC; with respect, it is <i>not</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  It seems to me that the correct analysis is that the representee is the plaintiff bank, UOB China, to whom the documents as createdby Mr Pohl were passed via BOC, and which, upon determining documentary compliance with the terms of the credit, confirmed its engagementto pay, and that it was only upon notice of such confirmation that BOC had advanced the discounted sum to ICT/Mr Pohl â the reasonbeing, of course, because BOC knew that it had a right of recourse to the plaintiff bank.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  It follows from the foregoing that in my view any argument predicated upon BOC, the bank with which Mr Pohl/ICT frequently dealtâ and which it now is alleged had specific knowledge of his <i>modus operandi</i> â being the represent<i>ee</i> is misplaced; nor, for that matter, do I think that the position of BOC is of particular relevance, whether on these two occasionsregarding LCâs 240 and 264, or indeed on any of the 150 odd other occasions on which Mr Pohl now says that he has conducted similaroperations through that bank.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  As earlier emphasised, there is absolutely no evidence that the plaintiff, UOB China, was aware of what was happening, and as matterspresently stand I am unable to see that there can be an issue of, for example, a âwaiverâ of the plaintiffâs rights. The shortpoint is that the plaintiff undoubtedly is the financial victim, and that this status has arisen, in part at least, as a direct consequenceof Mr Pohlâs activities.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Risk of dissipation</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Mr Barlowâs second main point was that in all the circumstances, and as now revealed on the evidence as filed by ICT/Mr Pohl,self-evidently there was no real risk of dissipation of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendantâs assets such that there was a real risk that any judgment in favour of the plaintiff would be unsatisfied.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In this connection leading counsel emphasized that since the letters from Rajah &amp; Tan of 7 April 2009 and the date of the <i>ex parte</i> application on 28 April 2009, the plaintiffâs solicitor had had no less than 3 weeks in which to make appropriate inquiries asto the status/credit standing of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, and that had this exercise been done, it would have revealed that ICT/Mr Pohl had been carrying on business in Hong Kongfor over 21 years, that âthey are not going anywhereâ, and that indeed they will be âresolutelyâ defending this action andthe false allegations of dishonesty as now levelled against them. Indeed, said Mr Barlow, to-date ICT/Mr Pohl had not dissipatedany of their assets, which was hardly surprising given that Hong Kong was home to Mr Pohl and his wife, and is the place where theyhave all their business connections.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The attention of the court was drawn to the principle that in this situation the plaintiff was under an obligation to make all dueinquiries â see, for example, dicta in <i>Bank Mellat v Nikpour</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20FSR%2087" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] FSR 87</a>, at 89-90 â and viewed in this context the 3 week lacuna was, said Mr Barlow, an important consideration which served to highlightthe relative paucity of hard data sworn to by Mr Lamplough merely on the basis of information and belief. Counsel also referred tothe passage in <i>Peter Oswald Scales v William HH Wong &amp; anr</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20HKLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] HKLR 110</a>, at 114, wherein Sir Alan Huggins VP had observed that âevidence which might tend to support a claim by the defendants that theyhonestly believed that they were entitled to do what they had done would reduce the likelihood of fraud and, consequently, tend todestroy the basis for an inference that there was a real risk of disposal of propertyâ¦â</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  At one point I confess that I was attracted to this argument, which potentially struck me as a stronger point that the materialnonâdisclosure argument which the court now has rejected.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  On reflection, however, I do not consider that this line suffices to get ICT/Mr Pohl home either, and to achieve the discharge asnow is sought.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Absent Mr Pohlâs own evidence as filed on this application, I should, perhaps, have been minded to discharge on this basis. However,in terms of the risk of non-disclosure I cannot properly overlook this element of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  On behalf of his client Mr Sussex SC has referred the court to passages commenting on risk of dissipation in cases as far apartas <i>Third Chandris Corpn v Unimarine SA</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20QB%20645" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 QB 645</a>, per Lawton J at 671-672, together with a judgment of this court in its very recent <i>Mareva</i> judgment in <i>Akai Holdings Ltd v Ho Wing On &amp; ors</i>, HCCL 37 &amp; 40 of 2005, unrep., Judgment dated 9 February 2009, at paras 52 and 53.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The gravamen of these passages is that where a good arguable case is established on the ground of fraud, dishonesty or an âunacceptablylow standard of commercial moralityâ, the court is the more likely to infer a real risk of dissipation; as Phillips LJ (as he thenwas) crisply put it in <i>Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society</i> <i>Ltd v Eden</i>, unrep., 25 January 1996:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt seems to me that when the court considers that there is a good arguable case it is at that stage that it considers whether thelikelihood of a judgment in favour of the plaintiff is sufficient to justify the grant of Mareva relief. If it is so satisfied, thequestion then arises:- if such a Judgment is given, what is the risk that there will be no assets there to satisfy it? If the judgmentin question being considered is a judgment in which allegations of fraud are made, then it seems to me that it is open to the courtto conclude from that fact alone that there is a sufficient risk of dissipation of assets to justify the grant of reliefâ¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  I appreciate, of course, that on behalf of his client Mr Barlow firmly disavows any suggestion of dishonesty <i>per se</i> or of âlow commercial standards of moralityâ, to adopt the well-known rubric from <i>Honsaico Trading v Hong Yiah Seng Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20HKLR%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 HKLR 235</a>, at 240, or of âquestionable integrityâ: <i>Standard Chartered</i> <i>Securities v Arther Lai</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20HKC%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] HKC 375</a>, and seeks to make the point that this was fully intended to be an âabove-boardâ business run by Mr Pohl through ICT.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  However, as Mr Sussex stressed during argument, the business as now described in Mr Pohlâs evidence cannot by any stretch of theimagination be described as âlegitimate businessâ (whatever he may believe, or has been led to believe to be the case) sincesuch business necessarily involves creating documents containing representations which Mr Pohl must have known to be untrue, andthereafter causing such documents to be presented under LCâs with the clear and obvious intention that they be relied upon by theissuing banks â in the present case in context of LCâs 240 and 264, and the consequent triggering of the obligation of the presentplaintiff, UOB China, to make payment under those credits. I also accept the correlative proposition that it can only be by reasonof fortuity that hitherto Dexing appears to have reimbursed the issuing bank, and thus that this fraudulent state of affairs hadnot earlier come to light.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The fact that Mr Pohl thus far had âgot away with itâ and apparently has run this type of business for some time without comingto commercial grief ultimately is nothing to the analytical point. This court has no reason to believe, and indeed does not believe,that Mr Pohl set out to act dishonestly, but putting it at its lowest he is misguided in doing what he has been doing â his <i>modus operandi</i> means that he is effectively an hostage to the intentions of his clients â and it is ironic that he does not seem to appreciatethe illegitimate nature of this commercial conduct, an aspect of this case which Mr Sussex has suggested serves to exacerbate thecurrent situation when considering ârisk of dissipationâ.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  When it comes to âdishonestyâ in creating and presenting documents known by the creator to contain misleading and wrong representations,in my view it is not open to Mr Pohl now to attempt to claim the moral high ground by saying, in effect, that he was only followinghis principalâs instructions (both in creating the documents and in disbursing the resultant funds) and that accordingly no âdishonestyâof any shade can be laid at his door.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  As Lord Nicholls observed in his celebrated speech in <i>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v</i> <i>Philip Tan Kok Ming</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 378</a>, at 389:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦for the most part dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety. However, these subjective characteristics of honestydo not mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honesty in particular circumstances. <i>The standard of what constitutes honest conduct is not subjective. Honesty is not an optional scale, with higher or lower values</i> <i>according to the moral standards of each individual</i>. If a person knowingly appropriates anotherâs property, he will not escape a finding of dishonesty simply because he sees nothingwrong in such behaviourâ¦â (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Moreover, Mr Sussex reiterated that in any event his client presently did <i>not</i> accept the story of, and the âdefenceâ of Mr Pohl/ICT, which he characterized as âirrational, intemperate and inherently incredibleâ;nor, for that matter, was he minded to accept the submission of Mr Barlow that factually there had been no dissipation of assetsfrom ICT subsequent the receipt by ICT/Mr Pohl of the Rajah &amp; Tan correspondence on 7 April 2009. As far as his client was concerned,said Mr Sussex, given the serious nature of the conduct now admitted to by Mr Pohl, it was clear that ICT and/or Mr Pohl alreadyhad put the proceeds of these fraudulent activities beyond the reach of the plaintiff, and that having regard to the facts upon whichthis claim was based, and the manner in which the claim unapologetically and aggressively now was being defended, he submitted thatthere remained âevery reason to fearâ that, absent the injunction remaining in place, assets would be removed from the reachof the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  In this connection counsel further noted that, unlike the situation with 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> defendants, Shine Well International Group Ltd and Edward Anwar (in the context of a 3<sup>rd</sup> fraud unconnected to LCâs 204 and 264) there had been no offer to pay back any of the monies thus abstracted from UOB China consequentupon the frauds as had taken place.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  At the end of the day, therefore, and after carefully reflecting upon all the circumstances of this case, not least in this contextthe current stance of Mr Pohl/ICT, I have decided also to refuse the discharge application on the alternative basis of absence ofrisk of dissipation.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  I have come to this conclusion after some hesitation, but in the event in the exercise of my discretion, and after weighing allthe factors in the balance, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for the injunction currently in place now to be discharged.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  To an extent I am fortified in this view because I have been told from the bar table that ICT in fact has <i>not</i> been prevented from operating at all â albeit it seems to have been doing so on a much reduced basis â given that one of itsbank accounts, that with Bank of Communications, has by consent of the plaintiffâs solicitors <i>not</i> been frozen consequent upon this injunction; indeed, Mr Sussex observed that from his clientâs viewpoint, the plaintiff was keenfor ICT to continue to trade, at least legitimately, in order to accrue assets for what was regarded as a âsure winnerâ in termsof the tort of deceit.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  As to this characterization of the plaintiffâs prospects of success, at present I naturally venture no concluded view, save toobserve that on the basis of the currently available materials the plaintiff appears to have a strong case, and in coming to my conclusionto leave the injunction in place I naturally also place this opinion into the discretionary âmixâ.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  I should add, for the sake of completeness, that on reflection I do not consider the <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> order, granted by Reyes J on the plaintiffâs application against BOC on 23 April 2009, is of particular significance in the contextof the present application, although it is true that the documentation surrounding this application was produced at the request ofthe court towards the conclusion of argument.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  It may also be useful to state that had I not come to the view to which I have come as to the discharge application as mounted bythe 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, and had I decided to discharge the <i>Mareva</i> injunction obtained from this court <i>ex parte</i> on 28 April 2009, in light of the totality of the evidence before the court I should have entertained, and indeed would have accepted,an application to regrant, although such regrant would <i>not</i> have been in the terms of the existing injunction.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Which in turn naturally leads to Mr Barlowâs belated application to vary.</p>    <p class="heading">Variation of terms</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  At the conclusion of his argument, Mr Barlow asked the court alternatively to consider a variation of the terms of the injunctionas granted.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  He had in mind the principal sum for which <i>Mareva</i> injunctive relief was granted against the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, namely in the sum of US$1.8 million, and wondered rhetorically how this amount could have been so magnified by the elementsof interest and costs when the principal sum of the 2 LCâs as had been honoured by the plaintiff bank came to no more than US$1.28million (<i>vide</i> the Endorsement of Claim).</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  I am assured by Mr Sussex that Mr Lamploughâs clear recollection of the <i>ex parte</i> hearing of 28 April 2009 â of which now I have but a very limited memory â is that Mr Lamplough <i>did</i> make a specific point of drawing the attention of the court to the sum of US$1.8 million, and the constituent elements thereof.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  I am happy to accept this assurance, and can only conclude that in this regard my concentration must have wavered, and that thisfigure went through absent appropriate evaluation â certainly it is the case, as Mr Barlow was keen to point out, that there canbe little justification for the principal sum as claimed to be inflated by almost 30% solely on the basis of interest and costs,not least since the current rates of interest paid on US deposits as the result of the recent financial contagion are now risiblylow, and reflect the huge amount of liquidit injected by governments around the world into the financial system.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In my view the figure more properly should have been US$1.5 million, and accordingly I now vary the order to this extent, with thesubstitution of this latter figure for that as originally granted.</p>    <p class="heading">Other matters</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  An oddity of this case is the strategy adopted by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants in this litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  The <i>ex parte</i> <i>Mareva</i> relief was granted on 28 April 2009, and the application to discharge, which in the event has been unsuccessful, has come on forhearing some 13 weeks later.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  It strikes me that instead of lavishing time and money upon an application to discharge, a better use resources would have beento seek an order from the Commercial Court for an early trial; indeed, with co-operation from both sides â which I see no reasonnot to be forthcoming in the circumstances â the case could have been prepared and heard within, or at the least reasonably nearto, the time taken for this interlocutory application.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The court made this observation during argument, and Mr Sussex indicated that his client would be amenable to such an order foran expedited hearing, which surely is in the interest of the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Accordingly, I make an order for an early trial of this action. In my view this is precisely the sort of case which should attractan order of this type.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  It follows from the foregoing that the Order of this court on this application is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i) The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendantsâ application by summons dated 13 May 2009 is dismissed;</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) The Mareva injunction order dated 28 April 2009, as amended on 27 May 2009, and as re-amended on 11 June 2009, is henceforthvaried, at paragraph 1(1)(b) hereof, by the substitution of the figure of US$1.5 million for the figure of US$1.8 million;</p>        <p class="quote">(iii) There be an order for an early trial of this action;</p>        <p class="quote">(iv) As to costs, there be an order <i>nisi</i> that 90% of the costs of and occasioned by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants summons dated 13 May 2009 be to the plaintiff in any event, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(William Stone)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Charles Sussex SC, instructed by Messrs Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan, for the plaintiff/respondent</p>        <p>Mr Barry Barlow SC, instructed by Messrs Robertsons, for the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants/applicants</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2009/688.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
