To set the scene for what follows it is appropriate to say something about a particular species of VAT fraud.  I begin with therelevant regulatory backdrop.</p>        <p class="quote">4.   Under the rules concerned with the charging and collection of VAT, supplies of goods between registered traders in differentmember states of the European Union are zero-rated provided the seller in one member state obtains the VAT registration number ofthe customer in another member state and can show that the goods in question were removed from the seller's member state to the othermember state. The result of those rules is that where an entity registered for VAT in the United Kingdom imports goods from anothermember state, it need not make any payment in respect of VAT to the vendor.  In due course it will be obliged to account in the UnitedKingdom for output tax on its sales to customers in the United Kingdom.  If the goods are purchased by an entity registered for VATin the United Kingdom which the entity then sells abroad, that entity will not be entitled to charge output tax on the sale but,conversely, having incurred and paid input tax on its purchase of the goods (assuming the purchase was from somebody registered forVAT in the United Kingdom) will be entitled to recover that input tax from HM Commissioners of Customs and Excise ('HMCE' for short).</p>        <p class="quote">5.   It is the opportunities for fraud provided by these rules that have given rise to the kinds of dishonest scheme summarised inthe following passage of the judgment of Jacob L.J. in <i>R (on the application of Federation of Technological Industries) v Customs &amp; Excise Commissioners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] EWCA Civ.1020</a> (at paras 17-21):</p>        <p class="quote">'17.    The simplest form of abuse is what [HMCE] call "acquisition fraud".  A business in the UK acquires goods from an EU supplierVAT free and sells them on into the United Kingdom market directly or indirectly.  When it sells these goods to its U.K. customersit charges VAT but it fails to account to [HMCE] for the VAT it collects.  Before [HMCE] catch up with it the trader simply disappears.</p>        <p class="quote">18.    This kind of abuse is somewhat limited in that the importer who intends to defraud is actually selling the goods into the UnitedKingdom market.  He has to find real customers or his customers do.</p>        <p class="quote">19.   Much more significant is the second type of abuse which [HMCE] call "carousel fraud".  Again, there is a UK importer buyingfrom a supplier in another EU state.  Again, he pays no VAT on his purchase. He then sells to a "customer" in the U.K., chargingVAT. That "customer" sells on to another "customer", himself charging VAT (output tax) and setting that against the tax he paid tohis supplier (input tax).  This may go through several traders (whom [HMCE] call "buffers").  The last buffer in the chain does not,however, sell on to ultimate UK customers.  He sells back into the EU very often to the original seller.  He will have paid inputtax on his purchase.  This he claims "back" from [HMCE].  None of this would matter if the original importer, who has charged outputtax to the first of the buffers, were around to account to [HMCE] for that tax.  But by now he has disappeared.</p>        <p class="quote">20.    So on each circuit of the "carousel" 17.5% of the value of the goods is extracted from [HMCE].  The scheme requires high value,low physical size goods - a container full of mobile phones or computer chips is just right for this.  A pallet-load arrives at Heathrow,the transactions all take place quickly (perhaps in the same day) and the pallet moves out again.</p>        <p class="quote">21.    [HMCE] estimate ... that the annual cost to the UK in 2002-3 was between Â£1.65 and Â£2.64 billion.  The problem is, whateverthe precise figure, vast.  It is not confined to the UK but is EU wide...'</p>        <p class="quote">One of the features of carousel fraud is that there is no need to find real end-customers for the goods in the United Kingdom.  Theoverseas customer to whom the goods are exported may or may not be a genuine purchaser of them.  It is because the goods may endup with the original supplier that the designation 'carousel' is used.  Dishonest schemes of this nature have become known as missingtrader intra-community fraud, or 'MTIC fraud' for short.</p>        <p class="quote">6.   The value to those participating in MTIC fraud is the sharing of the VAT extracted from HMCE (effectively the amount of the outputtax which the missing importer has charged to his purchaser but failed to pay to HMCE).  It is only if the exporter fails to recoverthe input tax he has paid on his acquisition of the goods that the VAT position is neutral.  Since the transactions - certainly thosethat the evidence before me has explored - can take place (or are said by the parties to them to have taken place) in the space ofa single day (with completion of the transactions occurring over, at the most, a few days) and it may be some time before the importerdefaults on his obligation to account for the output tax he has charged and been paid, it requires vigilance on the part of HMCEto realise, when a payment claim is made, that it is part of a carousel fraud.</p>        <p class="quote">7. It can happen that one or more of the 'buffers' is innocent of any involvement in the fraud: he just happens to have purchasedthe goods and sold them on.  But if the goods end up with an exporter who is involved in the fraud (because, for example, it canbe shown that he is the recipient of a commission or the like which has been paid to him by a purchaser/vendor higher up the chainor coincidence cannot satisfactorily account for the number of chains in which that exporter and the same importer are involved)the buffer may find it difficult to resist the inference that he too is involved, particularly if he has sold direct to that exporteror there are other features of his involvement indicating that his purchase and on-sale are other than what one would expect in thecase of a genuine arms-length transaction."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  We have a copy of Amended Particulars of Claim ("APoC") filed on behalf of HMRC (the successor to HMCE), and an affidavit of SusanElizabeth Ogburn ("the affidavit") made in support of the application for a <i>Mareva</i> injunction.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In the APoC, MTIC fraud was explained in para 12, and that MTIC fraud typically involved also:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(f) the exporter (or 'Broker') [who] claims repayment from HMRC of the VAT charged on its acquisition of the goods, while the importer(or 'Defaulter') having directed payment of its invoice to a Third Party Recipient, fails to account to HMRC for the VAT due on itssale of the goods;"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  After comparing a lawful chain of supply with MTIC fraud, para 12 went on to say:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(m) By contrast, the net effect of MTIC fraud transactions is that:</p>        <p class="quote">(i) no VAT in (<i>sic</i>) received by HMRC from the importer (the Defaulter);</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) HMRC nevertheless makes a repayment to the exporter (the Broker);"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Paras. 13-15 of the APoC are important and are quoted in full:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<u>HMRC's claims</u></p>        <p class="quote">13.

Of the 697 Relevant Transaction Chains referred to at Paragraph 14(a) above:</p>		<blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) HMRC have identified 237 chains in which:</p>		<blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i) there is a Defaulter who has failed to account of the VAT on its sale;</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) a Buffer made a third party payment to Sunico; and</p>        <p class="quote">(iii) HMRC have paid the VAT repayment claim by the Broker;</p>        <p class="quote">(iv) the total value of the VAT loss in those 237 Relevant Transaction Chains is Â£12,939,472.39;</p>		</blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) as to remaining 460 chains, HMRC have identified (i) there is a Defaulter who has failed to account of the VAT on its sale; and(ii) a Buffer has made a third party payment to Sunico.  HMRC has been unable to trace each link in the chain between the UK tradingparties.  In particular it has been unable to trace the chain through to the Broker.  However, it may be inferred that a VAT repaymentclaim was made by the Broker in those chains and that such repayment claim was paid.   Such inference is made from the followingfacts:</p>		<blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i) in so far as known, each of the 697 Relevant Transaction Chains contained essentially the same characteristics and resulted inan export by a Broker who submitted a VAT repayment claim;</p>        <p class="quote">(ii) HMRC only declined to make pay a VAT repayment claim where it was able to identify the transaction chain back from the Brokerto the Defaulter;</p>        <p class="quote">(iii) in none of the 697 Relevant Transaction Chains referred to at Paragraph 14(a) have HMRC identified the chain back from the Brokerto the Defaulter;</p>        <p class="quote">(iv) the Brokers' VAT repayment claims in the remaining 460 Relevant Transaction Chains must have been paid."</p>		</blockquote>		</blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  However, in the affidavit, Ms Ogburn said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"8 In respect of those 697 transactions the total VAT that was paid away and was unpaid by the Defaulting Traders to HMRC was Â£39,387,622.36.</p>        <p class="quote">9 Of those 697 transaction chains HMRC have been able to trace 237 up to an exporting Broker in which a repayment claim was paid byHMRC.  The total loss suffered by HMRC in respect of these 237 transactions is Â£12,939,472.39.  The reconstruction of complete chains(from Defaulting Trader to Broker) involves tracking the documentation for each stage of the chain.  This has not been possible forall 697 chains in which Sunico have received monies.</p>        <p class="quote">10 In addition HMRC has traced 22 of fraudulent transaction chains back from two brokers which follow the outline pattern above. The loss to HMRC suffered in these chains together with the loss suffered as referred to above totals Â£13,942,950.04.  This is thequantum of HMRC's claim for damages against Sunico and the other Defendants."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In para 51 of the affidavit, Ms Ogburn explained that the claim has excluded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"51. â¦ all those chains which involve Sunico and which ended with a Broker whose repayment claim was denied".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  At first instance, counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent were content to proceed on the basis that HMRC's claim was in nature of a carousel fraud.  On appeal, Mr Chan Chi Hung,SC, leading Mr Jeffrey Tam (neither of whom appeared below) on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent, contended that HMRC's claim did not involve a carousel fraud. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Chan also submitted that the claim in the UK action is not an action for the return of the refund paid to the broker/exporters,nor for damages for loss suffered in paying out the refund on the basis that the HMRC should not have paid out the refund to theexporters and would not have done so had they known the facts they pleaded in the APoC. He submitted that there was no allegationin the APoC that the exporters were parties to or had knowledge of the conspiracy or fraud; or that the exporters were not entitledto the refund.  Mr Chan submitted that the parties to the conspiracy were set out in APoC para 100.  They were: the importer-defaulters,the EU suppliers (or the unknown parties hijacking the names of such EU suppliers), the buffers making the payments to Sunico; orgiving/passing on the instructions to pay Sunico; and the Defendants, but the exporters were not listed in para 100.  Also, thateach of the unlawful acts relied on was by the importer-defaulters, not the exporters/brokers.  He pointed out that para 101 wenton to allege that as a result of the conspiracy, the VAT payable (not the refund), which ought to be accounted and paid to HMRC,was diverted to Sunico or other overseas recipients. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Thus, Mr Chan submitted that the action is in substance a claim by HMRC for the VAT which had not been paid to them and as suchis covered by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 3.</a></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Charles Sussex, SC (leading Mr Johnny K. C.

Movil 2000 traded in the import and exportof telecommunications equipment from premises known as 'the Churchill' 1 Chartwell Place, Off Middle Road, Harrow, Middlesex.  Movil2000 completed a VAT1 Form to register for VAT on 6 March 2000 (SO10/8 -11).</p>        <p class="quote">274   As has been illustrated by the numerous examples above, Movil 2000 has occupied the position of a broker exporting mobile phonesin transaction chains that involved MTIC fraud.  In each instance it would export the phones to Dhalomal Ramchand.  As may be seenfrom the table at SO10/67 - 68 there are 21 transactions in which HMRC made VAT repayment to Movil 2000 in chains in which (a) VATwas unpaid by the defaulter and (b) 3rd party payments were made to Sunico The total amount of VAT repaid in respect of these transactionswas Â£710,490.15.</p>        <p class="quote">275   In the various examples referred to above, the documentation showed that in selling the goods to Dhalomal Ramchand, Movil 2000made no profit.  Whilst that would appear to be lacking in any commercial logic, the wider pattern of Movil 2000's trading duringthe period under review in this case in even more extraordinary.  At SO10/18 - 66 are copies of its purchase and sale summaries thatit provided to HMRC.  In October 2005 it made gross purchases of Â£60,470,218 (SO10/18 - 34) (and gross sales of Â£60,464,663 (SO10/35- 51) (a loss of Â£5,555).

Amber submitted a repayment claim for VAT for the period 07/05.  HMRC paid Amber Â£5,027,249.68 in respect of this return bytwo instalments (SO3/418A-418J).  Following further investigations into Amber by HMRC an assessment was raised 2006 to reclaim themoney paid to Amber for the period 07/05 (SO3/418A-418J).

Europecom, Fix, Zeetta, Sheeling, Team Mobile and Goldex all datedtheir invoices 25 August 2005.  However Europecom Sarl, despite the date of its invoice to Fix, did not in fact order the goods inquestion until 26 August 2005 on which date Sunico raised its invoice despite those invoices showing that the goods had been deliveredthe day before.

This suggests a circular movement ofthe goods.  As the majority of parties in a transaction add a mark up on the purchase price, no matter how small, if the goods aremoving in a circular fashion at some point there had to be a readjustment in price.  If, as suspected, the same goods are being usedover and over again to perpetrate the fraud then what Sunico purportedly paid for the goods is irrelevant.  The transactions do notreflect actual commercial activity as the object of the exercise is to induce a loss to HMRC by failing to account for VAT on transactionswithin the UK.</p>        <p class="quote">141.

There, the Commissioners brought an action against the Defendant for damages at commonlaw for unlawful means conspiracy in sums equivalent to the amount of value-added tax ("VAT") which they had refunded as a resultof the carousel frauds.

He relied on <i>Optigen Ltd v Customs and Excise Comrs (ECJ)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%202%20WLR%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 2 WLR 456</a>, a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Communities which decided a trader, who had no knowledge of the fact or meansof knowing that a previous or subsequent transaction in the chain was vitiated by VAT fraud, was entitled to a VAT refund.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I have endeavoured to show that, in present case, exporters such as Movil 2000 or Amber might not have been innocent parties.

It was held that the claim was not maintainable because it was a claim by theGovernment of India to recover tax.  There, Lord Keith of Avonholm made the following observations about <i>Peter Buchanan Ld v McVey (Note)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%20AC%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] AC 516.</a></p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Lord Keith said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"â¦ The plaintiff (in <i>Peter Buchanan</i>) company was a company registered in Scotland which had been put into liquidation by the revenue authorities in Scotland under acompulsory winding-up order in respect of a very large claim for excess profits tax and income tax.  The liquidator was really anominee of the revenue.  The defendant held 99 one pound shares of the capital of the company and the remaining share was held bya confidential cashier and bookkeeper as trustee for him.  These two sole shareholders were also sole directors.  The defendant havingrealized the whole assets of the company in his capacity as a director and having satisfied substantially the whole of the company'sindebtedness, other than that due to the revenue, by a variety of devices had the balance transferred to himself to his credit withan Irish bank and decamped to Ireland.  The action was in form an action to recover this balance from the defendant at the instanceof the company directed by the liquidator.  The first answer of the defendant was that, as he had received the money from the companyin his capacity as a shareholder in pursuance of an agreement between all the corporators, the company could not now ask to haveit back.  The judge held that the transaction was a dishonest transaction designed to defeat the claim of the revenue in Scotlandas a creditor and was ultra vires of the company and accordingly rejected the defendant's submission.  On the other hand, he heldthat although the action was in form an action by the company to recover these assets it was in substance an attempt to enforce indirectlya claim to tax by the revenue authorities of another State.  He accordingly dismissed the action.  The judgment contains an ableand exhaustive examination of the authorities.</p>        <p class="quote">One explanation of the rule thus illustrated may be thought to be that enforcement of a claim for taxes is but an extension of thesovereign power which imposed the taxes, and that an assertion of sovereign authority by one State within the territory of another,as distinct from a patrimonial claim by a foreign sovereign, is (treaty or convention apart) contrary to all concepts of independentsovereignties.  Another explanation has been given by an eminent American judge, Judge Learned Hand, in the case of <i>Moore v. Mitchell</i>, in a passage, quoted also by Kingsmill Moore J. in the case of <i>Peter Buchanan Ld.</i> as follows: 'While the origin of the exception in the case of penal liabilities does not appear in the books, a sound basis for itexists, in my judgment, which includes liabilities for taxes as well.  Even in the case of ordinary municipal liabilities, a courtwill not recognize those arising in a foreign State, if they run counter to the "settled public policy" of its own.  Thus a scrutinyof the liability is necessarily always in reserve, and the possibility that it will be found not to accord with the policy of thedomestic State.  This is not a troublesome or delicate inquiry when the question arises between private persons, but it takes onquite another face when it concerns the relations between the foreign State and its own citizens or even those who may be temporarilywithin its borders.  To pass upon the provisions for the public order of another State is, or at any rate should be, beyond the powersof the court; it involves the relations between the States themselves, with which courts are incompetent to deal, and which are intrustedto other authorities.  It may commit the domestic State to a position which would seriously embarrass its neighbour.  Revenue lawsfall within the same reasoning; they affect a State in matters as vital to its existence as its criminal laws.  No court ought toundertake an inquiry which it cannot prosecute without determining whether those laws are consonant with its own notions of whatis proper.'</p>        <p class="quote">On either of the explanations which I have just stated I find a solid basis of principle for a rule which has long been recognizedand which has been applied by a consistent train of decisions. â¦"  pages 510-511</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  <i>Buchanan</i> and <i>Government of India</i> were considered in <i>Williams and Humbert Ltd v W &amp; H Trademarks (Jersey) and Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20AC%20368" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] AC 368</a>, where Lord Mackay of Clashfern said at 440:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Having regard to the questions before this House in [<i>Government of India</i>] I consider that it cannot be said that any approval was given by the House to the decision in the <i>Buchanan</i> case except to the extent that it held that there is a rule of law which precludes a state from suing in another state for taxesdue under the law of the first state. â¦"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  <i>Buchanan</i> and <i>Government of India</i> were followed, in <i>QRS 1 Aps and others v Frandsen</i> [1999] STC 616, a case which was indistinguishable on the facts from <i>Buchanan</i>, where Simon Brown LJ said at 630F:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I can readily understand Lord Mackay's insistence on the narrowness of the <i>Buchanan</i> decision and his approach certainly appears consistent with the view of the editors of <i>Cheshire</i> <i>and</i> <i>North's Private International Law</i> (12th edn, 1992) p116: 'It is questionable whether the general ban on indirect enforcement is not too rigid.' They do not, however,criticise <i>Buchanan</i> and, as I repeat, the present case is indistinguishable from <i>Buchanan</i>: both are to be regarded as cases where the liquidator, as nominee for a foreign state, in substance is seeking a remedy designedto give extra-territorial effect to foreign revenue law. â¦"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr Chan submitted that even if the present case is indistinguishable from <i>Total Network</i>, enforcement of any such judgment would nevertheless be an indirect enforcement of foreign revenue law.

Quite apart from thedifficulties which arise in a case where there are civil claimants alongside the taxman, one wonders why the fraudster is to be preferredto the Revenue?

I do not believe that <i>Government of India</i> compels such a conclusion.  If, it does, I am respectfully of the view that our courts may wish to consider whether <i>Government of India</i> should be followed.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  It is inappropriate and unnecessary at this juncture to say more than that this is not a case where the claim ought to be struckout.  Whether any judgment in the English action will be enforced will depend on the actual basis of the decision and a determinationby our courts on the scope of Rule 3.</p>    <p class="heading">Disposition</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I have had the advantage of reading Fok JA's judgment in draft.  I agree that leave to appeal should be refused.  Indeed, for thereasons given above, I would have dismissed the appeal in any event.</p>	<p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Fok JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Tang VP in draft.  With respect, assuming we should entertain the appeal, I agreewith his reasons for dismissing it.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  The question of whether we should entertain the appeal or not arises because the respondents did not apply for leave to appeal,as was required.  The application for leave should have been made to the Recorder below: RHC Order 59 rule 2B(2).  It should havebeen made within 14 days of his judgment: RHC Order 59 rule 2B(1).</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The respondents apparently omitted to make such an application because their solicitors took the view that the Recorder's orderwas within RHC Order 59 rule 21(2)(b) being "an order striking out â¦" and so one from which leave to appeal was not required. This view was also apparently shared by the applicant's solicitors at one stage.  It was, however, an erroneous view since the Recorder'sorder was not an order striking out an action or pleading and leave is required to appeal against a refusal of such an application. The question is now whether this court should grant leave to appeal and the necessary extension of time for the appeal.  The judgmentwas handed down on 16 November 2010 and the application for leave to appeal was not made until 22 February 2011, a delay of overtwo and a half months.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Even if I were prepared to accept that the delay due to a misunderstanding of the new rules of court was excusable (this being thereason proffered in the respondents' solicitor's affirmation) so that the test for leave is whether the respondents can show a reasonableprospect of success, I do not think that test is satisfied in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  In my view, the respondents 	cannot show a reasonable prospect of success on the appeal given the high 	threshold required tosustain the strike out application in this case.  	It should be noted that, on the originating summons by which the applicant commenced the proceedings in this jurisdiction, all the applicant is 	required to demonstrate in order to establish jurisdictionfor the grant of 	the Mareva injunction in aid of the English proceedings is that there is a 	good arguable case that the Englishproceedings are capable of giving rise 	to a judgment which may be enforced in Hong Kong.  In order for the 	strike out to havesucceeded, the respondents would have had to show that it 	is plain and obvious that there is no such case. In my opinion, for the	reasons set out in the judgment of Tang VP above, the respondents&#39; arguments 	fall far short of that hurdle.  I would thereforerefuse leave to 	appeal. </p>	<p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Tang VP:</b></p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Leave to appeal is refused, and I make a costs order <i>nisi</i> in favour of HMRC.</p>	<p> </p>		<p> </p>	    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">(Robert Tang)<br />            Vice-President</td>            <td style="text-align:center;upper" width="50%">(Joseph Fok)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>        </tr>    </table>		<p> </p>	<!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p style="text-align:left">Mr Chan Chi Hung, SC &amp; Mr Jeffrey Tam instructed by Messrs Fairbairn Catley Low &amp; Kong for the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent</p>    <p style="text-align:left">Mr Charles Sussex, SC &amp; Mr Johnny K.
