The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was the developer of HWR21 and HWR23.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is the owner of some staircase spaces of HWR21.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was the owner of the ground, 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of HWR21 between 15 June 2001 and 14 October 2005.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant is the owner of the ground, 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of HWR21 and the entire HWR23 since 14 October 2005.  The Defendants are associated companies.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  HWR21 and HWR23 are adjoining lots of land on which two five-storey old buildings used to be erected.  There were two common staircases,one at the front and the other at the rear of the two buildings, which stood partly on each of the two lots.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant acquired HWR21 on 6 October 1986 and started to redevelop it.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant also had in mind acquiring and redeveloping HWR23 as an extension of HWR21 and as one integral building at a later stage. It took certain measures to cater for the later redevelopment of HWR23, which included preserving the two common staircases.  Anew wall was built against the old party wall and the common staircases from the ground floor to the fifth floor of HWR21 (â1<sup>st</sup> Wallâ).  The 1<sup>st</sup> Wall stood within the boundary line of HWR21 with HWR23.  The external wall of HWR21 adjoining HWR23 from the sixth to the fifteenthfloors (â2<sup>nd</sup> Wallâ) was built along the boundary line of the two lots.  The redevelopment of HWR21 was completed in 1987 with the erection ofa fifteen-storey building.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant completed acquisition of HWR23 on 19 August 1992.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant anticipated that openings would have to be made on the 1<sup>st</sup> Wall and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wall or that some of those walls would have to be demolished so as to connect HWR21 with HWR23 and so that the buildings on the twolots could be merged into one integral building.  In anticipation of that eventuality, by an assignment dated 25 May 1988 (âAssignmentâ)the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant assigned to its associated company, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, the entire part of the common staircases standing within HWR21 and the party wall adjoining them (âStaircase Spacesâ)together with the right to demolish the wall and the staircases and had such rights written into the Deed of Mutual Covenant of HWR21 of the same date (âDMCâ).  The DMC was entered into between the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the First Owner, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as the Second Owner and Asian Harbour Company Limited (âAsian Harbourâ) as the Management Company which undertook tomanage HWR21 on the terms and conditions of the DMC.  Asian Harbour was also an associated company of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  After that, some of the units in HWR21 were sold to various owners.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant remained as the owner of the ground, 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of HWR21 until those units were transferred to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant in 2001 and then the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant in 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Between the acquisition of HWR23 and its redevelopment, the height restriction in the locality was relaxed which resulted in unusedplot ratio for HWR21.  This unused plot ratio could not be used by HWR21 unless the entire building thereon was demolished and redeveloped,but could be used by HWR23 if HWR23 was redeveloped as an extension of HWR21, which was what the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant already had in mind.  Through Asian Harbour, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant negotiated with the then owners of HWR21 for the purchase of the unused plot ratio of HWR21 to be used in redevelopingHWR23. On 29 September 1994, Asian Harbour representing the owners of HWR21 executed a Deed of Grant assigning the unused plot ratioto the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in consideration of a sum of $3,516,543.78.  Under the Deed of Grant, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant covenanted to observe all the covenants in the DMC and to indemnify the owners of HWR21 against non-performance of thesaid covenants.  About two years later, the Plaintiff was incorporated by the co-owners of HWR21 on 28 June 1996.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The redevelopment of HWR23 proceeded.  A twenty-four storey building was completed and occupation permit was issued on 1 May 1997. The two old common staircases were demolished and floor slabs were built connecting the two buildings and providing additional floorareas with access from HWR23.  Two sets of wall openings were made.  One set was at the 1<sup>st</sup> Wall and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wall connecting the lift lobbies from ground floor to 14<sup>th</sup> floor (â1<sup>st</sup> Openingsâ).  The other set was within the staircase of HWR21 from 1<sup>st</sup> floor to 4<sup>th</sup> floor and from 13<sup>th</sup> floor to 14<sup>th</sup> floor (â2<sup>nd</sup> Openingsâ).  There is no staircase within HWR23 save from 15<sup>th</sup> floor to the roof.  The staircase of HWR21 therefore serves both HWR21 and HWR23.  In addition, in early 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant installed a glass curtain wall on the external wall from the 1<sup>st</sup> floor to 4<sup>th</sup> floor of HWR23 which extended to and covered that of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor to 4<sup>th</sup> floor of HWR21.  Some of the common facilities of HWR21 were relocated to HWR23 and new facilities were installed to serve both buildings. HWR23 was also managed by Asian Harbour.  As an integral building, HWR23 uses some of the common areas and facilities of HWR21 andvice-versa.  The common boundary between HWR21 and HWR23 became indistinguishable and meaningless.  In 1998, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant demolished the remaining part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Wall on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 thereby connecting it with the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR23 so that the two floors could be let out as one unit.  The 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 was then assigned to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant on 15 June 2001.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  All went well while the two buildings were under the management of Asian Harbour.  On 30 September 1999, at a meeting of the managementcommittee of the Plaintiff and Asian Harbour, it was agreed that the cost of managing the common areas and facilities of HWR21 usedby the owners of HWR21 and HWR23 in common shall be shared in accordance with the ratio of the building areas of the two buildings,i.e. 43.21 to 56.79 (â43/57 Ratioâ) while the cost of managing the common areas and facilities of HWR21 which were not to beused by the owner of HWR23 shall be borne by the owners of HWR21.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Presumably feeling that Asian Harbour, being a related company of the Defendants, was not acting to the best interest of the Plaintiff,the Plaintiff terminated the appointment of Asian Harbour as manager of HWR21 and replaced it with Pacific Rich Management &amp;Consultants Limited (âPacific Richâ) on 30 September 2000.  Upon the advice of Pacific Rich, the Plaintiff took the stance thatthe owner of HWR23 should contribute to the cost of managing all the common areas and facilities of HWR21 and not just limited tothe cost of managing the common areas and facilities used by the owner of HWR23 in common with owners of HWR21.  The Plaintiff demandedadditional contribution from the Defendants.  The Defendants refused to accede to the demands.  On 30 August 2005, the Plaintiffthrough their solicitors wrote to the Defendants to complain for the first time about the wall openings and related works.  Withthe conviction fuelled by Pacific Rich and those advising them that they were entitled to restrain the Defendants from using thecommon facilities of HWR21 unless the Defendants meet their demand, the Plaintiff commenced the present proceedings.</p>    <p class="heading">Dramatis Personae</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Plaintiff is the incorporated owners of HWR21.

Last minute amendments to the Amended Statement of Claim wereobjected to and disallowed.  Despite that, the factual witnesses attempted to raise new issues in their evidence.  The factual witnessesâevidence is inconsistent with their expertâs.  It appears that they have run out of concert with their legal team.  With respectto those representing the Plaintiff, the Plaintiffâs case is disorientated.  The following non-issues were raised by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Lui was equivocal as to the ownership of the glass curtain wall but asserted that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has the responsibility to maintain it.  That assertion is inconsistent with the Plaintiffâs expert evidence that thePlaintiff has sole control over the external wall including the glass curtain wall and hence the responsibility of its maintenanceand repairs.  The glass curtain wall was also described in the report of Pacific Rich of April 2005 as an improvement.  The responsibilityfor the maintenance of the glass curtain wall has not been pleaded.  I shall not deal with it.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mr Cheung, counsel for the Plaintiff, sought a last minute amendment to the Amended Statement of Claim to plead the invalidity ofthe Deed of Grant.  That application was refused.  Despite that, Cheong maintained her equivocal challenge to the validity of theDeed of Grant.  She alleged that she did not know what was the underlying transaction under the Deed of Grant and was misled by AsianHarbour into agreeing to the transaction, despite that she attended the meeting when the sale of the surplus plot ratio of HWR21was agreed and she subsequently received the monetary consideration of $200,000 odd. </p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr Cheung raised another un-pleaded issue that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant encroached on an open space directly outside the old common staircase on the ground floor of HWR21.  That was objectedto by Mr Li, counsel for the Defendants, as being an un-pleaded issue.  The objection was quite unnecessary as it was obvious fromthe building plan annexed to the DMC that the space was also assigned to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant under the Assignment and to which the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was given exclusive possession under the DMC.  I disallowed the issue as a matter of principle.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Cheong said she was induced into consenting to the wall opening works because of representations made to her by Leung and variousother staff of Asian Harbour.  The Plaintiffâs pleaded case is that it never consented and not that it consented as a result ofrepresentations made by Asian Harbour.  Accordingly, this issue is also disallowed.</p>    <p class="heading">Credibility of witnesses</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  This is a case which is heavily documented.  There is little room for witnesses to traverse outside the incontrovertible and contemporaneousdocuments.  There are some factual disputes between the parties but those disputes can be resolved by reference to those documentswhich deserve greater weight.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In respect of the Plaintiffâs witnesses, I find Lui gave evidence in a half-hearted manner.  He was unable to provide answersto a number of questions while under cross-examination.  He was evasive.  I find Cheong a very protective witness.  She said shewas not explained about the DMC by her lawyer and had no knowledge about the peculiar provision of clause 2(b) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC.  Most of her evidence is inconsistent with the contemporaneous documents.  I find her incredible.  As for the Defendantsâwitnesses, their evidence is consistent with the contemporaneous documents.  I find them credible.  But as I said, this finding isnot crucial as this is a case which is heavily documented.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  As for the Plaintiffâs expert witness, despite his qualification as an architect and authorised person, I have found Yip not qualifiedto give expert evidence on structural aspects of the building on HWR21 due to his lack of qualification in structural engineering. That apart, his evidence is in general agreement with the Defendantâs expert, Shun, who was the authorised person in respect ofthe later stage of development of HWR21 and the entire development of HWR23.  This is a case which has to be resolved on the basisof the rights and obligations of the parties under the DMC.  The expertsâ evidence on architectural and engineering aspects ofthe building on HWR21 has little bearing towards the outcome of this case.</p>    <p class="heading">The Assignment</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Central to this dispute is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs rights and obligation under the Assignment and DMC.  It should be recalled that the redevelopment of HWR21 was completedwith the two old common staircases remaining intact and enclosed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Wall within HWR21.  After completion of the building and before the sale of any of the units therein, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant assigned the Staircase Spaces to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant by the Assignment dated 25 May 1988.  In the preamble to the Assignment, it was stated that HWR21 was notionally dividedinto 921 shares of which 10 shares were allocated to the property to be assigned which is more particularly described in the Schedule. The property is described in paragraph 1(a) of the Schedule in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â(a)    Description and address:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">         the exclusive right to hold use occupy and enjoy ALL THOSE Staircase Spaces adjoining No. 23 Hillwood Road from the groundfloor to the 5<sup>th</sup> floor (both inclusive) as more particularly coloured pink and pink hatched black on the plan annexed hereto for reference only ofVincent Commercial Centre (æ°¸ååæ¥­ä¸­å¿) No.21 Hillwood Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong together with the sole and exclusive rightas the owner of such Staircase Spaces</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)  to grant to the owner or owners of any adjoining building or buildings the rights in common with the co-owners of the Propertyand the Building to use the areas in the Building and the facilities therein (including the lifts thereof) the use of which has notbeen reserved unto any particular owner Provided the owner or owners of such adjoining building or buildings shall bear a due proportionof the costs of managing such common areas pro rata to the respective gross floor areas of the Building and such adjoining buildingor buildings;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(ii)           to amend the plans of the Building approved by the Building Authority in any lawful manner so long as the exclusiveright of possession of the other co-owners to the other Units in the Building with reasonable access and other rights thereto arenot unreasonably adversely affected;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iii)          to demolish such of the walls of the Building the exclusive possession of which is vested in the owner of the StaircaseSpaces Provided such demolition is otherwise lawful and the owner of such Staircase Spaces or the owner of the adjoining buildingshall be responsible for such demolition cost and to make good all damage or injury whether to the Building or to any other buildingor property or to any person caused by or on account of such demolition;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(iv)         to relocate the cable ducts coloured yellow hatched black on the plans annexed to the Deed of Mutual Covenant â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In the context of the Assignment, the word âBuildingâ means the building on HWR21, whereas the word âPropertyâ referredto in the preamble of the Assignment and as defined in the Schedule and referred to in the plan annexed to the Assignment means (i)the two old common staircases; (ii) the connecting old party wall and (iii) an open and un-built space within the boundary line ofHWR21, which probably served as part of the patio for the two old buildings.</p>    <p class="heading">The Deed of Mutual Covenant</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  On the same day of the assignment of the Staircase Spaces to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the First Owner entered into the DMC with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as the Second Owner and Asian Harbour as the Management Company.  Clauses 2(b), 7(b), 8(a) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> and clauses 1(b) and 5 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the DMC are relevant.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Clause 2(b) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC is an exact replication of paragraph 1(a) of the Schedule to the Assignment.  Under clause 2(b), the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was granted the sole and exclusive right as the owner of the two old staircases with rights which were precisely wordedin the same terms as those contained in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) of paragraph 1(a) of the Schedule to the Assignment.  But, inthe context of the DMC, the word âPropertyâ referred to in the preamble of the DMC and as defined in the Schedule means the landand building on which HWR21 is situated, whereas the word âBuildingâ means the building on HWR21.  Effectively, the words meanthe same thing.  Despite this, the difference between the meaning of the word âPropertyâ in the Assignment and in the DMC hasno difference in effect on the rights and obligations of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant under the two documents.  Under both documents, the Staircase Spaces were allocated 10 of 921 equal and undivided sharesin HWR21.  It was pursuant to this clause that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant granted to the owner and occupiers of HWR23 the right to use some of the common areas and facilities of HWR21.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The other relevant clauses under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC are as follows:</p>    <p>â7.     (b)  Each owner shall not make any alterations (whether structural or otherwise) to or additions to the exterior of hisUnit without the consent of the Manager and shall not make any window or other aperture in any part of the wall dividing his Unitfrom the parts of the said Building in common use.â</p>    <blockquote>        <p> â8.   Subject to Clause 2(b) hereof the owner or owners for the time being of each undivided share in the Property and the saidBuilding shall at all times during the subsistence of this Deed be bound by and observe and perform the covenants and conditionshereinafter contained, namely:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)  Not to make any addition or alteration to the said Building or any part thereof nor to the Unit of which he is the owner norto make any window or other aperture in any part of the wall dividing his Unit from the parts of the said Building in common usenor to damage, injure or interfere with any part of the said Building it equipment apparatus and services.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Clauses 1(b) and 5 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the DMC provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1.   (b)   All acts and decisions of the Managers in accordance with the provisions of this Deed in respect of any of the mattersaforesaid shall be binding in all respects on all the owners for the time being of undivided shares in the Property and the saidBuilding.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">  â5.    The Managers shall be the Attorney for and on behalf of all owners in respect of all matters concerning the Common Areasfor which the Managers are herein authorised to act.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is beyond argument that despite the incorporation of the Plaintiff on 28 June 1996, Asian Harbour as the Management Company ofHWR21 was the attorney for and on behalf of the Plaintiff and all owners of HWR21 in respect of matters concerning the common areasand facilities of HWR21 until 30 September 2000.  Until then, their acts and decisions in respect of those matters were binding onthe Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">The Deed of Grant</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The Deed of Grant was entered into on 29 September 1994 between Asian Harbour representing all the then owners of HWR21 as grantoron the one part and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as grantee on the other.  The then owners of HWR21 were effectively the Plaintiffâs predecessor in title.  Under clause1 of the Deed of Grant, the then owners of HWR21 assigned to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant the unused plot ratio of HWR21.  Under clause 2, the then owners of HWR21 covenanted with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that the conditions of the Crown lease in respect of HWR21 and the DMC were valid and that the terms and the Crown rentpayable and conditions contained in the Crown lease and DMC had been paid or performed.  Under clause 3 of the Deed of Grant, the1<sup>st</sup> Defendant covenanted with the then owners of HWR21 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p> â3.  AND the Grantee hereby covenants with the Grantor that the Grantee will in the exercise of the rights hereunder perform andobserve all the covenants terms and conditions contained in the Conditions and the Deed of Mutual Covenant and indemnify the Grantoragainst the non-performance of the said covenants terms and conditions.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>By this clause, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant covenanted with the then owners of HWR21 that it will observe all the covenants terms and conditions contained in the Conditionsand the DMC and indemnify them against the non-performance of the said covenants, terms and conditions when exercising the rightsunder the Deed of Grant.  The claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is partly made pursuant to this clause.</p>    <p class="heading">The approach to the construction of the Assignment and the DMC</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  The rights and obligations of the parties depend significantly on the construction to be given to the Assignment, the DMC and theDeed of Grant.  Mr Cheung submits that construction of such documents must be done in the context and using a purposive approach. He also submits that there are no limits as to what can be regarded as the background but that previous negotiations of the partiesand declaration of subjective intents are excluded.  He argues that the evidence of the Defendantsâ intention of developing HWR21and HWR23 as one integral building must be excluded from the factual background.  He quoted <i>Ng Chun Kong and First Star Development Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%203%20HKLRD%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 3 HKLRD 281</a> at paras 27 to 28 and <i>National Bank of Sharjah v Dellborg and Others</i> QBCMF 96/0431/B in support of his proposition.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  I have no doubt about the correctness of the proposition of the law as quoted by Mr Cheung.  It is consistent with the leading caseson construction of documents such as the House of Lordâs decisions in <i>Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20WLR%20989" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 WLR 989</a> and <i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd and West Bromwich Building Society</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20896" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 896</a> and the Court of Final Appealâs decision in <i>Jumbo King Ltd and Faithful Properties Ltd &amp; Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%204%20HKC%20707" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 4 HKC 707</a> at 726 to 727.  Construction of a contract is the ascertainment of the meaning which the contract would convey to a reasonable personhaving all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they wereat the time of the contract.  The background or factual matrix, as it is often called, includes absolutely anything which would haveaffected the way in which the language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man.  Thus in the passage in <i>Ng Chun Kong and First Star Development Ltd</i>, relied on by Mr Cheung, Le Pichon JA quoted Lord Wilberforceâs speech in <i>Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen</i> at 995H-996A:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNo contracts are made in a vacuum: there is always a setting in which they have to be placed.  The nature of what is legitimateto have regard to is usually described as âthe surrounding circumstancesâ but this phrase is imprecise; it can be illustratedbut hardly defined.  In a commercial contract it is certainly right that the court should know the commercial purpose of the contractand this in turn presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the partiesare operating.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is here that I disagree with Mr Cheungâs submission when applying the above principle of construction to the facts of the presentcase.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Despite that HWR23 was developed after a lapse of nine years since the completion of HWR21, an important feature in this case isthat it was the undisputed intention of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the developer of the two buildings to develop the two buildings as one integral development.  For that purpose, variousmeasures were planned and executed in connection with the later development of HWR23. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Firstly, the 1<sup>st</sup> Wall was built against the old party wall and the old staircases from the ground to the 5<sup>th</sup> floors of HWR21 so as to minimize the disturbance to the occupiers of HWR21 when the old building in HWR23 and the old party wallstanding on HWR23 were to be demolished. </p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Secondly, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wall, i.e. the external wall of HWR21 from the 6<sup>th</sup> to the 15<sup>th</sup> floors adjacent to HWR23 was built along the boundary line.  It is the common view of the experts on both sides that the part ofthis wall which adjoined the building on HWR23 lost its character as an external wall of HWR21 and became an internal partition uponcompletion of the redevelopment of HWR23.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Thirdly, provisions were written into the Assignment and clause 2(b) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC so that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as assignee of the Staircase Spaces was given the right to grant to the owner of HWR23 the rights in common with the otherco-owners of HWR21, i.e. to access and use the common areas and facilities of HWR21; to amend the building plans of HWR21 and todemolish the old party wall and the old common staircases standing on HWR21.  To grant a co-owner the right to allow adjacent ownersto use the common areas and facilities in a building is a most peculiar provision to be found in a deed of mutual covenant.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Apart from the above factual circumstances, the parties to the Assignment were the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the assignor and the then owner of the entire interest in HWR21 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as assignee.  The parties to the DMC were the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the First Owner, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as the Second Owner and Asian Harbour as the Management Company.  All the three parties were and are associated companiesof which Woo was the directing mind.  The parties knew they were planning an integral building to be built on HWR21 and HWR23.  Theymade structural provisions to enable the future development of HWR23 as one integral building with HWR21.  With that in mind, theyinstructed their lawyers to prepare the DMC making the necessary legal provisions to enable that end to be carried out.  The DMCis a commercial contract.  The parties, being associated companies, must have knowledge of the genesis of the transaction and thebackground under which the DMC was drawn up.  What was the subjective intention of Woo must also be the common intention of all theparties to the Assignment and the DMC of whom Woo was the controlling mind.  It is just contrary to common sense and legal principleto exclude from the factual matrix what the parties knew and intended to be the purpose of the Assignment and the DMC.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  With the genesis of the DMC in mind and adopting a purposive approach, it is plainly obvious that the common and practical objectintended to be achieved by the Assignment and the DMC is to enable HWR23 to be developed as an extension of HWR21.  In this connection,it should be recalled that it is also the evidence of the Defendantsâ expert, Shun, who was the authorised person for the developmenton HWR23 that there was no point to acquire the unused plot ratio of HWR21 by the Deed of Grant if HWR23 was not developed as anextension of HWR21.  It must therefore be within the contemplation of the parties to the Assignment and the DMC that in order toachieve that purpose, some walls would have to be demolished or wall openings made so that the buildings on the two lots would mergeinto one integral building and the buildings on the two lots would share in the use of some common facilities.  It must also be foreseenthat those works would be carried out when the development on HWR23 is completed.  The Assignment and DMC must be construed againstthe above background.</p>    <p class="heading">The construction of clause 2(b) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  The provisions in clause 2(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC are obviously drafted in such a way as to give effect to the above common intention of the parties.  Clause 2(b)(ii) gavethe 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant the right to amend the plans of HWR21.  The only limitation was that the exclusive right of possession of the other co-ownersin HWR21 and their access to their units were not unreasonably adversely affected.  Clause 2(b)(iii) gave the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant the right to demolish such of the walls of the old common staircase and adjoining party wall the exclusive possession ofwhich was vested in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant itself.  That right was only subject to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs obligation to make good any damage or injury caused to the building or other persons.  Clause 2(b)(iv) gave the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant the right to relocate the cable ducts in the common areas of HWR21 subject to the obligation of making good all damageor injury to the building or other persons.  Those rights were exercisable by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as a co-owner of HWR21 even without seeking consent from the Plaintiff or the co-owners of HWR21 who were and are boundby the terms of DMC thus entered into between the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the First Owner and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as the Second Owner.  But it should be noted that this clause does not empower the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to make the various wall openings or to install the glass curtain wall.  There is no dispute between the parties aboutthe construction of the above sub-clauses.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The focal point of counselâs argument is on the proper construction of clause 2(b)(i) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC.  Under this sub-clause, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant may grant to the owner of HWR23 the rights in common with the co-owners of HWR21 to use the common areas and facilitiessubject to their bearing â<b><i>a due proportion</i></b> of the cost of managing and maintaining <b><i>such</i></b> common areas pro rata to the respective gross floor areasâ of the buildings on HWR21 and HWR23.  Mr Cheung contends that as AsianHarbourâs duty to manage HWR21 under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the DMC is a very wide one, including management, operation, servicing, maintenance, repair and insurance of HWR21, on a commonsense construction of clause 2(b)(i) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC, the obligation of the co-owner of HWR23 to contribute to the cost of managing the common areas of HWR21 pro rata mustmean the cost of managing all the common areas and facilities of HWR21 irrespective whether the common areas and facilities wereused by the co-owner of HWR23 or whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant has allowed them to be used by the co-owner of HWR23.  He further argues that as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant wanted the co-owner of HWR23 to have the rights in common with the co-owners of HWR21 to use the common areas and facilitiesof HWR21, it must mean the rights to use all the common areas and facilities of HWR21 and to contribute to the cost of managing allthe common areas and facilities.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  With respect, that broad brush approach is inconsistent with common sense.  The obligation of the owner of HWR23 is to bear âadue proportionâ of the cost of managing and maintaining such common areas.  The words in quote are significant.  Those words canbe deleted in their entirety without affecting the language of that clause.  If those words were deleted, it will give the meaningcontended by Mr Cheung, i.e. the owner of HWR23 shall bear the cost of maintaining such the common areas and facilities of HWR 21pro rata to the gross floor areas of the two buildings.  Those words could not have been included in the clause for no reason.  Theonly possible reason is that they were to limit the contribution to an appropriate proportion of the cost of managing the commonareas and facilitiesthe use of which was granted by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to the owner of HWR23 as against all the common areas and facilities.  This construction is consistent with the word âsuchâpreceding the words âcommon areasâ.  It is reasonable and makes good sense.  On the other hand, Mr Cheungâs construction givesrise to grotesque and unreasonable results.  One may obviously ask why the owner of HWR23 has to pay for festive decoration, repairand maintenance of the external walls of HWR21.  If the words are capable of giving rise to two constructions, it is trite law thatthe court will prefer the one which yields a more reasonable result than the other.  The reason is simple.  The court will generallyadopt an objective approach, that is to say it will consider what would have been the intention of reasonable persons in the positionof the actual parties to the contract: see <i>Lewison, The Interpretation of Contracts</i>, paragraph 2.05.  In my opinion, on the proper construction of clause 2(b)(i) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC, the obligations of the owner of HWR23 is to contribute to the cost of managing the common areas and facilities whichthe owner of HWR23 is authorised by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to use, whether in fact they are used or not.  The amount of contribution is pro rata to the respective gross floor areasof the two buildings, i.e. the 43/57 Ratio.  It may be increased or decreased, if the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant seeks to vary the extent of the use of the common areas and facilities it would wish to grant to owner of HWR23.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Mr Cheung argues that the grant by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to the owner of HWR23 of the right to use the common areas and facilities in HWR21 was only made once sometime after 1May 1997 and there is no evidence of a similar grant to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant when it became the owner of HWR23 on 14 October 2005 and hence the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant and its occupiers and/or licensees have been trespassing on HWR21 when using the common areas and facilities of HWR21. Whether the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant has granted the right to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant is a matter between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants.  There is no issue between them that the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant has not been granted such right.  It is not an issue before this Court.  Mr Cheungâs argument does not assist the Plaintiffâsclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Then, Mr Cheung argues that there is no mechanism for the Plaintiff to monitor and ascertain what has actually been granted by the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to the owner and occupiers of HWR23 and such further grant from the owner and occupiers of HWR23 to their licensees.  Thusthe Plaintiff has no way to exercise an effective control on the access to such of its common areas and facilities which are effectivelyturned into a public place.  I fail to see how such argument could assist the Court in preferring the construction in favour of thePlaintiff.  There is nothing to prevent the Plaintiff from ascertaining from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant the nature and extent of its grant to the owner of HWR23.  HWR23 is principally being used as offices.  The problems raisedby Mr Cheung are just matters of practical enforcement, which in any event is difficult for commercial buildings with tenants engagedin the sort of services, such as private bars and clubs, operated by the co-owners and tenants of HWR21.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  The above construction applies equally to paragraph 1(a)(i) to (iv) of the Assignment which is worded in identical terms.  Havingdealt with the construction of the Assignment and the DMC, I now turn to the various claims of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">The encroachment claim</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  As submitted by Mr Li, the Plaintiffâs encroachment claim is convoluted and difficult to understand.  The Plaintiff made two encroachmentclaims against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants, one in respect of the demolition of the old common staircase and the adjoining party wall and one in respect of the wallopenings.  The claim is made against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the developer of HWR21 and HWR23, which is understandable.  But the claim against the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant who became the owner of the ground, 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of HWR21 since October 2005 is utterly incomprehensible.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  In respect of the demolition of the old common staircase and the connecting party wall, I have already found that the space occupiedby those structures, i.e. the Staircase Spaces, were assigned to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant under the Assignment.  The plans annexed to the Assignment and the DMC show clearly that the space assigned included boththe staircase walls and the old party wall between the two staircases.  They were shown coloured red and red hatched black on theplan annexed to the DMC.  Mr Cheung argues that the plan annexed to the Assignment was stated to be âfor reference onlyâ andnot for identification.  Be that as it may, the plan has been incorporated into the conveyance.  The property stated to be assignedunder the Schedule to the Assignment clearly described it as âmore particularly coloured pink and pink hatched black on the planannexed heretoâ.  There is nothing to suggest that the plan is inconsistent with the above description.  The areas coloured pinkand pink hatched black covered the two old staircases and the old connecting party wall between them.  It also covered a small openun-built areas within the boundary line of HWR21 immediately adjoining the steps at the rear staircase which probably served as apatio for the old building.  The Staircase Spaces were converted into floor areas on each of the floors delineated by the 1<sup>st</sup> Wall inside HWR21 which are not accessible from HWR21 but are accessible from HWR23 (except on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 because of the removal of that part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Wall on that floor).  Under clause 2(a) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was given exclusive possession of those spaces.  Clause 2(b)(ii) gave the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant the right to amend the plans of the HWR21 in any lawful manner so long as the exclusive right of possession of the otherco-owners of HWR21 were not unreasonably adversely affected.  Clause 2(b)(iii) specifically gave to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant the right to demolish the walls the exclusive possession of which was vested in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as owner of the Staircase Spaces assigned to it under the Assignment.  It is the common view of the experts that the demolitionwork was in accordance with the amended building plans and was lawfully executed.  There is no argument or evidence that the otherco-owners of HWR21 had been unreasonably adversely affected by the demolition.  There is no requirement that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had to obtain prior consent from the Plaintiff for such demolition and construction work.  The demolition of the old staircasesand the old connecting party wall as well as the construction of the floor slabs were what the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as owner of the Staircase Spaces is entitled to do under the Assignment and the DMC which is binding on the co-owners ofHWR21.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as the owner of the Staircase Spaces is perfectly entitled to allow the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to execute the demolition and construction works and to allow the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant whether as a co-owner of the ground, 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of HWR21 or as the owner of HWR23 to use the areas constructed from the Staircase Spaces.  There is no encroachment of HWR21by the owner of HWR23 or by anybody at all.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  In respect of the wall openings, it is difficult to understand how and why the wall openings can constitute an encroachment on HWR21. As submitted by Mr Li, there simply cannot be an ouster of possession of any part of HWR 21 by the openings made on the walls. My comment here is without prejudice to the Plaintiffâs other claims in respect of the openings.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Accordingly, the Plaintiffâs claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants for an injunction to demolish and remove the structures built in the old common staircase assigned to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant must be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  For the same reasons, the Plaintiffâs claim against the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant for damages for trespass and demolition of the old party wall and common staircases of HWR21 must also be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The Plaintiffâs alternative claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants is for a declaration that the ground and additional space obtained as a result of the demolition of the old common staircasesand the adjoining party wall are the property of all the co-owners of HWR21 and form the common areas of HWR21.  The ground and additionalspaces were the Staircase Spaces the exclusive possession of which were given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant under the Assignment and clause 2(b) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC.  They are not common areas of HWR21.  The Plaintiff cannot have a valid claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  It is also impossible to understand the basis on which the claim is made against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants who have no proprietary right to the space or the right to exclusive possession of the space.  This alternative claimis absurd and must be dismissed.  The Plaintiffâs further alternative claim to a declaration that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants are in breach of the DMC and/or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s34i.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 34I(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> must also be dismissed for the same reason. </p>    <p class="heading">The glass curtain wall claim</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim is that the glass curtain wall was installed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on the external wall of HWR21 without the consent of the co-owners of HWR21 and that the Plaintiff has no obligation tomaintain the glass curtain wall which is now in disrepair.  The primary issue here is whether the Plaintiff or Asian Harbour as theManagement Company of HWR21 had consented to the installation of the glass curtain wall. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  The circumstances leading to the installation of the glass curtain wall were as follows.  By 1996, nine years lapsed since the completionof the building on HWR21.  The external wall of the building on HWR21 fell into disrepairs.  At the time, the development of HWR23was near completion.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was contemplating installing a glass curtain wall on the external wall on the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> floors of the building on HWR23.  In September 1996, Woo in his capacity as director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, discussed with Leung representing Asian Harbour as the Management Company of HWR21, about installing a glass curtain wallon the 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> floors of HWR21 which would merge with the glass curtain wall to be built on the building on HWR23.  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant offered to contribute $200,000 to the owners of HWR21 for the project.  Asian Harbour issued a notice to convene an extraordinarymeeting of the owners of HWR21 to discuss the proposal.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  At the extraordinary meeting held on 11 November 1996, Leung tabled the proposal for renovation work which included, inter alia,installing a glass curtain wall on the front and right side of HWR21 adjacent to HWR23.  The estimated cost was about $1,350,000. According to the minutes of the meeting, Cheong felt that the cost of renovation was high and wished the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, as the developer, would provide some financial assistance.  It was then resolved not to consider the installation furtheruntil the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had offered financial assistance.  Paragraph 2.4 of the minutes of the meeting recorded as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>  ãæ³åä¸»å¸­æ¹å¤ªè¬æä¸é é ç®è¨ï¼æ¯å±¤æ¥­ä¸»æå°è² æ$135,000 (ä¸è¨åå±¤é»æ¢¯å¤§å è£ä¿®)ï¼æ­¤è²»å¯¦ä¸è²ï¼æå¸æç¼å±åèæ®è½å¦å°æ°¸ååæ¥­ä¸­å¿æä¾è¥å¹²åªæ ãå¨ç¼å±åæªææåºæéåªæ äºæ¥­ä¸»/æ³åèæ®åï¼AåDé æ«ä¸ä½æ·±å¥è¨è«ãã</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then according to Leung, after discussing the matter with Woo, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant agreed to undertake the installation of the glass curtain wall on the front side of HWR21 only.  The glass curtain wallwas installed with the full cooperation of the owners and tenants of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> floors of HWR21.  Some signage and air conditioners had to be cleared and removed.  The cost of demolition of the unauthorised structureswere paid by the owners and tenants of the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of HWR21. </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  According to Leung, at the extraordinary meeting held on 11 November 1996, the co-owners of HWR21 had agreed in principle to theproject save that Cheong had asked Asian Harbour to request the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for more financial incentive.  But Cheong denied any agreement having been reached at the meeting. </p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Mr Li submits that Cheongâs evidence is not to be believed.  That I agree.  Cheong is an utterly unreliable witness.  However,Leungâs evidence that agreement in principle to install the glass curtain wall was reached at the meeting was inconsistent withthe minutes of the meeting.  Mr Li submits that the meeting was only attended by a handful of members of the management committeeof the Plaintiff and was not conducted in a formal manner.  Hence, he draws the analogy from company law on informal consent andsubmits that recording of resolutions passed in a formal manner is not to be expected in such an informal meeting but that agreementwas indeed reached.  I also have difficulty with that submission.  The meeting was not a meeting of the management committee or aninformal meeting between the Plaintiff and Asian Harbour as the Management Company.  It was an extraordinary meeting of the Plaintiffwhich was properly and formally convened by Asian Harbour.  The meeting was attended by seven representatives of the owners, includingLeung representing the owners of the ground and 1<sup>st</sup> floors; by a representative of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and Yeung with another member of Asian Harbour.  Yeung was the person who wrote the minutes.  If there was an agreementin principle reached, she would have so recorded.  If she had missed it, Leung would have corrected it.  The unequivocal conclusionrecorded in the minutes was that the Plaintiff in general meeting resolved not to discuss the matter further until the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had come up with an offer of financial assistance.  By no reading of those minutes can it be said that any agreement onthe installation of the glass curtain wall had been reached with Asian Harbour or the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant or that the Plaintiff consented to the installation to be carried out.  However, the tone of the minutes suggests thatthough no express agreement or approval for the installation was given by the Plaintiff, there was nevertheless no objection to orprohibition against the installation.  That was perhaps interpreted by Leung as an agreement in principle.  In any event, Leungâsevidence, put to the highest, was that the Plaintiff reached agreement in principle.  In my view, an agreement in principle is anagreement to agree which is short of a concluded agreement or consent.  </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  It never was Leungâs evidence that following his discussion with Woo, he reported the new offer to the Plaintiff or its managementcommittee or Cheong.  There was not a single piece of documentation showing that the Plaintiff was informed about the new offer orthe execution of the installation work.  The work was executed with the cooperation of the owners and tenants of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> floors.  The 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors were at the time owned by Wrencrest Estates Limited which was also an associated company of the Defendants.  Thus, what probablyhappened was that Leung thought the Plaintiff had no objection to the installation if the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would provide some financial assistance.  With the problem of finance being wholly resolved by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant agreeing to pay for all the cost of installation, he assumed Asian Harbour had authority to give consent on behalf of thePlaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to execute the work.  The owners of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> floors might have consented to the work.  But they have no authority to give such consent as the external wall was part of the commonareas of HWR21, which those owners did not have the right to exclusive possession.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Mr Li seeks to rely on the clauses 1(b) and 5 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the DMC which provide respectively that the decisions of the Management Company in respect of the management of the building isbinding on all the owners and that the Management Company shall be the attorney for and on behalf of all owners in respect of allmatters concerning the common areas for which the Management Company was authorised to act.  Leung knew the Plaintiff had not givenexpress consent to the installation work.  Leung being a common staff of Asian Harbour and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, his knowledge must be attributed to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  Despite that, there was nevertheless no express prohibition against the installation.  It never was the Plaintiffâscase that it prohibited the installation.  There is nothing to suggest Leung or Woo were acting in bad faith in executing the installationworks.  Indeed, even according to the report of Pacific Rich, the glass curtain wall was an improvement to HWR21.  The future costof maintenance apart, the glass curtain wall was a benefit to HWR21.  In consenting to the installation of the glass curtain wall,Asian Harbour was acting in the Plaintiffâs interest and within clause 1(b) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the DMC.  Accordingly, that consent was binding on the owners of HWR21 under clause 5 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the DMC.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Lastly, Mr Li submits that there has been acquiescence or waiver on the part of the Plaintiff or that the Plaintiff should be estoppedfrom raising objection.  Cheong said she did not object to the installation works because she had been misled by Leung and Yeungthat the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had authority to install the glass curtain wall under the DMC and the Deed of Grant.  That allegation was never pleaded. In any event, I reject her evidence.  The Plaintiff averred in its Reply to the Defence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant suffered no detriment as the cost of installation was part and parcel of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs construction cost for developing HWR23.  That plainly could not be correct as material and labour were spent on installingthat part of the glass curtain wall on HWR21, which had nothing to do with the construction cost of HWR23.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The Plaintiff suggested that there was no waiver because the Plaintiff did not have legal advice about breaches of the DMC until2005.  The fact is that since the appointment of Pacific Rich in 2000, the Plaintiff had been informed of alleged breaches of theDMC.  Furthermore, on the Plaintiffâs case, the installation was a blatant act of trespass.  It hardly lies in the Plaintiffâsmouth to argue that it did not know its right had been infringed when the glass curtain wall was being installed.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The principle of law on acquiescence has been succinctly stated by Thesiger LJ in <i>De Bussche v Alt</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=8%20Ch%20D%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">8 Ch D 314</a> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf a person having a right, and seeing another person about to commit, or in the course of committing, an act infringing upon thatright, stands by in such a manner as really to induce the person committing the act, and who might otherwise have abstained fromit, to believe that he assents to its being committed, he cannot afterwards be heard to complain of the act.  This, as Lord Cottenhamsaid in <i>Leeds v Amherst</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=16%20LJ%20Ch%205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">16 LJ Ch 5</a>, is the proper sense of the term âacquiescenceâ, and in that sense may be defined as quiescence under such circumstances as thatassent may be reasonably inferred from it, and is no more than an instance of the law of estoppel by words or conduct.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The Plaintiff knew about the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs proposal to install the glass curtain wall on HWR21 so as to merge with the glass curtain wall to be built on the buildingstanding on HWR23.  Though short of an agreement or express consent, the Plaintiff indicated no objection to the installation butwanted it to be partially financed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The installation was properly designed and approved by the Building Authority.  The works were carried out openly andwith cooperation of the owners of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> floors.  Substantial cost had been incurred by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on the installation.  The Plaintiff had full knowledge of all the circumstances surrounding the installation of the glasscurtain wall and the cost involved.  Cheong admitted that she had knowledge of the installation at the time but raised no objection. The glass curtain wall was allowed to be installed there since 1997 for at least eight years without any objection.  The Plaintiffor at least some of the co-owners had the benefit of the glass curtain wall.  The installation was described as an improvement byPacific Rich in its report of April 2005.  Undoubtedly, the value of the HWR21 was enhanced. </p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Not only that the Plaintiff watched by with full knowledge of all the circumstances when its rights were being infringed, it hadthe benefit of the glass curtain wall for eight years.  It adopted the tort.  It is only when the cost of maintenance and repairof the glass curtain wall and the present dispute arose that it raised objection about the installation.  I am satisfied that thePlaintiff had with full knowledge waived its right against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and is therefore estopped from raising the objection to the glass curtain wall now.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Mr Cheung referred to the case of <i>The Incorporated Owners of Hoi Luen Industrial Centre and Anor v Ohashi Chemical Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20HKC%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 HKC 11</a> and argues that the defence of waiver, acquiescence and estoppel is not available in proceedings between co-owners and the incorporatedowners.  He relies on the fact that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant then was and the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant now is the owner of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21.  In that case, the incorporated owners of a building obtained an injunction compelling one of the co-owners to demolishand remove an air-conditioning cooling tower erected in breach of the deed of mutual covenant.  The co-owner appealed alleging thatit was unfair and unjust that it should be singled out and ordered to remove its cooling tower while other owners had done the samehad not been called upon to do so.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.  Godfrey JA held at 13:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt follows that in the instant case the plaintiffs were not only entitled but bound to take proceedings for the enforcement ofthese covenants.  It follows, too, that they could hot have granted expressly to this defendant or any other owner of any unit inthe building the right to act in contravention of the deed of mutual covenant as this defendant has done.  What cannot be done expresslycannot be done impliedly.  Although equity will sometimes restrain a plaintiff in the exercise of his legal rights because it wouldbe inequitable and unjust in all the circumstances to allow him so to exercise those legal rights, equity will not hold him boundby acquiescence to allow something which he could not have allowed by express grant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Mr Li argues that the above decision is inapplicable to the present case because the glass curtain wall was installed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in its capacity as the developer of HWR23 and not as a co-owner of HWR21.  The minutes of the extraordinary meeting on11 November 1996 showed that it was the Plaintiff who requested for financial assistance from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as developer of HWR23 to install the glass curtain wall.  There is no dispute that the installation of the glass curtainwall was financed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as developer of HWR23 and not as a co-owner of HWR21.  I agree with that submission.  Clearly, this is not a case of aco-owner breaching the DMC, but an alleged act of trespass by the developer of HWR23 who happened also to be a co-owner of HWR21. This cannot turn an act of trespass into a breach of the DMC.  The Plaintiffâs claim of breach of the DMC by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is simply misconceived.  So too is its claim against the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant who was neither a co-owner at the time of the breach nor the party who installed the glass curtain wall.  The 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant only became the owner of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 in 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Mr Li further submits that despite the decision in <i>Hoi Luen Industrial Centre</i> case, the defences are still available.  He argues that what was decided in that case and the line of cases which followed it wasthat the fact that some other co-owners were also in the same breach could not make it inequitable and unjust to restrain a plaintifffrom exercising its legal rights.  He referred to <i>Hong Yip Service Co Ltd v Candela Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20HKC%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 HKC 273</a> and submits that in granting an injunction against the co-owner, Le Pichon J (as she then was) only ruled the defence to be unavailableby reason of the scale and prevalence of the breaches and she did not castigate the defence simply on the basis of <i>Hoi Luen Industrial Centre</i> case.  I do not think that is a correct interpretation of the decision in <i>Hong Yip</i> case.  The basis of that decision was that the court found, at 285I to 286A, that the incorporated owner had neither waived its rightsto enforce the covenants under the deed of mutual covenant nor acquiesced in their breach and the point whether such defences wereavailable to a co-owner did not fall for consideration.  I do not think Mr Liâs submission is a correct interpretation of the <i>Hoi Luen Industrial Centre</i> case.  Godfrey JAâs dicta are unequivocal, at least as far as the defence of acquiescence is concerned.  I consider I am boundby <i>Hoi Luen Industrial Centre</i> case, but for reasons as I have explained that case is distinguishable from the present one. </p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Accordingly, the Plaintiffâs claim for an injunction requiring the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants to demolish and remove the glass curtain wall and the alternative claim for declaration that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants are in breach of the DMC and/or <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s34i.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 34I(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> must be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">The wall openings claim</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The Plaintiff claims against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants for an injunction requiring them to seal the various wall openings made at the lift lobbies and staircases of HWR21 forthe purpose of connecting HWR21 with HWR23.  This does not include demolition of the wall on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 adjoining HWR23 against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, which I shall deal with separately.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  The Defendantsâ case is that it was authorised by clause 2(b)(ii) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC to amend the building plans approved by the Building Authority so long as the exclusive right to possession of the otherco-owners to the other units in the building with reasonable access and other rights thereto were not unreasonably adversely affected. There is no evidence that the rights of any co-owners were unreasonably adversely affected.  There is also no dispute that the variouswall openings were made in accordance with amended plans approved by the Building Authority.  Even the Plaintiffâs own expert,Yip, confirmed that the alteration works were legitimate and did not contravene any provisions in the Building Regulations.  Theonly issue is whether the works were carried out with the consent of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  According to Woo, some time before July 1996, which was at about the same time as the incorporation of the Plaintiff, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant gave consent to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to carry out the wall opening works.  At another meeting between him and Leung representing Asian Harbour, Asian Harbour,as the Management Company of HWR21, gave consent to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to execute the works.  Asian Harbour duly obtained consent from the management committee of the Plaintiff for the executionof the works and informed the management committee of the progress.  </p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  There is an abundance of documents in support of Leungâs evidence.  On 24 July 1996, the management committee of the Plaintiff,including Cheong, attended a meeting with Yeung at Cheongâs office in which the management committee agreed to the execution ofworks in principle.  A note of the meeting was prepared and signed by Yeung.  That was followed by another meeting of the managementcommittee on 2 August 1996 attended by Cheong and three other members of the management committee in which the progress of workswas discussed.  A works schedule containing details of the works to be executed, the place and time of execution of works was tabledand agreed to by the management committee.  The works included relocation of fire services installation, installation of a new generator,sprinkler system and telephone services and the wall openings in the various lobbies and staircases.  It was recorded that the managementcommittee agreed in principle to the arrangement subject only to Asian Harbour liaising with the co-owners affected by the worksarrangement.  The minutes of the meeting was signed by Cheong.  The minutes showed that the works were executed with the knowledge,consent and cooperation of the management committee and co-owners of HWR21.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  In her evidence, Cheong did not dispute the management committee had consented to the works, but said that she did not object tothe works because it had been represented to her by Yeung that the Defendants had authority under the DMC to carry out the worksand the works had been approved by the Building Authority.  Hence the management committee was solely concerned with the steps tobe taken to minimise the disturbance and inconvenience caused by the works to the co-owners of HWR21.  Mr Li submits that Cheongâsevidence raised an un-pleaded issue that the consent was obtained by misrepresentation and that such evidence should be excluded. I would not take that submission too seriously because Cheong had disclosed the allegation, albeit very briefly, in her witnessstatement dated 5 July 2007 and if necessary leave could be granted to the Plaintiff to re-amend the Amended Statement of Claim. However, I find Cheong incredible.  Her allegation was never mentioned in any of the correspondence or minutes of the meeting orin the pleading.  She adamantly insisted that she had told her lawyers about the representation but could not explain why her lawyerswould have missed it.  </p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Furthermore, at the time Asian Harbourâs appointment as the Management Company of HWR21 had not been revoked by the Plaintiff. Pursuant clause 5 of Part 2 of the DMC, it was the attorney for and on behalf of all the owners in respect of all matters concerningthe common areas for which the Management Company was authorised to act.  Under clause 1(b) of Part 2 of the DMC, their acts anddecisions in respect of those matters were binding on all the co-owners of HWR21.  Though Asian Harbour was an associated companyof the Defendants, there is nothing to suggest that it acted otherwise than in good faith when granting consent to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to execute the works.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had the right to amend the building plans of HWR21 under clause 2(b)(ii) of Part 1 of the DMC.  Bearing in mind the factualbackground and the purpose which the DMC was intended to achieve, it must be an implied term of the DMC that the co-ownersâ consentto execute the works pursuant to the amended building plans will not be unreasonably withheld.  Thus, even if I were to hold thatthe consent given by the management committee ought to be set aside by reason of misrepresentation, the consent given by Asian Harbourwas nevertheless valid and binding on the Plaintiff.  In the circumstances, it would be futile to allow the Plaintiff to amend itsAmended Statement of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Mr Cheung contends that even if consent had been given to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants to execute the works, the consent was only a licence at will which was revoked by the Plaintiffâs solicitorsâ letterdated 30 August 2005.  This contention is not supported by any evidence from the Plaintiffâs witnesses.  There is no evidence asto the terms of the licence.  The contention is not even fully developed in argument.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Accordingly, the Plaintiffâs claim for an injunction requiring the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants to seal the various openings at the walls of HWR21 adjoining HWR23 must be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1<sup>st</sup> floor wall claim </p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  As for the demolition of the wall on the first floor of HWR21 adjoining the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR23, the Plaintiffâs case is that the wall was the external wall of HWR21 which was vested in the Plaintiff, which the3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant demolished in breach of clause 8(a) of the DMC and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s34i.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 34I(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a>.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  It is the common expert opinion of both Yip and Shun that the external wall on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 adjoining HWR23 became an internal partition upon completion of the building on HWR23.  Mr Li quoted paragraph 11.13of <i>Kim Lewison QC, The Interpretation of Contracts, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed</i>:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â11.13      A grant of part of a building will be presumed to include both sides of any external wall bounding it, and also anythingfixed to the wall.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">  In <i>Hope Brothers Ltd v Cowan</i>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1913%5d%202%20Ch%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1913] 2 Ch 312</a>, Joyce J said:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âspeaking generally in the case of a demise of one floor of a  building, or of a room on any floor which is bounded or enclosedon one or more sides by an outside wall, unless the outside wall be excepted or reserved or there be some context which leads toa contrary conclusion, prima facie the premises demised comprise the whole; that is to say both sides of the outside wall.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">  So in the absence of a reservation, a landlord may be restrained from maintaining an advertisement on the walls enclosing the demisedproperty, <i>Re Webbâs Lease</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1951%5d%20Ch%20808" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1951] Ch 808.â</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p>Hence Mr Li argues that the ownership of the internal partition wall belongs to the owner of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21, i.e. the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant at the time, and that the Plaintiff has no interest in the wall. </p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Mr Cheung argues that the external wall at the 1<sup>st</sup> floor is part of the common areas of HWR21.  He submits that for terms statutorily defined such as âexternal wallâ, âpartywallâ and âcommon areasâ, one must take the statutory definition from the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> and the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a>.  âCommon partsâ is defined in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/344" class="autolink_findacts">Building Management Ordinance</a> as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â âcommon partsâ means -</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)      the whole of a building, except such parts as have been specified or designated in an instrument registered in the Land Registryas being for the exclusive use, occupation or enjoyment of an owner; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b)     unless so specified or designated, those parts specified in Schedule 1.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>External wall is one of the items specified in Schedule 1 of the Ordinance.  On the other hand, âcommon areasâ is defined in theDMC to include an areas coloured yellow and yellow hatched black in the plan annexed to the DMC, which does not include the wallin question.  I assume the term âcommon partsâ and âcommon areasâ means the same thing.  The definition in the DMC is inclusiveand not exhaustive.  I therefore consider the statutory definition applicable despite the definition under the DMC.  Mr Cheung hasreferred me to section 54 and Schedule 2 of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123" class="autolink_findacts">Buildings Ordinance</a> but not to any statutory definition of âexternal wallâ.  I can only adopt a common sense meaning for that term, i.e. a wall whichis exposed on the outside of the building.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  However, I fail to see how Mr Cheungâs argument can assist the Plaintiff.  According to facts in this case, the wall in questionwas not an exposed wall.  It was described as the 1<sup>st</sup> Wall which was built against the two old common staircases and the old party wall adjoining the two staircases.  It was built behindanother wall within the lot boundary of HWR21.  The side of the wall adjoining HWR23 was never exposed to the outside.  It was inaccessibleto any co-owners of HWR21.  The other side of the wall was within the space to which the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had exclusive possession and was equally inaccessible to any co-owners of HWR21.  There was simply no external wall onthat side of the building.  It is more appropriate to call it an internal partition.  It is just impossible to see how this wallcould have formed any common parts or common areas for which the Plaintiff has any proprietary interest or control.  Though the assignmentin respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 has not been produced, on the evidence before me, I think it is beyond dispute that the wall in question is not partof the common areas or common parts of HWR21.  To hold otherwise would effectively deprive the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant of its right to exclusive possession of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21.  Lastly, whatever this wall is called, it is the common opinion of the experts on both sides that with the completionof the development in HWR23, it is just an internal partition wall. </p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  Furthermore, according to Woo and Leung, sometime around 20 April 1998, Leung, on behalf of Asian Harbour, gave consent to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to demolish the wall so as to enable the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 to be used together with the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR23 as one unit for letting purpose.  At the time, Asian Harbour was the common manager of HWR21 and HWR23.  The Plaintiffwas not yet incorporated.  Asian Harbour as attorney of the then existing co-owners of HWR21 and the Management Company had authorityto give such consent pursuant to clauses 1(b) and 5 of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the DMC. </p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Accordingly, the Plaintiffâs claim against the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant for an injunction requiring it to reinstate the wall on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of HWR21 adjoining HWR23 and damages for breach of the DMC must also be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Contribution claim</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>    Central to the partiesâ dispute is the Defendantsâ contribution to the cost of managing the common areas and facilities ofHWR21.  The Plaintiffâs case is that the Defendants should pay a share of all the cost of managing the common areas and facilitiesof HWR21 according to the 43/57 Ratio.  On that basis, the Plaintiff claimed a liquidated sum of $1,479,757.43 for the period fromOctober 2000 to April 2005.  The Defendants say that they are only liable to contribute a due proportion of the cost of managingthe common areas and facilities which the owner of HWR23 was actually authorised by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to use.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  On a proper construction of clause 2(b)(i) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/123#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the DMC, I agree with the Defendantsâ construction.  Mr Li submits that as the Plaintiffâs claim is on a liquidated sum basedon a purported calculation which is wrong then this claim must be dismissed.  Furthermore, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has been making contributions to maintenance of the fire services system which the Plaintiff has failed to take accountof.  The contributions were of substantial amounts.  There are also numerous other claims of expenses which obviously were solelyincurred for the benefit of the owners of HWR21 which the Plaintiff could not claim any contribution from the Defendants.  Theseinclude meal expenses of the Plaintiff, printing cost, decoration cost and solicitorsâ fees, to say a few.  In view of the claimbeing a liquidated one, I do not find it necessary to adjudicate on which of the items the Defendants should contribute nor is theresufficient factual evidence for me to make the adjudication.  The Plaintiffâs claim against the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants must be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">The revocation claim</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The revocation claim against the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants is premised on the Defendantsâ failure to contribute to the cost of management of the common areas and facilities. The Plaintiff complains that the Defendants were deliberately delaying payment of contributions.  However, the contribution claimedwas made on the wrong basis and without taking into account contributions received.  As such, the claim must be unreasonable.  Infact there was an agreed 43/57 Ratio for paying contribution reached on 30 September 1999.  It was the Plaintiff who sought to revokethat agreement.  In view of the unreasonable demand made by the Plaintiff and their failure to properly account for what they demand,I do not think the steps taken by the Defendants to ensure that they only pay what they are liable to pay under the DMC can be consideredas unreasonable.  In the circumstances, the Plaintiffâs claim for revocation must also be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Other remedies</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  The Plaintiff claims an injunction restraining the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants from entering or using the common areas and facilities of HWR21 and damages for wrongful use of such common areas andfacilities.  These claims are based on the Defendantsâ failure to contribute to the cost of managing the common areas and facilities. The contribution claim having been dismissed, these claims must also stand to be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  The Plaintiff failed in all its claims against all the Defendants.  They launched their action on the wrong basis and in total disregardof the Assignment and the DMC.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffâs action is dismissed with a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the Plaintiff shall pay costs of all the Defendants.</p>    <p>      </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> ( Anthony To )<br />            Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr. Alexander H.F.
