The other Defendants are the publisher, editor and printer of the magazine.</p>    <p class="heading">The article</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The Plaintiff developed a drug called Retrogen which he said was able to treat AIDS. In May 1993, Mr Yan, a reporter from the NextMagazine conducted an interview with the Plaintiff. After the interview, Mr Yan had a number of telephone conversations with thePlaintiff as well. The Next Magazine subsequently published the article entitled "Such an effective drugs for AIDS". The four-pagearticle covered many topics and they can be summarised as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The Plaintiff said that he had invented several kinds of drugs including Retrogen for curing AIDS.</p>        <p>(2) None of the drugs invented by him was approved by the authorities.</p>        <p>(3) It would take at least hundreds of clinical experiments over a long period of time before a drug can be approved.</p>        <p>(4) He was unable to find patients in the U.S.A. to conduct experiments and he moved to Uganda in Africa and Mexico to conduct clinicalexperiments. In 1989, five patients in Uganda were tested for three months and 10 clinical experiments were tried in Mexico. Withvery little research success, he went to some medical conferences to give presentations.</p>        <p>(5) One of the five patients in Uganda had died of meningitis, he did not know whether the rest of the patients had died.</p>        <p>(6) After meeting difficulties everywhere in the U.S.A., the Plaintiff came to Hong Kong to promote sale of his new drugs for AIDSand often held press conferences for publicity purpose. He was warned by the Department of Health that his press conference wouldamount to advertising and that he would be prosecuted if he committed the same again.</p>        <p>(7) The Plaintiff had requested Dr Li, a member of the AIDS Foundation in Hong Kong to provide him with patients to conduct clinicalexperiments. Dr Li, however, was of the view that the information on his new drugs was inadequate. When Dr Li asked him how to arrangethe treatment, what quantity of drugs should be used and for how long, the Plaintiff could not give any concrete answer. The AIDSFoundation would not recommend the drugs to be used on dying patients because the drug was lacking in fundamental data.</p>        <p>(8) In European countries and America where AIDS is rampant, quite a number of AIDS patients would take the risk and buy the drugsin the underground market notwithstanding the drugs are not yet approved. The Plaintiff, however, said that he was not prepared totest the law. Even when ten Americans pressed him to sell the drugs, he refused to do so.</p>        <p>(9) The Plaintiff went to countries which would deal with the matter more flexibly to conduct research. He also entered into a packagingcontract with the Shaoguan Drugs Manufacturing Factory ("the Shaoguan Factory") to manufacture Retrogen. He said that "Mainland Chinais more lax, regulations could be changed by them at will, whether to loosen the control is entirely at their whim". He said thathe hope to get 1,000 patients to carry out experiments on the drugs.</p>        <p>(10) Doubts were cast by Dr Li on how the Plaintiff could have the confidence to find the 1,000 patients as there were only severaltens of HIV carriers in the Guangdong province.</p>        <p>(11) The Health Department of Shaoguan denied having any contact with the Plaintiff and the person in charge did not even know thatthe state run Shaoguan Factory had entered into a packaging contract with the Plaintiff.</p>        <p>(12) In order to obtain the approval for Retrogen from the Chinese side, the Plaintiff had set up a land selling plan to sell landin Iowa U.S.A. to the people in China and to use the proceeds to establish an AIDS Foundation.</p>        <p>(13) The article concluded that "Although the Plaintiff said his Retrogen could treat AIDS, his AIDS Foundation in mind was not forhelping the patients to recover but to help the Chinese AIDS children to have their last dreams fulfilled, for instance, enablingthem to go to Disney Land for fun."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The Plaintiff complained that the article was defamatory. He relied on 18 matters in the article in support of his claim that theDefendants had defamed him.</p>    <p class="heading">The principles</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> As the Plaintiff appears in person, it is necessary for me to set out firstly, the principles to be applied.</p>    <p class="heading">The defamatory imputation</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The gist of the torts of libel and slander is the publication of matter (usually words) conveying a defamatory imputation. A defamatoryimputation is one to a man's discredit, or which tends to lower him in the estimation of others, or to expose him to hatred, contemptor ridicule, or to injure his reputation in his office, trade or profession, or to injure his financial credit. The standard of opinionis that of right-thinking persons generally (<em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em>, para.31).</p>    <p class="heading">Imputation of unfitness for profession or calling</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> It is defamatory to impute that a man is unfit for his profession or calling owing to want of ability, learning or some other necessaryqualification, or that he has been guilty of any dishonest or disreputable conduct or any other misconduct or inefficiency therein.This applies to any profession or calling, however humble, so long as it is not illegal. "... words may be defamatory of a traderor a business man or professional man, though they do not impute any known fault or defect of personal character. They can be defamatoryof him if they impute lack of qualifications, knowledge, skill, capability, judgment or efficiency in the conduct of his trade orbusiness or professional activity ..." (<em>Gatley</em> para.60)</p>    <p class="heading">Natural and ordinary meaning</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Words are normally construed in their natural and ordinary meaning, i.e. in the meaning in which reasonable men of ordinary intelligence,with the ordinary man's general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs, would be likely to understand them. The natural andordinary meaning may also "include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader guided not by any special but only by generalknowledge and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction would draw from the words." (<em>Gatley</em> para.93)</p>    <p class="heading">Legal innuendoes</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> However, words may convey a defamatory imputation only by reason of some special knowledge available to those to whom they were published,of the circumstances of publication, or of some special meaning or inference to be attached to or drawn from the words. The wordsare then said to carry an innuendo. In such a case the question is what meaning would be attached to the words by a reasonable manhaving special knowledge of any relevant facts or meanings (<em>Gatley</em> para.94).</p>    <p class="heading">The general burden</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The general burden of proof is on the plaintiff, so that it is for him to show, if he relies on the natural and ordinary meaning,that the words convey a defamatory imputation, or, if it is disputed what defamatory imputation they convey, that they convey themost serious imputation on which he relies. But if either party alleges that the words were reasonably to be understood in a meaningother than their natural and ordinary meaning, and in that meaning were either defamatory or not defamatory, as the case may be,the burden of proof is on that party (<em>Gatley</em> para.114).</p>    <p class="heading">Judge and jury</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> It is well settled that the question whether words which are complained of are capable of conveying a defamatory meaning is a questionof law and is therefore one calling for the decision of the court. If the words are so capable then it is a question for the jurywhether the words do in fact convey a defamatory meaning (<em>Gatley</em> para.119).</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> As I am sitting as both the judge and jury in this case, I have to consider whether the words complained of are capable of conveyinga defamatory meaning and if they are, I have to further consider whether they in fact convey a defamatory meaning.</p>    <p class="heading">Reasonableness</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> In determining whether the words are capable of a defamatory meaning the judge will construe the words according to the fair andnatural meaning which would be given them by reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence, and will not consider what persons settingthemselves to work to deduce some unusual meaning might succeed in extracting from them (Gatley para.120).</p>    <p class="heading">Two meaning reasonably possible</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> But where the words complained of are ambiguous, that is, reasonably capable of either an innocent or a defamatory meaning, it isa question of fact for the jury to determine in which of the two meanings they were understood by those to whom they were published(<em>Gatley</em> para.124).</p>    <p class="heading">The judge's ruling : natural and ordinary meanings</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Whether the plaintiff relies on one or on more than one defamatory meaning as the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, thejudge must rule in relation to each meaning relied on whether the words are capable of having that meaning. His functions are notmerely confined to ruling whether or not the words are capable of a defamatory meaning (<em>Gatley</em> para.125).</p>    <p class="heading">Defences</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> In this case the Defendant is relying on the defence of justification and fair comment.</p>    <p class="heading">Justification</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The general rule is that it is a defence to an action for libel or slander that the words are true in substance and in fact. (<em>Duncan and Neill on Defamation</em> 2nd Ed., para.11.01) This defence is called justification.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The basis of the rule that truth is a defence to an action for defamation was stated by Littledale J in <strong>McPherson v. Daniels</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281829%29%2010%20B%20%26%20C%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1829) 10 B &amp; C 263</a> at 272 as being that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The law will not permit a man to recover damages in respect of an injury to a character which he does not or ought not to possess."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(<em>Duncan &amp; Neill</em> para.11.02)</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> The general rule is that the defendant's state of mind is irrelevant to the issue of justification. If the words complained of aretrue in substance and in fact the defendant will not be liable even though he published the words with the express intent of causingdamage to the plaintiff. The burden of proof is on the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In order to succeed in a defence of justification it is necessary for the defendant to prove the truth of the words complained ofnot only in their literal meaning but also in such inferential or innuendo meanings as the jury may find the words to bear. Furthermore,the words in their context may amount to a general charge against the plaintiff for which the proof of one or more specific allegationsmay not provide an adequate defence (<em>Duncan &amp; Neill</em> para.11.05).</p>    <p class="heading">Partial justification</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It is not necessary for the defendant, even at common law, to prove the truth of every detail of the words. In <strong>Edwards v. Bell</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281824%29%201%20Bing%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1824) 1 Bing 403</a> at 409, Burrough J put the matter as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"As much must be justified as meets the sting of the charge, and if anything be contained in the charge, which does not add to thesting of it, that need not be justified."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(<em>Duncan &amp; Neill</em> para.11.06)</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Where the words complained of contain more than one charge or are otherwise severable the defendant may justify part only of thedefamatory words, ... (Duncan &amp; Neill para.11.07). This is recognised by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.26</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a></em>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21">Cap.21</a> which is as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"26. Justification</em></p>        <p class="quote">In an action for libel or slander in respect of words containing two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence ofjustification shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be true do notmaterially injure the plaintiff's reputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charges."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Fair comment</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> The main principles relating to the defence of fair comment may be stated as follows -</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) The comment must be on a matter of public interest;</p>        <p>(b) the comment must be based on fact;</p>        <p>(c) the comment, though it can consist of or include inferences of fact, must be recognisable as comment;</p>        <p>(d) the comment must satisfy the following objective test : could any fair-minded man honestly express that opinion on the provedfacts?</p>        <p>(e) even though the comment satisfies the objective test the defence can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that the defendant wasactuated by express malice.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>(<em>Duncan &amp; Neill</em> para.12.02)</p>    <p class="heading">Public interest</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> In<strong>London Artists Ltd. v. Littler</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20QB%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 QB 375</a> at 391, Lord Denning MR spoke of the scope of public interest as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"There is no definition in the books as to what is a matter of public interest. All we were given is a list of examples, coupled withthe statement that it is for the judge and not the jury. I would not myself confine it within narrow limits. Whenever a matter issuch as to affect people at large, so that they may be legitimately interested in, or concerned at, what is going on, or what mayhappen to them or others; then it is a matter of public interest on which everyone is entitled to make fair comment."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Facts</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The comment must be based on fact. It is a necessary ingredient of fair comment that the comment shall be based on facts which areeither stated by the commentator or indicated by him with sufficient clarity to enable the reader or listener to ascertain the matteron which the comment is being made. A defendant cannot defend a statement as comment, however, if he has not set out the facts onwhich he based the statement nor, at the least, indicated in general terms what those facts were (<em>Duncan &amp; Neill</em> para.12.05).</p>    <p class="heading">Partial defence</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> The defence of fair comment will not fail by reason only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved. This is statedin <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.27</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a></em> :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>"27. Fair comment</em></p>        <p class="quote">In an action for libel or slander in respect of words consisting partly of allegations of fact and partly of expression of opinion,a defence of fair comment shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved if the expressionof opinion is fair comment having regard to such of the facts alleged or referred to in the words complained of as are proved."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Limits</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> The limits of the right of comment are very wide as appears clearly from the summing up of Lord Hewart CJ in <strong>Stopes v. Sutherland</strong>, where he said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"What is it that fair comment means? It means this - and I prefer to put it in words which are not my own; I refer to the famous judgmentof Lord Esher MR in <em>Merivale v. Carson</em> 'Every latitude', said Lord Esher, 'must be given to opinion and to prejudice, and then an ordinary set of men with ordinary judgmentmust say (not whether they agree with it, but) whether any fair man would have made such a comment. Mere exaggeration, or even grossexaggeration, would not make the comment unfair. However wrong the opinion expressed may be in point of truth, or however prejudicedthe writer, it may still be within the prescribed limits. The question which the jury must consider is this - would any fair man,however prejudiced he may be, however exaggerated or obstinate his views, have said that which this criticism has said?' Again asBray J said in <em>R. v. Russell</em>: 'When you come to a question of fair comment you ought to be extremely liberal, and in a matter of this kind - relating to the administrationof the licensing laws - you ought to be extremely liberal because it is a matter on which men's minds are moved, in which peoplewho do know, entertain very very strong opinions, and if they use strong language every allowance should be made in their favour.They must believe what they say, but the question whether they honestly believe it is a question for you to say. If they do believeit, and they are within anything like reasonable bounds, they come within the meaning of fair comment. If comments were made whichwould appear to you to have been exaggerated, it does not follow that they are not perfectly honest comments.' That is the kind ofmaxim which you may apply in considering whether that part of this matter which is comment is fair. Could a fair-minded man, holdinga strong view, holding perhaps an obstinate view, have been capable of writing this? - which, you observe, is a totally differentquestion from the question, do you agree with what he has said."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Express malice</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The defence of fair comment can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that when the defendant published the words complained of hewas actuated by express malice. Furthermore, malice may also be relevant on the issue of damages and in certain limited circumstancesin relation to a defence of justification (<em>Duncan &amp; Neill</em> para.17.03).</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> <strong>Horrocks v. Lowe</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 135</a> at 149 is a case dealing with the defence of qualified privilege and the effect of express malice, but the speech of Lord Diplockprovides an important guidance in which malice has to be considered.</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... So he is entitled to be protected by the privilege unless some other dominant and improper motive on his part is proved. 'Expressmalice' is the term of art descriptive of such a motive. Broadly speaking, it means malice in the popular sense of a desire to injurethe person who is defamed and this is generally the motive which the plaintiff sets out to prove. But to destroy the privilege thedesire to injure must be the dominant motive for the defamatory publication; knowledge that it will have that effect is not enoughif the defendant is nevertheless acting in accordance with a sense of duty or in bona fide protection of his own legitimate interest.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">...</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilegeis positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, 'honest belief'. If he publishesuntrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branchesof the law, treated as if he knew it to be false. But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness,impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true. ...</p>        <p class="quote">Even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion - which is presumed unless the contrary is proved- may not be sufficient to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose otherthan that for which the privilege is accorded by the law. The commonest case is where the dominant motive which actuates the defendantis not a desire to perform the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest, but to give vent to his personal spite or illwilltowards the person he defames. ... A defendant's dominant motive may have been to obtain some private advantage unconnected withthe duty or the interest which constitutes the reason for the privilege. If so, he loses the benefit of the privilege despite hispositive belief that what he said or wrote was true.</p>        <p class="quote">Judges and juries should, however, be very slow to draw the inference that a defendant was so far actuated by improper motives asto deprive him of the protection of the privilege unless they are satisfied that he did not believe that what he said or wrote wastrue or that he was indifferent to its truth or falsity. The motives with which human beings act are mixed."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The 18 allegations</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> I will deal with the 18 paragraphs of the article which the Plaintiff said had defamed him.</p>    <p class="heading">Para.1</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote">"SUCH AN EFFECTIVE DRUG FOR AIDS</p>        <p class="quote">An American Chinese claimed to have invented a new drug which could cure the incurable AIDS, but in the U.S.A. no one was willingto carry out clinical experiments on the drug. He went to Africa and found five patients to conduct experiments. One of them diedout of meningitis after taking the drug. Four of them could not be traced. He accordingly went to Mexico and claimed to have conductedten experiments there. This drug was not allowed to be registered in the U.S.A. and Hong Kong, and no medical practitioner was willingto find patients for carrying out clinical experiments. So this inventor hoped to take advantage of the laxity of the laws of Chinato find 1,000 AIDS patients in the Mainland China to conduct clinical experiments. Furthermore, without the support of data, he hadentered into a packaging contract with a drugs manufacturer, preparing for a mass production (of his new drug)."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Four separate complaints were raised on this paragraph.</p>    <p class="heading">1. The first complaint</p>    <p>The article alleged that he was an American Chinese. In fact he is a British citizen and holding a U.K. passport. The author usedhis imagination to fabricate the story and framed him as an American. This suggested that the Plaintiff was not an honest person.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> The words used in the article was "ç¾åè¯äºº" which means "a Chinese in the United States" or "American Chinese". In my view,this description, however translated, does not and is not capable of bearing any defamatory meaning. The evidence showed that thePlaintiff went to study in the United States in 1972. He returned to Hong Kong permanently in 1990. Between 1972 to 1990, he cameto Hong Kong once every few years. While he was in the U.S. he studied in the Ohio State University, obtaining a Ph.D. degree inbiochemistry in 1984. Between 1984 and 1990, he conducted research in the U.S. He developed the drug Retrogen in the U.S. By no meansof imagination could one say that the author of the article had fabricated a story to defame the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">2. The second complaint</p>    <p>The Plaintiff said that the article referred to the absence of supporting data. In fact he had done many studies to support the advocacyof the drugs. Five abstracts had been published in conferences. This cast doubt on his professional capacity as a scientist.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In my view, the words complained of by the Plaintiff are not defamatory and the Defendants have made out a case of justification.It is clear from the evidence adduced that there was insufficient data on the drug. The data was lacking for the drug to be usedin clinical tests on patients.</p>    <p class="heading">15 testings</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> The evidence showed that only 15 patients had been tested with Retrogen in the U.S. The only patient that was tested with the drugwas the Plaintiff himself. In Uganda, six patients were tested, one was used as a control and in Mexico, 15 patients were testedwith the drugs.</p>    <p class="heading">Dr Ng's evidence</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> According to Dr Steven Ng, an expert of the Defendants, in the U.S., before a drug is marketed commercially, its clinical claimsof indication, effectiveness and safety have to go through a very stringent series of tests :</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) <em>Pre-clinical investigations</em></p>        <p>This involves testing on animals to show its adverse effects, toxicity and death. Long term drugs will have to be administered fora sufficiently long period of time to determine the possible toxic effects.</p>        <p>(b) <em>Clinical investigations</em></p>        <p>Once clinical studies have established the relative safety of the drug on animals, clinical study on humans can begin. There are threephases of human investigation, each involving a large number of patients :</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p>(i) <em>Clinical pharmacology</em></p>            <p>This involves 20 to 80 patients to test the level of toxicity on human beings, the pharmacologic effect and followed by early dose- ranging studies in patients for safety and effectiveness.</p>            <p>(ii) <em>Clinical investigation</em></p>            <p>This consists of controlled clinical trials designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety. They are performed on closely monitoredpatients of limited number. Seldom will this phase go beyond 100 to 200 patients on drug.</p>            <p>(iii) <em>Clinical trials</em></p>            <p>These are performed after effectiveness has been basically established and are intended to gather additional evidence of effectivenessfor specific indications and more precise definition of drug related adverse effects. Trials on this phase are usually carried outin several hundred to several thousand subjects.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Approval of drugs in U.S.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In the U.S. the approval of drugs is done by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). Even after the FDA approval, there shouldbe clinical trials (Phase 4 studies) to elucidate the incidence of adverse reactions, to explore a specific pharmacologic effect,or to obtain more information of a circumscribed nature. The announcement of success of the new drugs is allowed only after FDA'sapproval and usually accompanied by the publication of the results of clinical trials.</p>    <p class="heading">Hong Kong procedure</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In Hong Kong, the regulatory body governing pharmaceuticals is the Pharmacy and Poisons Board ("the Board"). Hong Kong has very littleoriginal manufacturing of western medicine and no indigenous western medicine has ever been developed by a Hong Kong institutionto the stage that will require approval from Hong Kong government as the country of original production. The Board depends for itsown approval of drugs on the approval of other countries, namely, approval from the country of origin and two advance countries.</p>    <p class="heading">Plaintiff's data insufficient</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The Plaintiff by his own admission in the interview with Mr Yan agreed that the number of tests he had carried out was insufficient.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> Of his five publications, four abstracts were published in international AIDS conferences and one letter was published in a U.K.publication entitled <em>AIDS 1989</em> Vol.3, no.12, page 858.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> According to Dr Ng, whose evidence I accept, the abstracts and letters are considered minor publications by the scientific community,as they are generally not peer reviewed. The abstracts contribute little to scientific knowledge and letters serve to communicateonly preliminary ideas or data. They are considered more as opinions rather than scientific facts. Conference abstracts are sometimesreviewed by a selection committee but the criteria are very loose. They are usually judged on topical interest and not scientificrigor. Again, they are used to communicate preliminary results. Definitive results must always be published in a peer reviewed journalas a scientific article. Peer review would involve questioning by a panel of experts on the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Dr Ng was of the view that the publications by the Plaintiff can hardly qualify as serious publications or strong evidence of scientificaccomplishment.</p>    <p class="heading">Dr Li's evidence</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The evidence of Dr Li of the AIDS Foundation in Hong Kong points equally to the insufficiency of data of the drug. Dr Li had exchangedcorrespondence with the Plaintiff from September 1987. The Plaintiff approached him regarding the possibility of conducting a clinicaltrial on AIDS patients in Hong Kong with the product Retrogen.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Between 1987 and 1990, the Plaintiff corresponded with Dr Li and provided him with information on Retrogen and to give clarificationswhich would be necessary before approval could be obtained from the local ethics committee to proceed with the clinical trial. Theinformation and data on Retrogen provided to Dr Li by the Plaintiff were mainly in the form of descriptive summaries of the propertiesof Retrogen by the Plaintiff as well as copies of newspaper cuttings. He supplied Dr Li with letters from laboratories which demonstratedevidence of anti-HIV effect of Retrogen in the laboratory setting.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In 1990, Dr Li considered that there was not enough information on Retrogen to obtain approval from the Medical and Health Departmentfor clinical trials on patients in Hong Kong. This was because the information supplied to him by the Plaintiff only included hissummary of the properties of Retrogen and past experience of its use. No information about the study design and details of the analysiswas given. The only aspect which was detailed by the Plaintiff involved testing of the drug in the laboratory. There was insufficientdata on the use of Retrogen on healthy human subjects or patients with other illnesses, in particular, concerning the clinical efficacy,dose regiment and safety profile.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> Subsequently, Dr Li was informed by the Plaintiff that Retrogen has been used in China to treat herpes and other viral infectionwith good result and no toxicity. Also in 1992, the Plaintiff informed Dr Li that he had treated six patients in Africa with Retrogen.According to the results of the treatment, some of the patients had increased in immune cells. However there was only one patientserving as the control and the trial only lasted for 10 weeks.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Dr Li said that Retrogen has not been approved in any country for the treatment of HIV infection or AIDS. Eight years after the developmentof Retrogen, it still has not been approved for large scale human trials in the U.S.</p>    <p class="heading">3. The third complaint</p>    <p>The article said that no one was willing to do a clinical study in America. The Plaintiff said in fact most of the patients undertreatment in Mexico were Americans. Further, there were two American doctors who had shown their interest in using Retrogen to treattheir patients. This suggested that he was not successful in U.S.A. and therefore had to conduct the experiment in Africa and Mexico.He claimed that this "Made me look like an idiot".</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> The evidence established that in U.S.A. the Plaintiff was the only person who has been injected with Retrogen. The Plaintiff saidthat two medical doctors in U.S. were interested in using Retrogen to treat their patients. According to the documents produced bythe Plaintiff, one Dr Marcus Conant wrote to the Plaintiff on 24th May 1992. The letter reads :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" I thank you for your recent letter regarding Retrogen.</p>        <p class="quote">As you may know, we are currently caring for some 3,000 HIV positive men and have an active clinical research center associated withour practice.</p>        <p class="quote">If you would be interested in doing phase I and phase II studies of Retrogen on HIV positive patients, please contact me or my associate,Joe Robinson at the number noted below."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The letter did not show that Dr Marcus Conant was interested in letting his patients try Retrogen. On the contrary, the letter wasmade in response to the enquiries made by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The two other letters produced by the Plaintiff showed that an individual and a group were interested in obtaining Retrogen and askedfor information on this product.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> All these fall short of showing that the U.S. doctors were prepared to administer the drugs on their patients. In my view, the sentencethat "In the U.S.A. no one was willing to carry out clinical experiments on the drug" is not capable of bearing any defamatory meaningand is also shown to be true.</p>    <p class="heading">4. The fourth complaint</p>    <p>The Plaintiff said that the article accused him of taking advantage of the Chinese law to do a clinical study in Chinese. This isnot true because to get approval in any country, one has to do clinical studies in that particular country.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> In the interview the Plaintiff was asked by Mr Yan whether because of the problems he had encountered in the U.S. and the difficultiesof going to Africa that the Plaintiff wished to conduct the testing of the drugs in China. Although the Plaintiff denied that itwould be easier to get things done in China, he referred to the inflexibility of the approach taken in U.S. and in Hong Kong in solvingthe AIDS problem. The "inflexibility" was clearly reflected in the stringent requirements by the FDA on the testing of the drugsleading to its approval. Throughout the interview, the Plaintiff lamented the rigidity of the systems in U.S. and Hong Kong in respectof the approval of drugs for the treatment of AIDS. He stated that although the requirement in Europe was a little flexible, it stillrequired numerous testing of the drugs before approval could be given. He recognised that the data for the 15 testing of Retrogenwas insufficient. He further said the only method was to carry out the tests in China. This shows that the Plaintiff's intentionwas to avail himself of what he considered to be the more flexible approach in China to carry out the clinical tests.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> In my view, the passage is not defamatory and the Defendants have established the truthfulness of this matter.</p>    <p class="heading">5. Para.5</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote"><em>"Five Patients Were Treated With New Drugs,<br />        No One Knew Whether They Were Alive Or Not"</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The complaint</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> The Plaintiff said that this part of the article is not true because the patients were treated for a duration of 10 weeks only. Atthe end of the trial period, he only knew that four of them were still alive and their health conditions had been improved. The fifthone died of meningitis which was not related to the treatment. The Plaintiff submitted that this passage imputed that he was notresponsible in following up on or taking care of the patients and that he was taking advantage of the African patients.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> In the interview, the Plaintiff agreed that he did not know how were the 15 patients who had been treated with Retrogen. He saidthat they had used the Retrogen and their response within the three months treatment had been very good. However, he had no ideahow they were after the treatment. He had no idea whether the patients were dead.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> The interview between the Plaintiff and Mr Yan was repeated in paragraph 10 of the article in which the Plaintiff admitted that hehad not constantly monitored the condition of the patients and that "he did not even know whether the rest of those patients haddied by now".</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> The passage complained of is a sub-title of the preceding paragraphs which included paragraph 10. The Defendants have been able toprove that at the time of the interview the statement concerning the absence of knowledge of the live or death of the patients whohad been treated with the drugs is true.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> The Plaintiff complained that the article did not state that during the three months period the response of the patients were good.The omission to the response of the patients during the three months period does not, in my view, render the subtitle defamatoryor that it would constitute evidence of express malice. The fact remains that the drugs was only administered on patients over ashort period of time and only 15 patients were used for clinical treatment of the drug and eight years after the development of thedrug approval has still not be obtained.</p>    <p class="heading">6. Para.9</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" In the year 89, he had a package of 'Retrogen' transported to Uganda to test on five patients there for three months. Last yearhe entrusted medical practitioners in Mexico to conduct ten clinical experiments, and with that little research success, he wentto some medical conferences to give presentations."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The complaint</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> The Plaintiff said that the article insulted him that he was presenting research results everywhere. The accusation is defamatory.His presentation and publications were peer reviewed and published in world famous journals. The Plaintiff also complained that thispart of the article suggested he made presentation with very little data, casting doubt on his ability as a scientist.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> I do not find the statement that "the Plaintiff had presented the research results everywhere" is defamatory. By his own evidencethe plaintiff said that he had made presentations and published extracts in international conferences.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> In regard to his contention that that he was defamed because the article suggested that he was making presentations with very littlesupporting data, I am also satisfied that this is also not defamatory. The statement is true. I accept Dr Ng's view that the extractscontain only preliminary results.</p>    <p class="heading">7. Para.10</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" There are tens of thousands of AIDS patients in Africa, but Ki Ping-ki could only find five patients for experiments."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The complaint</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> The Plaintiff said this is defamatory. In doing any clinical trials, it is more effical to do a small trial with fewer patients.If it is successful, a larger trial would be conducted to eliminate the possible danger exposed to the patients. This suggested thathe was incapable to find patients and implied that he was not a good scientist.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> I am of the view that the words do not bear the defamatory imputation as suggested by the Plaintiff. The truth of the matter is thatin Africa only five patients carried out the experiment on Retrogen. The Plaintiff agreed that the experiment was not carried onbecause of the lack of funds to finance further experiment.</p>    <p class="heading">8. Para.12</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" After meeting difficulties everywhere in the U.S.A., Ki Ping-ki recently came to Hong Kong to promote sale of his new drug for AIDS,and often held press conferences for publicity purpose."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The complaint</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> The Plaintiff said that the Defendants accused him of selling the experimental compound in Hong Kong. He has never sold or intendedto sell the experimental compound in Hong Kong. It is suggested that he was committing a crime in Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> The Plaintiff's interpretation of the words is incorrect. The ordinary and nature meanings of the words is plain, namely that thePlaintiff came to Hong Kong to promote his new drug for AIDS and often held press conferences to publicise the matter.</p>    <p class="heading">The press conferences</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> The Plaintiff admitted that he had held about ten conferences in Hong Kong and five were held between January and May 1993. He saidthat the purpose of holding the conferences was to give its research results on the experiments he had conducted in Uganda. The conferenceswere centred on the discovery of his compound.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> It is clear that the conferences went beyond merely telling the press about his discovery. In a press conference invitation dated22nd December 1992 issued by the Plaintiff as the President of the Hong Kong Washington Co. for a conference to be held on 23rd December1992, it was stated that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Hong Kong Washington Co. has made an agreement with Guangdong Shaoguan Pharmaceutical Factory to produce a potent anti-HIV compoundcalled Retrogen in People's Republic of China. Retrogen has been tested clinically in Mexico and Uganda to prove its efficacy. Thefirst year projected production will be at least 200,000 dosages."</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The invitation went on to say that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The company was planning to donate US$3 million worth of Retrogen to the AIDS patients in the world who are facing extreme financialdifficulties. However, Retrogen will not be used or distributed in Hong Kong and PR China because Retrogen has not been registered."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The contract</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> By a contract dated 17th December 1992, signed by the Plaintiff as the President of the Hong Kong Washington Co. and the ShaoguanFactory, the Shaoguan Factory agreed to package Retrogen which was named in the contract as the "anti-AIDS effective drug".</p>    <p class="heading">Blatant publicity</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> In my view the Plaintiff had carried out the most blatant form of publicity for his drug. By the press invitation the Plaintiff wantedto show that the development of the drug, although referred to as "the compound", had gone beyond the experimental stage, otherwisehe would not be planning to donate the drugs to AIDS patients. Promotions were made notwithstanding it had not even passed the clinicalpharmacology stage of the investigation. He was trying to give the maximum exposure of his drug even when no approval to its marketinghad been given.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> It is equally clear from the record of interview between Mr Yan and the Plaintiff that it was the opinion of the Plaintiff that ifthe testing of his drugs in China on the patients was successful, people from around the world would go to China to buy the drugs.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> The evidence show that the Department of Health, by a letter dated 9th February 1993, referred to the press conference invitationand informed the Plaintiff that he had contravened s.3 of the <em>Undesirable Medical Advertisement Ordinance</em> by publicising the said advertisement. He was warned that if similar advertisements should appear in the future, prosecution willbe taken against him. The warning letter was referred to in the article.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> The evidence further showed that the Plaintiff had held further press conferences and was charged after he held a further press conferenceon 22nd October 1993. He was eventually tried in August 1994 and was acquitted of the charge.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> The newspaper reports which were relied upon by the Plaintiff made it clear that it was the allegation of the Department of Healththat the Plaintiff advertised Retrogen as a drug which could cure AIDS. In the circumstances, the passage has been justified by thefacts and they are not capable of bearing any defamatory meaning against the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">9. Para.13</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" The Department of Health pointed out that his press conferences were tantamount to "advertising", warning him that he would be prosecutedif he committed the same again."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The complaint</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> The Plaintiff said that this suggested that he had broken the law of undesirable medical advertising. The Defendants accused himof advertising in the press conference even before the trial in the court. On 1st August 1994, he was clear of such charge. He allegedthat the Defendants had been obstructing justice in the article.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> I have already dealt with the question of advertisement. The question of criminal trial simply did not arise at the time when thearticle was published. The Plaintiff agreed that in May 1993 the Department of Health had not yet charged him with any offence. Theparagraph is plain on its meaning, it is justified by the warning letter issued by the Department of Health. The Plaintiff has neverdenied receiving the letter. On the contrary, subsequent events show that the Department of Health did pursue and charge the Plaintiffafter the warning was not heeded.</p>    <p class="heading">10. Para.16</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... Even when Li Chung-ki inquired of Ki how to arrange the treatment, what quantity of drugs should be used and for how long, Kicould not give any concrete answer."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The complaint</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> The Plaintiff said what the Defendants had written was untrue because he had sent Dr Li the clinical report with the treatment protocolfrom the United States. The report has also been published and is available in the public domain. This also suggested that the Plaintiffwas not a good scientist.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> The complaint together with some others are not set out in the Statement of Claim but rather in the Further and Better Particularsof the Statement of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="pseudopara" id="p74">74.</a> It is clear from the evidence that Dr Li did not ask the Plaintiff how to arrange the treatment and what quantity of drugs shouldbe used and for how long. However it is equally clear that the data provided by the Plaintiff to Dr Li was lacking in information.Dr Li came to the view that because of the insufficiency of data, the AIDS Foundation was not prepared to recommend the patientsto try out the drug. The information provided by the Plaintiff after the Uganda experiment also lack treatment protocol or dosage.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="pseudopara" id="p75">75.</a> In any event, I am satisfied that the defence of justification still succeeds by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.26</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/21" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Ordinance</a>. The failure of the Defendants to establish the truth regarding the questions raised by Dr Li do not materially injure the Plaintiff'sreputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charge, namely that the Plaintiff was unable to provide data on the treatmentprotocol and dosage to Dr Li.</p>    <p class="heading">11. Para.17</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center" class="quote"><em>"Also Not Suitable For Dying Patients</em></p>        <p class="quote">Notwithstanding that a certain drug is not yet approved by the Department of Health, Hong Kong, if there is a certain extent of proofof the effectiveness of the drug, a dying patient could still try the new drug under the pretext of 'compassionate emergency application'.Li Chung-ki indicated that over the years, there were several applications of this kind of drugs (for aids) to AIDS patients. However,as Retrogen was lacking even in the fundamental data, the Committee would not list it in the recommended list. 'I feel it unfairto the patients to try out such a drug'".</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The complaint</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="pseudopara" id="p76">76.</a> The Plaintiff said that it was not true that there was a lack of information on the compound Retrogen because his research had beenpublished in the public domain and is available everywhere in the world. This passage suggested that he was not a good scientist.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="pseudopara" id="p77">77.</a> The Defendants relied on fair comment in relation to the sentence that "Retrogen was lacking even in the fundamental data". I acceptthat it is a matter of public interest for a newspaper or a magazine to comment on subjects such as AIDS and a drug which allegedlycould treat or cure AIDS. I find that fundamental data on the property was lacking on a drug which was claimed that it could treator cure AIDS. This is also true in respect of the information provided to Dr Li and the information published in the conference extractsand journals. I am satisfied that the comment is reasonable and fair.</p>    <p class="heading">12. Para.19</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Facing these queries, Ki Ping-ki indicated that he did not want to test the law by himself. Therefore, even ten Americans and beggedhim to sell the drug, he was unmoved. 'The risk was very big if I gave them the drug.

He was not that insensitive. This suggested that the Plaintiff was a selfishperson. This will make the gay community dislike him and this is a personal attack.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="pseudopara" id="p79">79.</a> Mr Wong, Counsel for the Defendants, accepted that in the interview, the Plaintiff did not say the exact words which were in quotation.It is, however, clear from the transcript of the interview that the quoted words contained the gist of what he said in the interview.In Item 41 of the transcript, the Plaintiff said that if the drugs were given by him, the risk would be very high. In Item 43, hesaid that he would not take the risk because this would involve breaking the law. In Item 51, he stated that the gays in order tostruggle to live, did not care if they were breaking the law. In Item 62, Mr Yan asked "So, that means your psychology is differentfrom theirs. You are not gay ..." The response of the Plaintiff at Item 63 is :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I am different! Of course! Of course I'm different! Of course! For that group of people, it doesn't matter. You arrest me, go ahead!I, I'm about to die. Maybe I, I would have been infected as well, he thinks! Right? It doesn't matter for him to be open! It, theSixty Minutes took pictures of him, he didn't care. No one would arrest him!"</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In my view the words were not capable of defamatory meaning and in any event, the words were true in substance and in fact.</p>    <p class="heading">13.

Para.21</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The Mainland China is more lax, regulation could be changed by them at will, whether to loosen the control is entirely at their whim."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The complaint</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="pseudopara" id="p83">83.</a> The Plaintiff said that he did not make such a statement. The statement should read as "Under special circumstances such as an AIDSoutbreak, the Chinese can speed up the approval process". The passage suggested that he had attacked the Chinese Government. Thepassage also insulted China.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="pseudopara" id="p84">84.</a> Mr Yan said that the quotation was taken directly from what the Plaintiff told him during one of their telephone conversations.

The words in their natural and ordinarymeaning could not be defamatory of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="pseudopara" id="p85">85.</a> I have already dealt with the Plaintiff's attitude on the testing of the drugs earlier under the fourth complaint of Para.1 of thearticle.

The Defendants didnot confirm Dr Li's data and used his statement to defame him. He was defamed as not being a very good scientist.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="pseudopara" id="p87">87.</a> The paragraph complained of is not defamatory of the Plaintiff. The report by the Defendants of Dr Li's comment could only be inthe nature of a fair comment.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="pseudopara" id="p88">88.</a> According to an article entitled "AIDS and HIV infection in China" written by Sun Xinhua and others, by 31st December 1993, 1,243HIV positive persons had been reported to the Ministry of Public Health of China from 21 of China's 30 Provinces Municipalities andAutonomous Regions. The largest concentration of AIDS and HIV infection was in Yunnan with 991 cases followed by Guangdong of 74cases.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="pseudopara" id="p89">89.</a> Items 95, 96 and 97 of the transcript of interview referred to the testing of 1,000 AIDS patients in China. When Mr Yan asked whetherit was</p>    <p>the Plaintiff's estimate that there were 1,000 patients in the Pearl River Delta, he confirmed that there were 1,000 patients.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="pseudopara" id="p90">90.</a> Dr Li confirmed that when Mr Yan informed him that the Plaintiff intended to test 1,000 patients, he was under the impression thatthe test was to be carried out in Guangdong. As the AIDS population in Guangdong was about 74, he doubted how the Plaintiff couldfind 1,000 patients. Undoubtedly it was natural and necessary for someone in Dr Li's position, who was a specialist in treating HIVand AIDS, to make the comment.</p>    <p class="heading">16.

The Defendants used him to attack the Shaoguan Department of Healthby suggesting that they did not know what was going on. This also suggested that he was a liar.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="pseudopara" id="p92">92.</a> Mr Yan had before writing the article telephoned the Shaoguan Department of Health and he was connected to Mr Ma who claimed to bethe Section Head of the Drugs Certifying Section. The conversation between Mr Yan and Mr Ma was, of course, hearsay in nature. However,based on the conversation, the conclusion reached by Mr Yan was that the Department of Health of Shaoguan did not know about thepackaging contract. The mere fact that the Shaoguan Health Department was not aware that the Shaoguan Factory had entered into thecontract with the Plaintiff did not mean that the statement was defamatory of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="pseudopara" id="p93">93.</a> The Plaintiff also referred to an inspection certificate issued by the Shaoguan Drugs Certification Section. The document purportedto record the carrying out of an inspection on Retrogen. The date of the report was 18th October 1993 which was sometime after thearticle had been published. The Plaintiff did not explain how he obtained this document. This document does not contradict the conclusionreached by Mr Yan that the Department of Health of Shaoguan had no knowledge of the packaging contract.</p>    <p class="heading">17.

This passage also attacked the China asa corrupting government.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="pseudopara" id="p95">95.</a> The Plaintiff complained that the Defendants accused him of setting up and donating monies to the AIDS Foundation because the Plaintiffwanted to get approval for his experimenting drugs in China.</p>    <p class="heading">The ruling</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="pseudopara" id="p96">96.</a> In my view the sentence that "In order to obtain the approval for Retrogen from the Chinese side, Ki Ping-ki also had a land sellingplan." does not bear the meaning relied upon by the Plaintiff, namely that he was corrupting the Chinese officials by the land sellingplan.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="pseudopara" id="p97">97.</a> According to the Plaintiff, he had registered in the State of Iowa an entity called the Iowana College. Although it was describedas a college, this entity did not have any premises nor did it carry out any teaching or any activities at all. This college intendedto sell to the people in China a piece of land in the U.S. which would be divided into small fractions. Money raised by the saleof land would be used for various purposes including donation to the AIDS Foundation which was to be set up by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="pseudopara" id="p98">98.</a> The making of the packaging contract and the land selling plan were carried out at about the same time.

It should be written as "Besides using the funding to save the patients,it is also used to fulfil the last dreams to those kids who are not able to be saved".

On a balance of probability, it is unlikely that if the Plaintiff was to set up the AIDSFoundation, he would inform others that the purpose was not for the purpose of helping AIDS patients.
