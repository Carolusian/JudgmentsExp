It is common ground that, as auditors, the defendants' responsibility is, in the first place, to the members of Texxonand Chino: see <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s141.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 141(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>. Normally, auditors in making their report on the financial statements of companies under audit owe no duty of care to strangersto the company: however careless they may have been. As Lord Reid said in <u>Hedley Byrne</u> v. <u>Heller</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 465</a> at 483, negligent misrepresentation gives no cause of action in common law: mere mis-statement is not enough, there must be somethingmore.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> The question boils down to this: Has Simister pleaded enough facts to establish, arguably, that it was in sufficient proximity tothe defendants, short of contract, to land the defendants with legal liability for mis-statement?</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The judge Cheung J in a 35-page judgment given on 26 July 1995 held against the plaintiff. He ordered that the pleadings be struckout and the action dismissed with costs. Hence this appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">The Background facts</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The reports were made by the defendants on 28 April 1989. They were unqualified: that is to say, that the financial statements ofTexxan and Chino, showing profits before tax of respectively HK$3.797m and HK$8.088m for the year ending 31/3/1988, gave a true andfair view of the companies' affairs and of their profits as at that date; in other words that the combined profits of the two companiesamounted to $11.885m.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> It is this, as the plaintiff avers, which is misleading: If proper provisions had been made for bad debts the companies would haveshown substantial losses; and if the defendants had exercised proper care, they would have known this and should not have made theunqualified report which they did.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> To understand how the plaintiff, not itself a member of Texxan and Chino - but, through a holding company, controlling a majorityof its shares comes to have suffered the loss and damage as pleaded, it is necessary to go into the background facts. They may besummarised as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="6%"> </td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="4%">(i)</td>            <td valign='top' align="left" width="90%">On 24 June 1988 the plaintiff (Simister) entered into an agreement called a subscription and shareholders agreement to acquire, througha holding company, a substantial shareholding in Texxan and Chino.

The precise nature of the relationship between the parties has not been ascertained by evidence.What the defendants were seeking to do, by their summons, was in effect to drive the plaintiff from the judgment seat. This is adrastic remedy and it follows that no court should give effect to it unless it is satisfied that the legal basis of the claim isunarguable or almost incontestably bad: and, as Sir Thomas Bingham M.R. remarked in <u>E (A minor)</u> v. <u>Dorset County Council</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%203%20WLR%20853" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 3 WLR 853</a> at 865, where the legal viability of the cause of action is sensitive to the facts, an order to strike out should not be made.</p>    <p class="heading">The legal basis of the claim</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The foundation of the claim - a claim for purely economic loss - goes back to the decision of the House of Lords in <u>Hedley Byrne</u> v. <u>Heller</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 465.</a> The principle has since been refined in many intervening cases. There is in my judgment considerable danger in over-refinement, inan area of the law where the duty-situation is identified by such broad concepts as foreseeability, proximity and fairness: see NeillLJ in <u>James McNaughton</u> v. <u>Hicks Anderson</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%202%20QB%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 2 QB 113</a> at 123H. Attempt at refinement is particularly inappropriate in an application to strike out the claim before the true facts havebeen ascertained. It would appear in reading the lengthy judgment of Cheung J that he had, in the course of the hearing, entertainedelaborate submissions from counsel on the case law. Many of the reported cases since <u>Hedley Byrne</u> v. <u>Heller</u> were apparently subjected to the closest scrutiny. The so-called six propositions set out in Neill LJ's judgment in <u>James McNaughton</u> v. <u>Hicks Anderson</u> at 125-6 were examined as if they were words in a statute: when Neill LJ himself meant them as no more than a series of "overlappingheadings" under which the basis for the claim in that case might conveniently be examined.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The broad principle to be applied in a case such as the present one is clear enough. It was formulated in Lord Bridge's judgmentin <u>Caparo Industries</u> v. <u>Dickman</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 AC 605</a> at 620 H to 621 B as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" The salient feature of all these cases is that the defendant giving advice or information was fully aware of the nature of the transactionwhich the plaintiff had in contemplation, knew that the advice or information would be communicated to him directly or indirectlyand knew that it was very likely that the plaintiff would rely on that advice or information in deciding whether or not to engagein the transaction in contemplation. In these circumstances the defendant could clearly be expected, subject always to the effectof any disclaimer of responsibility, specifically to anticipate that the plaintiff would rely on the advice or information givenby the defendant for the very purpose for which he did in the event rely on it. So also the plaintiff, subject again to the effectof any disclaimer, would in that situation reasonably suppose that he was entitled to rely on the advice or information communicatedto him for the very purpose for which he required it."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Applying law to the facts as pleaded</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Here, the "transaction" which the plaintiff clearly had in contemplation was the exercise of its contractual rights against Koonunder Schedule 2 and Clause 11.1 of the agreement: the right to demand an adjustment of the price and a right to "put" the sharesback to Koon for $24.6m. This put option had to be exercised by the plaintiff within 30 days of the publication of the audited accounts.On the pleadings the defendants were aware of the nature of the transaction. They knew that the audited accounts (and the report)would be communicated to the plaintiff. They had knowledge of the price adjustment mechanism and the put option in the shareholders'agreement and therefore knew that it was very likely that the plaintiff would rely on the audited accounts (and the report) in decidingwhether the price adjustment mechanism or the put option might be triggered.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> It seems to me that, on the facts as pleaded, this case lies at the opposite end of the spectrum from those cases where the impositionof liability would be grossly unfair to professional people, exposing them to "liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminatetime to an indeterminate class" (in the words of Cardozo CJ quoted by Lord Bridge in <u>Caparo</u> v. <u>Dickman</u> at 621 D). It is difficult to imagine a stronger case of a special relationship short of contract. The defendants had been appointed,before the acquisition of Koon's shares, to conduct a special audit of the companies for the eight months ending 30/11/87 and thecombined profits figure thus ascertained - amounting to $8.761m became the bench-mark for the exercise of the put/call options inthe agreement. For the purposes of Clause 11.1 the combined profits were to be computed by reference to the audited accounts madeup to 31/3/88 and to be conclusively certified by the defendants acting as experts and not arbitrators. The occasion for the exerciseof the option under clause 11.1 in fact never arose because the combined profits as shown in the audited accounts exceeded the bench-mark,so there was no question of the defendants being called upon to "certify" as experts: But if, for some reason, they had been calledupon to do so, nothing suggests that the figure in the certificate would have been any different from that in the audited accounts.(The only possible variation would have been inter-company transaction profits Which were to be expressly excluded from the profitsfigure as certified: But, as pleaded in the statement of claim, the audited accounts showed no inter-company transaction profits.)With that as background, the defendants then went on to conduct the full year's audit, knowing that the figures thus revealed wouldbe relied upon in the exercise of contractual rights under the agreement by the parties.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The defendants' exposure to liability is limited to two persons: Koon and the plaintiff; the amount is limited to the loss the plaintiff(or Koon) might have suffered arising from their inability to exercise their contractual rights under the agreement as a result ofthe defendants' negligent mis-statement. It is difficult to think of a situation further away from Cardozo CJ's classic dictum.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Mr Ribeiro QC counsel for the defendants argues that to bring the defendants within the special relationship giving rise to legalliability for mis-statement the plaintiffs had to require the defendants to "certify" the combined profits under Clause 11.1: or,perhaps stronger still, if the defendants had actually done so. I fail to see why. It was because the plaintiffs relied on the defendants'report - verifying the companies' combined profits well in excess of the bench mark figure - that they did not call for the certificate.There was no occasion to do so. If the profit figures in the audited accounts were correct as the plaintiff thought they were therewas no question of the put option being exercised. This, according to the plaintiff, was the precise reason why they look now tothe defendants for damages.</p>    <p class="heading">The judgment</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I turn now to look briefly at the judgment in the court below.

He spokeof the defendants' role in "computing" and "conclusively determining" the combined profits and said that the defendants had <u>assumed</u> no relevant relationship with the plaintiff and Koon. But, with respect, that plainly is the wrong test. The judge is equating thespecial relationship in this branch of the law with contract, when the whole basis for the imposition of liability is that thereis no contract. As Lord Griffiths said in <u>Smith</u> v. <u>Eric S. Bush</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20AC%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 AC 831</a> at 862:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" ... I do not think that voluntary assumption of responsibility is a helpful or realistic test for liability. It is true that referenceis made in a number of the speeches in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> to the assumption of responsibility as a test of liability but it must be remembered that those speeches were made in the contestof a case in which the central issue was whether a duty of care could arise when there had been an express disclaimer of responsibilityfor the accuracy of the advice. Obviously, if an adviser expressly assumes responsibility for his advice, a duty of care will arise,but such is extremely unlikely in the ordinary course of events. The House of Lords approved a duty of care being imposed on thefacts in Cann v. Willson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2039%20ChD%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 39 Ch.D. 39</a> and <i>in Candler v. Crane, Christmas &amp; Co.</i> [1951]2 K.B. 164. But if the surveyor in <i>Cann v. Willson</i> or the accountant in <i>Candler</i> v. <i>Crane, Christmas &amp; Co.</i> had actually been asked if he was voluntarily assuming responsibility for his advice to the mortgagee or the purchaser of the shares,I have little doubt he would have replied, 'Certainly not. My responsibility is limited to the person who employs me.' The phrase'assumption of responsibility' can only have any real meaning if it is understood as referring to the circumstances in which thelaw will deem the maker of the statement to have assumed responsibility to the person who acts upon the advice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Taking the view, as the judge apparently did, that to establish liability on the defendants' part, there must in effect be a voluntaryassumption of responsibility by them, it is not surprising that he then went on to conclude that the plaintiff's pleading was defective.As he puts it at p30H of his judgment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"there is no allegation that the Defendants <u>intended</u> that Simister should place reliance on the statutory audit for the purpose of Simister's own evaluation ... as to its position underthe Shareholders Agreement."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Obviously if the defendants had actually intended - and can be shown to have intended - that the plaintiff should place relianceon their statement, this would be almost conclusive in establishing proximity. But there is no such requirement in law, and the judgewas wrong to have so concluded.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> What is pleaded in this case is that the defendants <u>knew</u> or should have known that the plaintiff would rely on their statements: para 16 of the statement of claim. That, plainly, is enough.It was not necessary to go on to aver that the defendants so intended: subjective intention of this nature would be impossible toprove and can form no part of the legal requirement. It does not appear in Lord Bridge's formulation of the principle in <u>Caparo Industries</u> v. <u>Dickman</u> as I have quoted earlier, nor does it feature in Lord Oliver's speech at 638-9. If there is any valid distinction between <u>knowledge</u> on the part of the defendants and <u>intention</u>, then it is clear on a proper reading of the judgments in <u>Caparo Industries</u> v. <u>Dickman</u> that where the House of Lords referred to intention, their Lordships meant intention <u>actual</u> or <u>inferred</u>. Plainly, from the facts as pleaded in the statement of claim, intention can be inferred in this case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> In short, the judge formulated for himself the wrong test. He failed to look at the facts as pleaded in the round, to see if, arguably,it established sufficient proximity to found the special relationship. He erred, for example, when he said (p19 M of his judgment)that the financial statements for the 8 months' period up to 30th November 1987 were "of no relevance". He failed to appreciate that,by accepting appointment as auditors for the special audit, prior to the execution of the agreement, the defendants were immediatelybrought into close touch with the plaintiff. The profits shown in the accounts ending 30/11/87 formed, as I have mentioned earlier,the bench-mark for triggering the put/call options: the transaction giving rise to the plaintiff's loss.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> In my judgment, the statement of claim shows a viable cause of action against the defendants and the judge erred in ordering it tobe struck out.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> There is before us a motion for leave to amend the statement of claim.

In these circumstances the defendant could clearly be expected, subject alwaysto the effect of any disclaimer of responsibility, specifically to anticipate that the plaintiff would rely on the advice or informationgiven by the defendant for the very purpose for which he did in the event rely on it. So also the plaintiff, subject again to theeffect of any disclaimer, would in that situation reasonably suppose that he was entitled to rely on the advice or information communicatedto him for the very purpose for which he required it. The situation is entirely different where a statement is put into more or lessgeneral circulation and may foreseeably be relied on by strangers to the maker of statement for any one of a variety of differentpurposes which the maker of the statement to be under a duty of care in respect of the accuracy of the statement to all and sundryfor any purpose for which they may choose to rely on it is not only to subject him, in the classic words of Cardozo C.J. to 'liabilityin an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class:' see <i>Ultramares</i> <i>Corporation</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Touch</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%20174%20NE%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 174 N.E. 441</a>, 444; It is also to confer on the world at large a quite unwarranted entitlement to appropriate for their own purposes the benefitof the expert knowledge or professional expertise attributed to the maker of the statement. Hence, looking only at the circumstancesof these decided cases where a duty of care in respect of negligent statements has been held to exist, I should expect to find thatthe 'limit or control mechanism ... imposed upon the liability of a wrongdoer towards those who have suffered economic damage inconsequence of his negligence' rested in the necessity to prove, in this category of the tort of the negligence, as an essentialingredient of the 'proximity' between the plaintiff and the defendant, that the defendant knew that his statement would be communicatedto the plaintiff, either as an individual or as a member of an identifiable class, specifically in connection with a particular transactionor transactions of a particular kind (e.g. in a prospectus inviting investment) and that the plaintiff would be very likely to relyon it for the purpose of deciding whether or not to enter upon that transaction or upon a transaction of that kind."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> The speech of Lord Oliver at p638 is also of relevance to the present case and is in conformity with the views expressed by LordBridge:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"What can be deduced from the <i>Hedley Byrne</i> case, therefore, is that the necessary relationship between the maker of a statement or giver of advice ('the adviser') and the recipientwho acts in reliance upon it ('the advisee') may typically be held to exist where (1) the advice is required for a purpose, whetherparticularly specified or generally described, which is made known, either actually or inferentially, to the adviser at the timewhen the advice is given; (2) the adviser knows, either actually or inferentially, that his advice will be communicated to the advisee,either specifically or as a member of an ascertainable class, in order that it should be used by the advisee for that purpose; (3)it is known either actually or inferentially, that the advice so communicated is likely to be acted upon by the advisee for thatpurpose without independent inquiry, and (4) it is so acted upon by the advisee to his detriment.

But if the statementis made to an identifiable person and the maker not only knows that it will or is likely to be acted upon but also intended thatit should be acted upon for a particular purpose, then these may well exemplify 'circumstances in which the law will deem the makerof the statement to have assumed responsibility' to the person who acts upon it: per Lord Griffiths, at p.862E.

It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the relationship by definitionmust be 'voluntary' in the sense that no consideration proceeds from the plaintiff for the defendant's advice."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> I have no doubt that this is right.

There must also be a sufficient 'relationship of proximity' between plaintiff and defendant.It must also be 'just and reasonable' to impose liability on the defendant for what has occurred. Proximity is a somewhat uncertainconcept, representing, as it does, no more than a description of the kind of relationship between the parties which the courts considercapable of giving rise to a duty of care.

In fact, Lord Oliver, the Law Lord who, counselfor the defendants submitted, had suggested this, acknowledged in the same case that another House of Lords decision Smith v. Bush[1990] 1 A.C.831 established "beyond doubt that the law may attribute an assumption of responsibility quite regardless of the expressedintentions of the adviser" (see p.641 1F and also p.638H). Nor do I think the Court of Appeal in <strong>Galoo Ltd v. Bright Grahame Murray</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%201360" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 W.L.R. 1360</a> which applied the <strong>Caparo</strong> case and <strong>Morgan Crucible Co.

I note from the facts of the <strong>Galoo</strong> case that for the claim which the Court did not strike out, the pleading did not expressly allege that the statements in questionwere intended to be relied on. I do accept, however, that if an audit was intended to be relied on. this would be a very relevantcircumstance for consideration.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> There must of course be a relationship of proximity to give rise to a duty of care. But there can be no simple test or criterionfor proximity. As Lord Oliver in the <strong>Caparo</strong> case said at p. 633 D:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Proximity is no doubt a convenient expression so long as it is realised that it is no more than a label which embraces not a definableconcept but merely a description of circumstances from which pragmatically, the courts conclude that a duty of care exists."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">He also sounded a note of caution on generalisation. He said at p.635H:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"One must, however, be careful about seeking to find any general principle which will serve as a touchstone for all cases, for evenwithin the limited category of what, for the sake of convenience, I may refer to as 'the negligent statement cases,' circumstancesmay differ infinitely and, in a swiftly developing field of law, there can be no necessary assumption that those features which haveserved in one case to create the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant on which liability depends will necessarilybe determinative of liability in different circumstances of another case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> At the end of the day, the court has to decide whether the particular situation before it is one which it is fair and reasonableto impose a duty of care having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Counsel argued that the financial statements for the year ended 31st March 1988 were audited by the defendants for the purpose ofthe <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>.</i> However, it can also be said that when they did that, they knew that these statements were also required by the plaintiff for thepurpose of exercising its rights under the Subscription and Shareholders Agreement and were of vital importance not only to the partiesto that Agreement but also to the defendants themselves if and when they were asked to make a certification. As counsel for the plaintiffsubmitted, if intention (actual or inferential) is a necessary ingredient for giving rise to a duty of care, in such circumstances,the defendants may arguably be said to be taken to have intended that those statements would be relied on by the plaintiff. It seemsto me that the purpose of the certificate was to put matters beyond doubt in case the parties to the Agreement wanted to exercisetheir rights under that agreement and to lay at rest any possible dispute between them. It is most unlikely that the defendants whohad audited the financial statements would have done anything other than adding figures based on the statements and certifying ineffect the correctness of those statements. I think it is artificial to say that it must be the certificate which can only give riseto a duty of care on the part of the defendants towards the plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> This is not a case of foreseeability alone. My Lords have set out the facts as pleaded and I do not propose to repeat them. Assumingthose facts to be correct, I take the view that they disclose sufficient circumstances which can very arguably establish a relationshipof proximity. With respect to the learned judge, I do not think the plaintiff's cause of action as pleaded is obviously unsustainable.I too would allow the appeal.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Henry Litton)</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="34%">(Simon Mayo)</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="33%">(Patrick Chan)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="33%">Vice President</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="34%">Justice of Appeal</td>            <td valign='top' style="text-align:center" width="33%">Judge of the High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="left">Representation:</p>        <p align="left">Mr Robert Tang QC leading Mr Joseph Fok inst'd by M/S Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master for 2nd Plaintiff/Appellant</p>        <p align="left">Mr Robert Ribeiro, QC, leading Mr Godfrey Lam inst'd by M/S Barlow Lyde &amp; Gilbert for 1st Defendant/1st Respondent</p>        <p align="left">Mr William Stone, QC inst'd by M/S Deacons, Graham and James for 2nd Defedant/2nd Respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p align="left"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/1996/554.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
