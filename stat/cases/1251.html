By the judgment, it was declared thatthe registration of Hong Kong Trade Mark Numbers 300065196 âPING ANâ in class 36 and 300065213 âå¹³å®â in class 36 in thename of the respondent in respect of âè²¡å; éèäºåâ (financial affairs and monetary affairs) were invalid and the judgefurther ordered that the trade mark registrations and the Trade Marks Register in respect of those trade marks be amended by deletionof âè²¡å; éèäºåâ (financial affairs and monetary affairs).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The respondent to that application appealed that judgment.  At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal judgment was reservedwhich we now give.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Background</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The respondent was established in March 1988.  There were various changes of the company name and in January 2003 it adopted itspresent name âä¸­åå¹³å®ä¿éª(éå)è¡ä»½æéå¬å¸â (Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd.  The evidence showsthat as of 2002 it was the second largest insurance company in the Mainland.  It had over 31 million customers, 70 Branch offices,3600 sub-branch offices and in addition to the 8000 employee it had 180,000 sales agents.  Mr Yao Jun, the Chief Legal Officer andJoint Company Secretary, gave evidence that the respondent offered multiple financial, insurance and trusts services under the sameroof.  It has a trust company, China Ping An Trust and Investment Company Ltd, which, apparently is commonly known as Ping An Trust(ä¸­åå¹³å®ä¿¡è¨æè³æéè²¬ä»»å¬å¸).   It also has a securities business, Ping An Securities Company Ltd, known as PingAn Securities (å¹³å®è­å¸æéè²¬ä»»å¬å¸).  As of December 2003 it was one of 55 trust companies authorised by the Peoples Bankof China, the central bank of the Peopleâs Republic, to operate trust business in the Mainland.  Although Ping An Securities isbased in the Mainland, it operates an internet financial portal which is referred to as PA-18.  Even as long ago as 20 August 2003it had 300 customers who were Hong Kong residents.  Those customers could trade in B shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stockexchanges.  By August 2003, the value of stocks held by Ping An Securities on behalf of its Hong Kong customers was some HK$138,523,781.30. In addition there was a small amount in US dollars.</p>    <!--sino section party --><parties>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The respondentâs subsidiary China Ping An Insurance (Hong Kong) Company Limited (ä¸­åå¹³å®ä¿éª(é¦æ¸¯)æéå¬å¸) has since1992 been carrying on business in Hong Kong.  The turnover figures show that between 1999 and 2003 it had a consistently rising turnoverranging from $91.8 million to $104.3 million.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  By application dated 20 August 2003 the respondent registered the trade marks Ping An and âå¹³å®â in various classes includingclass 36 for âè²¡å; éèäºå; æ¿å°ç¢äºåâ which constitute financial affairs; monetary affairs; real estate affairs.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  For many years the respondent has had a high profile internationally.  As the exhibits to Mr Yao Junâs first affirmation show,back in 1993 Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs acquired 7.6% of the respondentâs equity.  That constituted more than 50% of itsthen tradeable equity.  Those companies pursued the investment with some vigour.  At their request a well-known international accountingfirm was brought in as the respondentâs financial adviser and for the 8 subsequent years the accounts were prepared in accordancewith international accounting standards.  Following that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs assisted the respondent in its internationalexpansion by seeking other major investors.  Those who demonstrated an interest in taking up a substantial shareholding included,apparently, Citigroup and Munich Re-insurance. </p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  As it transpired however it was HSBC which made that major investment.  Rumours had begun to circulate as early as May 2002 andin July 2002 HSBC issued a statement that it was in negotiations with the respondent to make a major investment.  Those negotiationsmatured on 8 October 2002 when HSBC invested US$600 million (equivalent to $5 billion RMB) for a 10% stake in âPing An Insuranceâreferring to it in the announcement also simply as âPing Anâ.  At the time, it was reported that the âExecutive Presidentâof HSBC explained that when Ping An Insurance listed 2 years later, HSBC would increase its shareholding in the respondent.  Althoughthe subsequent events took place after the relevant time for the purposes of these proceedings it can be stated that the ExecutivePresidentâs statement was no mere conjecture.  The respondent was, indeed, listed in Hong Kong in 2004 and today is one of theconstituents of the Hang Seng Index.</p>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The applicant</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The applicant was incorporated in March 1993 under the name Ping On Securities Ltd (âå¹³å®è¡ç¥¨æéå¬å¸â).  In Novemberof that year it commenced business as a stockbroker.  It appears that it took over the business, previously run as a partnership,of Ping On &amp; Co.  It did so without any formal assignment either of the business or the goodwill.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Ping On &amp; Co. commenced business in 1970.  Its Business Registration certificates only referred to the name in English.  Thefirm was a founder member of the Far East Stock Exchange.  Its business and that of the applicant appeared to be that of what wouldbe termed small stockbrokers.  In paragraph 14 of the judgment the judge refers to the turnover figures in 2003 and 2004 ($859 millionfor 2003 and in excess of $2 billion in 2004).  These can be compared with the turnover figure as at 31 December 2003 on the HongKong securities market (namely $10,456,801 million) which is quoted in the SFC annual report for 2003-4, which is referred to inparagraph 14 of the affirmation of Michael Chan filed on behalf of the applicant.  The figures quoted by the judge when seen in contextdemonstrate the smallness in size, if not insignificance, of the applicantâs business.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 6 April 2003 the applicant was purchased by the Baron Group.  In his first affirmation, Mr Michael Sze, the managing directorof the applicant, said that the Baron Group through a subsidiary, Grand Ahead Finance Ltd, which is apparently a BVI company, owns50.1% of the company, a Mr Michael Chan owns 27%, Mr Sze himself owned 14.9% and a Mr Ho Hau Wong 8%.  In that first affirmationMr Sze was very happy to have the applicant associated with the Baron Group.  This, no doubt, lead the judge to refer to the BaronGroup as being an established group.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Mr Michael Chan also made an affirmation in which he sought to establish the reputation of the applicant.  Directed to that, atparagraph 19b., he produced copies of 4 announcements relating to what were said to have been âmajor transactions, listings, initialpublic offering handled by the Applicant.â  All the transactions involved the applicant as an underwriter, as opposed to a sponsor,lead manager or manager.  The first related to a listing on the GEM market by way of placement which had taken place, seemingly,in February 2005 in respect of Sungreen International Holdings Ltd.  It would thus appear to relate to events which took place afterany period relevant as regards the issues in this case.  Nevertheless, the IPO was to raise a mere $50 million out of which wouldhave to be paid the expenses.</p>        <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The next item was in relation to the private placement of 43 million warrants in Kenfair International (Holdings) Ltd.  The othertwo matters related to the offer in May 2003 with the prospectus in June 2003 in relation to GR Investment International Ltd.  Itwould appear that Baron Capital Ltd was involved in this.</p>    </parties><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Baron Capital was not known to this court, despite the fact that the judge below referred to it as an âestablishedâ company. Furthermore, reference to the daily quotes of shares showed that Sungreen International Holdings Ltd seemed to be a very sparselytraded share.  When this matter first came before this court, two years after the IPO, its share price was listed at standing at193 P/E and no dividend was recorded.  The fact that a private placement was underwritten reflected very little on the underwriter. It seemed curious that the applicant might claim any specific reputation as a result of underwriting placements particularly inview of the fact that in the case of Sungreen International Limited only $50 million less expenses had been raised.  In this respectin March 2003 the âReport by the Expert Group to Review the Operation of the Securities and Futures Market Regulatory Structureâhad referred to listings of that size as indicating poor and inferior quality: see Chapter 2 of the Report.  Finally, GR InvestmentsInternational Ltd had changed its name to Prosperity Investment Holdings Ltd but had made losses in 2004 and 2005 and had only madea profit by 2006.  The most recent quote still shows that the shares of this company as having no yield but the P/E is now down toa more respectable 16.2.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In order to understand the significance of the applicant being owned by the Baron Group, this court of its own motion undertooka brief internet search.  The result of the search forms exhibit STP-11 to the fourth affirmation of Michael Sze.  The contents ofthat exhibit, namely copies of articles which had appeared on the âWebb Pageâ would appear to show dealings that put the BaronGroup in an unflattering light, to say the least.  This court, therefore, considered it appropriate to draw to the partiesâ attentionwhat had come to the courtâs attention as a result of attempting to understand the applicantâs own evidence in relying on itsconnection with the Baron Group.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Naturally, an adjournment was sought.  The parties were given an opportunity to file further evidence.  Mr Michael Sze filed a furtheraffirmation in which amongst other things he sought to criticise the writer of and proprietor of the Webb Page.  The subject matterof that criticism would appear to be irrelevant as regards the articles in question or their import and somewhat tendentious in viewof the newspaper article upon which the criticism was based.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In contrast to his first affirmation, Mr Michael Sze sought in paragraph 11 of his fourth affirmation to distance the applicantand himself from the Baron Group.  He explains how the Baron Group was wholly owned by Mr Joseph Wan and he says that the managementof the Baron Group and of the applicant was âentirely separateâ.  He says that âneither Mr Joseph Wan nor any other companiesor officers of Baron have influenced or interfered, directly or indirectly, with the management and operation of the Respondent (<i>the applicant</i>)â.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Michael Sze also said in his fourth affirmation that he had not been involved in nor had any personal knowledge of the transactionsreferred to in the Webb Page articles.  This is, perhaps, the most surprising statement of all, not least, because in paragraph 5of his first affirmation Mr Michael Sze had said that he became the managing director of the applicant on 7 April 2003 and was responsiblefor the overall operation of the applicant.  The notice of the proposed share consolidation and the open offer to qualifying shareholderson the basis of a three shares for one consolidated share dated 26 May 2003 and the prospectus which was issued on 25 June 2003 relateto matters which are referred to under the heading âGRI makes an open offerâ in the article entitled âThe Baron Networkâdated 14 April 2004.  The applicant apparently received a fee of 1.5%.  The discount was said to be some 72% to the 10-day averageprice of GR Investment International Ltd.  The article severely criticised this as being a deep discount which would not have beenallowed under the Listing Rules in the United Kingdom but was not contrary to the rules in Hong Kong   One of the points of the articlewas that it was suggested that the Listing Rules should be altered to prohibit such deep discounts.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Mr Szeâs proclaimed ignorance of and non-involvement in the transactions referred to in the article is also surprising given thefact that another of the matters referred to in that article relate to the private placement of the 43 million warrants in KenfairInternational (Holdings) Ltd.  That was the subject of the notice dated 25 November 2003 exhibited to Mr Michael Chanâs affirmation. That placement was underwritten by the applicant and Hantec International Finance Group Limited for a fee of 3% of the placing price. The net effect of that placement was that the combined purchase and exercise price of the warrants was $1.27 which was said to bean 18% discount to the market price.  The shares underlying the warrants were equivalent to 20% of the then existing issued shares. The Baron Group took up 49.31% of that issue.  Again the article points out that there appeared to be a lacuna which required attentionin the Listing Rules.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Sze states that he had contacted Mr Joseph Wan and had been told that he had clarified the issues raised in the Webb Page articleswith the Securities and Futures Commission and that that body was satisfied with Mr Wanâs âclarificationsâ and decided to takeno action against the Baron Group.  However, when the Webb Page articles are read with a modicum of care it can be seen that it isnot surprising that no action was taken because, as the articles point out, although it would appear that in both these transactionsthe Baron Group profited considerably in a manner which was quite arguably to the considerable disadvantage, if not abuse, of theminority shareholders, the article portrayed this as being a lacuna in the Listing Rules.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  One thing, however, did emerge from the further evidence namely that Mr Joseph Wan, who is the owner of Baron Capital which in turnowns the 50.1% stake in the applicant, had been found guilty in 1996 of failing âto meet the standards of commercial conduct andbehaviour that the SFC, through the Takeovers Code, seeks to achieve and considers acceptable for advisers in takeover transactions.â Specifically, the SFC found that Mr Wan failed to ensure the accuracy of announcements made in connection with a proposed acquisitionand general offer.  As a result Mr Wanâs registration as an investment adviser was suspended for a period of 12 months effectivefrom 6 March 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  It had also previously been known that amongst others Mr Michael Chan and Ping On Securities Ltd had been prosecuted in the WesternMagistracy on 24 June 1998 in relation on three summonses in relation to aiding and abetting three employees of Ping On SecuritiesLtd who were not registered with the SFC to perform functions of dealers representatives.  They were fined $3000 each and orderedto pay $30,000 costs.  They were both fined by the Disciplinary Committee of the Stock Exchange, the applicant in the sum of $40,000and Mr Chan in the sum of $10,000.  Both were publicly reprimanded by the SFC.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In my view Mr Szeâs evidence in relation to the change of name by the applicant on 26 May 2003 has to be considered with somescepticism if not outright disbelief.  Mr Michael Chan in his affirmation referred to that change on 6 May 2003 being made by thenew management of the applicant to reflect the Mandarin translation and the nationality of the new management.  In his first affirmationMr Michael Sze went further.  He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Being a Shanghainese, I felt that the English name of the Applicant, âPing Onâ, is pronounced too Cantonese and thereby decidedto change it to âPing Anâ to reflect the Mandarin transliteration and the new management.  Indeed, the Chinese transliterationor translation for âPing Onâ and âPing Anâ, i.e. å¹³å® are the same and identical and that there can be no other interpretations.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In his the second affirmation Mr Michael Sze went so far as to say that he did not even know of the existence of the respondentuntil its listing on the stock exchange in June 2004.  This is repeated in paragraph 19 of his fourth affirmation.  One can onlyconclude that Mr Szeâs professed desire to demonstrate a connection with Mandarin and the Mainland was not accompanied by any knowledgeof what was taking place in the Mainland nor on the financial markets there.  Indeed his knowledge of investments in Hong Kong securitiescould not have extended to any knowledge that one of the largest companies quoted on the Hong Kong stock exchange had invested morethan 5 billion RMB in a major Mainland company.  Such professed ignorance is more likely incredible since, if it were true, it wouldreflect what would be little short of rank incompetence of any stock broker.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  It was made clear in the course of the hearing that such statements of professed ignorance on the part of Mr Sze would likely bereceived with outright incredulity.  Mr Shipp, who appeared on behalf of the respondent, was unwilling to argue that Mr Sze shouldnot be believed, because there had been no cross-examination of Mr Sze in the court below.  In my view cross-examination of Mr Sze,in the context, would really have been a formality.  What is evident is that the major shareholder of the applicant, namely Mr Wan,whose own reputation in the financial field, particularly as to the honesty of statements made to the market for which he has beenheld responsible, is by no means fragrant, has given no evidence.  Mr Michael Chan, whose reputation is also not without blemish,merely sought to give evidence on behalf of Mr Michael Sze.  A change of a company name requires a special resolution.  It wouldthus not have been possible for any change of the company name of the applicant to have taken place without the concurrence of boththose persons as well as Mr Michael Sze.  Mr Joseph Wan has provided no evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In the court below the judge accepted the reasons given by the applicant for the change of name from Ping On to Ping An.  Giventhe fact that there was no evidence from the major shareholders of the applicant in relation to that and given the nature of theevidence at the time it was before the judge, I do not consider that that finding was one that was sound.  Given the further evidencewhich has now emerged, that is a finding to which the applicant is clearly not entitled.  The fact is that Ping An and Ping On aredifferent.  The only possible conclusion is that at the time the name was changed those in control of Ping On Securities Ltd knewfull well about the respondent, knew that HSBC had made a major investment in it and was content that if there were to be confusionbetween its new name and that of the respondent that that should happen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The decision below</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The judge below accepted the applicantâs broad claim to reputation without any true analysis of the evidence that was put forward. In particular, the judge was prepared to accept that âPing Anâ was the same as âPing Onâ and that reputation in âPingOnâ was carried forward to the new name.  As already referred to, the figures quoted by the applicant for turnover are by no meansimpressive in the way that the judge apparently considered them to be.  In accepting the bald statement that the applicant was, forexample, involved in organising IPOâs the judge clearly did not give careful consideration to the implication to be derived fromthe exhibits referred to above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The judge correctly considered that the question in this case turned upon whether the applicant established its case of passingoff in accordance with section 12(5)(<i>a</i>) of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559">Cap. 559</a> (âthe Ordinanceâ).

The new provision follows a similar change in the United Kingdom legislation namelyunder the Trade Marks Act 1994.  It replaces provisions which did not determine validity of a mark in terms of passing off.  Theessence of a passing off action is that one trader must prove that he has acquired goodwill or reputation attached to goods or servicesin the mind of the purchasing public by association with an identifying get-up (whether it be a brand name or whatever) such thatthe public recognise that get-up as distinctive specifically of his goods or services, there must be a misrepresentation by anothertrader which is likely to lead to the public to the belief that the goods or services offered by him are those of the other and theremust be damage.  See the analysis by Lord Oliver in <i>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd. v Borden Inc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20RPC%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] RPC 341</a> at 406.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  This courtâs attention was drawn to the decision of Geoffrey Hobbs  QC, sitting as the Appointed Person, in the case of <i>WILD CHILD Trade Mark</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20RPC%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] RPC 455.</a>  As was pointed out in that decision the question raised is whether normal and fair use of the particular mark registered for thepurpose of distinguishing the goods, or in this case the services, from those of other undertakings was liable to be prevented atthe date of application for registration by an action for passing off.

been cited with approval in other cases including in particular in the judgment of Pumfrey J (as he then was) in <i>REEF Trade Mark</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%20RPC%20397"

id="p36">36.</a>  If one considers, therefore, the manner in which the applicant has traded in the past, the first matter which is apparent is thatthe name Ping On and Ping An and the characterså¹³å®have been used almost exclusively, if not always, as part of the name of thefirm and the name of the company.  Despite the fact that massive documentation was exhibited in this case, it does not appear thatthere has been any, or giving the applicant the benefit of any doubt, any significant use of the words Ping On and Ping An and thecharacterså¹³å®on their own: they have always been used as part of the names of the firm and the company.  Furthermore, there hasbeen no advertising as the regulations relating to the stockbroking industry do not permit it.  As Mr Shipp pointed out the applicanthas also always used the words and characters in conjunction with its own logo and, very frequently, in conjunction with referenceto the Baron Group.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Mr Shipp stressed in argument that whatever reputation the applicant had, it extended very little further than the 3,000 clientsit had had over the years.  In my view his assessment has the ring of reality about it.  The applicant is a small stock broker witha very limited client base.  Its reputation clearly extends little beyond that.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In my view the scope for an action for passing off by the applicant by reason of the use of Ping An or the characterså¹³å®by therespondent as of the date of the application for the trade marks was not sufficient to render the trade marks unregisterable.  Ifthe trade marks were used by the respondent in a normal and fair way in respect of the services for which they were registered, Ido not consider that there would be confusion between the respondentâs business and the applicantâs business.  Apart from theextent of the applicantâs reputation, clearly the manner in which the securities trade is carried on and the manner in which therespondent as well as applicant traded would militate against any confusion.  In my view there is no scope for those in respect ofwhom the applicant has a reputation being deceived by a normal and fair use by the respondent of its marks.  The distinction betweenthe businesses would at once be obvious even to the proverbial âmoron in a hurryâ.  Whether or not any potential clients of theapplicant might make enquiries as to whether the applicant were connected with the respondent, which would be a reverse type of passingoff, would be a different question but again, I do not consider that there would be a sufficient likelihood that the businesses wouldbe confused.  In this respect, it is not impertinent to point out that the applicant changed its name some months before the dateof the application for the trade marks.  In my view, particularly in the light of the further evidence which has emerged, there hasnot been a proper explanation for that change by those who had majority control of the applicant and the antecedents of the majorityshareholder of the applicant is one of permitting deception of the market.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  It also has to be noted that the judge below approached the matter on the basis that there was some form of proprietary rights inthe words Ping On and Ping An and the characterså¹³å®.  In doing so he was coming close to confusing an action in passing off withan action for infringement of trade mark.  An action for passing off does not give rise to an exclusive right in any get-up as such. Hence, in many instances the words âwithout clearly distinguishing the defendantâs goods (or services) from the plaintiffâsâis inserted as part of a final injunction.  The judge also appears to have taken into account, wrongly, the consideration that theapplicant would be prevented from using its own name.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  I would therefore allow this appeal, set aside the judgment below and make an order <i>nisi</i> of costs in favour of the respondent.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Le Pichon JA:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  I agree with the judgment of Rogers VP.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><b>Hon Barma J:</b></p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons set out in paragraphs 31 to 39 of the Vice Presidentâs judgment andwith the costs order <i>nisi</i> proposed by him.
