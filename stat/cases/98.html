The defendant must know that he is inducing a breach of contract. As Lord Hoffman said in <i>OBC Ltd</i> at paragraph 39 </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â To be liable for inducing breach of contract, you must know that you are inducing a breach of contract.

Nor does it matter that you ought reasonably to have done so.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(b)   an intention to procure a breach of contract.  The defendant must intend to procure or persuade the third party to break hiscontract with the claimant.

The defendant is made responsible for the third partyâs breach because of his intentional causative participationin that breach.  Causative participation is not enough.  A stranger to a contract may know nothing of the contract.  Quite unknowinglyand unintentionally he may procure a breach of the contract by offering an inconsistent deal to a contracting party which persuadesthe latter todefault on his contractual obligations.  The stranger is not liable in such a case.  Nor is he liable if he acts carelessly. He owes no duty of care to the victim of the breach of contract.  Negligent interference is not actionable.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">The witnesses</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> I heard evidence from the plaintiff and D3.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> I also heard evidence from Peter Bradley (âBradleyâ) who at all material times was a solicitor and partner of Messrs StephenHarwood &amp; Lo (âSHLâ), Terence Lau Pok Hoi (âLauâ) who at all material times was an assistant solicitor at SHL, John Mulcahy(âMulcahyâ) who at all material times was a banker with NationsBank which subsequently merged with Bank of America on 30 September1998 and from Eliza Wu of ICS Trust (Asia) Ltd (âICSâ). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> The witnesses gave evidence about matters which occurred some 10 years ago and I have taken this into consideration when consideringand evaluating their evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> Bradley, Lau and Mulcahy were witnesses who were called on behalf of the plaintiff.  They were trying their best to recollect eventswhich took place a long time ago. It was clear from their evidence that their witness statements were not written out by them butwere prepared for them by the plaintiffâs solicitors. When they signed their witness statements they did not have the benefit ofperusing the many documents that were shown to them in cross-examination.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> In assessing the credibility of the plaintiff and D3 I have considered counselâs submissions.  I have no hesitation in findingthat D3 is an honest, credible and reliable witness whose evidence I believe and accept.  I cannot say the same for the plaintiff.I find that the plaintiff is a dishonest, evasive, untruthful and unreliable witness.  Where the evidence of D3 is at variance withthe evidence of the plaintiff, I have no hesitation in preferring the evidence of D3 which I accept to the evidence of the plaintiffwhich I reject.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> D3 has maintained that at all times whilst acting for Tiffany he was acting as her professional advisor in good faith.  I believehim and have no hesitation in accepting his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Contrary to the plaintiffâs case that he and Tiffany each owned one of the two bearer shares and 50% of the Company, Tiffany hasat all times maintained that the Company was wholly owned by her. This is clear from her affirmations filed in the matrimonial proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> The plaintiffâs case is that he and Tiffany were involved in various companies as joint owners and in 1995 he instructed Bradleyof SHL to restructure the same under the umbrella of a parent company CAL International Ltd (âCALâ).  Bradley confirmed thathe carried out the restructuring of the various companies.  He regarded his client as being the owners of CAL which he regarded asthe plaintiff and Tiffany.  However, it is clear from the many letters and communications that Bradley had over the years he didnot copy letters to Tiffany nor does it appear from the documents that he took instructions from Tiffany.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> The plaintiff gave evidence that Tiffany did also give instructions to Bradley but I do not believe him.  It seems to me that theplaintiff was the one who was principally dealing with SHL in relation to the affairs of the various companies.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> By the letter dated 9 February 1995 from SHL to Mossack Fonseca &amp; Co. (BVI) Ltd they were informed that SHL Services Ltd (âSHLServicesâ) had taken over the secretarial role of numerous companies and gave a list of the directors, secretaries and shareholdersof the companies listed therein. I would observe all that is said about the shareholding of the Company was that there were bearershares only.  The letter does not support the plaintiffâs case that the Company was jointly owned by the plaintiff and Tiffany.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The plaintiff gave evidence that the two bearer shares of the Company were kept in a safe deposit box jointly held by him and Tiffanyat Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong.  He said that he removed one of the share certificates namely, exhibit P1 sometime afterJuly 1998.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> According to the plaintiff, he and Tiffany agreed in the summer of 1997 to set up Communications Asia Ltd (âCommunications Asiaâ)with Philippines cable operators to expand the business and financing was required from bankers.  It was intended that CommunicationsAsia which was to be based in Hong Kong was to become a regional television broadcaster which would have subscribers who would invest.In order for the project to be fulfilled the shares of the Company were to be transferred to CAL Media Holdings Ltd which would sellthem to Communications Asia.  It was important for the Company to be involved as it had all the distribution rights in Mainland Chinaand Tiffany had the personal connection in Mainland China.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The project was to be effected by three core documents namely a shareholderâs agreement, a share subscription agreement and a sharepurchase agreement which were prepared by Bradley.  These documents were never executed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> Mulcahy said that NationsBank was hired to do the bank financing with Washington Equity to do the placement of shares.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Unknown to Mulcahy, however, on 15 July 1998, the plaintiff and Tiffany had already agreed to separate.  As the plaintiff said andI accept, he and Tiffany had drifted apart prior to that date and had agreed to divorce.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> On that day 15 July 1998 the plaintiff and Tiffany signed an agreement (âthe July agreementâ) agreeing on the division of cashand stock that the Company was going to receive on the basis of the deal going forward.  If the project went ahead successfully theCompany was going to receive US$10 million over a period of time as well as stock in Communications Asia.  By the July agreementthe plaintiff and Tiffany agreed to divide the cash and stock in the manner set out therein.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> By late summer and the fall of 1998 the bankers advised that the time was right to put together the private placement for the CommunicationsAsia deal with a target for the spring of 1999.  Roadshows with prospective investors in the USA started in March 1999.  The strategywas to meet prospective investors in the USA, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines and to close the deal in December 1999.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> It was submitted, correctly in my view, by Mr Fok SC with Mr Fung, for D3, D4 and D5, that in respect of the plaintiffâs causesof action it is incumbent on the plaintiff to first establish on a balance of probabilities that he did in fact own 50% of the Company. The complaint is that the plaintiff was deprived of his 50% interest in the Company and that was said to be the purpose of the conspiracy. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> As rightly pointed out by Mr Fok there is not a single piece of documentary evidence showing that the plaintiff was in fact the ownerof the one bearer share and 50% of the Company.  The only evidence as to this comes from the plaintiff who gave evidence that heand Tiffany were each owners of one bearer share and that 50% of the Company was owned by each of them. I do not believe the plaintiffand reject his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> The plaintiff in evidence said that there were documents showing that the two bearer shares were to be held by the plaintiff andTiffany equally.  These documents were the minutes of the Company in the files which were with the Company kit and minute books andresolutions which were taken away from SHL Services to ICS.  I do not believe the plaintiffâs evidence that the minutes of theCompany showed that the Company was jointly owned by the plaintiff and Tiffany or that the two bearer shares were owned by the plaintiffand Tiffany.  The plaintiff never mentioned this in his witness statement.  This would have been an important fact to mention whenpreparing his witness statement made on 24 November 2006 yet he only mentioned it for the first time in cross-examination years later. If there were such a document in existence it is inconceivable, in my view, that he would have omitted to mention it in his witnessstatement.  I do not believe the plaintiff. I am satisfied that he is lying and that he has made this up when giving evidence.  Ifind that there was no minute showing that the Company belonged to him and Tiffany.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> The fact that Bradley and Mulcahy proceeded on the basis that the Company was jointly owned by the plaintiff and Tiffany does notassist the plaintiff.  The impression that Bradley and Mulcahy got about the ownership of the Company came not from Tiffany but fromwhat the plaintiff had informed them.  His own self-serving statements to them do not assist him in establishing that he was in factthe owner of one of the two bearer shares.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> On the contrary there is clear documentary evidence showing that the whole Company belonged to Tiffany and to no one else includingthe plaintiff.  Exhibit D1 dated 15 May 1997 is addressed âTo Whom It May Concernâ and unequivocally confirms that Tiffany isâthe holder of the legal and beneficial interestâ of the Company.  Exhibit D1 was signed by the plaintiff and, in my view, amountsto a clear admission by the plaintiff that the Company wholly belonged to Tiffany and to no one else including the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> On the evidence no equivalent document was ever signed by Tiffany confirming that the plaintiff had any legal or beneficial interestin the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> In cross-examination the plaintiff tried to explain away exhibit D1 by saying that because he was leaving town exhibit D1 was preparedto secure a mortgage to acquire property that they had bought for their office.  He said that exhibit D1 was prepared as he was notgoing to be around to go to the bank to sign the appropriate documentation.  He said that it was shown by Tiffany to the bank whenthe mortgage was obtained.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> The plaintiffâs explanation of why exhibit D1 was prepared is, in my view, incredible. The relevant sale and purchase agreementand the credit facility letter being exhibits D8 and D9 respectively, in relation to the mortgage from the bank were not made contemporaneouslybut were only made one year after exhibit D1.  Exhibit D8 was made on 27 May 1998 and exhibit D9 was made on 19 June 1998.  The suggestionthat exhibit D1 was prepared for the purpose of obtaining a mortgage on a property transaction one year later is, in my view, incredible. I do not believe the plaintiff and reject his explanation which falls away.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> The fact remains that the only documentary evidence, signed by the plaintiff, which confirms that the Company belonged to Tiffanyand to no one else including the plaintiff is exhibit D1.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> When exhibit D1 was shown to both Bradley and Mulcahy in cross-examination they said that it would not surprise them to hear thatTiffanyâs instructions to D3 were that the Company was her Company alone.  Mulcahy also said that having seen exhibit D1 for thefirst time in evidence it would have caused him to question what the plaintiff was asserting to him as to being a shareholder ofthe Company.  It is, in my view, regrettable that exhibit D1 was not shown to Bradley and Mulcahy when their witness statements wereprepared. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> I would also observe that in the interview given by Tiffany to the International Herald Tribune published on 2 May 1994, Tiffanydescribed the Company as hers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established as a fact that he owned 50% of the Company.  That being so, the plaintiff isunable to establish his causes of action against D3, D4 and D5.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> Even if, contrary to my findings, the plaintiff were to establish that he did own 50% of the Company, there is no evidence to showthat D3 knew that the plaintiff was the lawful holder of 50% of the Company.  D3 maintained that he acted on his clientâs instructionsin good faith and that his instructions were that the Company wholly belonged to Tiffany.  I have no hesitation in believing him. I accept his evidence. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> On the evidence of D3 which I accept he did not have actual knowledge that the plaintiff owned one of the two bearer shares in theCompany.  The most that can be established on the evidence which I accept is that D3 had notice that the plaintiff was making a claimto one of the two bearer shares and therefore to 50% of the Company.  But this was not founded on any specific facts put forwardby the plaintiff to D3.  It was contrary to the instructions given to him by his client Tiffany who instructed him that she was atall times the 100% owner of the Company.  As D3 said, and as I accept and find, there was nothing in the instructions given by Tiffanyto him in March 1999 which raised a suspicion that the plaintiff might be one of the shareholders of the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> In evidence the plaintiff accepted that his whole case depended on D3 knowing that he owned 50% of the Company.  The plaintiff saysthat in his telephone conversation in May 1999 with D3 he mentioned that he had possession of one bearer share in the Company butthat he did not know where he had kept it.  This was denied by D3.  On this dispute of fact I prefer the evidence of D3 which I acceptto the evidence of the plaintiff which I reject.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> In my judgment there was neither actual knowledge nor blind-eye knowledge on the part of D3 at the time of the alleged agreementin or about March 1999 that the plaintiff was the owner of one of the two bearer shares and 50% owner of the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> The criticism was made by Mr Wright, for the plaintiff, that these defendants did not plead a positive case that the Company whollybelonged to Tiffany.  However, that is not something that these defendants need to plead.  It is for the plaintiff to establish firstof all that he was in fact the owner of the one bearer share and 50% owner of the Company.  This is denied.  The plaintiff has inmy judgment failed to establish that he was the owner of the one bearer share and 50% owner of the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> The next thing to consider is whether there was any agreement to injure the plaintiff as alleged in or about March 1999.  The plaintiffaccepted in evidence that he did not know when in March 1999 the agreement was made nor did he know if it was recorded in writingor whether it was made orally or the terms of the agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> Was there an agreement between D3, D4, D5 and other persons to injure the plaintiff?    </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> There is no dispute that Tiffany only met D3 for the first time in March 1999.  D3 gave evidence that he was told that Tiffany hadbeen separated from the plaintiff since about 1997 and was seeking a divorce from him.  She was concerned at being dragged into theplaintiffâs various business schemes the majority of which came to nothing. She told him that she owned the Company which she managedand ran and which was in the business of selling television programs to television stations in Mainland China.  She also told himthat the plaintiff conducted his own businesses through CAL companies.  He was also told that the plaintiff was not employed by theCompany.  Tiffany told him that she and the plaintiff had entered into the July agreement.  She told him that as the plaintiff wasnot claiming an interest in the Company she did not object to the plaintiff representing himself as her business partner in the project.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> D3 said that Tiffany approached him in March 1999 because of two main problems.  The first was that she was concerned about beingliable for fees incurred by the plaintiff in respect of the Communications Asia deal.  The second was the plaintiffâs claim toan interest in the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> D3 said that in respect of the second problem his job was to negotiate a settlement with the plaintiff so that it was clear thatthe Company only belonged to Tiffany.  According to D3 there was no strategy or plan.  He said that they were reacting to eventsthat were happening.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> I believe D3 and accept his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> D3 denied the existence of an agreement in March 1999 between him and Tiffany to make her the only shareholder of the Company.  D3was adamant that there was no such agreement.  I believe him and accept his evidence.  I find that there was no such agreement orany agreement to injure the plaintiff in or about March 1999. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> It is also incumbent on the plaintiff to establish that the agreement as alleged involved using unlawful means as the means of achievingthe purpose of the conspiracy which was to deprive the plaintiff of his shareholding in the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> What are said to be the unlawful acts?  On the plaintiffâs primary claim, his pleaded case on what the overt acts are in furtheranceof the conspiracy to injure by unlawful means are set out in the voluntary particulars as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â The Plaintiff will rely on the following overt acts:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(1)   On or about 12<sup>th</sup> April 1999, [D3] prepared a draft agreement for 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant dated 12<sup>th</sup> April 1999 providing that: <i>â[The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant]</i><i> </i><i>will</i><i> </i><i>cooperate,</i><i> </i><i>support and assist [the Plaintiff] in the closing of the</i><i> </i><i>deal.</i><i> </i> <i>[The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant] will place in trust immediately 49</i><i>%</i> <i>of the shares of</i><i> </i><i>[the Company</i><i>]</i> <i>for our s</i><i>o</i><i>n Austen.</i><i> </i><i> In return [the Plaintiff] hereby waive</i><i> </i><i>and disclaim any right, title or interest in [the Company] or its assets.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">(2)   On 7<sup>th</sup> May 1999, the corporate kits of both the Company and CALInternational Ltd, the sole director of the Company, were removed from theoffices of Stephenson Harwood &amp;

All of the acts with the exception of (5) of the voluntary particulars are alleged to be unlawful acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> As I have found that there was no agreement to injure the plaintiff there cannot have been any agreement to do the unlawful acts. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> Mr Wright submitted that the events after March 1999 provided cogent evidence of a conspiracy to damage the plaintiff by unlawfulmeans. I go on to consider whether the overt acts pleaded in the voluntary particulars were unlawful acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> As to (1) of the voluntary particulars, D3 accepted that he prepared the draft agreement for Tiffany.  This was a draft to be putforward to the plaintiff by Tiffany for the plaintiffâs agreement.  The plaintiff was free to agree or disagree.  I fail to seehow it can be said that the preparation of the draft agreement was an unlawful act on its own.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> As to (2) of the voluntary particulars, I also fail to see how it can be said that the taking of the corporate kits of the Companyand CAL was an unlawful act.  Even on the plaintiffâs own case Tiffany was a 50% owner of those companies. She would have, evenon the plaintiffâs case, been entitled to change the secretarial service from SHL Services to ICS. There was in any event no evidencethat D3 was involved in the taking of the corporate kits from SHL Services to ICS.  D3 denied a suggestion that he advised Tiffanyto arrange for the corporate kits to be collected from the offices of SHL. I believe him and accept his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> As to (3) of the voluntary particulars, it is said that the corporate kits were used to pass the resolutions including cancellingthe bearer shares in the Company and issuing new shares to Mega Global Ltd and Vida but not to the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> D3 gave evidence that he was informed by Tiffany in March 1999 that she had visited her safe deposit box and she had been shockedto see that the Company documentation including bearer share certificates had been removed.  The plaintiff was the only other personwith access to the box.  Tiffany carried out extensive searches for the missing bearer share certificates and asked the plaintiffand SHL if they knew where they were. I accept his evidence and believe him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> The plaintiff gave evidence in chief at the first day of trial that sometime after July 1998 he had removed one bearer share certificatefrom the safe deposit box namely, exhibit P1 and left the other one there.  He said that he did not tell anybody what he had done. On his evidence in chief quite clearly he did not tell Tiffany at the time that he had removed one bearer share certificate fromthe safe deposit box.  However, the following day in cross-examination he changed his evidence.  He said that he had told Tiffanythat he had gone to the safe deposit box and removed some items.  He explained that it was due to stress that he had given a differentversion of events the previous day.  I do not believe him. I do not believe that he ever told Tiffany that he had removed the bearershare certificate or some items from the safe deposit box. I reject his evidence on this.  I find that he did not tell Tiffany thathe had removed one bearer share certificate from the safe deposit box. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> The reason the plaintiff gave for removing the bearer share certificate from the safe deposit box was that he was going to be travellingand that he was going to be spending more time in the Philippines and the USA concluding the Communications Asia deal.  The reasonhe gave for removing the bearer share certificate from the safe deposit box is, in my view, unconvincing.  I do not believe him. It seems to me that if indeed he were the true owner of that share there is no plausible reason why he would not tell Tiffany thathe had removed it.  I find that he removed that share certificate from the safe deposit box for his own purpose without telling Tiffanyabout it to enable him to later assert that he was a 50% owner of the Company when in fact he was not.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> Lau confirmed in evidence that he had a number of telephone conversations on 19 April 1999 with Tiffany, Vida and Bonnie Ho.  Laugave evidence that he told Tiffany, Vida and Bonnie Ho in one or more of the telephone conversations that the share certificatesof the Company were or might have been lost.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> On the following day 20 April 1999 Lau by fax wrote to Tiffany, Vida and Bonnie Ho confirming that SHL did not have the two bearershare certificates and asked whether they wanted to instruct a BVI lawyer âregarding the procedures in respect of lost bearer certificatesâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> It is clear that steps had to be taken to regularize the affairs of the Company. The plaintiff chose not to inform Tiffany that hehad taken a bearer share certificate out of the safe deposit box.  Since the missing share certificate could not be found, stepshad to be taken to regularize the Companyâs affairs.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> D3 said that Tiffany informed him that she did not want the plaintiffâs solicitors to have control over the Companyâs secretarialfunctions.  In view of her pending divorce she wanted to distance herself and the Company from the plaintiff and his solicitors SHL. A number of alternative company secretarial companies were recommended by D3 to Tiffany and she chose ICS to replace SHL Services. I believe D3 and accept his evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> I find that the corporate kits were removed from SHL Services to ICS as Tiffany no longer wanted SHL Services to have control overthe Companyâs secretarial functions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> On 13 May 1999 ICS Secretaries Ltd became the Companyâs secretary.  Written resolutions of the Company were passed which includedresolutions to cancel the existing bearer shares and issuing new registered shares to Mega Global Ltd a company established by Tiffanyand Vida.  There was also a resolution to remove CAL as director of the Company and to appoint Tiffany as the sole director in itsstead.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a> Both the plaintiff and D3 gave evidence of a three way telephone conversation in mid May 1999 involving the plaintiff, Tiffany andD3.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a> The plaintiff said that in that conversation D3 referred to the bearer share certificate having been lost but that he told D3 thathe had the bearer share. He just did not know where it was at the time.  He was adamant that he had told D3 that he had the bearershare certificate but wasnât sure where it was and that it was either in the safe deposit box or in the Philippines or the USAor the office but he wasnât sure where.  This was never mentioned in his witness statement.  The whereabouts of the missing bearershare certificate was an important matter to deal with yet it was not mentioned in his witness statement.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a> D3 denied that the plaintiff had told him that he had the bearer share certificate in the telephone conversation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a> On this dispute of fact I prefer the evidence of D3 which I accept to the evidence of the plaintiff which I reject.  I do not believethe plaintiff. I believe D3.  I find that the plaintiff did not mention to D3 or to Tiffany in that conversation that he did havethe bearer share but did not know where it was at the time.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a> It is clear that Tiffany, Vida, Lau and D3 all thought that the bearer share certificates were lost.  That being so, it was, in myview, reasonable to take the step of cancelling the bearer shares and the issue of shares so as to arrange the shareholding of theCompany in accordance with Tiffanyâs instructions that the Company was solely hers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a> As I have found that the plaintiff has failed to establish that he was a 50% owner of the Company, there was nothing unlawful inthe matters alleged under (3) of the voluntary particulars.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a> I find that the resolutions that were passed on 13 May 1999 were not unlawful acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a> As to the matters alleged in (4) of the voluntary particulars, it seems to me that the statement in the draft agreements preparedby D3 that â[CAL] is currently serving as sole Director of [the Company]â was inaccurate at the time in view of the resolutionsthat had been passed on 13 May 1999.  However, the statement that the Company âhas held 2 bearer sharesâ¦..â is not, in my view,an inaccurate statement.  In view of the resolutions that had been passed on 13 May 1999 the bearer shares were cancelled but priorto that time the Company had held two bearer shares.  As Mr Fok submitted, and as I accept, the past tense of âhas heldâ renderedthe statement at least equivocal and not a clear and unambiguous representation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a> D3 gave evidence that by the time of the mid-May telephone conversation with the plaintiff the bearer shares had already been cancelledand that the plaintiff knew that.  D3 said that he had been told by Tiffany that the plaintiff knew that the resolutions had beenpassed.  D3 also said that it was clear from his conversation with the plaintiff that the plaintiff knew that Tiffany had been lookingfor the bearer shares and had not found them and that action had been taken to âclean upâ the corporate situation.  He told theplaintiff that as part of the âclean upâ of the Company the plaintiff needed to sign a document to complete the files at ICS.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a> I believe D3 and accept his evidence.  I find that the plaintiff knew at the time of the telephone conversation in mid-May 1999 thatthe bearer shares had been cancelled.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a> I am unable to accept the submission made on behalf of the plaintiff that the clear impression given by the draft agreements is thatthe shares which are to be placed in trust are the bearer shares.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a> I am satisfied that there was no dishonesty on the part of D3 in stating in the draft agreements that â[CAL] is currently servingas sole Director of [the Company]â.  This was, as I have said, an inaccurate statement at the time in view of the resolutions thathad been passed.  This was due to carelessness rather than dishonesty on the part of D3.  I so find.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a> As to (5) of the voluntary particulars, this is not alleged to be an unlawful act on the part of D3, D4 and D5.  The fax of 1 September1999 sent to Commerzbank was a fax signed by D3 introducing Tiffany to Commerzbank.  In my judgment the fax was entirely consistentwith the innocent explanation of D3 as a professional advisor to Tiffany introducing a third party banker to provide banking servicesto Tiffany in Singapore rather than as part of any alleged conspiracy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a> As to (6) of the voluntary particulars, it is alleged that in the telephone conversation with Mulcahy on or about 4 November 1999D3 informed him that the plaintiff was not a shareholder of the Company, that the plaintiff no longer represented the Company andthat Tiffany considered the Bank of Americaâs engagement by the Company to have ended in August 1999 and there was no longer anyagreement between Bank of America and the Company.  In view of the instructions given by Tiffany to D3 which I find that he honestlybelieved and on which D3 acted the matters relied on were not unlawful in my judgment.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a> I would observe that in any event Mulcahy never relied on what he had been told by D3 as Bank of America continued to represent CommunicationsAsia in seeking to raise capital to fund the project.  Also, as I have said, Mulcahy in evidence said when shown exhibit D1 in cross-examinationfor the first time that it would have caused him to question the plaintiffâs assertion of being a shareholder of the Company.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a> As to (7) of the voluntary particulars, the sending of the fax to MF on or about 13 June 2000 is said to be an unlawful act as beinga misrepresentation that Tiffany was the sole owner of the Company in order to secure the transfer of the registered office of theCompany to Samoa.  There is no representation in the fax that Tiffany was the sole owner of the Company.  There is a representationthat Tiffany has no involvement with any of the plaintiffâs companies and âis only the owner of the [Company]â.  I find thatthe 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant honestly believed his instructions from Tiffany that this was so.  I am unable to accept that this was an unlawful act.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a> The plaintiff has failed to establish that the acts relied on were unlawful acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a> It seems to me and I so find that the acts of D3 were entirely consistent with the innocent explanation of D3 as a professional advisorto Tiffany acting in accordance with her instructions which he honestly believed rather than as part of the alleged conspiracy.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a> Issues (1) and (2) are resolved against the plaintiff.  As there was no agreement to injure the plaintiff by unlawful means, no losswas caused to the plaintiff by the alleged unlawful acts.  Issues (3) and (4) are also resolved against the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a> The plaintiffâs primary claim falls to be dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a> The alternative claim of conspiracy to injure requires the plaintiff to establish that there was a predominant intention on the partof D3, D4 and D5 to injure the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a> This was denied by D3 and I accept his evidence that there was never any intention to injure the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a> I observe that the plaintiffâs pleaded case is that the defendants conspired with âthe sole or predominant intention of injuringthe plaintiffâ.  It is alleged that the motivation of the defendants âwas a wholly unreasonable and unjustified victimizationand hatred of the plaintiff â (paragraph 23B of the RASC).  The plaintiff has failed to establish this in my judgment.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a> D3 did not know the plaintiff and they had never met.  D3 only met Tiffany in March 1999 as a client for professional advice.  Thereis no plausible reason why in or about March 1999 D3 would victimize and hate the plaintiff.  In evidence the plaintiff suggestedthat the reason was money but, in my view, that is unconvincing.  I reject it.  D3 at all times acted as a professional advisor forprofessional fees which he billed for and in respect of which he was paid.  The bills have been produced in evidence.  There wasnothing else in it for him or for D4 and D5.  In my view the fees charged were reasonable fees for the professional work done asfully particularised in the bills rendered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a> I find that there was never any intention to injure the plaintiff on the part of D3, D4 and D5. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a> Issues (5), (6) and (7) are also resolved against the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a> In my judgment the plaintiff has failed to establish his alternative claim of conspiracy to injure.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a> Reliance was placed by the plaintiff on the judgment of Judge Gill in FCMC 1444 of 2000 in the District Court given on 19 August2002 on the plaintiffâs application for ancillary relief in the matrimonial proceedings.  The hearing before the judge was unopposedas Tiffany did not appear to contest the application by the time of the hearing before the judge although the divorce and interlocutorymatters before then had been bitterly fought.  Tiffany had filed affirmations and at a pre-trial hearing directions were given fordeponents to attend for cross-examination.  As she did not appear at the hearing before Judge Gill, Tiffanyâs affirmations couldnot be used as evidence without leave under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A" class="autolink_findacts">Matrimonial Causes Rules</a>. The hearing before Judge Gill proceeded on the evidence adduced by the plaintiff as well as his oral evidence which was one-sidedas the judge recognized.  The plaintiffâs evidence was not tested by cross-examination and no case was advanced on behalf of Tiffany.Although Tiffany maintained in her affirmations that the Company was her company which she owned her evidence could not be used andwas rejected by Judge Gill.  He proceeded to make ancillary orders on the basis of the plaintiff and Tiffany each owning 50% of theCompany.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a> The hearing before Judge Gill was one-sided.  The plaintiffâs evidence was never tested in cross-examination and Tiffanyâs affirmationswere rejected and not relied on.  Exhibit D1 which, as I have said, was a clear admission by the plaintiff that the Company whollybelonged to Tiffany was never mentioned by the judge in his judgment.  It seems that he did not consider this important evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a> The judge went further.  He found (at page 25 of the judgment) that the letters drafted by D3</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â taken in sequence are a clear indication that the plan was to have the [plaintiff] distanced and then removed entirely from [theCompany], and then pretend he never had any involvementâSee [D3âs] draft of 12 April 2000, reproduced in part earlier in thisjudgment.  I mention as an aside this demonstrates appalling professional misconduct on [D3âs] part.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a> In my view what the judge said as set out above was unwarranted and wholly unfair to D3.  He was not a party to those proceedingsand was not given a chance to defend himself before the very serious finding was made against him. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a> Judge Gillâs judgment does not assist the plaintiff.  I place no reliance on it. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a> As regards the alternative claim for unlawful interference, the same overt acts as set out in the voluntary particulars are reliedon. I have found that the plaintiff has failed to establish the conspiracy by unlawful means and it follows, in my view, that thisalternative claim must also fail.  Issues (8), (9), (10) and (11) are also resolved against the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a> As for the alternative claim for inducing breach of contract, the plaintiffâs case is that the contract which was breached wasa contract between the plaintiff and MF whereby they agreed to act as agents for the Company.  No such contract was adduced in evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a> In evidence the plaintiff said that his contract with MF was removed from the office by Tiffany and Vida.  I do not believe him. This was never mentioned in his witness statement.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a> I do not believe that the plaintiff had a personal contract with MF.  It is highly unlikely, in my view, that MF would have enteredinto a personal contract with the plaintiff rather than with the Company to whom it was providing services.  The plaintiff has saidthat he was the client of record with MF but I do not believe him.  If indeed he were the client of record there would have beenno difficulty in him obtaining a copy of the contract from MF but this has not been done.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a> I also find on the evidence of D3 which I accept that there was no intention on the part of D3 to procure a breach of any contractthat MF might have had with the plaintiff. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a> In my judgment the plaintiff has failed to establish that there was a personal contract between him and MF which was breached.  Theplaintiff has also failed to establish that D3, D4 and D5 had knowledge that they were inducing a breach of the same or that theyintended to procure a breach of the same.  Issues (12), (13) and (14) are also resolved against the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a> The plaintiffâs claim for inducing a breach of contract also fails.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a> I dismiss the plaintiffâs claims against D3, D4 and D5.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a> I also make an order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff do pay D3, D4 and D5âs costs of the action to be taxed if not agreed, with a certificate for two counsel.</p>    <p>    </p>    <p>    </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">  (Arjan H.
