Madam Wongâs pleaded claim</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Madam Wong claimed that in/about May 2006 she started to order/purchase skin beauty products from Art Express for use at OrganicBeauty. In/about October 2006, she closed down Organic Beauty and opened Spa Sensations through Pacific Wide as corporate vehicle.In/about June 2007, she decided to sell Spa Sensations on a going concern. At first, Madam Cheung expressed interest in purchasingthe entire business, but later proposed to operate Spa Sensations together with Madam Wong as partners.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In/about July 2007, Madam Wong and Madam Cheung on behalf of Mr Kwan entered into a partnership agreement (â<u>PA</u>â) to operate Spa Sensations as partners in equal shares as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class='quote'>(a)  Madam Wong agreed to sell half of the business of Spa Sensations to Mr Kwan who agreed to buy the same for HK$300,000.00;</p>        <p class='quote'>(b)  Madam Wong and Mr Kwan (â<u>Parties</u>â) agreed to contribute to the monthly expenses of Spa Sensations and share the net profits in equal shares;</p>        <p class='quote'>(c)  the contributions and daily takings shall be paid into Pacific Wideâs bank account;</p>        <p class='quote'>(d)  the Parties agreed to continue to use Pacific Wide as corporate vehicle to operate Spa Sensations;</p>        <p class='quote'>(e)  Madam Wong agreed to transfer 50% of her shares in Pacific Wide to Mr Kwan and appoint Madam Cheung as a director of PacificWide.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Mr Kwan engaged solicitors to prepare a share acquisition agreement (â<u>SAA</u>â) which the Parties signed on 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007. On the same day, Mr Kwan paid HK$100,000.00 as part payment of the price.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Madam Cheung wanted to commence operation at the Premises as soon as possible, so on/bout 25<sup>th</sup> July 2007 she caused some beauty equipment and products to be moved to the Premises, and from/about that day she operated Spa Sensationswith Madam Wong. Madam Cheung started to provide beauty treatment to her clients by using all facilities/staff at the Premises. UponMadam Cheungâs suggestion, Madam Wong agreed to employ Madam Lam Sin Man (â<u>Madam Lam</u>â) as a staff member of Pacific Wide, and further agreed for all daily takings of Pacific Wide be taken to Art Express for calculation.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Pursuant to the SAA, on/about 12<sup>th</sup> September 2007, Madam Wong provided Madam Cheung with copy audited accounts and financial statements of Pacific Wide for the financialyear from 1<sup>st</sup> July 2006 to 30<sup>th</sup> June 2007. Madam Wong also tendered originals of Pacific Wideâs books and recordsfor the period from 1<sup>st</sup> to 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007 for inspection, and such documents still remained in Madam Cheungâs possession, custody and control.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Madam Wong was at all material times willing and able to transfer 50% of her shares in Pacific Wide to Mr Kwan, and to sign allnecessary documents to effect such transfer. But in breach of the PA and the SAA, Mr Kwan failed/refused to pay the balance priceof HK$200,000.00 or part thereof, complete the sale and purchase of 50% of the shares of Pacific Wide, and/or contribute towardsthe monthly expenses of Spa Sensations, which were paid for by Madam Wong. Further, in breach of the PA, Madam Cheung failed/refusedto deposit daily takings derived from customers she brought to Spa Sensations into Pacific Wideâs bank account, and converted thesame.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Consequently, Spa Sensations suffered serious cash flow problems, and was unable to pay rent for the Premises from August to October2007. The landlord recovered possession of the Premises on/about 9<sup>th</sup> October 2007, and Spa Sensations was forced to close down its business on the same date.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Madam Wong therefore claimed for the balance price of HK$200,000.00, half of the expenses of Spa Sensations which she had paid,an account of the daily takings received by Madam Cheung as Mr Kwanâs agent from 24<sup>th</sup> July to 9<sup>th</sup> October 2007, all necessary accounts and enquiries, and an order for payment of such sums found to be due to her upon taking suchaccounts and enquiries.</p>    <p class="heading">III. Mr Kwanâs defence and counterclaim</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The summary in this Part is exclusive of Mr Kwanâs averments on the BP Agreement and the Beauty Products referred to in paragraphs26-33 below, which are the subject of Madam Wongâs present striking out application.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr Kwan claimed that by an oral agreement made in/about mid-July 2007 (â<u>Oral Agreement</u>â), Madam Wong agreed to sell and he agreed to purchase 50% of the shares of Pacific Wide for the sum of HK$300,000.00 on <i>inter alia</i> the following terms and conditions :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class='quote'>(a)  Spa Sensations shall sell and provide treatments with products supplied by Art Express with longer credit terms;</p>        <p class='quote'>(b)  Madam Cheung shall act as temporary manager of Spa Sensations;</p>        <p class='quote'>(c)  Mr Kwan shall move some beauty equipment and products from Beauty Gallery to the Premises for retail/treatment purposes;</p>        <p class='quote'>(d)  Mr Kwan shall perform beauty treatments for existing clients of Beauty Gallery at Spa Sensations;</p>        <p class='quote'>(e)  income generated from new clients and Madam Wongâs existing clients shall be deposited in Pacific Wideâs account;</p>        <p class='quote'>(f)  income generated from Mr Kwanâs existing clients from Beauty Gallery with prepaid packages for beauty treatment shall be keptby Mr Kwan and not deposited into Pacific Wideâs account âeven when shares are being transferredâ;</p>        <p class='quote'>(g)  beauty products belonging to Madam Wong and Mr Kwan shall be segregated and respectively deposited in Pacific Wideâs accountand kept by Mr Kwan âbefore shares are being transferredâ;</p>        <p class='quote'>(h)  Madam Lam shall help run Spa Sensations, and Madam Wong shall pay her salary whilst Mr Kwan shall pay her commission;</p>        <p class='quote'>(i)  rent and other outgoing expenses for operating Spa Sensations shall be paid out of Pacific Wideâs account;</p>        <p class='quote'>(j)  the Parties shall execute a share acquisition agreement for transfer of 50% of the shares of Pacific Wide to Mr Kwan;</p>        <p class='quote'>(k)  when such transfer was completed, the Parties shall execute a further written agreement, and share in the profits/ expenses ofSpa Sensations in equal shares.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Kwan engaged solicitors to prepare the SAA which the Parties signed on/about 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007. The SAA contained <i>inter alia</i> the following express conditions :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class='quote'>(a)  Mr Kwan shall pay an initial deposit of HK$100,000.00 to Madam Wong on signing of the SAA;</p>        <p class='quote'>(b)  Mr Kwan shall pay a further deposit of HK$100,000.00 upon receipt of the audited accounting report of Pacific Wide as at 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007 from Madam Wong;</p>        <p class='quote'>(c)  Pacific Wide shall have no arrears of rent, management fees, decoration fee, other debts or due payments except for certain specifieditems, and if otherwise Mr Kwan would be entitled to rescind the SAA whereupon Madam Wong shall refund all deposit(s) paid underthe SAA;</p>        <p class='quote'>(d)  both Parties agreed to execute a partnership agreement in relation to the management/operation of Pacific Wide and Spa Sensationson such terms/conditions agreed by them upon the completion date.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On/about 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007, Mr Kwan paid the deposit of HK$100,000.00 to Madam Cheung under the SAA.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Pursuant to the Oral Agreement, on/about 25<sup>th</sup> July 2007, Mr Kwan moved certain beauty equipment (â<u>Equipment</u>â) into the Premises. But Madam Wong refused to participate in the operations of Spa Sensations, and on 25<sup>th</sup> July 2007 wrongfully told her staff that she (a) no longer managed the spa, (b) had sold all her shares, and (c) had appointed MadamCheung as the new manager responsible for the entire operation. So from 25<sup>th</sup> July 2007 onwards, Madam Cheung managed Spa Sensations and performed beauty treatments on new clients as well as existing clientsof the Parties.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  On 7<sup>th</sup> September 2007, Madam Wong faxed copy âsubject to auditâ draft accounting report of Pacific Wide for the financial year from2<sup>nd</sup> March 2006 to 30<sup>th</sup> June 2007 to Mr Kwan. In breach of the SAA, such report did not cover the period up to 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007. Madam Wong also refused Mr Kwanâs suggestion to have solicitors stakehold the further deposit of HK$100,000.00 pendingpreparation of the audited accounting report.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 12<sup>th</sup> September 2007, Madam Wong faxed signed copy of Pacific Wideâs audited accounting report for the period from 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2006 to 30<sup>th</sup> June 2007 to Mr Kwan, but in breach of the SAA it was still not made up to 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007. On 14<sup>th</sup> September 2007, Mr Kwan suggested (but Madam Wong refused) that she went through Pacific Wideâs chequebooks, invoices, receipts,accounts and bank statements of July 2007 with him. Apart from having received Pacific Wideâs bank statements for the period from1<sup>st</sup> to 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007 in/about August 2007, Madam Wong had not tendered all original documents of Pacific Wide.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Mr Kwan claimed he was always ready and willing to pay the balance price to Madam Wong upon delivery of Pacific Wideâs auditedaccounting report for the period up to 24<sup>th</sup> July 2007. But in breach of the SAA, Madam Wong failed/refused to submit such report.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Further, in breach of the Oral Agreement and/or the SAA, Madam Wong failed to pay rent for the Premises since August 2007 and topay for other obligations and outgoing expenses of Pacific Wide. Mr Kwan had to pay Madam Lamâs salary and to pay commission toone of Madam Wongâs staff on behalf of Madam Wong.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr Kwan claimed he was the owner of the Equipment that was moved to the Premises pursuant to the Oral Agreement. On/about 4<sup>th</sup> October 2007, without the knowledge/consent of Mr Kwan, Madam Cheung or other staff of Spa Sensations, Madam Wong changed the doorlocks and prevented Mr Kwan from entering the Premises. Overnight between 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> October 2007, Madam Wong and others removed various office equipment, keys, cash, books/records of Pacific Wide and equipment/beautyproducts belonging to her from the Premises. As a result, Madam Wongâs clients were left with unfinished prepaid treatment packages,and Mr Kwan performed those treatments at Beauty Gallery on behalf of Madam Wong.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  On/about 9<sup>th</sup> October 2007, Madam Wong terminated the tenancy agreement and returned the keys of the Premises to the landlord. By reason of thematters disclosed in the letter referred to in paragraph 23 below, the landlord discarded the Equipment without Mr Kwanâs knowledge/consenton 9<sup>th</sup> October 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  By a letter dated 24<sup>th</sup> October 2007, Mr Kwan accepted Madam Wongâs repudiation thereby terminating the Oral Agreement and the SAA, and demanded returnof the Equipment stored at the Premises and of the deposit paid under the SAA. By 2 further letters both dated 24<sup>th</sup> October 2007 and a letter dated 6<sup>th</sup> December 2007, Mr Kwan demanded return of the Equipment stored at the Premises, but Madam Wong failed to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  By a letter dated 12<sup>th</sup> December 2007, the landlord informed Mr Kwan that Madam Wong had on 9<sup>th</sup> October 2007 signed a Note of Abandonment (â<u>Note</u>â) stating that chattels left at the Premises as at that date were abandoned by her and the landlord could dispose of them at will.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  By reason of the aforesaid matters, Madam Wong committed conversion of Mr Kwanâs properties to her own use and disposal, and MrKwan was unable to perform certain beauty treatments on his clients that required use of the Equipment.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Mr Kwan counterclaimed against Madam Wong for loss and damages as a result of her breach of the Oral Agreement and/or the SAA, andfor loss and damages for conversion of the Equipment.</p>    <p class="heading">IV. Mr Kwanâs pleaded claim in relation to beauty products</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr Kwan claimed that by a written agreement between Art Express and Organic Beauty dated 4<sup>th</sup> July 2006 (â<u>Written Agreement</u>â), Art Express agreed to sell and Organic Beauty agreed to purchase beauty products, but title in such beauty products would notpass to Organic Beauty until full payment was made.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  By an oral agreement in/about September 2006 between the Parties, they agreed to transfer Organic Beautyâs account with Art Expressto Spa Sensations under the same terms/conditions as the Written Agreement. By a letter from Art Express to âthe Plaintiffâ (ieMadam Wong) dated 19<sup>th</sup> September 2006 (â<u>AE Letter</u>â), âthe Defendantâ (ie Mr Kwan) confirmed that Organic Beautyâs account would be transferred to Spa Sensations upon signingof an authorisation by âthe Plaintiffâ (ie Madam Wong), which would signify âthe Plaintiffâsâ (ie Madam Wongâs) acceptanceof the terms/conditions of the Written Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In/about September 2006, â[the] Plaintiffâ (ie Madam Wong) signed the relevant authorisation form (â<u>Authorisation Form</u>â). âAs such, from about 1<sup>st</sup> August 2007 to 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2007, the Plaintiff [ie Madam Wong] agreed to purchase and the Defendant [ie Mr Kwan] agreed to sell certain beauty products,more particularly shown and set out in Schedule 3 attached [to the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim (â<u>RAD&amp;C</u>â)] (âthe Beauty Productsâ), in the total sum of HK$173,897.00 (collectively âthe BP Agreementâ).

Striking out application</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Madam Wongâs Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (â<u>RDC</u>â) averred that it was filed/served without prejudice to (a) her contention that paragraphs 7, 32, 34 and 38-40 of the Defence andCounterclaim (â<u>D&amp;C</u>â) insofar as they pertained to the Beauty Products disclosed no reasonable cause of action or is frivolous or vexatious, and (b)any application that she might make to have them struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  On 29<sup>th</sup> September 2008, Madam Wong by summons (â<u>Summons</u>â) sought to strike out the same paragraphs as aforesaid of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim (â<u>AD&amp;C</u>â) insofar as they pertained to the Beauty Products and answer (d) of paragraph 10(3) of the FBP on the grounds that they disclosedno reasonable cause of action (â<u>First Limb</u>â) and/or were scandalous, frivolous or vexatious (â<u>Second Limb</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Subsequent to the Summons, Mr Kwan applied to re-amend the AD&amp;C to add further averments as to the Written Agreement, the BPAgreement and the Beauty Products in line with the FBP so that the pleaded defences and counterclaims in the RAD&amp;C in relationto the BP Agreement and the Beauty Products were as set in paragraphs 26-33 above.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  On 10<sup>th</sup> October 2008, by consent Master R Lai ordered <i>inter alia</i> that (a) Mr Kwan do have leave to re-amend the AD&amp;C, and (b) Madam Wong do have leave to file and serve the Amended Reply andDefence and Counterclaim (â<u>ARDC</u>â), and to amend the Summons (â<u>Order</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Pursuant to the Order, Madam Wong filed the ARDC on 27<sup>th</sup> October 2008. In the ARDC, she averred it was filed/served without prejudice to (a) her contention that paragraphs 7, 7A, 7B, 22,32, 33, 33A, 34 and 38-40 of the RAD&amp;C insofar as they pertained to the BP Agreement and the Beauty Products disclosed no reasonablecause of action or were frivolous or vexatious, and (b) any application that she might make to have them struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Pursuant to the Order, Madam Wong amended the Summons on 27<sup>th</sup> October 2008 (â<u>Amended Summons</u>â) to seek an order that the aforesaid paragraphs of the RAD&amp;C insofar as they pertained to the BP Agreement and the BeautyProducts and answer (d) of paragraph 10(3) of the FBP (ie the matters set out in paragraphs 26-29, 31 and 33 above) be struck outon the First and/or Second Limbs.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  At the hearing before me, Ms Kei, counsel for Madam Wong, confirmed that Madam Wong would not seek to strike out paragraph 7 ofthe RAD&amp;C (except the first sentence) as prayed for in the Amended Summons. It was an obvious error because paragraph 7 of theRAD&amp;C does not have more than one sentence. Ms Kei also pointed out that although the Amended Summons asked for paragraph 40of the RAD&amp;C insofar as it related to âthe BP Productsâ be struck out, there was in fact no reference to âBP Productsâin paragraph 40 of the RAD&amp;C. Ms Kei submitted that the phrase âBP Productsâ should read as âBP Agreementâ. Ms Tam, counselfor Mr Kwan, had no objection, and she did not require any formal re-amendment of the Amended Summons.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  On 29<sup>th</sup> September 2008, Madam Wong filed her affirmation in support of the Amended Summons. She explained that pursuant to her solicitorsârequest for discovery, Mr Kwanâs solicitors provided copies of the Written Agreement, the AE Letter and the Authorisation Form,and various sales delivery orders in respect of deliveries of the Beauty Products to the Premises (â<u>SD Orders</u>â). Mr Kwan did not file any affidavit evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">VII. Practice Direction 19.1</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Paragraph 5 of Practice Direction 19.1 (â<u>PD19.1</u>â) provides as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn applications to strike out pleadings as disclosing no reasonable cause of action or where no letter has been written by counselfor the applicant to counsel for the respondent signifying his intention to make the application and the broad grounds upon whichhe will rely, the applicant shall inform the respondent of the said grounds in writing at least five clear working days before theday fixed for the hearing.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Ms Tam submitted that the first intimation of a potential striking out application was found in the RDC (see paragraph 36 above),but notwithstanding a letter from Madam Wongâs former solicitors dated 7<sup>th</sup> August 2008, the Summons, the ARDC, the Amended Summons and Madam Wongâs affirmation (which all alluded to Madam Wongâs rightto strike out certain parts of Mr Kwanâs pleadings on the First Limb), the broad grounds as required under PD19.1 were not givenuntilMs Keiâs skeleton submissions of 20<sup>th</sup> November 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Several matters of note. First, both counsel accepted the requirements in paragraph 5 of PD19.1 only apply to applications to strikeout pleadings on the First Limb, but not to striking out applications relying on the Second Limb (which limb Madam Wong also adoptedin the Amended Summons). There is no procedural irregularity in relation to Madam Wongâs striking out application based on theSecond Limb.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Secondly, even if Madam Wong failed to provide the broad grounds within the prescribed time as required under PD19.1, I am not persuaded(and Ms Tam did not suggest) that the striking out application should be dismissed. <i>Re Boon Voon King &amp; ors, ex p Nedcor Asia Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20HKLRD%20458" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 HKLRD 458</a> established that practice directions are issued under the inherent power of the court to regulate its own process and not under therules of the court or other statutory power, and that the purpose of practice directions is to ensure efficient, expeditious andeconomical despatch of the courtâs business. Whilst the court does have inherent power to dismiss a summons, <i>Re Langton (deceased), Langton v Lloydâs Bank Ltd &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%201%20All%20ER%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] 1 All ER 657</a> suggested it was not desirable to make an order to dismiss an application for breach of local practice directions. In respect ofthe Amended Summons, I also bear in mind that Madam Wong also relied on the Second Limb, and as I find below, there is nothing wantingin respect of the legal principles and arguments relied on by Ms Kei for the striking out application on this ground.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  More importantly, in the course of Ms Keiâs oral submissions in reply, she acknowledged that Madam Wong could not make out herapplication to strike out Mr Kwanâs pleadings in relation to the BP Agreement and the Beauty Products without referring to theWritten Agreement, the AE Letter, the Authorisation Form and the SD Orders supplied by Mr Kwan and exhibited to her affirmation (â<u>Mr Kwanâs Documents</u>â, see also paragraph 10 of Ms Keiâs supplemental skeleton submissions). Since Order 18 rule 19(2) of the Rules of the DistrictCourt provides that no evidence shall be admissible on an application for striking out pleadings as disclosing no reasonable causeof action, such submission suggested that Madam Wong would be unable to maintain her striking out application under the First Limb.In the circumstances, Ms Kei abandoned reliance on the First Limb and confirmed that Madam Wong would only rely on the Second Limbfor the Amended Summons.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Consequently, Ms Tamâs objections based on non-compliance with the requirements in PD19.1 fell away. At Ms Tamâs request, andMs Kei having no objection, both parties agreed there be no order as to costs in respect of Madam Wongâs striking out applicationinsofar as it relates to the First Limb.</p>    <p class="heading">VIII.

Ms Keiâs submissions</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Ms Kei submitted that the business of Spa Sensations was all along operated by Pacific Wide as a corporate vehicle and not by MadamWong in her personal capacity, and the Beauty Products were all along sold by Art Express and not by Mr Kwan in his personal capacity.These matters were confirmed in the FBP (now incorporated as part of the RAD&amp;C), and proved beyond doubt by Mr Kwanâs Documents.In the circumstances, Mr Kwanâs claim for the alleged loss of the Beauty Products was liable to be struck out under the SecondLimb.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Ms Kei argued that Mr Kwanâs counterclaim for the market value of the Beauty Products (in contra-distinction to any claim forthe price or for damages for breach of contract) was not based on breach of contract, but rather on a claim for conversion on thebasis that Mr Kwan was the seller/owner of the Beauty Products delivered to the Premises, and that Madam Wong allowed the landlordto discard them. Mr Kwan even claimed he retained title in the Beauty Products as unpaid seller, but he never averred he was in actualpossession or had possessory title of such products. In any event, Mr Kwanâs Documents suggested that at best it was Art Expressthat was the seller/owner who sold the Beauty Products to Spa Sensations operated by Pacific Wide.</p>    <p class="heading">X. Ms Tamâs submissions</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Ms Tam conceded that Mr Kwanâs pleadings insofar as they pleaded breach of the BP Agreement by Madam Wong were on their own liableto be struck out (ie paragraphs 7B, 22, 33, 33A, 34 and 40 of the RAD&amp;C).</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  But Ms Tam reminded that Madam Wong did not seek to strike out the counterclaim for conversion. For example, Mr Kwan in paragraphs22 and 40 of the RAD&amp;C averred <i>inter alia</i> that â[Madam Wong committed conversion of [Mr Kwanâs] properties and/or breach of the BP Agreement â¦â¦â and â[by] reasonof the conversion and/or breach of the BP Agreement, [Madam Wong] has suffered loss and damagesâ, but Madam Wong sought to strikeout such paragraphs only âinsofar as it relates to the BP Agreementâ. Further, Madam Wong did not apply to strike out paragraphs36-37 and 39 of the RAD&amp;C, which specifically relate to the conversion claim (see paragraphs 23, 24 and 30 above).</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Ms Tam argued that a claim for conversion was different from a claim for breach of contract in that it was not dependent on theexistence of a contractual relationship or on identification of the seller and buyer of the subject chattels. So âa person whois in wrongful possession of goods and unlawfully disposes with such possession is guilty of conversionâ. Mr Tam submitted thatin order for a claimant to have title to sue for conversion, he must either be in actual possession or entitled to immediate possessionof the subject chattels, but it was unnecessary to show absolute ownership or even ownership. For example, a person with possessoryinterest as an agent was entitled to sue.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Ms Tam submitted that particulars of the Written and BP Agreements were still relevant to Mr Kwanâs claim for conversion (whichMadam Wong did not seek to strike out) in order to show how the Beauty Products came to be stored at the Premises and the subsequentwrongful interference, and they should remain intact and not be struck out.</p>    <p class="heading">XI. Discussion</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  It is true that Mr Kwanâs pleadings included claims for breach of contract and for conversion. In relation to the Beauty Products,he claimed for loss and damages as a result of Madam Wongâs (a) alleged breach of the BP Agreement and (b) alleged conversion ofthe Beauty Products. I am not concerned with (a) since Ms Tam conceded that pleadings on such cause of action are on their own liableto be struck out. Hence, I do not propose to deal with Ms Keiâs suggestion that Mr Kwanâs counterclaim in relation to the BeautyProducts rested on conversion and not on breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Ms Tam placed strong emphasis on the fact that Madam Wong did not seek to strike out Mr Kwanâs cause of action on conversion.In my view, the reason is straightforward. Although Mr Kwan pleaded that Madam Wong converted both the Equipment and the Beauty Products,Madam Wong did not seek to strike out the claim for conversion of the Equipment, so she could not and did not apply to strike outthe pleaded cause of action on conversion in its entirety. In so limiting her objection, the effect of the prayer of reliefs in herAmended Summons is to strip the pleaded conversion claim of all material averments as to the Beauty Products, thus leaving the materialfacts and averments in relation to the Equipment intact.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  But Ms Tam submitted that by only removing the reference to breach of the BP Agreement, paragraph 22 of the RAD&amp;C in pleadingâ[by] reason of the above wrongful acts, the Plaintiff committed conversion of the Defendantâs propertiesâ actually preservedMr Kwanâs claim for conversion of the Beauty Products. I disagree. If paragraphs 7A and 7B of the RAD&amp;C were struck out accordingto the Amended Summons, there will be no reference to the BP Agreement and/or the Beauty Products in the context of a conversionclaim at all in the paragraphs preceding paragraph 22 of the RAD&amp;C, so the phrase âabove wrongful actsâ in paragraph 22 canonly refer to the alleged conversion of the Equipment and does not support any alleged conversion of the Beauty Products as partof the âDefendantâs propertiesâ.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Ms Tam submitted that the landlordâs letter dated 12<sup>th</sup> December 2007 in paragraph 36 of the RAD&amp;C (see paragraph 23 above) by referring to the Note which stated that âchattels leftat the Premises as at 9<sup>th</sup> October 2007 were abandoned by [Madam Wong] and that [the landlord] may dispose of them at willâ actually comprised an allegationof wrongful interference of the Beauty Products. But since the Amended Summons sought to strike out the whole of paragraphs 7A, 7Band 33A as well as parts of paragraphs 22, 32, 33 and 35 (insofar as they related to the BP Agreement and the Beauty Products) ofthe RAD&amp;C, the remaining parts of the RAD&amp;C pertaining to the conversion claim that precede paragraph 36 do not refer tothe Beauty Products at all, so the phrase âthe chattels left at the Premisesâ in paragraph 36 refers to wrongful interferenceof the Equipment and not of the Beauty Products.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Ms Tam next referred to paragraph 37 of the RAD&amp;C which pleaded a factual matter, ie on 9<sup>th</sup> October 2007 the landlord discarded the Equipment and the Beauty Products without Mr Kwanâs knowledge or consent. Reference tothe Beauty Products in this context does not support a claim for their conversion because if the disputed averments in the RAD&amp;Cwere struck out, the remaining parts of the pleadings preceding paragraph 37 of the RAD&amp;C at best only aver wrongful interferenceof the Equipment. A plea that the landlord discarded the Beauty Products is neither here nor there when no material facts in respectof the essential elements of such claim have been pleaded. Further, paragraph 37 of the RAD&amp;C describes the landlordâs allegedwrongful act in contra-distinction to Madam Wongâs alleged wrongful acts set out in paragraphs 33, 34 and 36 of the RAD&amp;C (andMadam Wong has applied to strike out references to the BP Agreement and the Beauty Products in those paragraphs). In any event, MrKwan discontinued his claim against the landlord on 6<sup>th</sup> October 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Ms Tam submitted that paragraph 39 of the RAD&amp;C in pleading that as a result of Madam Wongâs conversion â[Mr Kwan] was unableto perform certain beauty treatments on his clients using equipment stored at the Premisesâ also maintained the claim for conversionof the Beauty Products. If Madam Wong is successful in striking out the offending pleas referred to in the Amended Summons, the analysisabove shows there will be no references to the Beauty Products and/or the BP Agreement material to the conversion claim in the paragraphspreceding paragraph 39 of the RAD&amp;C. In any event, there is no express reference to Beauty Products in paragraph 39 of the RAD&amp;C,which essentially is a compliant by Mr Kwan of loss of use of the Equipment.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Next, if paragraph 40 of the RAD&amp;C is stripped of the references to the BP Agreement and the claim for the market value of theBeauty Products, the pleaded claim for loss and damages therein is unobjectionable as it is limited to a claim for the market valueof the Equipment and loss of profit.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In light of the above, I am of the view that just because Madam Wong did not seek to strike out the entire cause of action on conversion,it does not mean she recognises or accepts that the pleaded claim for conversion of the Beauty Products is viable. In fact, the AmendedSummons, which seeks to strike out the offending passages in relation to the BP Agreement and the Beauty Products, suggest otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The true question is whether the cause of action for conversion of the Beauty Products is liable to be struck out on the SecondLimb.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The crucial issue is whether Mr Kwan has sufficient title to sue and/or has sufficiently pleaded his title to sue. According to<i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 19<sup>th</sup> ed (2006) para.17-40 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA person has title to sue for conversion if and only if he had, at the time of the conversion, either actual possession or theimmediate right to possess the property concerned. It is not necessary to prove ownership, and indeed even an owner may not sue unlesshe either possesses or has the immediate right to possess. Thus, for example, a purchaser of goods in whom the title is vested cannotsue for conversion until he pays or tenders the price and thus becomes entitled to possession. Conversely, there is no reason whyone with a possessory interest less than ownership, such as an agent, pledgee or buyer under a reservation of title clause, shouldnot sue in conversion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 19<sup>th</sup> ed (2006) at para.17-56 at p.1034 went on to say that â[for] these purposes, it seems that the immediate right to possession onwhich the owner relies must be a proprietary right; a mere contractual right will not do. â¦â¦â</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In the present case, there is no dispute that at the time of the alleged conversion of the Beauty Products the Defendant was notin actual possession of the same.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  According to the RAD&amp;C, by the Written Agreement Art Express agreed to sell and Organic Beauty agreed to purchase beauty products.The Written Agreement stated on its face that it was made between Art Express and Organic Beauty, and signed by Mr Kwan as marketingmanager on behalf of Art Express and by Madam Wong with the company chop of Organic Beauty affixed thereto. Plainly, both on pleadingsand evidence, Art Express (a limited company) but not Mr Kwan (an individual) was the seller of the beauty products.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  According to the RAD&amp;C, the AE Letter confirmed that Organic Beautyâs account would be transferred to Spa Sensations uponsigning of the Authorisation Form signifying acceptance of the terms/ conditions of the Written Agreement. According to the AE Letterdisclosed by Mr Kwan, it was written under Art Expressâ letterhead, signed by Mr Kwan as marketing manager, and addressed to SpaSensations for the attention of Madam Wong. The letter stated that âwe write to confirm that we agree to transfer your accountin name of Organic Beauty to your new SPA provide that the new BRC of SPA Sensations can be submitted at your earliest convenience.Please also arrange to fill in a new Authorisation Form with the new company chop of SPA Sensations &amp; your signature, which willsignify your acceptance on the terms &amp; conditions of our previous Sales Contract between Organic Beauty &amp; our company. â¦â¦â</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  A few observations can be made. First, the AE Letter was addressed to Spa Sensations, which was operated by Pacific Wide (limitedcompany). It has not been pleaded or contended that Pacific Wideâs separate legal existence can be ignored or the corporate veilshould be pierced. Secondly, the AE Letter requested for the âBRCâ, ie business registration certificate, of Spa Sensations,and for the Authorisation Form to be signed by Spa Sensations with its new company chop. It is evident from the AE Letter that ArtExpress intended to deal with Spa Sensations and not with Madam Wong in her personal capacity. Thirdly, the AE Letter was under ArtExpressâ letterhead and signed by Mr Kwan as marketing manager. It is therefore plain and obvious that Art Express (and not MrKwan) was the seller of the beauty products, which view is reinforced by the reference in the AE Letter to the Written Agreementbetween Organic Beauty and âour companyâ.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  Quite simply, the AE Letter does not support the averment in the RAD&amp;C that it was a letter to âthe Plaintiffâ (ie MadamWong) by which âthe Defendantâ (ie Mr Kwan) confirmed the transfer of the account to Spa Sensations upon signing the AuthorisationForm by âthe Plaintiffâ (ie Madam Wong) which would signify âthe Plaintiffâsâ (ie Madam Wongâs) acceptance of the terms/conditionsof the Written Agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  This is supported by the Authorisation Form, which referred to Madam Wong as spa director, and she signed such form as âè² è²¬äººâof âSPA SENSATIONS O/B PACIFIC WIDE HOLDINGS LIMITEDâ. Quite clearly, Madam Wong signed not in her personal capacity but on behalfof Spa Sensations/Pacific Wide, so the Authorisation Form again does not support the plea in the RAD&amp;C that âthe Plaintiffâ(ie Madam Wong) signed the Authorisation Form.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  It is therefore plain and obvious that by about September 2008, the beauty products trading account was between Art Express as sellerand Spa Sensations operated by Pacific Wide as purchaser. There is no support for the averment in the RAD&amp;C that from about 1<sup>st</sup> August to 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2007, âthe Plaintiffâ (ie Madam Wong) agreed to purchase and âthe Defendantâ (ie Mr Kwan) agreed to sell the BeautyProducts.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  As regards the Beauty Products, the SD Orders of various dates between 1<sup>st</sup> August and 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2007 plainly showed deliveries by Art Express (not by Mr Kwan) to Spa Sensations operated by Pacific Wide (not to Madam Wong).The SD Orders were under Art Expressâ letterhead with its round company chop affixed at the space for âAuthorised Byâ, andaddressed to âSPA SENSATIONS O/B PACIFIC WIDE HOLDINGSâ with its round company chop affixed to the space for âReceived Byâ.The names of the Parties did not appear anywhere on the SD Orders. There is again no basis for the averment in the RAD&amp;C thatâthe Defendantâ (ie Mr Kwan) delivered the Beauty Products to the Premises.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  In the circumstances, the averments in paragraphs 7A and 7B of the RAD&amp;C are frivolous and vexatious in that they are not capableof reasoned argument, without foundation or cannot possibly succeed. They do not properly reflect how the Beauty Products came tobe stored at the Premises, and cannot be relevant to Mr Kwanâs alleged claim for conversion of the Beauty Products. To requireMadam Wong to meet such averments is unfair and oppressive. </p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Given the concession that pleas in respect of the alleged breach of the BP Agreement are liable to be struck out, I see no reasonwhy the first sentence in paragraph 33 (ie plea of breach of the BP Agreement in that Madam Wong failed to pay the price of the BeautyProducts), paragraph 33A (ie plea of wrongful repudiation of the BP Agreement), paragraph 34 (insofar as it relates to the plea thatMr Kwan accepted Madam Wongâs repudiation thereby terminating the BP Agreement) and paragraph 40 (insofar as it relates to theplea of breach of the BP Agreement) of the RAD&amp;C ought not be struck out since they relate solely to the claim in contract anddo not aid any claim in conversion.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Next, although a cause of action for conversion is not necessarily dependent on any underlying contract or buyer/seller relationshipor ownership of the subject chattels, the claimant still must properly plead his title to sue. In respect of Mr Kwanâs plea asto his title to sue for conversion of the Beauty Products, since he did not have actual possession at the material time, it is necessaryto ascertain whether he has pleaded any immediate right to possession of the Beauty Products.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  As discussed above, Mr Kwan pleaded that he agreed to sell the Beauty Products (which averment and/or contention I have rejected),and that he was âthe ownerâ of the Beauty Products (see paragraph 32 of the RAD&amp;C).</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  But there is no plea in the RAD&amp;C that Mr Kwan was entitled to possession to the Beauty Products even though a claimantâstitle to sue (ie possessory title with an immediate right to the goods) is necessarily an essential element of the cause of actionfor conversion that must be specifically pleaded (see, for example, sample statement of claim in Form 10 at p.205 of <i>Atkinâs Encyclopaedia of Court Forms in Civil Proceedings</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> ed (1995) Vol.39 (1995) issue).</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  It was suggested that the FBP expanded the RAD&amp;C by pleading that since Madam Wong failed to pay for the Beauty Products, underClause 6 title in such products would not pass to her pending full payment, and ââ¦â¦ the Defendant [ie Mr Kwan] remained theowner of the Beauty Productsâ. Even so, there is no plea in the RAD&amp;C that Mr Kwan was entitled to possession of the BeautyProducts.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Clause 6 provides <i>inter alia</i> that ââ¦â¦ æææªç¹³ä»çè²¨åï¼ä»å±¬<i><u>ä»£çå¬å¸</u></i>çè²¡ç¢ç´è³å¨æ¸ç¹³æ¸â (my emphasis) and âä»£çå¬å¸â is defined in the Written Agreement as Art Express. In my view,the FBP do not reflect a fair reading of this clause. As stated in paragraph 70 above, the seller of beauty products in the WrittenAgreement was Art Express (ie âä»£çå¬å¸â). Under Clause 6, when the purchaser failed to pay for the beauty products, titlein such products remained with âä»£çå¬å¸â (ie Art Express). Even under the Written Agreement, the party entitled to possessionof the Beauty Products was at best Art Express and not Mr Kwan.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  I also agree with the observation in <i>Third Supplement to Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> 19<sup>th</sup> ed (up-to-date to July 2008) at para.17-40 at p.161 as follows : âIt is suggested that the <i><u>claimant must himself have possession (or the right to it) and will not have title to sue merely because a company which he controlshas it</u></i>. Such a rule was held in <i>Thunder Air Ltd v Hilmarrson</i> [1008] EWHC 355 (Ch) to apply where the defendant was in such a possession: <i><u>by parity of reasoning it is suggested that it must equally apply to a claimant</u></i>â (my emphasis).</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Here, Mr Kwan has not pleaded any particulars or material facts for making the following leaps in logic :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class='quote'>(a)  from averments of the Written Agreement between Art Express and Organic Beauty and of transfer of the beauty products tradingaccount from Organic Beauty to Spa Sensations to an averment that the seller and purchaser in respect of beauty products under suchtrading account were Mr Kwan and Madam Wong;</p>        <p class='quote'>(b)  from an averment of a retention of title clause in the Written Agreement in favour of Art Express as unpaid seller to an avermentthat Mr Kwan was the owner of the Beauty Products.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>There is no plea of any proprietary right to possession on the part of Mr Kwan or that the corporate veil of Art Express and/or PacificWide should be pierced so that their separate legal existence can be ignored.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  I also refer to the above analysis and say there is no evidential support for the aforesaid leaps in logic. Rather, Mr KwanâsDocuments suggest that Art Express sold and delivered the Beauty Products to Spa Sensations in the course of its business pursuantto the Written Agreement (which trading account had been assigned to Spa Sensations operated by Pacific Wide), and any retentionof title was in Art Expressâ favour. In my view, the plea in paragraph 32 of the RAD&amp;C that Mr Kwan was the owner of the BeautyProducts is frivolous and vexatious, and is liable to be struck out. At best Mr Kwanâs involvement was as marketing manager ofArt Express (see the Written Agreement and the AE Letter).</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Ms Tam after finishing her oral submissions in opposition and in the course of Ms Keiâs oral submissions in reply applied forleave (i) to amend Mr Kwanâs pleadings to plead that he had immediate right to possession of the Beauty Products at the time ofthe alleged conversion, and (ii) to file further affidavit evidence to oppose the Amended Summons. I refused such application atthe hearing and now set out my reasons :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class='quote'>(a)  Mr Kwan already had an opportunity to file affidavit evidence in opposition but chose not to do so. Ms Tam conceded that Mr Kwanhad no objection or reply to Mr Kwanâs Documents exhibited to Madam Wongâs affirmation.</p>        <p class='quote'>(b)  No satisfactory explanation was given for the lateness of the application for leave to adduce new evidence. Ms Tam complainedthat Madam Wong failed to clearly set out in her affirmation the basis why she contended the disputed pleadings were scandalous,frivolous and vexatious. I do not understand such complaint. Only facts and not submissions should be set out in affidavits, andMs Kei has outlined Madam Wongâs stance in her skeleton submissions. I bear in mind that paragraph 5 of PD19.1 is not applicable.</p>        <p class='quote'>(c)  Mr Kwan can hardly claim he was taken by surprise. It is the duty of the claimant to plead all essential elements and materialfacts to support his cause of action. In a conversion claim, the claimantâs title to sue is a glaringly obvious essential elementor material fact. It would have been evident as from the beginning when the D&amp;C was prepared. Although Mr Kwan averred in theD&amp;C that he was the owner of the Beauty Products, Schedule 2 annexed thereto (ie a sales analysis list under Art Expressâ letterheadlisting all items of the Beauty Products and describing Spa Sensations operated by Pacific Wide as âcustomerâ) suggests he wasnot, which view is subsequently reinforced by Mr Kwanâs Documents. Further, Mr Kwan also has had 2 stabs at amending his pleadings(ie AD&amp;C and RAD&amp;C) and has filed the FBP, most of which were focused on his cause of action for alleged conversion of theBeauty Products.</p>        <p class='quote'>(d)  Ms Tam was wholly unable to tell the court even the gist of the affidavit evidence to be adduced. She submitted that after amendingthe pleadings as proposed, which would be easy, there could have been a whole host of potential reasons for Mr Kwan to have a rightto possession of the Beauty Products, eg Art Express might have given him such right. But Ms Tam acknowledged she had no instructionsat all as to what the actual reason or factual basis might be. She argued that such matter could be left to trial after amendmentof the pleadings as proposed. I see no reason why the court should lend itself to such application which is supported by nothingstronger than speculation, especially when Mr Kwanâs Documents suggest the factual scenario to be quite otherwise. There is noteven a shred of fact or law before me to suggest any arguable basis for saying Mr Kwan had possessory title.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I am of the firm view that such application must be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In the circumstances, without a viable plea or available evidence of title to sue for conversion of the Beauty Products, I am ofthe view that, on pleadings as well as on evidence, the relevant pleas are frivolous and vexatious. Such defect cannot be salvagedby the pleaded averments in relation to (i) the alleged conversion of the Equipment and/or (ii) the plea that the landlord discardedthe Equipment and the Beauty Products, or by amendment to the pleadings.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  In conclusion, the following averments in Mr Kwanâs pleadings fell to be struck out (and I so order) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class='quote'>(a)  paragraphs 7A, 7B and 33A of the RAD&amp;C;</p>        <p class='quote'>(b)  the phrase âand/or breach of the BP Agreementâ in paragraph 22 of the RAD&amp;C;</p>        <p class='quote'>(c)  the phrases âand Beauty Productsâ and âand the BP Agreementâ in paragraph 32 of the RAD&amp;C;</p>        <p class='quote'>(d)  the first sentence in paragraph 33 of the RAD&amp;C;</p>        <p class='quote'>(e)  the phrases âaccepted the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by Counterclaimâs repudiation, thereby terminating the BP Agreement, andâ and âand Beauty Productsâ in paragraph34 of the RAD&amp;C;</p>        <p class='quote'>(f)  the phrase âand Beauty Productsâ in paragraph 38 of the RAD&amp;C;</p>        <p class='quote'>(g)  the phrase âand/or breach of the BP Agreementâ and whole of item (2) of paragraph 40 of the RAD&amp;C;</p>        <p class='quote'>(h)  answer (d) of paragraph 10(3) of the FBP.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  I further order that Mr Kwan do within 14 days from the date hereof file and serve the Re-Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim andthe Amended Reply to Request for Further and Better Particulars of the Defence and Counterclaim to reflect that the aforesaid avermentshave been struck out. I also give leave to Madam Wong to file and serve Re-Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (if so desired)within 14 days thereafter.</p>    <p class="heading">XII. Costs</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  Even though paragraph 5 of PD19.1 does not apply to a striking out application based on the Second Limb so that there is no needto refer to <i>Tadano South China Company Limited v Brightford Limited &amp; anor</i> CACV152/2006 (unreported, 17<sup>th</sup> August 2006) cited by Ms Tam, Ms Tam still complained that Madam Wongâs affirmation did not give full alert of the basis for assertingthat Mr Kwanâs pleadings were scandalous, frivolous and vexatious. It was said that if Madam Wong had properly done so, the hearingfor striking out would have been rendered unnecessary, and substantial time and costs would have been avoided.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  I reiterate what I have said in paragraph 87(a)-(c) above. Madam Wong had all along relied on the Second Limb, which was first raisedin the RDC and maintained in the Summons and Amended Summons. She even filed affidavit evidence in support of the same. In my view,the pleadings and Madam Wongâs affirmation speak for themselves and point unerringly to the lacuna in Mr Kwanâs pleadings inrespect of his title to sue for conversion of the Beauty Products.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Further, although Mr Kwan conceded that the claim for breach of the BP Agreement was liable to be struck out, he chose to standon his pleaded claim for conversion of the Beauty Products until the failed attempt to seek leave to amend pleadings and file affidavitevidence at the tail end of the hearing.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  Still further, after the Summons was issued, Mr Kwan (well knowing that a striking out application was on foot) saw fit to re-amendthe AD&amp;C, and the focus of such re-amendments was on the subject of the striking out application, ie the BP Agreement and theBeauty Products. So Mr Kwan already had a stab in bolstering his pleadings on the very subject of the striking out application.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Ms Tam also made the point that Madam Wong did not object to the re-amendments made in the RAD&amp;C. I do not agree the Order madeby consent reflected any concession or admission on the part of Madam Wong. First, notwithstanding such re-amendments, Mr Kwan atthe very least conceded that the pleaded claim for breach of the BP Agreement was on its own liable to be struck out. Secondly, theOrder granted leave to Mr Kwan to re-amend the AD&amp;C, but at the same time also granted leave to Madam Wong to amend (not withdraw)the Summons, so both Parties knew that notwithstanding aforesaid re- amendments to the AD&amp;C, Madam Wong would still pursue herstriking out application pursuant to the Amended Summons.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  In the circumstances, there is no reason to depart from the usual principle that costs follow event in respect of the Amended Summons.I therefore grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that save and except there be no order as to costs of the Amended Summons limited to Madam Wongâs striking out application basedon the First Limb, Mr Kwan do pay to Madam Wong costs of and occasioned by the Amended Summons, including all costs reserved (ifany), to be taxed if not agreed with certificate for counsel. Although taxation of costs is reserved to the discretion of the taxingmaster, I should point out that, apart from submissions relating to paragraph 5 of PD19.1, the grounds for both the First and SecondLimbs are largely the same, and Madam Wong should be substantially entitled to costs of the application.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width='100%' border='0' style='border-collapse: collapse' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0'>        <tr>            <td width='50%' style='text-align:center'> </td>            <td width='50%' style='text-align:center'>(Marlene Ng)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width='50%' style='text-align:center'> </td>            <td width='50%' style='text-align:center'>District Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p style='text-align:left'>Ms Carmen Kei instructed by Messrs C K Mok &amp; Co for the Plaintiff by original action and 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by counterclaim.</p>        <p style='text-algin:left'>Ms Bonnie Tam instructed by Messrs K M Cheung &amp; Co for the Defendant by original action and Plaintiff by counterclaim.</p>        <p style="text-algin: left"> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2008/319.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
