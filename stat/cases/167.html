against the same Defendants.  Following the issueof the Writs, the 1st Defendant (then the only Defendant in the proceedings) applied to strike out the Statements of Claim endorsedon the Writs and for an order that the actions be dismissed.  The 2nd Defendant was added as a party by way of amendment but hasso far taken no part in the proceedings (we understand that there has been an order for substituted service on this Defendant). H H Judge Simon Leung dismissed the 1st Defendantâs application, but gave leave to appeal.  The issue before us was whether theStatements of Claim (as amended) should be struck out and if so, whether the actions should also be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  After hearing submissions from counsel, we allowed the appeals, and ordered the Amended Statements of Claim in the actions to bestruck out and the actions dismissed.  We also made consequential orders as to costs.  We indicated that the Reasons for Judgmentwould be handed down in due course.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The pleaded cause of action against the Defendants was the same in all the actions, namely, the economic tort of conspiracy to injure. Was this a sustainable cause of action?</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The factual allegations</b></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Until counsel for the Plaintiffs finally revealed to us the true nature of their case (see paragraph 23 below), it appeared to mefrom the Plaintiffsâ own evidence and their pleadings that the following represented the factual allegations asserted by them.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The Plaintiffs are from The Philippines.  They were all ex-employees of the 1st Defendant.  As pleaded, in the course of 2004 and2005, they were recruited by the 1st Defendant to work as process engineers in Hong Kong.  Each of them signed two contracts of employmentwith the 1st Defendant.  The difference between the two contracts was the salary : in the first contract (âthe 1st Contractâ),the salary was substantially higher than in the second contract (âthe 2nd Contractâ).  The range of salaries stated in the 1stContract signed by the Plaintiffs was between $18,000 and $21,000 a month, compared with the salary of $10,000 a month under the2nd Contract.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The person who hired the Plaintiffs was the 2nd Defendant, who was the Director of Quality Assurance of the 1st Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The purpose of the 1st Contract coming into existence was to facilitate the obtaining of employment visas from the Immigration Departmentfor the Plaintiffs.  Presumably, it was hoped that by stating a higher salary, the Immigration Department would be more willing toissue an employment visa.  Such visas were in fact issued.  When extensions to the visas were sought, letters were issued by the1st Defendant to the Immigration Department repeating the fact of the higher salaries under the 1st Contract.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On the other hand, the 2nd Contract reflected the actual salary to be paid to the Plaintiffs by the 1st Defendant and, when thePlaintiffs did come to Hong Kong to work, they were in fact paid the lower salaries.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In 2007, the fraud committed on the Immigration Department came to light.  The 2nd Defendant was prosecuted for conspiring withthe Plaintiffs to defraud the Immigration Department by the dishonest representation on salaries in order to secure employment visasfor them.  The 1st Defendant was also originally charged but this was later dropped.  At trial, all the Plaintiffs (except, apparently,the Plaintiff in DCCJ 3501/2008) gave evidence for the prosecution (they were presumably given some form of immunity).  The 2nd Defendantwas convicted at Shatin Magistratesâ Court and sentenced to 6 monthsâ imprisonment.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  It is to be noted that in the interviews carried out by the Immigration Department in the course of the investigations by the authoritiesinto the fraud, each of the Plaintiffs effectively said that the 1st Contract signed by them was not a genuine contract and was onlyused to facilitate the obtaining of employment visas.  The true agreement, according to them, was contained in the 2nd Contract.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>The claims made by the Plaintiffs against the 1st Defendant</b></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In March 2008, some of the Plaintiffs (in fact 7 of them) commenced proceedings in the Labour Tribunal against the 1st Defendanton the basis of underpayment of wages.  It was alleged that the agreed salary was that under the 1st Contract.  These claims wereeventually struck out for want of prosecution.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The present actions were commenced in September 2008.  The pleaded cause of action was conspiracy to injure.  It is now necessaryto examine this cause of action in detail.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Conspiracy to injury : the law</b></p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The law need only be briefly dealt with.  As stated above, the tort of conspiracy to injure is an economic tort.  Essentially, thetort consists of a conspiracy to injure the Plaintiffs resulting in (usually, if not invariably) pecuniary damage.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  There are two types of conspiracy to injure : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)    First, there is the conspiracy to injure the Plaintiff using lawful means.  Here, a requisite element of the tort is the predominantmotive to injure : see <i>Lonrho Plc v Fayed</i> <i>and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20AC%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 AC 448</a>, at 464B-C, 465C, 465H-466A.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)    The second type of conspiracy is the conspiracy to injure by the use of unlawful means.  Here, the mental element is not the<i>predominant</i> motive to injure the Plaintiff, merely an intention to do so : see <i>Lonrho Plc v Fayed</i> <i>and Others</i> at 465C, 465H-466A.  This is a lower requirement of intention, but it is still âneededâ to found the cause of action : see <i>Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Total Network SL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%20AC%201174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] AC 1174</a>, at 1249A-C (paragraph 82).</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr S T Jat, SC and Ms Lau (for the 1st Defendant) pointed out in their Skeleton Arguments that intention is not synonymous with foresight : <i>OBG Ltd and another v Allan and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] AC 1</a>, at 35E-G (paragraph 62).  Quite simply, what one foresees as a consequence of oneâs actions may not <i>necessarily</i> be the intention, although I daresay it is sometimes evidence of it.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Damage to the Plaintiff is an essential ingredient of the tort of conspiracy : see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>  (19th edition) at paragraph 25-137; <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (18th edition) at paragraph 40-023.  The tortious basis of damages has, of course, as its starting point, the principle that theinnocent party should be put, in monetary terms, in the same position as he would have been if the wrong had not been committed :see <i>McGregor on Damages</i> at paragraphs 1-022 and 19-003.  This is of course just a starting point in that, in any given case, the court will have to examineother aspects such as causation in order to reach a conclusion as to whether or not the damages claimed can be awarded.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  As a matter of pleading, a case based on conspiracy, must contain the following elements : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)    The agreement between two or more persons.  The means of carrying out the agreement, whether lawful or unlawful, must be setout.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)    The intention to injure the Plaintiff, whether predominant (in the case of a lawful means conspiracy) or merely an intentionto injure (in the case of an unlawful means conspiracy).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)    The acts that were carried out pursuant to the agreement and the stated intention.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)    The damage caused to the Plaintiff.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>See : <i>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacobâs Precedents of Pleadings</i> (16th edition) Vol.2 at paragraph 51-02.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  With these principles in mind, I now examine the Plaintiffsâ claim, both as pleaded and in substance.  The latter exercise isnecessary in that even if a pleading is bad, as long as it can be saved by amendment, the court may necessarily not be prepared todismiss the whole action (or, in the case of a defence, give judgment in the action).</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Are the Plaintiffsâ claims sustainable?</b></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The Statements of Claim in all 8 actions are virtually identical.  The conspiracy relied on is a conspiracy by unlawful means. There is pleaded the 1st Contract, but it is said that the Plaintiffs were âinducedâ to sign this contract.  From the pleading,it is clear that this contract was not relied on as constituting the true agreement, because it is said that when extensions forthe employment visas were sought from the Immigration Department, a letter was supplied to the Plaintiffs by the 1st Defendant âfalselyâstating the salary to be that under the 1st Contract.  The 2nd Contract is pleaded as one in which the Plaintiffs had no choice butto sign by reason of their circumstances.  However, it is pleaded that the Plaintiffs did âacceptâ this contract.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The pleading is obscure as to just what the conspiracy entailed.  The unlawful means to further the conspiracy can be assumed tobe the fraud committed on the Immigration Department by the use of the 1st Contract (although no particulars are provided as to theexact nature of this fraud), but the Statement of Claim does not provide any clue as to whether it is alleged that the intentionof the conspiracy was to injure the Plaintiffs and if so, how this was to occur.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  If, as seems to be the case pleaded in the Statement of Claim, the true contract was the 2nd Contract, then it is impossible tosee how any conspiracy was intended to or could injure the Plaintiffs.  In any event, it is also impossible to rationalize how thepleaded loss (the difference in the salaries between the 1st Contract and the 2nd Contract) could arise : the Plaintiffs receivedexactly the salary under the very contract asserted in their pleading to have been the true contract.  Thus, on the basis of thoseprinciples referred to in paragraph 16 above, without the conspiracy, their financial position was precisely the same.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In my view, the failure to plead properly material aspects of the conspiracy (even particulars aside) â that is, in respect ofthe intention to injure and the loss caused by the alleged conspiracy - renders the Amended Statements of Claim (on their face) demurrable. It should therefore be struck out on this ground alone.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Faced with this possibility, Mr S H Kwok( for the Plaintiffs) then expanded on the true nature of the conspiracy intended to bealleged by the Plaintiffs.  As I understand his formulation (or more accurately, reformulation) of the cause of action, it is this: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)    It was not the Plaintiffsâ case that a true agreement was reached on the terms of either the 1st Contract or the 2nd Contract.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)    There was in fact never any agreement as to the precise salary to be received by the Plaintiffs.  The agreement or arrangementwas only that the Plaintiffs would work for a salary that was consistent or commensurate with the terms of the Migration for EmploymentConvention 1949, as revised (it was said that this Convention applied in Hong Kong; without deciding this, we assume this to be thecase).</p>        <p class="quote">(3)    In Mr Kwokâs skeleton arguments, he sets out the relevant parts of Article 6(1) of the Convention as follows : -</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:left">âEach Member â¦â¦â¦ undertakes to apply â¦â¦â¦ treatment no less favourable than that which it applies to its own nationalsin respect of â¦â¦â¦ remuneration, including family allowance where these form part of remuneration, hours of work, overtime arrangements,holidays with pay, restrictions on home work, minimum age for employment, apprenticeship and training, womenâs work and the workof young persons; â¦â¦â¦ accommodation â¦â¦â¦ legal proceedings relating to the matters referred to in this Convention.â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">(4)    Accordingly, when the Plaintiffs came to Hong Kong to work for the 1st Defendant, they did so on the expectation or hope thatthey would be paid a salary that was consistent or commensurate with the Convention.  They were instead paid $10,000 a month.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(5)    The conspiracy consisted of an agreement on the 1st Defendantâs part with the 2nd Defendant to injure the Plaintiffs by payingthem only $10,000 when the salary ought to have been higher; and the unlawful means to be employed consisted of defrauding the ImmigratonDepartment by representing that the salary was that under the 1st Contract, when in reality, the 1st Defendant only intended to pay$10,000 a month.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(6)    The damage suffered by the Plaintiffs was the difference between $10,000 (the salary actually received) and $21,000 (or insome cases, $18,000), being the salaries that they ought to have received.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  If what has been set out in the previous paragraph represented the Plaintiffsâ true cause of action, it was nowhere pleaded inthe Amended Statements of Claim.  This version was also nowhere to be found in the various affidavits filed on behalf of the Plaintiffsby their solicitors, these affidavits purporting to set out the Plaintiffsâ version of events.  Mr Kwok submitted that this versionof the Plaintiffsâ case could be inferred from both the existing pleadings and the affidavits.  With respect to him, this was simplynot possible.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In any event, the formulation of a partyâs cause of action should clearly and cogently be made in the pleadings.  It should notbe left to an exercise of drawing inferences.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Three further points should be made: -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1)    First, the Plaintiffsâ latest version of their cause of action was totally at odds with the evidence before us.  I have inmind in particular the content of the Plaintiffsâ interviews with the Immigration Department : see paragraph 10 above.  No explanationwas provided as to this inconsistency.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(2)    Secondly, this version was also inconsistent with seven of the Plaintiffsâ cases in the Labour Tribunal (see paragraph 11above).  Again, Mr Kwok was unable to provide any clarification.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(3)    Thirdly, the latest version of the Plaintiffsâ case, whereby workers commenced employment without any agreement as to a fixedsalary but instead relying on the reference to a Convention, also defies logic and commonsense.  In the circumstances, it is impossibleto accept.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  For these reasons, the Amended Statement of Claim was struck out and there being no realistic possibility of the Statement of Claimbeing amended again to cure the defects, the action was dismissed as well.</p>    <p><b>Hon Kwan JA :</b></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  I agree with the reasons for judgment of the Chief Judge.</p>    <p><b>Hon Andrew Cheung J :</b></p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I also agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Geoffrey Ma)<br />            Chief Judge, High Court</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Susan Kwan)<br />            Justice of Appeal</td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Andrew Cheung)<br />            Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Mr Kwok Sui Hay, instructed by Messrs Boase, Cohen &amp; Collins for  the Plaintiffs (CACV 210/2009 to CACV 217/2009)</p>        <p>Mr Jat Sew Tong, SC &amp; Ms Queenie Lau, instructed by Messrs Lovells for  the 1st Defendant (CACV 210/2009 to CACV 217/2009)</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2010/71.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
