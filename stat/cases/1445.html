INTRODUCTION</p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  The Authority was the Employer and Rotegear the Nominated Sub-Contractor (NSC) for an Aldrich Bay construction project. The project(which started in 2005) involved the building of a Domestic Block (containing flats) and Market Complex (containing shops). Nishimatsuwas the Main Contractor. Rotegear was responsible for certain electrical works.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  By this action the Authority claims damages against Rotegear for breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Authorityâs case is that, contrary to what Rotegear warranted to the Authority, Rotegear failed to carry out its electricalworks with due diligence and without delay. As a result of Rotegearâs dilatory progress, Nishimatsu terminated Rotegearâs sub-contracton 28 September 2007. This meant that substitute sub-contractors had to be engaged to finish Rotegearâs uncompleted work. It isalleged that this led to the Authority having to pay more for the relevant electrical works than it should have.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  There are 3 principal issues for this Court to determine.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  First, Rotegear argues that there was no direct contractual relationship between itself and the Authority. Accordingly, Rotegearcontends that the Authority has no standing to bring the present proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Second, Rotegear denies that it was in breach of any contract that there may have been between itself and the Authority. If losswas caused to the Authority by having to engage replacement sub-contractors, this was because (according to Rotegear) Nishimatsuwrongly terminated Rotegearâs sub-contract.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Third, Rotegear says that, even if it were in breach of some contract, the damages of over $9 million claimed by the Authority areexcessive.</p>    <p class="heading">II. DISCUSSION</p>    <p class="heading">A. Was there a contract between the Authority and Rotegear?</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  By letter dated 10 June 2005 the Authority invited Rotegear to tender for the electrical works associated with the project. Theletter did not identify a main contractor. The tender documents accompanying the letter made it clear that the relevant works wouldbe carried out under an NSC and the tender would be evaluated by the Authority.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  By a mandatory Form of Tender addressed to the Authority. Rotegear confirmed that it had inspected the Site, the Main Contract,the drawings, and the Sub-Contract Specification for the relevant electrical works. The Form is dated 16 February 2005. But thisseems to be an error and the Form was likely sent to the Authority on 21 July 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  In the Form, Rotegear generally offered âto execute, complete and maintain the whole of the above-named Sub-contract Works inconformity with the said Main Contract (insofar as it apply to Nominated Sub-contractors)â. More specifically, by the Form, Rotegearundertook to the Authority:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âto complete the whole of the Sub-contract Works without delay to the Main Works and to complete the whole of the Sub-contract Worksand any Section thereof in accordance with the Contractorâs progress of the Main Works provided always the Sub-contractor is allowedany time specified in the Main Contract.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Form further stipulated (by cl.4):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âUnless and until a formal Agreement is prepared and executed this Tender, together with the written acceptance thereof by the Contractor... shall constitute a building contract between me/us and the Contractorâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  By letter dated 23 August 2005, at the Authorityâs request, Rotegear confirmed its tender of $11.85 million for the electricalworks. It stated that âthere would be no compromise to the standard of materials &amp; workmanshipâ. It also assured the Authoritythat âwe can mobilize all necessary resources for carrying out the Works to meet with the specified programme if the project wasawarded to usâ.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The Authority requested the letter because it was concerned that Rotegearâs tender was significantly lower than all the tendersreceived. The Authority was worried that Rotegear could not realistically perform its obligations under an NSC at such a low tender.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  On 22 September 2005 the Authority informed Rotegear that it had been nominated for the electrical works. The Authorityâs letteridentified Nishimatsu as Main Contractor and stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOn receipt of the written acceptance of your tender from [Nishimatsu] you will be deemed to be a Nominated Sub-contractor withinthe Conditions of Contract and will be required to enter into a Sub-Contract with [Nishimatsu]â.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Mr. John Bleach SC (appearing for the Authority) submits that the Form constituted an offer by Rotegear to the Authority which theAuthority accepted. By the Form, Rotegear promised to progress the relevant works in compliance with the Main Contractorâs programme,in return for being nominated by the Authority as sub-contractor. Rotegearâs offer to carry out the electrical works on time wasbuttressed by its letter of 23 August 2005. The Authority accepted Rotegearâs offer by nominating Rotegear for the electrical worksand requiring Nishimatsu to engage Rotegear as a sub-contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  There being offer and acceptance, it follows (Mr. Bleach reasons) that there was an actionable contract between the Authority andRotegear. If Rotegear failed to comply with Nishimatsuâs timetable for the project and caused delay, there would be a breach ofRotegearâs promise to the Authority. The Authority could sue Rotegear (Mr. Bleach concludes) for the consequences of such breachof promise.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr. Bleach notes that Form cl.4 is consistent with this analysis. That clause provides that, in the event of Rotegear being nominatedby the Authority and upon written acceptance by the Main Contractor of Rotegearâs tender in consequence of such nomination, theForm would stand as a contract between Rotegear and the Main Contractor until superseded by a formal sub-contract. The Form wouldperform such function between Rotegear and the Main Contractor in addition to evidencing an agreement between Rotegear and the Authority.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  I think that Mr. Bleachâs analysis is correct. In my view, the Form coupled with Rotegearâs letter of 23 August 2005 constitutesan offer to the Authority. The Authority accepted that offer by its letter of 22 September 2005. That acceptance gave rise to a directcontractual relationship between the Authority and Rotegear.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr. Hugh Wong (a director of Rotegear appearing on its behalf) submits that in an NSC situation âno sub-contractor ... would intendthat any promise or assurance made at a tender meeting would be enforced by the employerâ. He stresses that, when he himself discussedthe tender with the Authority prior to Rotegearâs nomination, he did not contemplate that he would be entering into a direct contractualrelationship with the Authority.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr. Wong suggests that the Form contains merely standard wording that is insufficiently specific to be enforceable as a contractbetween an Employer and a nominated sub-contractor. He contends that, if Mr. Bleach is right, there should have been a statementin the Form that the Employer would have the legal right to enforce a tendererâs promise if not performed.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr. Wong adds that, if Mr. Bleach is right, one would have the unfair situation where the Authority could sue Rotegear for breachof promise, but Rotegear could not sue the Authority.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  I am unable to accept Mr. Wongâs arguments.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  First, the civil law construes partiesâ intentions objectively by reference to their overt acts. In determining whether or notparties intended to enter into a legally binding agreement, the law pays no regard to their unexpressed subjective intentions orthoughts.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  This means that the law cannot take account of Mr. Wongâs personal understanding as to whether or not Rotegear was entering intoa direct contract with the Authority in the course of tendering for the electrical works. Such understanding is irrelevant. The Courtcan only take into account the overt acts which one party to the transaction manifested to the other.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  For the purposes of this case, such overt acts would include: the fact that the invitation to tender emanated from the Authoritywithout identifying a specific main contractor; the fact that the Form and the 23 August letter were specifically addressed by Rotegearto the Authority; the fact that Rotegearâs tender was evaluated by the Authority; and the fact that tender acceptance was communicatedto Rotegear by the Authority. In none of the above was Nishimatsu involved. In none of the above is there any suggestion that theAuthority was simply acting as Nishimatsuâs agent.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Second, the wording of the Form seems to me sufficient to give rise to a contractual arrangement. There is no legal requirementthat there be an express sentence acknowledging the Authorityâs entitlement to sue a nominated sub-contractor directly.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Third, the asymmetry in ability to sue which Mr. Wong identifies is not a basis at law for concluding that there is no enforceablelegal relationship between 2 persons.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It is commonplace in contract and tort law for one party to warrant something in consideration for another party engaging in someconduct. A typical example is where an agent warrants to a third party that the agent has authority to act for a principal. The merefact that the agent cannot sue the third party if the warranty of authority turns out to have been wrongly made, does not preventthe third party from suing the agent for breaching the warranty.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, I conclude that there was an enforceable contractual relationship between the Authorityand Rotegear.</p>    <p class="heading">B. Was there a breach of contract?</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  There is ample evidence that by August 2007, in relation to the electrical works in both the Domestic Block and the Market Complex,Rotegear was significantly behind schedule.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  For example, according to the minutes of a site meeting on 22 August 2007 which Mr. Wong had specifically been required to attend,the Housing Department identified the following problems with Rotegearâs performance:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â-- Manpower level was inadequate with respect to site work and paper work.</p>        <p class="quote">-- Achieved progress in Market Complex was unacceptable.</p>        <p class="quote">-- Submission and re-submission of external lighting material was outstanding.</p>        <p class="quote">-- Ordering of critical materials was delayed and outstanding. (in particular the armoured/ pre-fab. Cable, single core cables, mainswitch board, many accessories for domestic flats, etc.).</p>        <p class="quote">-- Submission of shop drawings was outstanding for external lighting layout and switchgears arrangement of meter rooms, ELV-PA/ securitysystems.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  At the meeting, the same minutes record that âRotegear was urged again to improve on the situation without further delayâ.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Nishimatsu, in particular, pointed out that âdelay in delivery and installation of critical Electrical materials would likelycause late completion of the domestic block beyond the contract completion dayâ. This message âwas made known to Rotegear repeatedly,clearly and specifically in the meetingâ. Mr. Wong on behalf of Rotegear âacknowledged and understood the aforesaid messageâ.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  On 24 August 2007, Nishimatsu followed up on the meeting with a warning letter. That stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDespite to our numerous letters urging you the progress of works in domestic block and market, we are very disappointed to notethat there has been no improvement to the electrical installation at meter rooms and corridor lighting installed at 3 floors, theelectrical installation at domestic blocks was suspended since June of 2007. For market, the Contract completion date was 30 July2007 but the ELV [Extra Low Voltage] installation was still incomplete and continues to be in delay.</p>        <p class="quote">For the domestic block, the F [Floor] 40 concrete structure was completed on February 2007 but the wiring within domestic flats hasonly been installed from F1 to F32. The wiring within the domestic flat has now been suspended since June 2007 while wiring of othercommunal area has not yet commenced. We understand that all such suspension of works has been caused by your inability to delivercabling materials to site. Since the cable materials require 6-8 weeks delivery, if those cables are not procured now, the projectcompletion will not be achieved due to your delay in achieving the energisation date of 15 Oct 2007.</p>        <p class="quote">In addition, you reported in the previous BS meeting in July that the LV main switch will be delivered to site around end of September2007 but we replied in the meeting that such late delivery shall cause delay in achieving the energisation date of 15 Oct 2007 asthe installation of LV main switch usually requires 3-4 weeks at least. To date your have still not confirmed the expected deliverydate of the LV main switch to achieve the energisation date.</p>        <p class="quote">....</p>        <p class="quote">We have chased you for the above via numerous letters, memos, ad-hoc meetings, special meeting with [the Authority] as listed below.</p>        <p class="quote">[List of 10 items]</p>        <p class="quote">Despite our letters, meeting etc there has been no response or improvement to the progress of your Sub-Contract Works.

This was because the Authority hadânot observed any significant improvement on Electrical NSCâs performanceâ. The letter identified the following as requiringâimmediate attentionâ:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1. Slow progress of ELV installation in the Market Complex.</p>        <p class="quote">2. Slippage of T &amp; C [Testing &amp; Commissioning] works in Market Complex.</p>        <p class="quote">3. Late ordering of major materials (armoured and pre-fab cables for Domestic Block).</p>        <p class="quote">4. Slow or non-progress of installation works in Domestic Block (such as wiring accessories for domestic flats, cable riser installation,lateral sub-mains installation and main switchboard installation).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The Authority concluded its letter:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe are deeply concerned that any further non-performance of your Electrical NSC could undermine the progress and the quality ofthe works to such an extent that you will fail to fulfil your contractual obligation in this project.

We would have no choiceto hold your company responsible for all the losses and damages due to your delay to this work section as resulted.</p>        <p class="quote">In addition, please pay special attention that the construction progress in Domestic Block are going to the final stage, in whichall trades of work progress will become critical in accordance with the said Master Programme. Since you have suspended the cablingwork in domestic block since June of 2007 by your inability to deliver cabling material to site. As advised by the cable supplierthat the cable materials require 8-12 weeks for fabrication, if those cables are not procured before 15 Sept 2007. While you areseriously reminded that the failure of procurement/ delivery of said power cables on time will cause the delay in achieving the mentionedenergisation date of 18 Dec 2007, and will extend to cause the late in Project completion accordingly. Therefore, you are instructedto procure all necessary material and arrange adequate manpower to complete your works on time, which the milestone dates for thedomestic block are as follows:-</p>        <p class="quote">a.

The ELV works arecritical to the completion and handover of the markets complex, which is currently scheduled for 21st September 2007. Your failureto proceed with due diligence with the ELV works will affect the issue of the Completion Certificate for Section 3 of the Works.</p>        <p class="quote">b) There has been no progress on the testing and commissioning works for the electrical installation to the market complex. To dateyou have only completed approximately 60% of the testing and commissioning. The testing and commissioning is critical to the completionand handover of the market complex. Your failure to proceed with due diligence with the testing and commissioning for the marketcomplex will affect the issue of the Completion Certificate for Section 3 of the Works.</p>        <p class="quote">c) For the residential block you have only installed wiring within the flats up to 32nd floor. The wiring to the remaining eight floorshas not progressed since 3rd April 2007. You have not installed the cabling from the individual flats to meter room. The energisationdate for residential block is 18th December 2007. Your failure to proceed with due diligence with the wiring/ cabling installationto the residential block will affect the energisation of the block and thus delay the completion of the Works.</p>        <p class="quote">d) Without the wiring installation you cannot install the wiring accessories to the flats.

Thus, as a result of Rotegearâs failure to progress critical electrical works in a timely fashion, the completion of theDomestic Block and Market Complex by 21 September 2007 (that is, the completion date envisaged at the time of Nishimatsuâs terminationletter) had been put into jeopardy.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  I reach this conclusion especially in the absence of any contemporaneous letters from Rotegear to Nishimatsu or the Authority refutingthe matters of which complaint was made prior to 28 September 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  It was Mr. Wongâs evidence that no such refutation letter was sent, in order to maintain the âgood relationshipâ between Rotegearon the one hand and Nishimatsu and the Authority on the other.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  According to Mr. Wong, at the time, Rotegear was having to put up with a âfinancial burdenâ. By this I understand that Rotegearwas having cashflow difficulties. This meant that it could not pay for the more expensive of the electrical equipment (such as mainLV switchboard) which it had to supply in order to complete its work. On occasion, Mr. Wong had to request financial assistance fromNishimatsu or the Authority in the form of one or other of the latter ordering such electrical equipment on Rotegearâs behalf andRotegear paying for the same in instalments or by deduction from interim payments becoming due to it.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  I find this evidence of Mr. Wong on maintaining a âgood relationshipâ hard to believe. It seems to me that, if the correspondencefrom the Authority and Nishimatsu painted the wrong picture about Rotegearâs actual progress on the project, Rotegear would havebeen saying so in writing in no uncertain terms. I doubt that Rotegear would have been holding back its fire on some forlorn hopeof maintaining a âgood relationshipâ with Nishimatsu and the Authority. Any relationship between Rotegear and the latter twowould have already been in a deteriorated condition as a result of the complaints being levied. It would have been evident to Rotegearthat, unless it refuted the complaints or improved its progress, there would be no âgood relationâ to preserve.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  If anything, the âfinancial burdenâ which Mr. Wong candidly accepts that Rotegear was then facing, goes a long way towards explainingwhy progress on the electrical works was slow.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In this connection, consider, for instance, the ELV works for the Market Complex.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  Rotegear sub-contracted those works to MegaTech Engineering Ltd. MegaTech refused to proceed with the works because it was not beingpaid by Rotegear. On 23 August 2007 MegaTech agreed, however, to deliver certain necessary equipment in return for an immediate chequepayment of $29,5000 and a 45 days post-dated cheque for $177,091.25. Both amounts represented monies long overdue to Megatech.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In the event, following delivery of the equipment, MegaTech instead received a 60 days post-dated cheque from Rotegear contraryto the understanding reached between the two. As a result, MegaTech by letter dated 17 September 2007 refused to do any further workâunless and until a new mutual agreement regarding the payment and work progress has been establishedâ. The outcome was thatRotegear could not complete the ELV works in the Market Complex as scheduled.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  In my view, Rotegear was silent in the face of so many complaints about its progress from Nishimatsu and the Authority for the simplereason that it had no good answer to those criticisms. Lacking the necessary resources, especially financial resources, Rotegearcould not keep in step with Nishimatsuâs programme. On the contrary, its lack of progress on site cast doubt on its ability toperform its obligations and repeatedly placed Nishimatsuâs programme in jeopardy.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  In those circumstances, I am unable to say that Nishimatsu wrongly terminated Rotegearâs NSC on 28 September 2007.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I conclude from all this that Rotegear breached its warranty to the Authority to perform its obligations in accordance with theMain Contractorâs programme.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr. Wong, however, submits that such a conclusion would not be right.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  First, Mr. Wong says that Nishimatsu was constantly sending to Rotegear advance drawings incorporating variations to the electricalworks. Rotegear acted upon these drawings. But it requested that the Authority and Nishimatsu provide it with formal site instructionsincorporating the relevant variations. It was not until those variations were received (Mr. Wong claims) that Rotegear could applyfor Extensions of Time (EOTs). Such EOTs as it might have applied for by reason of the advanced drawings, would have enabled Rotegear(Mr. Wong asserts) to finish its works on time.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  I am unable to accept this argument.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Rotegear never in fact applied (whether formally or informally) for an EOT.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The NSC did stipulate that, where an act or omission of the Main Contractor has delayed relevant Sub-Contract works, the Sub-Contractorwill be entitled to an EOT. But this is provided that the Sub-Contractor âgives notice in writing to the Contractor as soon aspracticable but in any event within 30 days of the cause and probable extent of any delay ... becoming apparentâ.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr. Wong admitted in evidence that he was fully aware of this proviso.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  The NSC did not require a site instruction before an EOT could be granted to Rotegear. If Rotegear truly believed that (by reasonof some variation contained in some drawing) it was entitled to an EOT, it was incumbent upon Rotegear to give written notice toNishimatsu accordingly, within the time stipulated by the NSC. No notice having actually been given by Rotegear, it is difficultto see why it should be entitled after the event to the benefit of EOTs which it might have received had it applied for the same.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Mr. Wong claims not to have applied for EOTs because of an understanding reached with Mr. Patrick Yu of the Authority. That understanding(according to Mr. Wong) was to the effect that Rotegear could apply for any EOTs at the end of the project and everything would besorted out at the time of a final account. Mr. Yu denies that there ever was such an understanding.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  On this, I do not accept that there was an understanding between Mr. Wong and Mr. Yu.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I do not think that the allegation of an understanding is credible. Mr. Wong never raised the existence of such understanding untilhis second witness statement in this action. There is no hint of the understanding in any contemporaneous document. One would haveexpected the matter to have been mentioned at some point before 28 September 2007, if there truly had been some understanding.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Nor do I see how the supposed understanding could be workable. It would have been necessary at any moment for everyone involvedin the project to know whether or not Rotegear was entitled to an EOT. Rotegearâs entitlement or not to an EOT would have an effecton the overall programming for the project, since installation of electrical equipment would impact on other sub-contract works.If entitlement to EOTs was only to await a final reckoning at the end of the day, it would have been impossible to assess at a givenmoment whether the project as a whole was or was not on time.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Second, Mr. Wong argues that Nishimatsuâs termination of the NSC was premature. Nishimatsu being entitled to 60 days EOT for inclementweather, Rotegear should have had the benefit of the same. That would have meant (it is suggested) that Rotegear could have finishedits works within the 60 daysâ allowed to Nishimatsu.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  But Mr. Bleach rightly points out that it does not follow from the fact that, under the Main Contract, Nishimatsu became entitledto 60 days extension for inclement weather, that Rotegear should automatically enjoy the same benefit. The Domestic Block and MarketComplex were enclosed by February and December 2006 respectively. Thus, inclement weather should not have had a delaying effect uponthe electrical works which Rotegear largely had to carry out indoors.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Nor is it apparent from the evidence that Rotegear would have had sufficient financial and manpower resources to complete the projectwithin any extended period of 60 days. This is especially doubtful given the âfinancial burdenâ admitted by Mr. Wong and thefact that for several months prior to the termination of the NSC in September 2007 Rotegearâs progress had been very slow.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  There is evidence that, between 17 September and 10 October 2007, Mr. Wong injected $2 million into Rotegear by 6 payments of between$100,000 and $300,000. But (as Mr. Bleach observes) this must be viewed against the background that in the same period Rotegear stillowed Nishimatsu about $1 million for electric cables and had to find funding of about $2.2 million for a cable riser, about $600,000for a main LV switchboard, and about $350,000 for ELV equipment. Thus, despite the $2 million injected, Rotegear still required substantiallymore to comply with its obligations.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Third, Mr. Wong argues that, if Nishimatsu had been delayed, it would have had to pay the Authority liquidated damages of about$45,000 per day. Even on a generous assumption of (say) 60 daysâ delay, Nishimatsu would only be liable to the Authority for liquidateddamages of about $2.7 million. Nishimatsu could then (Mr. Wong says) recover this last amount from Rotegear by way of compensationfor breach of the NSC.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  $2.7 million is nothing like the sum of over $9 million now being claimed by the Authority from Rotegear. It is unfair (Mr. Wongasserts) for the Authority to have a claim in breach of warranty against Rotegear that is wholly disproportionate to the amount thatNishimatsu could claim from Rotegear by way of consequential damages.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In my view, there is nothing in this argument. Rotegearâs liability to the Authority for breach of warranty is a separate matterfrom Rotegearâs liability (if any) to Nishimatsu under the NSC. As a matter of law, one cannot infer anything about the legitimacyof the Authorityâs action by reference to the compensation which Rotegear may have had to pay Nishimatsu.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Mr. Wongâs arguments therefore do not alter my conclusion that Rotegear breached its warranty to the Authority. Rotegear couldnot keep to Nishimatsuâs schedule for the project works. This led to Nishimatsu terminating Rotegearâs NSC. In consequence, theAuthority had to pay more to get Rotegearâs electrical works done. Rotegear is thus liable for such additional cost which the Authorityreasonably and foreseeably had to expend in order to finish off Rotegearâs uncompleted work.</p>    <p class="heading">C. Are the damages being claimed excessive?</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Following Rotegearâs termination in September 2007, the remaining electrical works in the Domestic Block were tendered out. Theworks were awarded to Pekko Engineering Ltd. which had put in the lowest tender ($7,325,000).</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The works were let out to Pekko as a domestic sub-contractor to Nishimatsu and not as a nominated sub-contractor. The Authoritycalculated (and I accept) that it would be more costly and time-consuming if the works were let out under an NSC. Nishimatsu chargedthe Authority a mark-up of 25% over Pekkoâs tender to take account of the risk of supervising Pekko at a late stage in the project.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  The Market Complex was taken out of the Main Contract by agreement between the Authority and Nishimatsu. The remaining electricalworks there were carried out by Newton Engineering Co. Ltd. Newton was the Authorityâs Term Maintenance Contractor.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  As Employer, the Authority would ultimately have to bear any additional cost to the project resulting from Rotegearâs termination.In engaging replacement sub-contractors for the Domestic Block and Market Complex, the Authority was mitigating its loss. It is entitledto be compensated for all reasonable steps taken in mitigation.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  At trial, the parties each called a quantum expert. The Authority relied on the evidence of Mr. John Battersby and Rotegear on theevidence of Mr. Paul Mallon.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  The formula agreed between the experts for computing Rotegearâs damage may be summarised as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAmount A (Work done by Rotegear prior to termination)</p>        <p class="quote">PLUS</p>        <p class="quote">Amount B (Cost of completing Sub-Contract Works for Market Complex)</p>        <p class="quote">PLUS</p>        <p class="quote">Amount C (Cost of supplying cabling material and LV switchboard for Domestic Block)</p>        <p class="quote">PLUS</p>        <p class="quote">Amount D (Cost of completing Sub-Contract Works for External Works and Domestic Block other than supply of cable materials and LVswitchboards for Domestic Block)</p>        <p class="quote">PLUS</p>        <p class="quote">Amount E (Additional staff costs and professional fees)</p>        <p class="quote">MINUS</p>        <p class="quote">Amount F (Estimated cost of Sub-Contract Works pursuant to the Sub-Contract)</p>        <p class="quote">EQUALS</p>        <p class="quote">Amount G (Total Damages)â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Before going through Amounts A to G, I note that I have generally (but not always) preferred the evidence of Mr. Battersby to thatof Mr. Mallon where the two have been in conflict. Mr. Battersby has had long experience as a QS in Hong Kong. On the other hand,although Mr. Mallon worked as an engineer in various Hong Kong companies between 1997 and 2004, he is not actually a QS. Further,it does not appear that Mr. Mallon had sufficient access to relevant documents in this case. As a result, Mr. Mallonâs report hasmade a number of assertions (such as the existence of arithmetical and other errors) which have appeared unjustified on a closerinspection of the documents. To put it bluntly, it seems to me that Mr. Battersby was more careful than Mr. Mallon in the preparationof an expert report.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The experts are agreed that Amount A should be assessed at $8,461,000.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Mr. Battersby assesses Amount B at $1,049,256.49, while Mr. Mallon puts the amount at $434,185. The difference between them is mainlyattributable to an omission by Mr. Battersby of a maintenance cost of $200,000 and to Mr. Mallonâs deduction of supposed overpricingin relation to Newtonâs works.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Here I prefer Mr. Battersbyâs figures. Mr. Bleachâs cross-examination of Mr. Mallon has (I believe) demonstrated that therewere quotations from suppliers supporting the prices claimed by Newton.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  The experts both assess Amount C at $3,058,549.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Mr. Battersby assesses Amount D at $9,136,000. Mr. Mallonâs assessment is $6,032,166. The difference between them is mainly attributableto supposed arithmetic and duplication errors in Pekkoâs tender price and the mark-up applied to Pekkoâs tender price.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Here I think that Mr. Bleachâs cross-examination of Mr. Mallon has shown that the alleged arithmetic errors were picked up andcorrected by Pekko when quoting its tender price. As for the supposed duplication errors, I am not satisfied that there was double-countingas Mr. Mallon asserts. Thus, for instance, entries (such as those in relation to âbonding for water pipe/gas pipe &amp; sinkâ)which Mr. Mallon says are duplicates do not bear precisely the same description and have different rates ascribed to them. I alsobear in mind Mr. Battersbyâs evidence that, Pekko having been engaged on a lump sum basis, it is likely that rates were workedout retrospectively after a total tender price had been decided on by Pekko. Thus, âcorrectionsâ to rates would probably havehad little effect on the lump sum tender price already determined by Pekko.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Insofar as mark-up is concerned, Mr. Mallon thought that Nishimatsuâs mark-up of 25% was too high. He suggested that 2.4% wouldbe more appropriate. That was based on an allowance for attendance of 2.4% in the NSC between Rotegear and Nishimatsu. But that figurestrikes me as far too low. As Mr. Battersby pointed out (and Mr. Mallon accepted) an attendance fee is typically charged by a maincontractor on sub-contractors to reflect the cost of the latter using general facilities (such as canteen and toilets) made availableby the main contractor. Consequently, as a reflection of the increased risk to Nishimatsu in taking on Pekko as a domestic sub-contractorat short notice, a figure of 2.4% would be inadequate.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The evidence is that something like 15% would be the normal mark-up charged by a main contractor for a domestic sub-contractor.By comparison, 25% would seem excessive. But taking account of the fact that Nishimatsu did not charge the 25% mark-up on materialswhich it supplied for the electrical works, the actual uplift is something more like 17.5%.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Although this figure of 17.5% is slightly higher than the 15% figure commonly used as a starting point, I am not prepared to saythat it was excessive or unreasonable. I am mindful, in particular, that Pekko was engaged late in the day and within a short-timeframe. Thus, it may not have been possible within the limited time available for Nishimatsu fully to assess the risks inherent intaking on Pekko as a domestic sub-contractor. Not surprisingly then, Nishimatsu may not have been prepared to engage Pekko withoutan uplift in the mark-up percentage. The evidence is that in fact Nishimatsu strongly insisted on 25%.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  Accordingly, on Amount D, I prefer Mr. Battersbyâs assessment.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In relation to Amount E, Mr. Battersby assesses additional staff costs at $572,087.90, Mr. Mallon at $421,333. Mr. Mallon suggeststhat the additional staff deployed by the Authority to supervise Pekko and Newton was excessive. He therefore reduces the amountattributable to such staff by one-third.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Here, I would follow Mr. Mallon. In terms of additional supervisory staff, the authority deployed 5 persons on site and 6 off-site.Off-site staff cost the equivalent of nearly $200,000; site staff cost about $380,000. These figures strike me as excessive, especiallygiven that there would inevitably already be some general supervision by Nishimatsu. Mr. Mallonâs approach of a one-third discountwould seem to lead to a more reasonable figure. Mr. Bleach criticises the discount as âarbitraryâ. But I believe it is a rough-and-readyapproach, doing the best that one can in all the circumstances.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  On Amount F, Mr. Battersby comes up with $13,175,402.14 and Mr. Mallon $13,319,599.22. There is in fact little to choose betweenthe two calculations of Amount F. Since quantification cannot be an exact science, I shall err on the side of generosity towardsRotegear and go for Mr. Mallonâs figure.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  By reason of the foregoing, Amount G (Total Damages) comes to $8,784,884.72. For ease of handling, this can be rounded down to $8,784,880.This is about $300,000 less than the damages claimed in the Amended Statement of Claim ($9,087,258.84).</p>    <p class="heading">III. CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  There will be judgment for the Authority against Rotegear in the sum of $8,784,880. Interest is to accrue on the sum at 1% overprime from the date of the Statement of Claim (24 April 2008) until the date of this Judgment. Thereafter interest will run at thejudgment rate until payment.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  There will be an Order Nisi that Rotegear is to pay the Authorityâs costs of this action, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(A.T.
