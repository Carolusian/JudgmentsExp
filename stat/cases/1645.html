It is fair to say that the car-park was basicallyjust an open space with iron fencing at its boundary.  There was a kiosk at the entrance.  An attendant was at the kiosk and ticketwas issued to members of the public who parked there.  The parking charge was $4 per hour.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The Claimant parked his car there on 30 July 2003.  When he returned on the same day, he found that his car had been burgled.  Thehi-fi system, steering wheel and other accessories were stolen.  As a result, he incurred $24,630 to repair the same.  He consideredthat the Defendant should be liable to compensate him for such loss.  He therefore filed a claim against the Defendant in the SmallClaims Tribunal.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 5 March 2004, the case was tried before Mr Pang Ka-kwong.  The Adjudicator decided the claim in favour of the Claimant and awardedhim the sum of $24,630 plus interest and costs.  The Defendant appealed against that award and leave was granted by this court on3 June 2004.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Although two grounds of appeal were canvassed, it is apparent that if I decide the first ground in favour of the Defendant (viz.on the question of Defendantâs responsibility in keeping safe custody of the car at the material time), there is no need to dealwith the second ground (viz. whether the Defendant could rely on the exemption clause).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Before I turn to the law, I shall set out the terms of the Parking Rules which were found by the Adjudicator to be the terms ofthe contract between the parties.  They were in Chinese and parties have not provided any translation thereof.

There was no barrier at the entrance.  In other words, if a car owner drove awaywithout paying, he would not encounter any physical difficulty although he would probably be guilty of a criminal offence.  Needlessto say, there was no CCTV.  However, the Defendant required the attendant to patrol around the car-park once every hour and thiswas checked by a supervisor.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The duty of the Defendant depends on the legal analysis as to its relationship with the Claimant.  As stated by <i>Palmer on Bailment,</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn., p.426 n.2, it is a well established general principle of the law of tort that generally a person owes no duty of care to protectthe property of another against theft by independent third parties.  It seems that the Adjudicator found the Defendant to be liableon the basis that it became a bailee of the car (see Paragraph 22 of the judgment of the Adjudicator). </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Mr Chui submitted that the Adjudicator erred in law in holding that the Defendant was a bailee.  He submitted that the Defendantwas only a licensor.  It granted a licence to the Claimant to park the car there.  It did not undertake the responsibility for thesecurity of the car when it was parked there.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Mak contended that the Adjudicator made such finding on the basis that the Defendant had provided securityservices and used a ticketing system to exercise control over the car when it was parked there.

With respect, insofar as the Adjudicator held that the Defendant had undertaken such aresponsibility, he had misconstrued the contract.  Clause 1 specifically and categorically stipulated that the Defendant only gavea licence to the car owner to park within the car-park but did not undertake the safe custody of the car.  Clause 1 made it quiteclear that the car was parked there at the ownerâs own risk.  As said by Romer LJ in <i>Ashby v Tolhurst</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%202%20KB%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 2 KB 242</a> at p.255-6,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âYou cannot infer a contract by A to perform a certain act out of circumstances in which A has made it perfectly plain that he declinesto be under any contractual liability to perform that act. The defendants made it as clear as writing can make it in the ticket â¦that they would not take any responsibility for the safe custody of any car. One cannot infer, therefore, in those circumstancesthat the car was left in the car park for the purpose of being in the custody of the defendants.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In that case, the Court of Appeal held that there was no bailment and the relationship between a car park proprietor and car owner,on the facts of that case, was only licensor and licensee.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The taking of extra precaution by the Defendant in requiring the attendant to patrol once an hour (and in my view, that was theonly measure that could be regarded as security measure) could not and did not alter the contractual obligation undertaken by theDefendant towards the Claimant.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Neither does the provision in Clause 1(b) of the Parking Rules assist the Claimant.  That clause was plainly inserted <i>ex abundante cautela</i>.  It did not purport to re-define the primary legal obligation undertaken by the Defendant as regards the safe custody of cars parkedwithin the car-park.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Clause 7 laid down the requirement as to production of parking ticket.  This was referred to in Paragraph 22 of the judgment ofthe Adjudicator as the parking ticket system.  Mr Mak also relied on this clause to contend that the Defendant had obtained possessionof the car upon the issue of the parking ticket.  He submitted that it was a case of constructive possession although the key ofcar was retained by the Claimant.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  In the context of hourly parking, the production of a parking ticket was to facilitate the calculation of parking charges.  Thisis reasonably clear if one reads Clause 7(b) together with (d).  I could not accept that these provisions implicitly placed the carin the possession of the Defendant, constructive or otherwise.  All it said is that if the parking ticket could not be produced,the owner might be delayed in driving the car away pending reasonable inquiry.  It does not tantamount to the transfer of the possessionof the car from the car owner to the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I can readily think of several scenarios in which a car owner is prevented from driving his car away from a site or place whereit would be absurd to suggest that possession of his car has been transferred to others.  Take the case of vehicular ferry, in thecourse of crossing the harbour, even if the car owner has left his car and went to the passenger section of the ferry, I do not thinkanyone would suggest that he has parted with possession of his car.  Another instance is where a police officer stops a car in thestreet for investigation.  No-one would suggest that the possession of the car is transferred thereby to the police officer.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Of course, the factual circumstances are quite different.  However, there is a clear conceptual distinction between the transferof possession of a car to another and a restriction, whether physical or intangible, imposed on the car owner from driving his caraway.  In the present case, as mentioned above, there was no physical barrier to prevent the Claimant from driving the car away fromthe Defendantâs car park.  The restriction under Clause 7(b) was at most an intangible one.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Chui cited a number of cases to show that parking ticket system could not be conclusive in determining whether there was a bailment,see <i>Ashby v Tolhurst</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%202%20KB%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 2 KB 242</a>; <i>Fred Chappell Ltd v National Car Parks Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20Times%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) The Times, 22</a> May 1987; <i>BG Transport Service Ltd v Marston Motor Company Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 Ll Rep 371</a>; <i>Bata  v City Parking Canada Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%2043%20DLR%20%283d%29%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 43 DLR (3d) 190.</a></p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Counsel have in fact referred to a number of authorities and there is a detail discussion on the topic in <i>Palmer on Bailment,</i> 2<sup>nd</sup> Edn., pp.382 to 413.  I do not find it useful to go through each and every case and it is perhaps impossible to reconcile some ofthe cases.  It would also be futile to try to distil a single test from the cases.  The conclusion of <i>Palmer</i> at p.412 after surveying the cases is noteworthy,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAs the foregoing analysis has shown, one can rarely answer this question with complete certainty.  Certain features appear regularlyin the decisions but, taken overall, enjoy only a limited and variable significance.  Often, they are effective in establishing abailment only when combined with other factors not, in themselves, conclusive.  Consequently, the side of the line upon which a givencase may fall is largely intuitive ---- â a matter of impressionâ.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  A host of factors have been listed by <i>Palmer</i>.  The more pertinent ones seem to be the following,</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a)     transfer of the means of access to or control over the chattel: the ignition key;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(b)    procedures for recovery;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(c)     fees and charges;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(d)    physical geography: the layout of the car park;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(e)     proximity of the owner;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(f)     staffing;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(g)     purposes to which  possession a necessary incident;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>(h)     the terms of the ticket.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  From a legal point of view, <i>Palmer</i> identified the difference between bailment and licence as follows at p.382,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe law has repeatedly drawn a distinction between bailments and licences; the former requiring a transfer of possession and avoluntary acceptance of the common law duty of safekeeping, the latter amounting to no more than a grant of permission to the userof a chattel to leave it upon the licensorâs land on the understanding that neither possession shall be transferred nor responsibilityfor guarding the chattel accepted.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  For reasons given, in the light of the terms of the Parking rules, the physical layout of the Defendantâs car park, the quantumof the fees charged, I do not think the factors adverted to by the Adjudicator support a conclusion that the Defendant had assumedresponsibility for the safe custody of the car.  I also do not consider there had been any transfer of possession of the car by theClaimant to the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Although it is obvious that in dealing with a question of this nature, each case must depend on its own facts, I shall briefly commenton some of authorities cited.  Mr Mak placed strong reliance on <i>Always Win Ltd v Autofit Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20HKC%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 HKC 48.</a>  He properly acknowledged that the facts in the claim between the plaintiff and the defendant in that case were substantially differentfrom ours.  He however referred to the third party claim in that case.  The third party in that case was the manager of the buildingand responsible for management of the carpark in question.  After occurrences of car theft at the carpark, the third party implementedan in and out permit system to step up the security.  Cheung J (as he then was) found at p.67F to H that although the initial arrangementwas a mere licence, the third party assumed possession of the car by imposing the in and out permit system.  It is however importantto note Cheung Jâs rationale in so holding set out at p.67G to H,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThis measure [viz. the permit system] was no doubt implemented to prevent car theft â¦ This is the clearest indication that thethird party was assuming possession of the cars of the defendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In my judgment, that was a decision on the special facts of that case.  In contrast, I do not think the totality of the evidencebefore the Tribunal justifies any finding that by having Clause 7(b) in the Parking Rules, the Defendant assumed responsibility forthe safe custody or possession of the cars parked in its carpark.  That case cannot avail the Claimant.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mr Mak also relied on the passages in <i>Palmer</i> on procedures for recovery at p.391-2.  A number of Australian cases were cited there: <i>The Council of the City of Sydney v West</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20114%20CLR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) 114 CLR 481</a>; <i>Walton Stores Ltd v Sydney City Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%202%20NSWR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 2 NSWR 109</a>; <i>Walsh v Palladium Car Park</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20VR%20949" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] VR 949.</a>  I have read those cases.  Whilst the courts in those cases did place significance on the requirement as to the production of parkingticket as a prerequisite for removal of the car from the carpark in concluding the relationship between the parties before the courtwas a bailment, the terms in the parking tickets in those cases were quite different.  In particular, the tickets in those casesdid not clearly spell out, as in the present case, that the car park operator only gave a licence to the car owner to park withinthe car-park but did not undertake the safe custody of the car.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  On the other hand, the relevant terms and conditions in <i>Fred Chappell Ltd v National Car Parks Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20Times%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) The Times, 22</a> May 1987 (a Lexis copy was supplied by Mr Chui) are quite similar to those in the present case.  The physical layout of the carparkwas also similar.  However, the car owner paid the parking fees immediately after he parked the carpark.  There was a clause similarto Clause 7(b).  Deputy Judge Hamilton QC held that the relationship was a licence as opposed to bailment.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Ultimately, it is a question that must be decided by reference to the facts of the case and previous cases could only provide limitedguidance.  Although I agree with Mr Mak that this is a question that different judges may reasonably hold different views, I am ofthe clear view that the matters relied upon by the Adjudicator did not support his conclusion that this was a bailment situation. Hence, this court must examine the situation afresh to see whether a conclusion could be reached on the primary facts found by theAdjudicator.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I am satisfied that I have all the relevant facts before me and I have set out those in the earlier part of this judgment.  Thisis a case where this court can properly substitute its conclusion in accordance with the approach I set out in Para.37 of my judgmentin <i>Wong Man Kwan v Chun Shing Holdings Ltd</i>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKLRD%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 HKLRD 403.</a>  In my view, on such primary facts, the proper conclusion is that the relationship between the Claimant and the Defendant at thematerial time was licensee and licensor.  In other words, the Defendant did not undertake any responsibility for the safe custodyof the Defendantâs car.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  For this reason, the Defendant did not owe the Claimant any duty to prevent theft or damages to his car.  Due to the general principleset out in Paragraph 7 above, in the absence of any bailment, the fact that the Defendantâs attendant might have been carelessin performing his patrol duties and the loss occurred within the car park did not give the Claimant any right to claim against theDefendant.  The fundamental position remains that the Claimant parked his car there at his own risk.  In a way, there is no differencebetween parking at such a car park and parking at the street at parking space with meters.  Incidentally, the fees charged by theDefendant was in fact less than that for parking meters.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  The appeal must therefore be allowed and the award of the Adjudicator is set aside.  I will also dismiss the claim of the Claimant. As regards costs, I make an order nisi that the Claimant shall pay the Defendantâs costs of the appeal, such costs to be taxedif not agreed, and no order for costs as to the proceedings in the Tribunal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(M H Lam)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Bernard Mak, instructed by Messrs T S Tong &amp; Co., for the Claimant</p>        <p>Mr Alvin Chui, instructed by Messrs Hau, Lau, Li &amp; Yeung, for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2004/1021.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
