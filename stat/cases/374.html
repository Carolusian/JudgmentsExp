These I now give.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On 24 November 2004, Mr Jook, who is employed by SBI, sent an e-mail, using his employerâs e-mail system, to a Mr Yeap, in Singapore. Emperor learned of the e-mail, and considered that it was defamatory of them.  On 25 November 2004, Emperor issued a writ, witha general endorsement, alleging defamation by SBI and Mr Jook.  Unspecified damages, including exemplary damages, and an injunctionwere sought by way of relief.  A statement of claim was filed on 9 March 2005.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>   On 23 March 2005, SBI applied to stay the proceedings on the grounds of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, asserting that the proper forum was Singapore.  An identical application was made by Mr Jook on the same day.  In support of theapplications affidavits were filed by SBI and Mr Jook asserting that the only recipient of the e-mail was Mr Yeap in Singapore, andthat the e-mail was not sent to any other person or body in Hong Kong or Macau.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In an affidavit in response, Vanessa Fan, managing director of Emperor asserted:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âThe e-mail was distributed in Hong Kong to (among others) China Everbright Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd, which faxed to the Plaintiffthe copy of the e-mail, a copy of which is exhibit âVF-1â.</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Ms Fan did not, in that affidavit, condescend to particulars as to the circumstances in which China Everbright, or any others, apparentlyreceived a copy of the e-mail.  Despite a request for particulars as to those circumstances, none were supplied by Emperor.  Thismatter came on for hearing before Yam J on 24 August 2005.  The judge generously gave Emperor time to file an affidavit containingappropriate particulars.  An affidavit has been filed, but sensibly Mr Houghton did not rely on it as it took the matter no further. Ms Fan asserted that she had no knowledge as to how the e-mail came into the possession of China Everbright.  There is no explanationas to whether inquiries were made of China Everbright, nor why they have not made, or been asked to make, an affidavit setting outthe circumstances in which they received the e-mail. There is thus no evidential basis whatsoever to suggest that either SBI or MrJook were responsible for any re-publication in Hong Kong or Macau or elsewhere.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In her first affidavit Ms Fan asserted to being told of rumours in the market to the same effect as the e-mail.  The circumstancesof the rumours were referred to in her second affidavit, but that took those circumstances no further.  Having regard to the factthat the e-mail followed a publication in the China Morning Post of factual information referred to in the e-mail, it is not at allsurprising that there were rumours in the market.  However, again, there is no suggestion in the affidavit that those rumours werein any way attributable to either SBI or Mr Jook.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Emperor is a Hong Kong company.  Its business and corporate headquarters are in Hong Kong.  SBI is a Hong Kong company.  Mr Jooklives in Hong Kong.  The only evidence establishing publication of the e-mail is that it was published in Singapore.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The matter came before the Master on 15 July 2005, and an order was made staying the proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  From that decision Emperor now appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The starting point for any consideration of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is the judgement of Lord Goff in <i>Spilada Maritime  Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</i> [1987] 460 at 476-478, the principles in which have been applied in Hong Kong since <i>The Adhiguna Meranti</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 904</a>, CA.  These are the principles that I apply.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The law is equally clear that the jurisdiction in which a tort has been committed is prima facie the natural forum for the determinationof the dispute: <i>The Albaforth</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%2021%20Ll%20R%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 21 Ll.

I am satisfied that that is not a sufficient pointof distinction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  <i>Spilada</i> and <i>The Albaforth</i> have been reviewed recently in <i>Berezovsky</i>.  There, Lord Steyn drew attention to the general nature of the propositions in <i>Spilada</i>, and the practical issues considered in <i>The Albaforth</i>.  Commenting that in <i>Berezovsky</i> counsel accepted that he could not object to a proposition that the place where in substance the tort arises is a weighty factorpointing to the jurisdiction being the appropriate one, the House of Lords upheld the principle of law that the jurisdiction in whicha tort is committed is prima facie the natural forum for the determination of the dispute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  I am also assisted in this matter by the decision in <i>Rambas Marketing Co LLC v Chow</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%203%20HKC%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 3 HKC 250</a>, where Mr Recorder Ma, (as he then was), set out the three essential stages of the inquiry in forum non conveniens cases.

It is not without significance in relation to the present case that the following passage appearsin the headnote to the report of the decision of the Court of Appeal, ([1999] EMLR 278), which decision was upheld by the House ofLords:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td style="text-align:left" width="100%" valign="top" class="quote">âWhere there was no complaint of substance that a tort had been committed in England, either because the publication had only aninsignificant English circulation or because the plaintiff had no connection with, or reputation to protect in, this country, theplaintiff would fail to establish that English jurisdiction satisfied the Spilada test.â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  There is no evidence of publication of the allegedly offending words in Hong Kong by either SBI or Mr Jook.  The only evidence ofpublication is that there was a publication in Singapore.  The assertions in the statement of claim that:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>				<td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">4.1</td>				<td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">The e-mail was published via the Internet to Mr Jookâs primary addresses in Hong Kong, Macau and elsewhere (âpublicationâ).</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>				<td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote">4.2</td>				<td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">The e-mail was also re-published to persons to whom the e-mail was on-forwarded (electronically or otherwise) by the primary addressees(âre-publicationâ). â</td>			</tr>		</table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">are quite without any evidential basis whatsoever, except in so far as the expression âelsewhereâ necessarily includes Singapore. It is right that the burden is on the defendants as the applicant for a stay.  They discharge that burden by pointing to the statementof claim and showing that the e-mail was published only in Singapore.  As to re-publication there is no allegation of any act againstthem in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Emperor have had every opportunity to substantiate publication in Hong Kong or elsewhere other than Singapore, or re-publicationby either of the defendants, and have failed to do so.  Singapore is consequently, prima facie, the natural forum for the determinationof the dispute.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  I am satisfied that the answer to the stage 1 question is: Yes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Houghton did not assert as to the deprivation of any particular personal or juridical advantage that Emperor may suffer as aresult of the trial taking place in Singapore.  The suggestion was vaguely made that there was nothing to show that the SingaporeCourt would have jurisdiction in the matter.  I take judicial notice of the fact that the Singapore courts have jurisdiction in defamationand the discretion to issue injunctions.  Mr Houghton suggested there was nothing to show that the courts in Singapore might exercisea discretion in favour of Emperor.  It is sufficient that I am satisfied that the discretion exists.  How the courts in Singaporeexercise that discretion is entirely a matter for them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  I am satisfied that the answer to the stage 2 questions is: No.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It is accordingly not necessary to proceed to the stage 3 question.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I have however, viewed the matter broadly with a view to doing substantial justice for Emperor.  Singapore being another availableforum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, a stay will ordinarily be granted unless there arecircumstances, by reason of which, justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I have listened carefully to everything said on the part of Emperor, and I am satisfied that there are no special circumstancesby reason of which justice requires that the trial should nevertheless take place in Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The judgement of the Master was plainly correct.  The appeal is dismissed. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr Houghton did not oppose an application by both defendants for costs to be taxed on a party and party basis if not agreed.
