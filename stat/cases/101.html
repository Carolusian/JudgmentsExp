TheHong Kong Housing Authority, a statutory body established in 1973 under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/283" class="autolink_findacts">Housing Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/283">Cap. 283</a>), has been given the unenviable task and duty of securing the provision of housing and ancillary amenities to the generalpublic of Hong Kong, particularly those belonging to the lower or lower-middle class of the society.  Demands are great and varied,and resources limited.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Apart from the provision of public rental housing in the form of public housing estates which houses approximately 2 million people,the Housing Authority has since 1977 implemented the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS), which was designed to enable lower-middle incomefamilies and public housing tenants to become home-owners.  Flats built by the Housing Authority were offered to them for purchaseat affordable prices set at a discount from the market values of comparable units in developments developed by the private sector.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Since about 1978, HOS was supplemented by the Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS).  PSPS was a scheme similar to HOS butwith the involvement of private sector developers.  The idea was to draw on private sector resources and experiences in the constructionand sale of flats.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Since then, HOS and PSPS have served as the main vehicles of the Housing Authority in providing affordable means for the lower-middleincome households to purchase their own flats.  The flats were offered for sale in phases.  In each phase of sale, invariably demandexceeded supply and phase after phase, a substantial over-subscription was recorded in the sale of HOS and PSPS flats.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Under both HOS and PSPS, applicants were divided into âgreen formâ and âwhite formâ applicants.  Basically, green form applicantswere those who were domestic tenants in public rental housing estates of the Housing Authority and the Housing Society or authorisedresidents in temporary housing areas and cottage areas managed by the Housing Authority or prospective public rental housing tenantswho held valid green form certificates.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  All other applicants made their applications by standard âwhite formsâ prepared and provided by the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Over the years, details of the eligibility requirements of the applicants have changed from time to time to meet the changing needsand demands of the society.  However, the objective has always been to enable lower-middle income households to purchase their ownflats at affordable prices.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  According to the evidence that I accept, up to and including Phase 8A in 1985, as provided in the green forms and white forms, apurchaser selected by the Housing Authority was required to pay a deposit equivalent to 10% of the purchase price of the unit.  FromPhase 8B in 1986 onwards, the green form purchasers and white form purchasers selected by the Housing Authority were require to payto the Housing Authority 5% and 10% of the purchase prices of the units respectively as deposits.  Furthermore, since Phase 13C inabout 1991, the forms had always contained a provision to the effect that the purchaser could withdraw from the purchase prior topayment of the balance purchase price and assignment, subject to the forfeiture of part or the whole of the deposit paid.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In a PSPS project, the Government invited tenders from private developers for the issue of a land grant in the form of a conditionsof sale in respect of the relevant site.  The successful bidder paid the Government a premium for the land for development and undertookunder the conditions of sale to develop the particular PSPS project on terms set out in the conditions of sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Essentially, since 1986 the conditions of sale required the developer to only sell the completed residential flats to those purchasers(called home-owners) to be nominated by the Housing Authority.  If the purchaser failed to sign the formal sale and purchase agreementwith the developer after the nomination or failed to pay the balance purchase price and complete the sale and purchase with the developer,the conditions provided that the Housing Authority would re-nominate a new purchaser to take up the flat.  The conditions also providedthat in case the flats could not be sold within a stipulated period of time, the Housing Authority would buy back the flats.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  An important condition in the conditions of sale was that the developer would only receive proceeds of sale of the residential flatscalculated at a fixed yet guaranteed rate ($X per square metre of saleable area), regardless of the actual prices of sale to thehome-owners which were to be fixed by the Housing Authority.  In case of buyback, the same fixed rate would be used to calculatethe buyback price.  It should be noted at the outset that the above arrangement was set out in the conditions of sale, a documentexecuted between the Government and the private developer.  The Housing Authority was not a party to the conditions of sale.  Indeedit should be noted that, rather surprisingly, under a PSPS scheme, the Housing Authority and the private developer did not sign anyformal document as such to set out their mutual rights and obligations under the PSPS project (leaving aside for the time being theconveyancing minutes and notes to be mentioned later).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Housing Authority offered the residential flats constructed under a PSPS project for sale to eligible members of the public(the green form and white form applicants) by phases.  Sometimes a phase of sale would only include HOS flats from one or more thanone project.  Sometimes, a phase would include both HOS and PSPS flats from different projects.  As mentioned, demand was alwaysso great that invariably there was an over subscription.  Ballots had to be drawn in order to determine the eligible applicantsâpriority.  Because of the discounted prices and other attractions and the resulting keen competition, successful applicants, in thewords of one witness, often felt like a âmark-six winnerâ.  A successful applicant had to pay a nomination fee and sign a nominationagreement and a declaration with the Housing Authority.  The Housing Authority would then formally nominate the successful applicantas a home-owner to sign the formal sale and purchase agreement with the PSPS developer.  As between the developer and the home-owner,the nomination fee also served as the deposit paid under the formal agreement.  The balance purchase price was payable upon completionto the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  For obvious reasons, prior to the events forming the subject matter of this litigation, the âdrop-outâ rate of these successfulapplicants was relatively small.  In case of withdrawal, the Housing Authority would re-nominate another purchaser to sign the formalsale and purchase agreement with the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Again for obvious reasons, until the events forming the subject of this litigation, there was never ever an occasion when a PSPSflat could not be resold and the Housing Authority had to buy back the flat at the guaranteed rate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Under the conditions of sale, any surplus in proceeds of sale over the guaranteed price payable to the developer would go to theHousing Authority, whereas any deficiency would be borne and made up by the Housing Authority to the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Because of the differences between the prices at which the units were sold to the public and the prices which the PSPS developerwas entitled to receive from the project based on the guaranteed unit rate, and because of the fact that the purchasers were allnominated by the Housing Authority to which each of the purchasers paid a nomination fee equivalent to 5% or 10% of the purchaseprice, which was then regarded as the deposit paid under the formal sale and purchase agreement when it was signed pursuant to thenomination, there were quite elaborate provisions agreed between the Housing Authority and the developer in the form of conveyancingminutes or notes, dealing with the transfer of monies between the two and the final reconciliation account.  There were further provisionsand arrangements dealing with re-nomination where the entire process of nomination, payment of nomination fee, and signing a formalsale and purchase agreement was repeated.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  According to the evidence, at least as from 1988, the Housing Authority did not transfer the whole of the nomination fees receivedfrom the selected home-owners to the developer; instead, <i>pro rata</i> amounts, based on the same proportion between the guaranteed unit price and the average unit selling price, would be remitted tothe developer upon signing of the agreements for sale and purchase.  The Housing Authority would retain the remaining portion.  Allthis was a matter of administrative convenience only.  The accounts would be reconciled and squared at the end of the day after completionof the project, based on the guaranteed unit price.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Charming Garden â a PSPS project</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Chevalier group of companies had extensive experience in PSPS projects.  Through different wholly owned subsidiary companies,the group had participated as developers in no less than seven PSPS projects between mid-1980s and mid-1990s.  In October 1995, theChevalier group, through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Oriental Sharp Limited, the plaintiff in this action, submitted atender for the grant of Kowloon Inland Lot No. 11082 in Area 20, Mongkok West, Kowloon, a PSPS project.  The bid was successful andon 15 April 1996, the relevant Conditions of Sale was executed between the Government and the plaintiff for the grant of the landfor development as a PSPS project.  The development was subsequently named Charming Garden.  The guaranteed unit rate stipulatedin the Conditions of Sale was $15,000 per square metre.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Apart from the residential units which had to be sold as PSPS flats, the development also comprised commercial premises, car-parkingspaces and a kindergarten which were to be built and sold by the developer as private development.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Charming Garden involved 3,908 residential flats, of over 195,000 square metres in total area.  2,648 units in Charming Garden PhaseI were launched for sale under Phase 19A in June 1997 while 1,260 units in Charming Garden Phase II were made available for saleunder Phase 19B in October 1997. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In fact, there was another PSPS project involving the Chevalier group as private developer, known as Beverly Garden, which was puton sale in the same phases as Charming Garden.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Once again there were over subscriptions in the two phases, 10 times in Phase 19A and 8 times in Phase 19B.  Following standardprocedure, starting from July 1997, the Housing Authority made a total of 3,908 nominations, out of which 2,648 nominations weremade under Phase 19A and the remaining 1,260 nominations were made under Phase 19B. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Events leading to litigation</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Then a series of events happened that led, or are said to lead, to mass withdrawals of the nominated home-owners from the purchasesand cancellations of the nominations or signed sale and purchase agreements.  A huge amount of nomination fees or deposits paid inrespect of the nominations or the relevant sale and purchase agreements, totalling over $150 million, was involved in these withdrawal/cancellationcases.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  These events included:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(1)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The announcement by the then Chief Executive in his first policy speech on 8 October 1997 that the Government would implement a newhousing policy in which 85,000 residential units per year would be provided by public and private sectors to members of the society. It was further stated in the policy address that the aim was to achieve a home ownership rate of 70% in 10 years.  The Governmentintended to make available the first batch of about 25,000 public rental housing flats for sale by 1998.  This would involve a hugeincrease in the supply of public housing.  It has been said in evidence that the announcement sent âshock wavesâ in the propertymarket and that it was âwidely believedâ in the property market that they âgreatly contributed to the crash of the Hong Kongproperty marketâ shortly thereafter. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(2)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">The onset of the Asian financial crisis in late October 1997.

In short, the flexible discount rates made the discounts given by the Housing Authority to a buyer of flat in terms of the purchaseprice more reflective of the actual market value at the time of purchase for that individual flat purchaser.  In February 1998, theHousing Authority implemented a new flexible discount rate policy for units to be sold under HOS and PSPS as well, whereby a purchaserin future could choose within a range of different discount rates for the purchase price of his unit.  The new policy, announcedon 9 February 1998, did not have any retrospective effect and was not applicable to purchasers of units in previous phases, includingPhases 19A and 19B under which Charming Garden was initially launched for sale, or where an agreement for sale and purchase had alreadybeen signed. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="5%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">(7)</td>                <td width="95%" valign="top" style="text-align:left">According to some newspaper reports, which the plaintiff relies on, the Housing Authority also represented or announced in February1998 that purchasers of HOS or PSPS flats, who were holders of green form certificates awaiting allocation of public rental housing,would be allowed to retain their priority in the Housing Authority public rental housing allocation system even if they did not completethe sale and purchase of their HOS or PSPS units, notwithstanding previous policy to the contrary.  This alleged change in policywas denied by the Housing Authority at trial. </td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In about October 1997, the Housing Authority started receiving applications for withdrawal from nominations or agreements from nominatedhome-owners.  They comprised those who had not yet signed formal agreements for sale and purchase as well as those who had alreadysigned such agreements in respect of units in Charming Garden.  The number of applications for withdrawal increased significantlyin early 1998.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Many purchasers of residential units in Charming Garden as well as other HOS/PSPS projects, who had yet to complete their sale andpurchase, took steps to pressurise the Government and Housing Authority to allow them to pull out of their deals.  There were demonstrationsand petitions.  They were assisted by politicians and grass root organisations.  It cannot be doubted that a major reason for theiractions was the sharp downturn in economy, the slump of the stock market and the significant drop in property prices starting sincelate October 1997.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  According to evidence, purchasers of 946 residential units in Charming Garden, who were originally nominated by the Housing Authorityto purchase those residential units, decided to withdraw from the purchases after signing the relevant agreements for sale and purchase(a total of 3,488 agreements had been signed out of 3,908 nominations).  849 of them were green form purchasers.  28 of them participatedin TPS subsequently and had 5% of the purchase prices paid as deposits refunded by the Housing Authority in full.  The rest of themhad their deposits forfeited.  The remaining 97 units involved white form purchasers.  The Housing Authority approved their applicationsfor withdrawal and they signed cancellation agreements with the plaintiff.  The Housing Authority forfeited 5% of the purchase pricesand refunded the remaining 5% purchase prices to these purchasers, which they paid by way of nomination fees to the Housing Authoritywhen they signed the nomination agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The withdrawals were effected by cancellation agreements signed between the developer and the purchasers.  The reason for signingthe cancellation agreements, all sides agreed, was to facilitate the early re-nomination of new buyers and resale of the flats. Without signing the cancellation agreements, the developer would have to wait until the contractual time fixed for completion beforeit could take steps to formally rescind the agreements after serving notices on the defaulting purchasers.  That would greatly delaythe re-nomination process and resale of the flats concerned, particularly bearing in mind that PSPS flats were only sold by the HousingAuthority in batches in one or more phases of sale, but not individually.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The Housing Authority made re-nominations for 904 units after the unsold flats were offered for resale in Phases 19C and 20A.  Nore-nomination was made by the Housing Authority for the remaining 42 units, as there were no purchasers of those units in the subsequenttwo phases.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Apart from the 946 cases, there were another 420 cases which the plaintiff also complains about, where purchasers of residentialunits in Charming Garden who were originally nominated by the Housing Authority decided to withdraw from the purchases without signingthe agreements for sale and purchase.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  There were purchasers of 62 units who subsequently participated in TPS.  Each of them obtained a full refund of the 5% purchaseprice which had been paid as deposit.  There were another 341 units involving green form purchasers who did not participate in TPS. Their deposits (5% of the purchase prices) were forfeited by the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The remaining 17 units involved white form purchasers.  Each of them had 5% of the purchase price forfeited and the remaining 5%purchase price refunded by the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  The Housing Authority made re-nominations for 402 units after the unsold units were offered for resale in Phases 19C and 20A.  Nore-nomination was made by Housing Authority for the remaining 18 units as no purchasers could be found.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  In fact, apart from these 420 cases, there were another 5 cases not referred to by the plaintiff in this action which also concernedpurchasers who failed to sign the formal sale and purchase agreements after having been nominated by the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  There were purchasers of 36 residential units who, without prior notification or application, simply did not proceed to completetheir purchases after signing the agreements for sale and purchase, after the times for completion had arrived.  All but one of themwere green form purchasers.  Their deposits â 5% of the purchase prices for the green form purchasers and 10% for the single whiteform purchaser â were forfeited.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  The Housing Authority made re-nominations for 34 units which were resold under Phases 19C and 20A.  Two units remained unsold asno purchasers could be found.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Due to the downturn in the property market, when these flats were offered for resale in the subsequent two phases, the Housing Authorityfixed lower prices.  However, this did not affect the amounts of purchase price received by the plaintiff as developer.  This wasbecause the purchase prices received by the developer were calculated at the guaranteed unit rate of $15,000 per square metre, ashad been expressly stipulated in the Conditions of Sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Moreover, for those flats which could not be resold because no new purchasers could be found within the time stipulated in the Conditionsof Sale, they were bought back by the Housing Authority at the guaranteed unit rate of $15,000 per square metre.  Altogether therewere a total of 62 units involved in the buyback. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The total purchase prices of all the residential units in Charming Garden receivable by the plaintiff, calculated at the guaranteedunit rate of $15,000 per square metre, exceeded $2.9 billion.  As a matter of fact, the plaintiff did receive the guaranteed $2.9billion odd from the sale of the flats to home-owners/buyback of the unsold units by the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Plaintiffâs claim</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In this action, the gist of the plaintiffâs claim against the Housing Authority relates to the forfeited nomination fees/deposits. What actually happened at the end of the day was that the Housing Authority kept, in effect, all the nomination fees/deposits forfeitedin all the withdrawal/non-completion cases, save and except those cases involving green form purchasers who subsequently took partin TPS, and cases involving white form purchasers who all had half of the 10% purchase prices paid as nomination fees refunded tothem upon signing the relevant cancellation agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The plaintiff contends that under the terms of the Conditions of Sale to which the Housing Authority was a âjoint contractorâ(so the plaintiff contends in pleadings), the plaintiff is entitled to the forfeited nomination fees/deposits (including those moniessubsequently refunded to the home-owners).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Alternatively, the plaintiff argues that the Housing Authority is a trustee or fiduciary agent for the plaintiff in respect of thenomination fees/deposits, and it is under a fiduciary duty to account the same to the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Further or alternatively, the plaintiff says that there were various implied terms in the Conditions of Sale, and both the Governmentand the Housing Authority have acted in breach of those terms âby communicating pressure or persuasion or otherwise inciting, encouragingor procuring the 946 purchasers of units in Charming Garden not to complete their purchases, and/or had dealings with the said purchaserswhich the [Housing Authority] knew were inconsistent with the Plaintiffâs [agreements for sale and purchase with the purchasers]â(para. 27(1)(i) of the amended statement of claim), thereby causing loss and damage to the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Similar claims are made in respect of the 420 cases and 36 cases mentioned above.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Alternatively, the plaintiff contends that the Housing Authority is guilty of unlawful interference with the agreements for saleand purchase between the developer and the 946 home-owners.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  The plaintiff also complains that, apart from the loss of the forfeited deposits, the withdrawal and re-nomination process and theresulting delay caused it loss in terms of increases in interest charges, management fees, Government rates and rents and other outgoings,which were all borne by the developer.  Delay in selling the residential flats also caused, it has been suggested, a correspondingdelay in selling the car-parking spaces in Charming Garden.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The Government is likewise said to have breached the implied terms in the Conditions of Sale.  Further, the plaintiff claims thatthe Housing Authority has acted as the Governmentâs âagentâ in the material events and transactions, and the Government istherefore âvicariously liableâ for the Housing Authorityâs wrong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Trial on liability only</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  By an earlier order given by a master, the trial, which lasted 11 days, was only concerned with liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Special conditions 24 &amp; 26</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Although the Conditions of Sale, in the nature of a Government grant, was only executed between the Government and the plaintiffas developer, it is common ground between all parties that the relationship of the plaintiff and the Housing Authority is also governedby the relevant terms and conditions in the Conditions of Sale.  In particular, it is common ground that special conditions 24 and26 of the Conditions of Sale govern, as a matter of contract, the relationship between the plaintiff and the Housing Authority, althoughthe parties differ on how that contractual relationship arose.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Before I deal with that question, it is necessary to set out the two rather lengthy special conditions.

She submitted that the modern approach of the courts is to see whether on the totalityof the evidence, viewed objectively, the parties have intended that the substance of the collateral contract should form part ofthe basis of the legal relationship between them: <i>Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd v. Fung Chin Kan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%201%20HKLRD%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 1 HKLRD 181</a>, 198-199, paras. 55-57 (per Litton NPJ).  She submitted that the earliest time when the collateral contract was made between theHousing Authority and the developer would be the time when the Government accepted the developerâs tender and granted the landto the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Leading counsel elaborated that on the part of the developer, when tendering for the land, it knew full well that it was tenderingfor the land for a PSPS project to be administered by the Housing Authority.  This was plain from the terms of the tender noticeand conditions of sale, which the developer must have studied carefully before putting in the tender.  On the evidence, includingthe oral evidence given by Mr Lo Siu Hon, formerly manager of the property division of the Chevalier group in charge of the CharmingGarden project and many previous PSPS projects of the group, the plaintiff well knew that it was tendering for a PSPS project.  Asdiscussed above, the Conditions of Sale contained typical PSPS provisions regarding restriction on sale, nomination, re-nomination,buyback, the guaranteed unit price and so forth.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  On the part of the Housing Authority, there can be no dispute, particularly on the oral evidence given by Ms Yu Yan Oi, senior estatesurveyor of the Housing Department and Ms Ting Wan Sin, formerly of the Home Ownership Centre running PSPS as well as HOS projects,that the Charming Garden project was a PSPS project, and through the tender and land grant procedures administered by the Government,the Housing Authority invited private developers to participate in the particular PSPS project.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Furthermore, it is common ground that both sides intended to create a binding legal relationship between them in relation to thePSPS project.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Ms Eu therefore submitted that when the Government accepted the developerâs tender and granted the land to the developer, theHousing Authority, whether by holding out or by acting through the Government, must have undertaken the obligations and contingentliability under special conditions 24 and 26 towards the developer to make nomination of home-owners, to buy back any unsold flatsand to see that the developer would get its remuneration for the flats at the guaranteed unit rate of $15,000 per square metre ofsaleable area of the flats.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Alternatively, Ms Eu submitted that what the parties did <i>after</i> the grant of land to the developer would give rise to a collateral contract between the Housing Authority and the developer, suchas by making the agreement as evidenced by the conveyancing minutes and conveyancing notes, by the parties jointly putting up theflats for sale under PSPS, by the Housing Authority nominating home-owners to p4rchase the flats and by the developer selling theflats to the home-owners nominated by the Housing Authority under PSPS.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Indeed, collateral contract is also an alternative basis on which the plaintiff argues that there was a contractual relationshipbetween itself and the Housing Authority.  As mentioned earlier, the primary basis, at least on pleadings, of the plaintiff is thatthe Housing Authority was a âjoint contractorâ in the Conditions of Sale.  But to be fair to Mr John Griffiths SC, Mr C W Lingwith him, representing the plaintiff at trial, by the time of final submission, his main contention on this aspect of the case wasalso that there was a collateral contract between the two parties.  Mr Griffiths argued that the collateral contract should havebeen formed at the time when the Government accepted the plaintiffâs tender and granted the land to the plaintiff.  He submittedthat that was much more consistent with the evidence given than the alternative case of Ms Eu, i.e. that the collateral contractwas only formed subsequently after the execution of the Conditions of Sale, by reason of the partiesâ conduct in implementing thePSPS project.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â My view â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  I agree with Ms Euâs primary analysis of the legal position.  In other words, I find that viewed objectively, the evidence asa whole pointed to the formation and existence of a collateral contract between the Housing Authority and the plaintiff.  As regardsthe time of formation of contract, I agree with Mr Griffiths that the evidence supported the formation of a contract at the timewhen the Government granted the land to the developer.  This was also Ms Euâs primary submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  As regards the suggestion that the Housing Authority was a joint contractor under the Conditions of Sale, I do not find the contentionattractive at all.  For one thing, the Conditions of Sale did not say that the Housing Authority was a joint contractor.  The partieswere expressly stated to be the Government and the developer only.  Secondly, under the PSPS project and the Conditions of Sale,the Housing Authority and the Government had very different roles to perform.  At least under the Conditions of Sale, the role ofthe Housing Authority was very limited.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In short, I do not think the analysis that the Housing Authority was a joint contractor fits well with the facts and evidence atall.  I reject the argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Having said all this, I must put the above discussion in context.  As has been mentioned more than once, it is common ground thatthere was a contractual relationship between the developer and the Housing Authority, and special conditions 24 and 26 were bindingon the two of them as a matter of contract.  Apart from arguments over implied terms and the conveyancing minutes/conveyancing notes,and leaving aside the question of factual matrix for the time being, it was not suggested by any party that there were any othermaterial contractual provisions or terms governing the relationship between the two parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  In those circumstances, the mode and manner in which the accepted contractual relationship between the Housing Authority and thedeveloper came into being is, in a significant sense, rather academic.  As will be seen, the question does not really play any materialpart in resolving the crucial differences between the parties.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â Formality requirement â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  A second point to note, before I move on to the next topic, is this.  Although Mr Griffiths briefly mentioned in final submissionthe formality requirement in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219">Cap. 219</a>) and the fact that part of the contents of the collateral contract between the Housing Authority and the developer affectedland (such as the buyback provisions), no party pleaded or took any point on the enforceability of the terms of the collateral contractfor want of evidence in writing.  No such issue arose.  In those circumstances, I need mention it no more.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Principles of construction</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  I now turn to the construction of the two special conditions with a view to resolving the partiesâ differences regarding who wasentitled to the forfeited deposits following the massive withdrawals by the nominated home-owners from the Charming Garden projectand other related questions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The general legal principles on construction of contract were not in dispute.  Indeed both the Housing Authority and the plaintiffurged the Court to take into account and pay special attention to the factual matrix of the case in construing the special conditions,in determining whether there were implied terms as contended for by the plaintiff and in deciding the legal status, if any, of theconveyancing minutes/conveyancing notes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Leading modern cases on interpretation of contracts, including <i>Prenn v.

However, beyond that, the plaintiff was most hostile to the Housing Authorityâsattempt to âimportâ the policies and practices of the present and previous PSPS projects, including the use of the green andwhite forms, sale brochures, nomination agreements, declarations, conveyancing minutes and notes and so forth, as part of the factualmatrix.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â Housing Authorityâs contention â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  In this regard, I think Mr John Griffiths had over-put the Housing Authorityâs real case in his closing submission â para. 25â i.e. that the Housing Authority was attempting to import all these matters as terms into the collateral contract.  I think allMs Eu tried to do was to argue that they were relevant and indeed formed an important part of the factual matrix that the Court mustconsider.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  It is true that at one stage of her final submission, particularly bearing in mind paragraph 17 of her written closing submission,Ms Eu appeared to argue that the respective rights and obligations of the Housing Authority and developer were clear not only fromconditions 24 and 26 of the Conditions of Sale, but also from the past policies and practices of PSPS and the conveyancing minutes/conveyancingnotes.  However, as Ms Eu developed her argument, it was apparent to me â if I have not misunderstood her ultimate position âthat she restricted herself exclusively to conditions 24 and 26 of the Conditions of Sale as containing the relevant contractualterms for the determination of the entitlement to the forfeited deposits.  As far as the policies and practices of PSPS and the conveyancingminutes/notes were concerned, important though they were, they merely formed part of the factual matrix that the Court should takeinto account in construing the relevant terms in the Conditions of Sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In any event, even if I am wrong in understanding counselâs submission, it will be seen in due course in this judgment that thisdistinction does not really matter at the end of the day.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  Instead of going into all these policies and past practices in general â and in this regard, the oral evidence called dealt within great detail these past practices and policies as well as the forms, agreements, sale brochures, conveyancing minutes and notesused, it would be more fruitful to concentrate on what Ms Eu tried to extract from all this and the counter position of Mr Griffiths.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  In essence, Ms Euâs objective in referring to the policies and practices of the present and past PSPS projects was to establishtwo main points.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  First, it has always been the case in PSPS (and indeed in HOS) that home-owners could not be forced to complete their purchasesand they could always withdraw from their purchases at any time after nomination but before completion, subject to forfeiture ofnomination fees â at the time of sale of the Charming Garden flats at an amount equivalent to 5% of the purchase price.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Secondly and to a lesser extent, Ms Eu sought to extract from the past policies and practices the proposition that under PSPS, theforfeited deposits always went to the Housing Authority, but not the developers, save with one exception (the Kornhill MTR project)where the special provisions in the relevant Government grant dictated a different result.  I should point out immediately, in relationto this second point, that Ms Eu accepted in her oral final submission that this latter point turned more on the proper constructionof special conditions 24 and 26 rather than on the past policies and practices of PSPS.  I will come back to this in due course butdeal with the first point now.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â Home-ownersâ right to âopt outâ prior to completion â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  An important part of the factual matrix, Ms Eu submitted, was the home-ownersâ right to withdraw or âopt outâ after nomination(but before completion).  She contended from the evidence adduced that such had always been the case since the launch of PSPS.  Forthat purpose, oral evidence was called and voluminous documents concerning past PSPS projects were adduced as evidence to prove counselâspoint.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  A convenient starting point is the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/283" class="autolink_findacts">Housing Ordinance</a>, which by its schedule restricts the resale of HOS/PSPS flats and provides for the buyback of those flats by the Housing Authorityfrom a home-owner within the first few years of the original purchase.  Basically, the resale restrictions in the schedule requirethat within a certain period (currently 5 years) after a HOS/PSPS flat has first been sold, the purchaser who no longer wants hisflat must offer to assign the flat back to the Housing Authority at a certain price, namely (a) during the first few years (currentlybeing the first two years), at the original purchase price; and (b) during another few years thereafter (currently being the thirdto fifth years), at a price to be assessed by the Director of Housing.  Only if the Housing Authority should decline the offer couldthe purchaser otherwise re-sell the flat in the open market subject to payment of a premium.  Since June 1997, a purchaser may duringthe period, instead of offering to assign the flat back to the Housing Authority, offer the flat for sale in the HOS secondary marketto those otherwise eligible for purchasing HOS/PSPS flats without payment of a premium.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  According to the evidence, which I have no difficulty accepting, HOS and PSPS housing are a form of subsidised housing.  If a particularhome-owner no longer wishes to retain a flat, it is in the interest of the Housing Authority as well as the home-owner for the home-ownerto return the flat to the Housing Authority at the original price, so that the flat can be made available by the Housing Authorityto another person in need of housing provision.  On the other hand, the restriction on the home-owner to only resell the flat tothe Housing Authority within the initial few years would ensure that the flat is not acquired for any speculative purpose and willonly be occupied by the targeted classes of people for whom the flats were constructed in the first place.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  To the Housing Authority, it was important that the HOS/PSPS flats would end up not only with those for whom they were developed,but also with those who really wanted them as their homes.  That was why when purchasers of HOS/PSPS flats offered to return theirflats back to the Housing Authority shortly after the flats had been assigned to them, the Housing Authority, in practice, wouldalways accept the offer and take up the assignment, and then put up the flat for re-sale in the subsequent phases of HOS/PSPS.  Thatwould ensure that ultimately, the flats would end up with those users who were eligible for HOS/PSPS flats and who genuinely wantedthe flats as their homes.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  From the perspective of the purchaser, the result would be that shortly after the purchase had been completed, he could withdrawfrom the purchase and assign the flat back to the Housing Authority.  If the purchaser did so shortly after the flat had been assignedto him, he would not suffer any loss on the price of the flat (even in a falling market), as the Housing Authority was required toaccept the assignment back at the same price, although he would probably incur some losses, such as expenses payable by him underthe Ordinance and legal costs or bank charges.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  According to the evidence that I accept, in practice, the Housing Authority has always accepted all offers to assign back unwantedflats shortly after they were taken up by purchasers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  That being the case, according to the evidence, the same logic applies even to the pre-assignment stage.  In other words, even beforethe completion of sale and purchase, if, for whatever reason, a nominated home-owner did not want to proceed with the transactionand take up the flat, he was allowed to withdraw from the nomination and give up the flat, so that the Housing Authority could offerthe same flat to another person in need of housing.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  According to the evidence, it has always been the policy and practice of the Housing Authority to allow purchasers to withdraw fromtheir purchases even before completing the transactions, but with part of or the whole of the deposits or nomination fees paid forfeitedto the Housing Authority.  To hold the purchasers who no longer wanted the flats to their contracts until after completion time hadarrived would only serve to delay the re-sale of the flats and cause unnecessary conveyancing expenses and mortgage charges.  Itwould not do the Housing Authority, the purchasers or the PSPS developer any good.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  That, in essence, was the rationale behind the rule that allowed a nominated home-owner to withdraw from the transaction after nominationbut before completion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  However, also according to the evidence, to discourage people from applying for HOS or PSPS flats without serious thinking and withdrawingfrom successful applications/nominations afterwards, a nomination fee was required to be paid upon signing the nomination agreement(which would become the deposit under the agreement for sale and purchase), and in case of withdrawal, the nomination fee or a partof it would be forfeited or retained by the Housing Authority as administration fee (leaving aside the question of who, as betweenthe Housing Authority and the developer, would be entitled to the forfeited or retained nomination fee/deposit, for the time being). In earlier years, the amount of nomination fee/deposit forfeited/retained used to be 50% of the nomination fee.  In latter years(i.e. since Phase 17B in 1995), the amount of forfeiture was 5% of the purchase price.  In other words, white form applicants, whohad to pay a 10% nomination fee would have 5% forfeited and the remaining 5% returned to them if they should withdraw; whereas forgreen form applicants, who only had to pay a 5% nomination fee, the whole nomination fee would be forfeited if they should withdraw.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  That this was the position throughout was well borne out by the green forms and white forms used over the years, the previous nominationagreements and declarations, and the past practices of the Housing Authority in dealing with applications to withdraw.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  According to the evidence, the Housing Authority invariably accepted applications to withdraw from nominations, and in most casesthe nomination fees or a part of them would be forfeited, whereas when compassionate grounds existed or hardship was demonstrated,the Housing Authority would waive forfeiture.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  It is true that over the years, the exact wordings used in these documents and forms did change slightly.  But the essence remainedthe same.  The Housing Authority did allow applicants to withdraw from nominations subject to forfeiture of the nomination fees orpart of them, and when compassionate grounds or hardship could be demonstrated, the Housing Authority would waive forfeiture.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Indeed the sale brochure prepared by the plaintiff for Charming Garden, the contents of which were approved by the Housing Authority,provided expressly that if a home-owner did not complete the purchase after nomination, the nomination would be cancelled and theHousing Authority would forfeit 5% of the purchase price out of the nomination fee.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  It is also noteworthy that so far as the previous PSPS projects which the Chevalier group was involved in are concerned, which startedin 1985 with Chevalier Garden sold under Phases 8C and 9B, there were 331 cases in total in which home-owners, after nomination,did not complete the sale and purchase.  Out of them, there were 177 cases which involved the home-ownersâ withdrawing after signingthe formal sale and purchase agreements.  In all those cases, cancellation agreements were subsequently signed.  Over $14 millionwas involved by way of nomination fees/deposits.  Out of it, about $7.5 million was forfeited.  The forfeited monies all went tothe Housing Authority, rather than the relevant developers.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>   It is true that the Housing Authority, in the application forms for withdrawal, did ask the withdrawing home-owners the reasonsfor their decisions.  But according to the evidence which I accept, this was merely done for the purpose of information collection. Invariably, according to the evidence, the Housing Authority would approve the applications for withdrawal.  In hardship cases,the Housing Authority would also waive the forfeiture of deposits.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Despite suggestion to the contrary, I have no difficulty in finding, on the documentary as well as oral evidence adduced at trial,that in PSPS projects, home-owners were always allowed to withdraw from nominations subject to forfeiture of part or whole of thenomination fees.  They would not be forced to complete the sale and purchase â indeed that would be quite meaningless because immediatelyafter completion, the purchasers would have the right, as provided in the schedule to the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/283" class="autolink_findacts">Housing Ordinance</a>, to resell the flats at the same prices to the Housing Authority.  In particular, I have no difficulty in accepting in entirety theoral evidence given by the Housing Authorityâs witnesses on how PSPS projects were operated in the past.  Documents such as thegreen forms and white forms were documents printed in large number and freely available to the general public.  Whilst I accept theplaintiffâs witnessesâ evidence that they had no say in the wordings of those forms, there can be no doubt that the Chevaliergroup, as an experienced PSPS developer, must have been fully aware that under those forms, the home-owners were allowed to withdrawfrom the nominations subject to forfeiture of the nomination fees.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Ms Eu submitted, and I agree, that the different provisions in the agreements for sale and purchase signed by the nominated home-ownerswith the developer, which provided for the forfeiture of the entire deposit and did not specifically exclude specific performanceagainst the purchaser, did not contradict the proposition that the home-owners had a right to withdraw subject to forfeiture of deposits. It is true that the formal agreements for sale and purchase were based on a pro forma agreement approved by the Director of Lands. However, it is important to note that there was no entire agreement clause in the formal agreement.  In particular, it did not saythat it superseded any representations or promises made by the developer in the sale brochure.  Nor did it supersede or replace anyrepresentations or promises made in the green forms or white forms prepared by the Housing Authority.  The sale brochure was printedby the developer and distributed to the potential buyers.  In the absence of an entire agreement clause in the formal agreement,the same must be read subject to or together with the promises or representations made in the sale brochure.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  As for the green forms and white forms, although they were prepared or distributed by the Housing Authority, but from the perspectiveof the applicants, the Housing Authority was quite clearly representing the developer in promising them that they could withdrawfrom the transactions prior to completion subject to forfeiture of 5% of the purchase price.  By allowing the Housing Authority tomake the representations in the green forms and white forms, the developer cannot be heard subsequently to say that no such promiseshad been made to the green form and white form applicants and they must be held to the strict terms of the sale and purchase agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  Ms Eu submitted in final submission that the sale and purchase agreement should be read subject to a collateral contract to theeffect that the home-owner could withdraw from the transaction before completion subject to forfeiture of deposit as had been representedin the green form or (as the case may be) white form and sale brochure.  She relied on <i>Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd v. Fung Chin Kan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 199F to 200C.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  I agree with her submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  That said, this does not <i>per se</i> decide the outcome of the dispute over the forfeited deposits.  The first proposition put forward by Ms Eu, based on the past practicesand policies of PSPS, only went to the extent that a home-owner has always enjoyed the right to withdraw or opt out from the purchaseafter nomination, subject to forfeiture of a fixed amount of the nomination fees/deposit.  That is a matter between the Housing Authority/developeron the one hand and the home-owner on the other.  It deals with their relationship <i>inter se</i>.  But it does not bear on the all-important question of who is entitled to the forfeited nomination fees/deposit, <i>as between the Housing Authority and the developer</i>.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i> â Housing Authorityâs right to keep the forfeited deposits â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  That is the subject of the second proposition which Ms Eu sought to derive from the past practices and policies of PSPS.  In otherwords, Ms Eu submitted that as another important part of the factual matrix, it had always been the case that the forfeited nominationfees/deposits belonged to the Housing Authority, as opposed to the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  On this second question I accept, on the evidence adduced, that as a matter of what <i>actually happened</i> in the past and leaving aside the only exception in the Kornhill project, the Housing Authority had always kept the forfeited nominationfees/deposits to the exclusion of the developers â including those belonging to the Chevalier group.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  However, as a matter of <i>documents</i> used, the position is not that entirely clear.  The various versions of the green forms and white forms did have different wordingsin this regard.  Some versions provided for forfeiture to the Housing Authority, whereas other versions did not specify who wouldretain the forfeited nomination fees.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  As mentioned above, for instance, the pro forma contract approved by the Government actually provided for forfeiture of the depositto the developer as vendor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  The conveyancing minutes and conveyancing notes did seem to suggest that the forfeited deposits would go to the Housing Authorityinstead of the developer.  But all witnesses who have given evidence on these minutes and notes said that they were not meant tovary the partiesâ contractual entitlement, if any, to the forfeited deposits.  In other words, none of them were saying that theconveyancing minutes or notes would provide an independent answer to the question of entitlement to the forfeited deposits.  Theconveyancing minutes or notes did not constitute a variation of or a supplemental agreement to the contract between the Housing Authorityand the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  Ms Eu, in final submission, accepted that her reliance on past policies and practices of PSPS as part of the factual matrix wasmainly in relation to the first proposition discussed above, namely that home-owners had always had the right to withdraw or âoptoutâ from the transactions after nomination subject to forfeiture of nomination fees/deposits. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In relation to the second proposition, namely that as between the Housing Authority and the developer, the Housing Authority hadalways been entitled to the forfeited deposits, counsel accepted that, beyond what had actually happened, the past practices andpolicies of PSPS (including the documents used) were a less certain guide. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Indeed counselâs submission on the Housing Authorityâs entitlement to the forfeited deposits was based essentially on the constructionof contract, rather than the past practices and policies as such.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Plaintiffâs claim to the forfeited deposits based on contract â construction of special conditions 24 and 26</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  I would now turn to the construction of the contract between the Housing Authority and the plaintiff, and construe it in light ofPSPS as its background, in order to determine the entitlement to the forfeited deposits in the withdrawal cases.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>(1) The 420 cases</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  As mentioned above, there were 420 cases where the home-owners, after nomination by the Housing Authority, failed to sign the formalagreements for sale and purchase with the plaintiff. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  These cases clearly fall within condition 24(a)(ii)I which provided for the re-nomination by the Housing Authority within 4 calendarmonths of notification of default in signing the agreement for sale and purchase by the nominated home-owner.  In all these cases,the home-owners had paid the requisite nomination fees (upon signing the nomination agreements with the Housing Authority).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Condition 24(a)(ii)I did not, nor did any other provisions in the two conditions, specify that the nomination fees so paid belongedto the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  However, it is difficult to think of any other possible answer.  Such nominated home-owners did not sign any formal agreements withthe developer, and did not therefore have any contractual relationship with the developer.  What they had failed to do was to signthe formal agreements for sale and purchase, as per the nomination agreements they had signed with the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  The nomination fees that were forfeited were paid to the Housing Authority.  The nomination agreements provided for their forfeitureto the Housing Authority in case of failure to sign the formal agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  As far as the flats were concerned, the Housing Authority were obliged to make a re-nomination, failing which it was obliged tobuy back the flats at the guaranteed unit rate.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  As a matter of fact, the majority of the flats involved were sold upon the Housing Authorityâs re-nominations.  The remainingflats were bought back by the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  In those circumstances, Ms Eu submitted that the developer could have no claim to the forfeited nomination fees.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  Mr Griffiths never made any concession relating to the 420 cases.  However, he did not advance any real arguments, whether in hisopening or final submission, in relation to the forfeited nomination fees in the 420 cases either.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  I agree with Ms Eu that the plaintiff has no contractual claim to the forfeited nomination fees, whether pursuant to the collateralcontract between the plaintiff and the Housing Authority or as the vendor/developer of the flats in Charming Garden.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>(2) The 36 cases</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  As regards those 36 cases where the nominated home-owners, after signing the agreements for sale and purchase with the plaintiff,failed to pay the balance purchase prices or complete the sale and purchase with the plaintiff, without ever applying to the HousingAuthority for withdrawal from the transactions, the situation is covered squarely by condition 24(a)(ii)II.  The provisions stipulatedthat the Housing Authority had to re-nominate a new home-owner to take up the flat and most importantly for our present purpose,the provisions provided specifically that the developer âshall only be entitled to an amount equal to the purchase price (<i>less the deposit paid by the original home-owner</i>) which would have been payable by the original home-owner had the failure not taken placeâ (emphasis added).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  In other words, the forfeited deposit paid by the original home-owner belonged to the Housing Authority, not the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  In my judgment, the plaintiff can have no contractual claim to the forfeited deposits in those 36 cases.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>(3) The 946 cases</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  That leaves the 946 cases where the nominated home-owners applied to the Housing Authority to withdraw from the transactions aftersigning the formal agreements for sale and purchase with the plaintiff.  The Housing Authority, acting consistently with its pastpolicies and practices, approved all these applications for withdrawal, and as a result the plaintiff âhad no practical choiceâ(as per its case) but entered into cancellation agreements with these home-owners.  The cancellation agreements all provided expresslyfor the forfeiture of the entire deposits paid to the developer.  But in fact, for white form applicants, only half of the depositswere forfeited with the remaining half refunded by the Housing Authority.  For the green form applicants, who only paid 5% of thepurchase prices as deposits, the entire deposits were forfeited.  The only exception comprised those green form applicants who participatedin TPS â the entire deposits were refunded by the Housing Authority to them.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â Counselâs arguments on the 946 cases â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  The plaintiff claims that it is entitled to the forfeited deposits (including those monies refunded by the Housing Authority). The plaintiffâs case is essentially that the matter is governed by the formal agreements for sale and purchase signed between theplaintiff and the home-owners as well as the cancellation agreements also signed between them.  Both agreements have been vettedby the Government.  The formal agreement provided for forfeiture of the deposit upon default by the purchaser (clause 16).  The cancellationagreement provided for forfeiture of the deposit upon cancellation of the formal agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  To meet the counter argument that the above two documents only dealt with the relationship between the developer and home-owner,but does not answer the question of who is entitled to the forfeited deposit as between the Housing Authority and the developer,Mr Griffiths argued that as between the latter two, the matter is entirely covered by the collateral contract in this sense:  Thecollateral contract, leading counsel submitted, was completely silent on the forfeited deposits, and this being the case, the HousingAuthority can point to no contractual provisions whereby it could make a claim to the forfeited deposits.  There is, therefore, nothingbetween the Housing Authority and the developer to disturb the âprima facieâ position regarding the forfeited deposits that hasbeen dictated by the terms of the formal agreements for sale and purchase and the cancellation agreements, the terms of which, putat the lowest, the Housing Authority was fully aware of.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  In particular, Mr Griffiths argued that condition 24(a)(ii)II did not apply to the 946 cases.  First, the provisions there onlyapplied to the situation where the time for completion had arrived and the home-owner had failed to pay the balance purchase priceand complete the sale and purchase.  Here, the completion time was yet to arrive, but the home-owner had, in anticipatory breachof contract, evinced an intention not to proceed further with the transaction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  Secondly, Mr Griffiths submitted, basing his argument on a distinction first drawn by Ms Susan Lee, the developerâs solicitorin the Charming Garden project, that the provisions in question  (i.e. condition 24(a)(ii)II) only applied to a case of <i>rescission</i> following failure of a purchaser to pay the balance purchase price and complete the sale and purchase when the time for completionhad arrived.  The provisions had no application to a case of <i>cancellation</i> â via the cancellation agreement signed between the developer and the purchaser whereby the formal agreement was âcancelledâand was âdeemed to be null and void and of no further effectâ.  There was simply no âdefaultâ in such situation and thereforethe provisions did not bite. (For the same reason, Ms Susan Lee asserted that the understanding or agreement reached in the conveyancingmeeting as evidenced by the conveyancing minutes regarding <i>rescission</i> cases and entitlement to the forfeited deposits in those cases did not apply to <i>cancellation</i> cases.)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  Ms Eu, as indicated above, countered that the formal agreement for sale and purchase must be read subject to a collateral contractbetween the developer and the home-owner.  It must be read as part of the whole PSPS.  Furthermore, it did not govern the relationshipbetween the Housing Authority and the developer as such.  As regards the cancellation agreement, the Housing Authority did not approveits contents.  More importantly, counsel submitted that according to the evidence, the Housing Authority and the plaintiff both agreedthat the cancellation agreements were to be entered into on a without prejudice basis, i.e. without prejudice to their respectivecontentions regarding entitlement to the deposits to be forfeited.  Accordingly, the terms of the cancellation agreement could notaffect the Housing Authorityâs entitlement to the forfeited deposits under the collateral contract between the Housing Authorityand the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  Most importantly, Ms Eu argued that entitlement to the forfeited deposits under the 946 cases was governed by condition 24(a)(ii)II. She argued that (1) the provisions covered not only cases of default at the time of completion, but also cases of withdrawal afternomination but prior to completion; and (2) that the provisions covered not only rescission, but also cancellation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Ms Euâs argument was premised on the evidence adduced at trial that invariably in the past, when a home-owner applied, after nominationand signing a formal agreement, to the Housing Authority to withdraw from the transaction, the Housing Authority would approve theapplication and inform the developerâs solicitors about the withdrawal.  In such an event, the developer had two choices, one ofwhich was wholly unattractive.  The unattractive choice was to wait until completion time to see if the home-owner would really defaultin making payment of the balance purchase price.  If he did, then the developer would have to send notices to the defaulting purchaser,and it was only after the expiry of the notices that the developer could formally rescind the agreement.  It was only then that thedeveloper could notify the Housing Authority pursuant to condition 24(a)(ii)II to re-nominate a new home-owner within four months,failing which the Housing Authority would have to buy back the flat.  According to the evidence, that was a possible but wholly unattractivechoice.  It had no appeal whatsoever to the developer or the Housing Authority.  It delayed the resale of the flat and thus the receiptof the purchase price, and increased finance charges.  It delayed the sale of the flat to another home-owner who genuinely requiredit for housing purpose.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  The second choice, which according to the evidence was adopted without exception, was that the developer would enter into a cancellationagreement with the withdrawing home-owner to cancel the formal agreement.  After signing the cancellation agreement, the flat couldimmediately be put up for resale in the next phase of sale of HOS and PSPS flats.  That would be to the mutual benefit of the HousingAuthority and the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  As mentioned above, in relation to the past PSPS projects involving the Chevalier group, there were 137 cases of withdrawal wherea formal agreement for sale and purchase had been signed.  In all those 137 cases, cancellation agreements were signed so as to facilitatethe immediate re-nomination/resale of the flats concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  The good commercial sense of the arrangement is easy to see.  I have no difficulty in accepting the relevant evidence. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  Based on such evidence, Ms Eu argued and this was the main plank of her argument in the case, that condition 24(a)(ii)II, on itsproper construction in light of the factual matrix, covered the case of withdrawal prior to the time for completion via signing acancellation agreement.  The signing of a cancellation agreement simply brought forward the rescission of the transaction.  In thewords of one witness, it was simply an âadministrative actâ to implement the rescission/withdrawal by the nominated home-ownerfrom the transaction.  Put another way, it was a simplified form of rescission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  Under those circumstances, Ms Eu argued that the case of cancellation fell squarely within condition 24(a)(ii)II.  Since condition24(a)(ii)II provided that in case of rescission and re-nomination/resale, the forfeited deposit belonged to the Housing Authority,in the case of cancellation/re-nomination, the same result must follow.  The forfeited deposit must belong to the Housing Authority. Likewise, for those cases where no re-nomination could be made within time following cancellation and the unsold flats were boughtback by the Housing Authority, they are covered by condition 24(b)(ii) and the forfeited deposits must also belong to the HousingAuthority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  Put another way, it would be wholly illogical and out of line with the intention behind condition 24(a)(ii)II, counsel argued, thatthe Housing Authority should lose the benefit of the forfeited deposit if, instead of letting the developer wait until completiontime for the actual default by the home-owner to pay the balance purchase price to take place (in which event upon re-nominationand resale the Housing Authority would get the forfeited deposit), it should agree with the developer that it could enter into acancellation agreement with the withdrawing home-owner prior to completion, with a view to facilitating the quick re-nomination/resaleof the flat to the mutual benefit of both sides.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  Ms Eu further argued that her construction must be correct because if the case of cancellation were not covered by condition 24(a)(ii)II,it would not be covered by any other provisions in the special conditions, in which event the Housing Authority would have neitherthe right nor obligation to re-nominate a new home-owner for the flat.  Nor would the Housing Authority have any obligation to buyback the same flat.  It would therefore wholly defeat the purpose behind building the PSPS flats.  From the standpoint of the developer,since it could not sell the flat to any outsider, the absence of any re-nomination/buyback provisions applicable to a case of cancellationwould mean that the developer would be stuck with the flat.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  Ms Eu pointed to the evidence that as a matter of fact, after the cancellation agreements were signed in the 946 cases, the plaintiffas developer did call upon the Housing Authority to make re-nominations, which the Housing Authority duly did.  Furthermore, whensome of those flats could not be resold within the time stipulated, the developer called upon the Housing Authority to buy them back,which again the Housing Authority did.  Throughout, the developer relied on condition 24(a)(ii)II in requiring the Housing Authorityto make re-nominations and to buy back the unsold flats.  Counsel argued that this illustrated quite conclusively that the constructionof condition 24(a)(ii)II she put forward was wholly consistent with the partiesâ own understanding.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  Mr Griffiths answered all these arguments by contending that cancellation brought about advantages not only to the developer butalso to the Housing Authority.  There was no logical reason why, given that the Housing Authority also benefited from the cancellationarrangement, it could not, as a sort of price for that benefit, lose the right to the forfeited deposit it would otherwise have gotif the developer had waited until completion time before rescinding the agreement and calling upon the Housing Authority to makea re-nomination.  The cancellation arrangement benefited the Housing Authority in terms of early receipt of its share of the balancepurchase price and the consequential reduced likelihood of having to buy back any unsold flats.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  As regards the Housing Authorityâs obligations to make a re-nomination and buy back any unsold flats, Mr Griffithsâ answer tothe lack of any express provisions to cover the case of cancellation (as per his construction of the conditions) was that there wereimplied terms regarding re-nomination and buyback in cancellation cases as a matter of âcommon senseâ.  Such implied terms were,counsel submitted, crucial to the integrity of the Conditions of Sale because otherwise, the developer who could not sell to anypurchaser except the Housing Authority and its nominee would be encumbered with any unsold units at the end of the day which it couldnot sell or occupy.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  On the other hand, Mr Griffiths submitted that it was not necessary, under those implied terms, to further imply a provision tothe effect that the developer should be deprived of its prima facie entitlement to the forfeited deposit under the agreement forsale and purchase and the cancellation agreement, in order to give business efficacy to the relevant special conditions.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  Mr Griffiths therefore argued that there was no inconsistency between his construction of condition 24(a)(ii)II and the requirementfor re-nomination/buyback.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  Ms Eu pointed out in her submission that according to the plaintiffâs financial estimate which it put forward as part of its tenderdocumentation, the residential flats in Charming Garden were expected to make a loss of $3.8 million and the whole project (includingthe non-residential part) was estimated to generate an overall profit of not more than $19 million.  Yet, counsel emphasised, theplaintiff is now contending that it is entitled to the forfeited deposits in the total sum of almost $107 million (for the 946 casesalone), which significantly exceeds the plaintiffâs estimated overall profit in the Charming Garden project.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  Mr Griffiths countered in his final submission that if one were to look at the total investment of the plaintiff in the projectand the losses such as increase in finance charges that the withdrawals and re-nominations brought about, the claim of the plaintiffto the forfeited deposits would look much more reasonable than the picture portrayed by Ms Eu would superficially suggest.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â My view on the 946 cases â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  I agree with Ms Eu that the formal agreement for sale and purchase could not by itself govern the entitlement to the forfeited depositas between the Housing Authority and the developer.  I also agree that the cancellation agreements, which were entered into on awithout prejudice basis, do not decide the issue in question.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  As to the proper construction of condition 24(a)(ii)II, I find force in Ms Euâs argument.  The obvious intention in a default/rescissionsituation was that the Housing Authority should be entitled to keep the forfeited deposit.  What the developer would get was a re-nominationand a new home-owner who would have to pay the full purchase price to buy the flat.  Out of the full purchase price, the developerwould receive its share of proceeds calculated at the guaranteed unit rate as per condition 26(b)(iv) and (c).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  In a case where the nominated home-owner defaulted in paying the balance purchase price and completing the sale and purchase, boththe Housing Authority and the developer would suffer in terms of delay in receiving the balance purchase price and the resale ofthe flat.  There was an increased risk of the Housing Authority being required to buy back the unsold flat, particularly if the contractualtime for completion should fall outside the twelve monthsâ period counting from the date of the Director of Landsâ consent forsigning sale and purchase agreements (in which case the Housing Authority could not make a re-nomination but must buy back the flat:condition 24(b)(iii)).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  Condition 24(a)(ii)II expressly provided that in such a situation, notwithstanding the respective losses of and disadvantages tothe Housing Authority and the developer, the forfeited deposit should go to the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  That being the case, why should there be a different provision regarding the benefit of the forfeited deposit if both sides shouldagree, for their mutual benefit, or as a sort of loss mitigation measure, that there should be a cancellation agreement signed withthe home-owner who was intending not to complete the sale and purchase, so as to enable the flat to be resold (via re-nomination)as soon as possible?  Why should entitlement to the deposit be changed from the Housing Authority to the developer in such a case? </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  If no mechanism was available for the purchasers to withdraw from the purchases early, the re-nomination/re-sale procedure couldonly be initiated after the time when the sale should have been completed.  Unlike sale of private flats by private developers, neitherthe Housing Authority nor the developer could simply sell the unwanted flats to any purchasers who happened to be interested in thoseflats.  The flats would have to be resold in the upcoming phases for HOS/PSPS flat sale, which would only be undertaken once everyfew months on average.  On the other hand, if the purchasers were allowed to withdraw early, the re-sale could possibly (and accordingto the evidence, in fact often would) take place in the upcoming phase of sale which possibly could take place even before the timewhen the original sale should have been completed.  Quite plainly, that was to the benefit of both the Housing Authority and thedeveloper.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  It would be, therefore, very strange that in the case of cancellation, the developer should suddenly be entitled to get the 5% or10% purchase price paid by the home-owner as nomination fee/deposit.  The amount of nomination fee/deposit was proportional to thepurchase price fixed not by the developer, but by the Director of Housing.  The developer had no say at all.  Yet it should be notedthat the developerâs case is <i>not</i> that it is entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> amount of the nomination fee/deposit by way of forfeiture.  It is not saying that it should get part of the nomination fee in thesame proportion as the guaranteed unit rate of $15,000 bears to the actual unit selling price of the particular flat in questionor the average selling price per square metre fixed by the Director of Housing at his discretion.  The developerâs case is thatit is, in the event of cancellation, entitled to <i>the whole of</i> the nomination fee/deposit.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  Yet, the developer has to accept, because there are express provisions to that effect (condition 24(a)(ii)II), in case of a purchaserfailing to pay the balance purchase price and complete the sale and purchase after the time for completion has arrived, the nominationfee/deposit belongs to the Housing Authority, but not the developer.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p154" class="para" id="p154">154.</a>  The cancellation arrangement was, on the evidence, simply a device to, as it were, short-cut the rescission process that would otherwisetake a relatively long period of time to complete before which the flat could not be re-sold. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p155" class="para" id="p155">155.</a>  The cancellation arrangement had been around for a long time, as the history of PSPS has demonstrated.  In construing condition24(a)(ii)II, one must take that into account as part of the factual matrix.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p156" class="para" id="p156">156.</a>  If the construction put forward by Ms Eu should appear to be straining the actual wording used in condition 24(a)(ii)II to someextent, the contra argument of Mr Griffiths, which necessitates the implication of (unpleaded) terms as important as re-nominationand buyback into the collateral contract between the Housing Authority and the developer, would seem to be even more unnatural andartificial.  One would have thought that for matters as material as re-nomination and buyback, they would have been covered comprehensivelyin the special conditions.  The fact that under Mr Griffithsâ construction, one should need to imply obligations into the specialconditions so as to require the Housing Authority to re-nominate home-owners and buy back any unsold flats in cases of cancellationcasts a serious doubt on the correctness of Mr Griffithsâ construction.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  Without the suggested implied terms, the obstacle to Mr Griffithsâ construction is that the Housing Authority has no right norobligation to re-nominate or buy back, a proposition so extraneous to the whole object and intention of PSPS that neither side suggestedthat it should be the result.  For after all, the developer is the last person on earth who should be stuck with a PSPS flat.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  Condition 26(b)(iv) which provided for the guaranteed unit rate of $15,000 per square metre would also tend to support Ms Euâscontention.  Under that provision, the developer would get the guaranteed unit rate, regardless of the actual prices at which theflats were sold to the home-owners.  At least as a matter of theory, a flat could have been sold at below the guaranteed unit price. In a sense, the developer in a PSPS project was nothing more than a builder of the flats and agent of the Housing Authority in marketingthem.  At the end of the day, it received a fixed reward for its work and labour, with the Housing Authority shouldering the riskof fluctuations in market prices.  As a matter of fact, after the onset of the Asian financial crisis, the prices of flats in CharmingGarden had been adjusted downward from $40,000/$42,000 per square metre by a total of 11 times, when they were resold in Phase 19Cand Phase 20A, which took place in March/April 1998 and November/ December 1998 respectively.  The Housing Authority received a totalsum of $345 million less out of the sale of the flats involved.  On the other hand, the plaintiff, as developer, received the sametotal purchase prices calculated at the guarantee rate of $15,000 per square metre out of the sale/resale/buyback of the flats inCharming Garden, leaving aside the question of entitlement to the forfeited deposits.  From this perspective, the risk of the fallingmarket fell entirely on the Housing Authority, as Ms Eu had lost no time to point out to the Court during final submission.  Theforfeited deposits, although huge in aggregated amount, paled into insignificance beside the cuts in price in the subsequent re-nomination/resaleprocedures. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  Furthermore, the special conditions also provided that even in a case of buyback due to the Housing Authorityâs failure to nominateany home-owner at all (condition 24(b)(i)), all that the developer would receive from the Housing Authority was the guaranteed price:condition 24(a)(iii) and (b).  There would be no compensation for any delay in receipt of money or additional financial charge. And in the case of buyback after the originally nominated home-owner had failed to pay the balance purchase price resulting in hisdeposit being forfeited (condition 24(b)(iii)), condition 24(b) expressly provided, in effect, that the forfeited deposit shouldbelong to the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  All this tends to show that the intention of the special conditions was simply to pay the developer a fixed price, calculated at$15,000 per square metre.  All losses such as increased finance charges due to delay in selling the flats or a total failure to sellthe flats (i.e. the buyback situation) would have to be absorbed by the developer without any compensation.  Indeed, condition 24(a)(iii)said so in terms â â[the developer] shall not make any claim or demand whatsoever, whether under these Conditions or common law,against the Government or the Hong Kong Housing Authority or the Director of Housingâ for failure to nominate/re-nominate, thusresulting in a buyback situation.  Given that sort of intention or thinking as evinced by those express provisions, it would be asurprising result indeed if the same special conditions should, upon proper construction, leave the benefit of the forfeited depositto the developer in case of cancellation.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  Ms Eu submitted that PSPS had been in operation for many years, and there had been numerous cases of withdrawal after signing theagreements for sale and purchase but before completion.  Counsel submitted that it was totally unreal to suggest â as the plaintiffhad done at one stage â that the 946 cases were âunforeseenâ ones and therefore they should not be covered by the provisionsin the Conditions of Sale.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  For my part, either the cancellation cases are covered by condition 24(a)(ii)II or they are not.  The fact that there were 946 casesis, in my view, neither here nor there.  To be fair, Mr Griffiths in his final submission did not really premise his submissionson the supposedly âunforeseenâ aspect of the withdrawal cases. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  For the above reasons â including the submissions of Ms Eu which I, after careful consideration, accept in preference to the competingsubmissions of Mr Griffiths, I conclude that on the proper construction of the special conditions in question, condition 24(a)(ii)IIapplies also to a case of cancellation.  In other words, in case of cancellation, the forfeited deposit also belongs to the HousingAuthority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  That being a special contractual provision in the collateral contract between the Housing Authority and the developer governing,on its proper construction, entitlement to the forfeited deposit in case of cancellation it must override the so-called âprimafacieâ entitlement of the developer to the forfeited deposit under the formal agreement for sale and purchase and cancellationagreement signed between the developer and the home-owner.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  In short, in the 946 cases, like the other two types of cases, the forfeited deposits belong to the Housing Authority as opposedto the plaintiff.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â An alternative way of analysing the 946 cases â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  An alternative way to analyse the 946 cases, which would lead to the same result, is as follows.  Assume in the plaintiffâs favourthat on its proper construction condition 24(a)(ii)II only covers a case of actual default/rescission after arrival of the contractualtime for payment, but not a case of cancellation.  The cancellation agreements were entered into on the express understanding betweenthe Housing Authority and the plaintiff that the same would not prejudice their respective claims to entitlement of the forfeiteddeposits.  Their agreed basis was that the entitlement would be determined in accordance with the Conditions of Sale, i.e. specialconditions 24 and 26.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  What does that mean?  In my judgment, the without prejudice basis means that the cancellation arrangement, which, according to theevidence and my finding, was resorted to as a practical means to mitigate the partiesâ losses resulting from the home-ownerâswithdrawal and a shortcut to the lengthy rescission process (pending which the unit affected could not be put up for resale), shouldnot prejudice the entitlement of either the Housing Authority, or alternatively the developer, to the forfeited deposit as per conditions24 and 26.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  In other words, in order to find out whose entitlement it was to the forfeited deposit under conditions 24 and 26, one should notionallyignore the cancellation arrangement â i.e. as if the cancellation agreement had not been signed. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  Put another way, one should notionally put oneself back to the situation where no cancellation agreement had been signed with thehome-owner and the home-owner had been left to default in making payment of the balance purchase price after the arrival of the contractualtime for completion and payment.  In such a case, obviously, the specific provisions in condition 24(a)(ii)II would have bitten providedthat it should have happened within twelve months of the Director of Landâs consent, and the Housing Authority would have had theobligation to re-nominate a new home-owner and the further obligation to buy back the flat if it could not be re-sold within time. Alternatively, if the contractual time for completion should have fallen outside the twelve months period, there would have beenno question of a re-nomination but the Housing Authority would have to buy back the flat.  In either case, the deposit would havebelonged to the Housing Authority as per condition 24(a)(ii)II or 24(b)(iii).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  In my view, that is the correct way to understand the without prejudice basis upon which the parties agreed to have the cancellationagreements signed between the developer and the withdrawing home-owners.  On that basis, the entitlement to the forfeited depositsis clear.  The situation is governed, notionally, by condition 24(a)(ii)II or alternatively condition 24(b)(iii); in either casethe forfeited deposits belong to the Housing Authority.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  That is the same result as the one that I have already arrived at via construction of condition 24(a)(ii)II.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â Conclusion on the 946 cases â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  Either way, the plaintiff is not entitled to the forfeited deposits in the 946 cases.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  Likewise, any ancillary claim of the plaintiff based on contract to the <i>refunded</i> deposits, i.e. the 5% deposits refunded to the white form purchasers and the 5% deposits refunded to those green form applicantswho had opted for joining TPS, must also fail.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â Rejection of the estoppel argument â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  Incidentally, the alternative analysis described above also deposes of an argument run by Ms Eu as a fall-back position in casethe plaintiffâs narrower construction of condition 24(a)(ii)II should be preferred by the Court.  Ms Eu has argued that becausethe plaintiff had, pursuant to the re-nomination and buyback provisions in condition 24, required the Housing Authority to re-nominatenew home-owners to buy the flats involved in the 946 cases and eventually to buy back the unsold flats, the plaintiff is estoppedfrom denying that those 946 cases fell within condition 24(a)(ii)II. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  In my judgment, the re-nomination and buyback requests followed the cancellation agreements, which were entered into, as mentionedabove, on a without prejudice basis.  According to my interpretation of the without prejudice basis, the partiesâ respective rightsand positions were to be viewed as if there had been no cancellation.  Regarded in that light, the 946 cases were simply equivalentto cases of <i>actual</i> default/rescission, and should be dealt with as if they were covered by condition 24(a)(ii)II (or condition 24(b)(iii)) and the obligationsto re-nominate and/or buyback thereunder.  In short, the plaintiffâs reliance on condition 24(a)(ii)II (or condition 24(b)(iii))in requiring the Housing Authority to make re-nominations and/or buy back the unsold flats was simply pursuant to the without prejudicebasis.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  In the circumstances, I do not think there can be any place for an estoppel argument.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  However, this does not matter, given the main conclusions that I have already reached.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Plaintiffâs claim to the forfeited deposits based on fiduciary duty</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  As accepted by Mr Griffiths in his opening, the plaintiffâs claim to the deposits based on breach of fiduciary duty stands orfalls with that based on contract.

It provided fora guaranteed price and stipulated periods of nomination, re-nomination and buyback.  He submitted that whilst everyone wanted tosee the flats marketed and sold as quickly as possible, it does not mean that it was necessary to imply the suggested terms intothe contract in order to make that happen.  The various stipulated periods in the conditions took care of the partiesâ intentionand agreement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  Mr Miu also criticized the suggested implied terms as being vague and not capable of clear expression, a criticism shared by MsEu in her final submission relating to the implied terms.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  Ms Eu also added that it would be surprising to hear anyone complain about the Housing Authority trying to obstruct sale of flatsin Phases 19A and 19B, given its statutory duty to provide housing.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â My view on the implied terms â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  I agree with Ms Eu and Mr Miu. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  In my view, given the clear time frame set out in the relevant conditions, there was no scope for implying the suggested terms intothe conditions.  They were simply unnecessary.  Under the framework provided by the conditions, the bottom-line was that the HousingAuthority would buy back any unsold flats at the guaranteed unit rate.  Condition 24(a)(iii) specifically excluded any liabilityon the part of the Government or the Housing Authority for not making any nomination or re-nomination save and except to buy backthe unsold flats as per condition 24(b).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  It should also be noted that the Governmentâs policy on housing as well as the market situation may change from time to time. The indefinite freezing of construction and sale of HOS and PSPS flats in 2003 due to the then social and economic situation isa prime example of a change in Government policy in response to prevailing condition.  In those circumstances, it would be whollyinappropriate to imply any terms into the two conditions to the effect that the Government or the Housing Authority must make nominationstimeously or not delay the sale of the units, so as not to âinhibit the optimum reasonably achievable cash flow to the plaintiffâ.

For instance, the term âoptimumreasonably achievable cash flowâ is, in my view, as uncertain as it is unworkable. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  Without the suggested implied terms, the contract was still effective and workable.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  The fact that the plaintiff did not make the profit that it had hoped and anticipated to make when it tendered for the project isnot a good reason for implying the terms.

The purchaser committed an anticipatory breach of contract when he announced his intentionto withdraw from the purchase by <i>inter alia</i>, submitting a withdrawal application form.  He complained that the unilateral changes of policy, the approval of the withdrawal applicationsand the partial or total refund of deposits, all amounted to direct interferences on the part of the Housing Authority with the plaintiffâscontractual rights <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the home-owners who had signed agreements for sale and purchase with the plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  Mr Griffiths submitted that the Housing Authority was clearly aware of the terms of the agreements for sale and purchase which followedthe standard form prescribed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  As far as intention is concerned, the test is objective and does not require a âdesire to injureâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  So far as justification is concerned, it was argued that there was no justification for the Housing Authorityâs action even ifit were simply following announced Government policies.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  Ms Eu raised a number of arguments to counter the plaintiffâs claim.  As I see it, the most important argument is that there simplywas no actionable breach resulting from the alleged interference/inducement.  The home-owners of Charming Garden, like all otherhome-owners in previous HOS and PSPS schemes, had the right to opt out from the nominations and agreements, even after signing ofthe agreements for sale and purchase.  The only sanction was the forfeiture of the nomination fees/deposits (or part thereof).</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  In the 946 cases, that was precisely what the home-owners had done. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  Furthermore, the forfeited deposits belonged to the Housing Authority, counsel argued â quite correctly as determined above. Any waiver of forfeiture or refund of deposits was a matter between the Housing Authority and the withdrawing home-owners.  It didnot cause the plaintiff as developer any loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  In short, Ms Eu submitted that there was no breach, nor was there any loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  Mr Griffiths countered that this argument was tantamount to saying that anyone has a right to breach a contract provided he is willingto pay damages.

Having referred to various passages in Sir Edward Fryâsclassic work on <i>The Specific Performance of Contracts</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> ed. (1921), Chapter 3, the Court of Appeal concluded that the Centaline clause, which stipulated for the payment of a so-called doublecompensation by the vendor to the purchaser if the vendor did not wish to proceed with the sale, provided an alternative mode ofperformance by the vendor, namely payment of the double compensation, in which event no specific performance of the contract couldbe ordered.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  In my judgment, the essential question has been set out at p. 65 of Sir Edward Fryâs work:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="12%" valign="top" class="quote">S.S.140.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">â¦ where a contract is substantially performed by the payment of a sum of money, the Common Law remedy being adequate, Equity willnot interfere.  Hence, in cases where there is added to the contract a clause for the payment of a sum of money in the event of non-performance,the question arises whether the contract will be satisfied by the payment or whether it will not.  In the former case, Equity willnot interfere; in the latter, it may.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="12%" valign="top" class="quote">S.S. 141.</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="87%" valign="top" class="quote">The question always is, What is the contract?

If the former, the factof the penal or other like sum being annexed will not prevent the Courtâs enforcing performance of the very act, and thus carryinginto execution the intention of the parties: if the latter, the contract is satisfied by the payment of a sum of money, and thereis no ground for proceeding against the party having the election to compel the performance of the other alternative.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  In my view, so far as the contract between the plaintiff and an individual home-owner is concerned, given what I have found anddecided above, the contract is really one providing for two alternative modes of performance on the part of the purchaser, namelyto pay the balance purchase price and complete the sale and purchase, or alternatively to  withdraw from the contract and have 5%of the purchase price forfeited to the Housing Authority.  According to my findings based on the past practices and policies of PSPS,neither the developer nor the Housing Authority would, in that event, have any additional remedy, including specific performanceor a claim for damages, against the withdrawing purchaser.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  In those circumstances, in the words of Lord Lindley, the purchaser has âstipulated for an optionâ to opt out of the contractby having 5% of the purchase price forfeited to the Housing Authority.  In terms of Sir Edward Fryâs work, the home-owner has contractedto perform the contract in one of two ways, namely payment of the balance purchase price and complete the sale and purchase or forgoingof 5% of the purchase price by way of forfeiture.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  That being the case, as a matter of substance, when the purchaser elected to withdraw from the transaction and have 5% of the purchaseprice forfeited, he committed no actionable breach of contract for the purpose of the tort of interference. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  It is true that in the evidence, words like âdefaultâ, âforfeitureâ have been used in connection with the purchaserâsopting out of the transaction by given up 5% of the purchase price, thereby suggesting that he has committed a <i>breach</i> of contract.  However, that, in my view, is not crucial for our present purpose.  It should be noted that in <i>Wong Lai Fan</i> itself, the Centaline clause actually said that should the vendor âfail to complete the saleâ, the vendor shall immediately âcompensateâthe purchaser with a sum equivalent to the amount of the initial deposit as âliquidated damagesâ together with the refund ofthe initial deposit.  Furthermore, in such an event where the vendor âfails to complete the sale and purchaseâ, âthe defaultingpartyâ â i.e. the vendor, shall âcompensateâ the estate agent a stipulated amount of money as âliquidated damagesâ. All this use of words that suggested that the vendor was in wrongful breach of contract by refusing to complete but offering to paya double compensation did not prevent the Court of Appeal from concluding, upon the proper construction of the contract and the Centalineclause, that the contract provided for an alternative mode of performance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  In my judgment, at the end of the day, it may well be a matter of semantics with no real significance whether to label the partyopting for the alternative mode of performance as acting in breach of contract or not. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  I have not lost sight of the fact that what was in issue in <i>Wong Lai Fan</i> was whether the purchaser could sue for specific performance of contract against the vendor â a question of <i>relief</i>, rather than whether the vendor was acting in wrongful breach of contract â a question of <i>liability</i>.  However, the way in which the Court of Appeal resolved the dispute suggested that in such a case, there was no breach of contractat all (a <i>liability</i> question). </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  But in any event, it is, as I said, a question of semantics.  For the purpose of the tort of inducing a breach of contract/wrongfulinterference with contract, there has to be a breach which, in my judgment, goes beyond a technical one, a âbreachâ which givesrise to a real remedy in favour of the innocent party.  Just like what happened in <i>Wong Lai Fan</i>, whether one calls the vendor a defaulting party in wrongful breach of contract is neither here nor there.  The reality was thatapart from the double compensation that he had offered to pay (which constituted the alternative mode of performance in the firstplace), he was not obliged to pay the innocent purchaser any damages.  Nor could he be specifically compelled to perform the contract. Whether technically speaking, he has committed a breach is neither here nor there. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  In my judgment, for there to be an actionable tort of inducement/interference, the breach of contract must be something more thana technical breach in the sense described above.  I should point out, for the sake of completeness, that I am not here dealing withthe situation where the âcontract-breakerâ (who has succumbed to the inducement or interference) has failed to render performanceof contract in either of the alternative ways provided.  Rather, I am only focusing on the situation where he has opted for the alternativemode of performance and has duly done his part as required by it.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  My conclusion on that last-mentioned situation is fortified by the requirement that in order to be actionable, the interference/inducementmust result in special damage.  That is another element of the tort. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  In the case of a technical breach that I have just described, there simply is no actionable special damage resulting from the technicalbreach.  The innocent party cannot sue the wrongful party for any substantial relief.  It would therefore be most surprising if hecould turn around and sue the third party who has, <i>ex</i><i> hypothesi</i>, wrongfully interfered with the contract or induced the breach in question, for any loss that he may have suffered as a matter offact by reason of the breach of contract â which is not actionable against the contract-breaker.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  For all these reasons, there was no (actionable/substantial) breach and an essential element of the tort that Mr Griffiths reliedon is missing.  The plaintiffâs tortious claim must fail. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  Likewise, there was no (actionable/substantial) special damage.  And for that reason also, the tortious claim must fail.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â Causation of loss â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a>  Insofar as may be necessary, I would further find that save for those minority cases involving green form applicants who had withdrawnfrom the transactions and entered into TPS transactions and enjoyed a full refund as a result, the plaintiffâs tortious claim mustalso fail for want of proof of causation. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a>  In summary, according to the information provided in the applications for withdrawal, out of the 946 cases, only 50 purchasers withdrewfrom or did not proceed to complete their purchases solely because of the introduction of TPS or the flexible discount rate policy. Eventually, only 28 green form applicants joined the TPS. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  Out of the 420 cases, only 71 purchasers withdrew from or did not proceed to complete their purchases solely because of the introductionof TPS or the flexible discount rate policy.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  In relation to proof of causation, save for the exception mentioned, I simply wish to express my agreement with Ms Euâs submission.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a>  However, for those green form applicants who took part subsequently in TPS, I do find that the plaintiff has established the necessarycausal link.  Regardless of what reasons they gave in the withdrawal applications, common sense would dictate that the Housing Authorityâsannouncement that they would get a full refund of their nomination fees if they should enter into TPS as per the announced conditionsmust have played a significant role in their decisions to withdraw.  Of course, only those green form applicants who applied to withdrawafter the announcement was made can be regarded as having been affected by the announcement.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a>  As regards the flexible discount rates policy, regardless of whether it had any influence on the withdrawing home-ownersâ decisionsto withdraw, I simply do not accept the plaintiffâs underlying premise for its tortious claim.  The Housing Authority was and isfully entitled to announce whatever new policy relating to housing it sees fit to pursue.  The policy did not have any retrospectiveeffect (unlike the TPS policy which would involve a full refund).  In those circumstances, I totally fail to see how the plaintiffcould complain that the new policy gave future applicants/home-owners in future PSPS/HOS projects a better treatment than that offeredto home-owners of Charming Garden.  I fail to see how that could constitute a tort.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a>  As regards the retaining of priority, I find on the evidence before me that no such policy was implemented or announced by the HousingAuthority.  The plaintiffâs reliance on various newspaper cuttings was simply insufficient to prove the alleged announcement ofpolicy.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left"><i>â Conclusion on the tortious claim â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a>  For all these reasons, I also reject the plaintiffâs claim based on tort. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion on the Plaintiffâs claim against the Housing Authority</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  In conclusion, the plaintiffâs claim against the Housing Authority wholly fails.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusion on the Plaintiffâs claim against the Government</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  Also, for reasons explained above, the plaintiffâs claim against the Government based on implied terms must also fail. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  I wish to add that to the extent that the plaintiffâs claim against the Government is based on the allegation that the HousingAuthority was the Governmentâs agent and therefore the Government is vicariously liable for the wrong committed by the HousingAuthority, that claim must also fail as I have concluded that the Housing Authority has committed no wrong. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  I need not further lengthen this judgment by dealing with the plaintiffâs argument that the Housing Authority acted as the Governmentâsagent in the material events.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Outcome</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a>  I therefore order that the action by the plaintiff against the Housing Authority and the Government be dismissed. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a>  I also make a costs order <i>nisi</i> that the plaintiff pay to the Housing Authority and the Government respectively their costs of the action, to be taxed if not agreed.
