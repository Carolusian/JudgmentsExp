On 18th December 1997, after trial, Seagroatt J. dismissed the plaintiff's claim against all the defendants buton 6th March 1988 he made a costs order nisi that the 2nd and 3rd defendants pay the costs of the other parties. The judgment onliability was perfected on 21st January 1998 and the costs order nisi was made absolute on 11th March 1998. The time prescribed forlodging an appeal against judgment expired on 4th March 1998. The 2nd and 3rd defendants applied ex parte to a single judge of thiscourt for leave to appeal against the costs order dated 6th March 1998 made absolute on 11th March 1998. I granted leave on 23rdJune 1998. Notice of Appeal was accordingly filed as was the plaintiff's "Respondent's Notice and Cross-Appeal".</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> On 24th July 1998, the 1st and 4th defendants took out a summons to strike out the Notice of Appeal of the 2nd and 3rd defendantsand the plaintiff's/Respondent's Notice and Cross Appeal. On 31st October 1998, 2nd and 3rd defendants amended their grounds of appealby a Supplemental Notice of Appeal. On 10th November 1998, the 2nd and 3rd defendants again amended their Supplemental Notice ofAppeal.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Subsequent to the leave granted on 23rd June 1998 to appeal against the costs order, it was discovered that the 3rd defendant hadbeen struck off the company register on 29th March 1996 by the Registrar of Companies under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s290a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.290A</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>. However, the 3rd defendant was restored to the Company Register on 11th September 1998. All parties agree that under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s290a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.290A(6)</a> of the Ordinance the effect of the 3rd defendant's restoration is that the 3rd defendant "is deemed to have continued in existenceas if its name has not be struck off." It was the consensus that validity of the leave to appeal granted to the 3rd defendant wasno long a live issue, and the renewed application for leave to appeal made ex abundante cautela by Mr. Egan for the 3rd defendantwas therefore withdrawn.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> The 1st and 4th defendants indicate that in view of Supplemental Notice of Appeal and the Amended Supplementary Notice of Appeal,they would not proceed with their summons for striking out against the 2nd and 3rd defendants but they would seek costs against them.The outstanding matter in this appeal is therefore their application to strike out the plaintiff's Respondent's Notice and CrossAppeal.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The plaintiff in his Respondent's Notice and Cross Appeal seeks an order that the costs order under appeal be affirmed.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Wan submits that the plaintiff's prayer is formulated in two parts: to affirm or vary the costs order on additional grounds andto challenge the same by what would appear to be an effective appeal against the judgment on liability. This is a back door attemptto reopen the judgment on liability which is final and has been perfected for some time and the time for appealing against it haslong expired. The mounting of, in effect, an appeal against the judgment on liability should not be permitted. On the other hand,Mr. Brown says that he is entitled to re-open and matters of evidence evaluation and factual issues in order to illustrate the errorsin the costs order.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Turning to the summons to strike out the plaintiff's Respondent's Notice and Cross Appeal, insofar as the plaintiff seeks to affirmthe costs order on additional grounds, each and every so-called additional ground is founded on an attack at and criticism of determinationsof the judge and/or his evaluation of the evidence in the trial. It is only at the conclusion of a trial when matters are decidedthat the judge would proceed to consider, in the exercise of his judicial discretion, the question of costs. The matters decidedcannot be challenged except in an appeal against the judgment. Without any appeal against the judgment of the judge in this case,the costs order could not be impugned on the basis of any error in the matters so decided. Costs are to be considered and grantedin the overall circumstances of the case as decided by the judge in his judgment. In the consideration of costs after trial, a judgeinvariably guides himself by matters he has decided and those matters could not be reopened in a challenge solely against a costsorder by a litigant. Time for appeal against the judgment has expired, and no party may appeal against the judgment without leave.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Insofar as the Respondent's Notice and Cross Appeal seek to challenge matters upon which the judge relied in giving judgment, thepurported appeal against the judgment of the judge is out of time. No party may challenge findings of fact and rulings on law inan appeal exclusively against a costs order. Those matters could only be questioned in an appeal against the judgment itself. Timefor lodging an appeal against the judgment has long elapsed, and that is another obstacle which the plaintiff is unable to overcome.Clearly, the plaintiff's Respondent's Notice and Cross Appeal must be struck out in its entirety for the absence of any conceivablyarguable grounds of appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Moreover, the plaintiff subjects his Cross Appeal to the condition either that "the appeal being allowed ...... against (the costsorder) in that judgment" or that "(the costs order) being affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by the court below". Theseconditions are not very easy to follow but it is not suggested that either of these two conditions has been fulfilled.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> This is not a technical objection as it is important for a party in an appeal to disclose reasons to his adversaries so as to enablethem to, at least, understand what case they have to meet. In conclusion, the plaintiff's Respondent's Notice and Cross Appeal mustbe struck out with costs to D1 and D4.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> For the above reasons, the plaintiff's Respondent's Notice and Cross Appeal should be struck out with costs to the 1st and 4th defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> On the question of costs, since the 1st and 4th defendants do not proceed against 2nd and 3rd defendants in their application tostrike out, what is the justification for departing from the usual rule that costs are to follow the event? Mr. Wan says that thesummons was taken out simply because of the Notice of Appeal filed on 6th July 1998. The Supplemental Notice of Appeal filed on 31stOctober 1998 was "in place of" the original grounds. Mr. Wan concedes that the 1st and 4th defendants would not seek to strike outthe Supplemental Notice of Appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> D1 and D4 had notice of the Supplemental Grounds of Appeal "in place of" the original Grounds of Appeal at or about the end of October1998, some 3 weeks before the hearing of this appeal. I do not accept D1 and D4's excuse of requiring time to take instructions.No satisfactory explanation was given for not withdrawing part of the summons of D1 and D4 seeking to strike out D2 &amp; D3's Noticeof Appeal as amended. D1 and D4 should have the costs of the issuance of their summons to strike out against D2 and D3 but they shouldnot be given the costs of today. D1 and D4 did not withdraw their summons for striking out against D2 and D3. D3 came armed withits own summons for leave to appeal out of time against the costs order. D3's summons was in fact proceeded with and later withdrawn.In my view, D1 and D4 should have the costs of the issuance of the summons for striking out against D2 and D3. D2 should have costsof today's hearing against D1 and D4 as D2 had to attend in response to the application of D1 and D4 on their summons to strike outwhich had not been withdrawn. D3 is, in my view, in a different position. D3 came with its own summons and later withdrew it. Asbetween D1 and D4 on one hand and D3 on the other, in my view, there should be no order as to costs for the hearing of this appeal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Liu, J.A.:</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p>Nazareth, V.-P.:</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> I also agree.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> I would add the following. The plaintiff did not agree with all that Seagroatt J. held and said in his judgment. But having had enoughof the litigation and also having regard to the costs order nisi which subsequently became absolute, that D2 and D3 were to pay hiscosts (and also those of D1 and D4), he decided to call it a day on the basis of that order. He accordingly did not appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> Then out of time, and when time for him to appeal had also expired, D2 and D3 applied ex parte and obtained leave from Leong J.A.to appeal against the costs order. The relief they sought was that instead of the costs order made, the plaintiff should be orderedto pay D2 and D3 costs, and not only their costs but also D1 and D4's costs.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Not surprisingly, he decided to resist the appeal. I pause here to note that the plaintiff has represented himself for a substantialpart of the protracted proceedings. In the process he has, for a layman, acquired considerable skill in putting forward his case.Indeed, this has led Mr. Wan to submit that he should be regarded as if he were a qualified legal practitioner. I unhesitatinglyreject that submission, particularly in the context of the present applications. I cannot conceive of any legal practitioner gettinghis tackle as tangled up as the plaintiff has in his attempts to affirm the costs order.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> The plaintiff's primary objective, as he explained it, was to ensure that the costs order was not upset. To that extent, he onlywished to have that order affirmed. But if the appeal against the costs order was allowed, then he would want to appeal against thejudgment order dismissing his claim. He sought to express these objectives in the following way in his respondent's notice and cross-appeal:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"FOR AN ORDER THAT the Judgement be affirmed or affirmed on grounds other than those replied upon by the Court below and that the2nd Defendant does pay to the Plaintiff his costs of this appeal to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE THAT in the event of the appeal being allowed, in whole or in part against that Order in that Judgement, orif that Order be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by the Court below, Plaintiff Respondent Cross Appeals againstthe 1st Order in that Judgement, whereby it was ordered that Judgement be entered against the Plaintiff in favor of all Defendants;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">AND FOR AN ORDER THAT the decision be varied in whole or in part, and a Judgement be entered in favor of the Plaintiff against the2nd Defendant and that 2nd Defendant does pay to the Plaintiff and the 1st &amp; 4h Defendants the cost of this action, to be taxedif not agreed"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Immediately following that he listed twenty grounds with numerous sub-paragraphs, all of which, so far as I can see, are directedagainst the judgment, and not against the costs order. In effect, these are only grounds in support of a cross-appeal against thejudgment. Most of these appear to claim that findings in favour of the 2nd and 3rd defendants or against the plaintiff are inconsistentwith other specific findings also made by the judge or inconsistent with the evidence. In this welter of grounds, there are someincidental matters mentioned, i.e. findings and bits of evidence, that would go to the affirmation of the costs order.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> The respondent's notice and cross-appeal consist in substance of what is a cross-appeal. This, it is submitted by the 1st and 4thdefendants, he cannot bring out of time through the back door without leave.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> However, O59 r6 of the Rules of the High Court provides in effect that there are three kinds of respondent's notice:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"(a) to contend on the appeal that the decision of the court below should be varied, either in any event or in the event of the appealbeing allowed in whole or in part, or</p>        <p class="quote">(b) to contend that the decision of the court below should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by that court, or</p>        <p class="quote">(c) to contend by way of cross-appeal that the decision of the court below was wrong in whole or in part"</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> Having regard to (a), it would seem that the plaintiff may well be entitled to seek his second relief upon the contingent basis thathe places it, i.e. "in the event of the appeal being allowed in whole or in part" to the order, that judgment be entered againstthe plaintiff in favour of all defendants be varied.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> The net result of all of the foregoing may be that the plaintiff is entitled to proceed upon some or all of the grounds upon whichhe seeks to rely by means of his respondent's notice, with the reference to "cross appeal" deleted or disregarded. This aspect ofthe matter was not addressed before us. It was for the applicants before us, i.e. the 1st and 4th defendants, to address it.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> It may be that with only some textual deletions or amendments the respondent's notice and cross appeal should be permitted to standand not be struck out. In that matter it seems to me that this Court should not overlook the fact that the plaintiff is acting inperson.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> In the result it seems to me that the 1st and 4th defendants have not made out a case for the whole of the respondent's notice andcross-appeal to be struck out. The 1st and 4th defendants, it <em>prima facie</em> seems to me, have taken too extreme a stand in seeking the striking out of the respondent's notice and cross-appeal in its entirety.They did not require this to protect their position on the dismissal of the plaintiff's original claim, which he made clear at thehearing he was not concerned to pursue, except upon a contingent basis which would not arise.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> In any case, the appropriate and just order would be to adjourn the application for further argument to a date to be fixed. Thiswould enable the 1st and 4th defendants to make further submissions if they wished; the plaintiff to apply to amend his notice appropriatelyor take other steps he thought fit; or the parties to reach some acceptable arrangement.
