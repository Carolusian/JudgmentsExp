He appointed two of his brothers, TM Fok andFok Cho Yue as his "executors" (the correctness of this English translation is in dispute - see below).</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> On 19 August 1975, the deceased passed away. On 21 November 1975, Fok Cho Yue renounced his right and title as "executor" under thedeceased's will, leaving TM Fok as the only "executor". TM Fok instructed a firm of solicitors (C Y Kwan &amp; Co.) to handle probate,and in the course of it, an English translation of the will was prepared by a solicitor in the employ of the firm (Albert Ho). Thetranslation was certified by a court translator (C C Hsu).</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> On 1 August 1978, probate of the will was granted in favour of TM Fok as the executor named in the will.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> On 16 October 1978, upon legal advice, TM Fok as executor of the deceased took out a construction summons (High Court MiscellaneousProceedings No. 582 of 1978), seeking the court's determination on whether the executor had a general or specific power of appointmentunder the will. In short, the court was asked to determine whether the executor had a specific power to distribute the deceased'sresiduary estate amongst 16 specified persons (including, amongst others, TM Fok himself, the lawful widow and the four legitimatechildren of the deceased - see below), or whether the purported power to distribute was a general power to distribute to the worldat large (in which event the same would be void for uncertainty, resulting in an intestacy situation in respect of the residuaryestate).</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> The construction summons named another brother of the deceased (Fok Yan Nung) - one of the 16 potential appointees as a representativedefendant, to represent the potential appointees' interest in the litigation.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> The matter came before the late Zimmern J for determination. The certified English translation of the Chinese will was used by thecourt in the construction process. On 12 December 1979, the learned judge came up with a construction in favour of a power to distributeamongst the named persons only. In other words, no partial intestacy arose.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> By a twist of fortune, the order of Zimmern J was never drawn up and sealed by the solicitors then acting for TM Fok. The four legitimatechildren of the deceased including her only daughter Cynthia Fok ("the Children") were unhappy with the construction placed by thecourt, having found out the proceedings and the court's determination in around 1980. In May 1985, they successfully applied to theCourt of Appeal for leave to be joined as defendants in the proceedings. Furthermore, because Zimmern J's order was never sealed,time for appealing against the learned judge's order never began to run. In those circumstances, after the Children were joined asparties, they appealed against the determination to the Court of Appeal (Civil Appeal No. 28 of 1985). On 25 March 1986, the Courtof Appeal, which like Zimmern J relied on the certified English translation of the Chinese will for its determination of the appeal,allowed the appeal and held as a matter of construction that the power of appointment was in respect of the world at large. In thosecircumstances, it was void for uncertainty, and a partial intestacy situation thus arose in respect of the residuary estate of thedeceased.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> However, in the meantime, based on Zimmern J's order, and acting on legal advice, TM Fok had exercised the power of appointment,vesting the residuary estate on himself, with a view to making (strictly speaking - voluntary) distribution of the residuary estateso vested in favour of most of the 16 potential appointees. Indeed, distribution was so made according to a distribution plan devisedby him. It should be stressed that prior to the Court of Appeal's overturning of Zimmern J's construction of the relevant part ofthe will, TM Fok's appointment of the residuary estate in favour of himself was perfectly lawful, and what he did with the estateafter the vesting exercise was entirely within his own power.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Furthermore, TM Fok did not live long enough to see the overturning of Zimmern J's decision. He passed away on 28 May 1983. He wassurvived by his widow (Kimball Wong) and their daughter (Eugina Fok - the present Defendant). Kimball Wong was the named executrixof TM Fok's will, and as such she also became the executrix of the deceased (by succession) on 7 December 1983. On 5 June 1984, shealso obtained probate of the will of her late husband (TM Fok).</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> After the Court of Appeal judgment in 1986, and after the abandonment of an intended appeal to the Privy Council for which leavehad been obtained, on 22 January 1988, Jones J made an order discharging Kimball Wong as successive executrix of the deceased, andinstead appointed the Children as joint administrators of the estate of the deceased (with the will annexed), upon Kimball Wong'sown application (MP 1790 of 1987).</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> On 16 March 1992, the Children, as joint administrators of the estate of the deceased, commenced the present action by the issueof a writ of summons against Kimball Wong "as the sole executrix and beneficiary of the estate of [TM Fok] and thereby as the soleexecutor of the estate of [the deceased] since the death of [TM Fok] and the granting of probate to the will of [TM Fok]".</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> According to the general endorsement of claim, the claim against Kimball Wong is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"1. The Plaintiffs claim as Administrators of the Estate of Fok Cho Min, deceased, against the Defendant as the sole executrix andbeneficiary of the estate of Fok Tso Moon, deceased, and thereby as the sole executor of the Estate of Fok Cho Min, deceased, sincethe death of Fok Tso Moon and the granting of probate to the will of Fok Tso Moon, but who was discharged from further administrationof the Estate of Fok Cho Min by the Order of the Court dated 22nd January 1988.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2. The Plaintiffs' claim against the Defendant is for:-</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(i) An order for an account of the real and personal Estate of the said Fok Cho Min, deceased;</p>            <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="95%">                <tr>                    <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote">(ii)</td>                    <td valign="top" width="75%" class="quote">(a) An inquiry as to the loss suffered by the Estate of said Fok Cho Min deceased resulting from or occasioned by or in connectionwith the wilful default and/or fraudulent, reckless, negligent or other misconduct or omission on the part of Fok Tso Moon, deceasedand/or the Defendant in the administration of the Estate of the said Fok Cho Min;</td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                    <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote"></td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td valign="top" width="5%" class="quote"></td>                    <td valign="top" width="85%" class="quote">(b) An order that the Defendant do made good and pay to the Plaintiff such loss found to be suffered by the Estate or such sum orsums due by the Defendant to the Estate upon such inquiry together with interest thereon;</td>                </tr>            </table>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iii) An account of all profits by the Defendant and an order for payment upon the taking of such account;</p>        </blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(iv) All consequential or necessary orders, directions accounts or inquiries and all remedies of tracing;</p>            <p class="quote">(v) Further or alternatively, damages for and arising out of the aforesaid default or misconduct or omission and interest on suchdamages;</p>            <p class="quote">(vi) Further or other relief;</p>            <p class="quote">(vii) costs."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> The writ was not served within its one year of validity. Instead, on 16 March 1993, the writ was renewed, on application, for another12 months.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> On 27 October 1993, Liu J (as he then was) made an order in the 1987 action commenced by Kimball Wong for her discharge as successiveexecutrix of the deceased (i.e. MP 1790 of 1987) that the grant of probate of the will (back in 1978) of the deceased in favour ofTM Fok be revoked and declared null and void,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"without prejudice to any right claim or cause of action that the [Children] have or might have against [Kimball Wong] or other personsconcerned for any breach of trust, fraud, misconduct or negligence committed by her or them or by [TM Fok]".</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> In March 1994, the lawful widow of the deceased (Fok Chan Sau Mui), the natural mother of the Children, passed away.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> On 14 March 1994, 2 years less 2 days after the writ was first issued, it was finally served on Kimball Wong. She filed an acknowledgementof service on 29 March 1994, indicating an intention to defend the action. No statement of claim was filed by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> In 1995, the 2nd "wife"/concubine (or mistress) of the deceased (Wu Hor Kwai) passed away.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> More importantly, on 28 July the same year, Kimball Wong herself passed away. On 13 February 1996, probate was granted to KimballWong's daughter, Eugina Fok - the present Defendant, as executrix named in Kimball Wong's last will.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> Apparently because of disagreements amongst themselves and other reasons, in an action commenced by one of the four Children (CynthiaFok) against the other three (MP 371 of 1997), Pang J made an order appointing a judicial trustee (Gabriel Tam of KPMG Peat Marwick)of the estate of the deceased, in lieu of the Children as joint administrators, on 21 October 1997. Amongst other things, the judicialtrustee was specifically empowered under the order of the learned judge to employ lawyers "for the purposes of taking action againstany person or solicitors' firm for negligence or impropriety in relation to the [estate of the deceased] and/or in dealing with theassets of [the deceased's estate], including bringing or continuing any suit against the former executrix, Kimball Wong". A furtherorder was made by Pang J on 21 October 1997 giving further powers and directions to the judicial trustee.</p>    <p class="heading">Applications</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> On 20 July 2000, the judicial trustee took out an application in the present action to substitute himself as the sole Plaintiff inplace of the original Plaintiffs (the Children), and to substitute Eugina Fok as the Defendant (in her capacity as executrix) inplace of the deceased Kimball Wong, and more importantly for leave to file and serve a statement of claim out of time - more than8 years after the writ was first issued and 6 years after an acknowledgement of service was filed by Kimball Wong whilst she wasstill alive.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> On 26 August 2000, the Defendant took out an application to strike out the writ of summons and dismiss the action on the ground thatthe claims or causes of action in the present action had become time-barred, that no statement of claim had been filed, and/or thatthe action was liable to be struck out for want of prosecution.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> Steps were taken and further delay occurred before the two substantive applications were eventually heard by me, the parties havingbeen substituted by orders of the court.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> It should be remembered that apart from the deceased, TM Fok, Kimball Wong, the lawful widow of the deceased, and the second "wife"/concubine(or mistress) of the deceased, have all passed away as referred to above. Moreover, Fok Yan Nung (a brother of the deceased who wasnamed as the representative defendant in the construction summons) passed away in August 1982, and the other two brothers of thedeceased have also passed away. Furthermore, of the four Children, i.e. the original Plaintiffs in the present action, two have sincepassed away. Cynthia Fok, who has filed an affirmation in respect of the present applications, is now 77 or 78 years old. Her onlysurviving brother, Fok Shiu Ying, is also an elderly gentleman said to be in his 80s.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> I should also point out that in the judicial trustee's summons for leave to file a statement of claim out of time, it did not referto any specific statement of claim as such. No draft statement of claim was annexed to the summons. However, in a supporting affirmationfiled by the judicial trustee, a draft statement of claim prepared by the judicial trustee's then counsel was exhibited. That affirmationwas made in July 2000. On 9 May 2003, almost 3 years after the first surfacing of the draft statement of claim and literately minutesbefore the two applications were due to be heard by Yam J, the Plaintiff's present counsel (Mr Alexander Wong) produced to the courtand showed his opponent an amended draft statement of claim containing various important and most serious amendments to the originaldraft - see below. Being of the view that the Defendant should be afforded a decent opportunity to consider the latest draft, YamJ of his own motion adjourned the hearing, and that was the last link in the chain of events which led ultimately to my hearing thetwo applications.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> Given that the summons for leave to file a statement of claim does not specify a particular statement of claim in respect of whichleave is sought, strictly speaking the Plaintiff needs no leave from the court to amend the draft statement of claim or amend hissummons for leave to file the statement of claim out of time. The application for leave to file the statement of claim out of timewas in fact proceeded with on the basis of the latest amended draft. I have heard the two cross applications together. There are,of course, several possible ways to deal with the two applications. I find it convenient and I propose to deal with the amended draftstatement of claim first. My purpose is three-fold: first, if any matter, claim or cause of action pleaded in the latest draft isobviously unsustainable (because of pleading defects, lack of merits, or otherwise), that is of itself a good reason to at leastdisallow that part of the statement of claim to be filed out of time; secondly, if any of the pleaded causes of action <em>was</em> already time-barred when the writ was issued back in 1992, it should be struck out, which is indeed part of the Defendant's applicationto strike out; and thirdly, the question of whether the pleaded causes of action <em>are</em> time-barred (if the writ had not been issued in 1992) is of course of great importance to the Defendant's application to strike outbased on want of prosecution (see below).</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> Bearing all this in mind, I now turn my attention to the latest draft statement of claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Latest draft Statement of Claim</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> The first major complaint against TM Fok, which was added in the latest revision by the Plaintiff's present counsel, is in relationto the alleged mistranslation of the Chinese will (paragraph 5A). According to the pleading, the will was translated by Albert Hoand was certified by a court translator.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Paragraphs 5B to 5I, all under the caption "Fraudulent Practice on the part of TM Fok", make most serious allegations against TMFok. They read as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Fraudulent Practice on the part of TM Fok</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">5B. TM Fok who was well versed with the Chinese language knew and/or ought to know of the material difference between an "adoptedfather" and "step father" and knew and/or ought to have known the difference between a "kit fat wife" and a "concubine" and/or "mistress"and/or cohabitee.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">5C. TM Fok who at all material times knew the different status of Chan Sau Miu as the lawful and/or "Kit Fat" wife of CM Fok and WuHor Kwai as a mistress and/or cohabitee of CM Fok with a daughter Helen fathered by another man before staying in the household ofCM Fok.</p>        <p class="quote">5D. TM Fok was aware, knew and/or ought to have known that the whole spirit of the said Will in the Chinese language was not to makeTM Fok or Fok Cho Yue or any of them beneficiaries of the residual estate nor was there any absolute gift to them nor further anygift to them in default of distribution. By proposing a scheme of distribution wherein only 11 out of the special class of 16 personsreceived various shares out of the total of 105 shares of the residue estate after all special bequests made. By a Deed of Appointmentdated 14th April 1982, declared by TM Fok as self assumed executor, all unadminstered, undivided and unappointed estate had beenvested to himself.</p>        <p class="quote">5E. Well aware of the above as pleaded in paragraph 5B, 5C and 5D in the Statement of Claim herein TM Fok without the knowledge andconsent of the five next of kin of CM Fok applied to the High Court by way of Originating Summons naming Fok Yan Nung as representativedefendant on behalf of the persons named in the said Chinese Will based on the said mistranslated certified translation and an incompleteand incorrect selected branch of the family tree of CM Fok.</p>        <p class="quote">5F. TM Fok colluded with Fok Yan Nung by misleading the Court that there was a special power of appointment so that TM Fok and FokYan Lung and the other persons named in the said Chinese Will belonged to the class of persons to whom that special power of appointmentrelated would be benefited.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">5G. TM Fok should have been well advised by his legal advisers that had the Court decided the terms of the said Chinese Will had notcreated a power of appointment but a discretionary trust to the world at large such would be void for uncertainty the estate of CMFok would have devolved as if on intestacy whereby only those persons named in paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim hereof wouldbenefit from such intestacy.</p>        <p class="quote">5H.

D. 473</a>, 489, per Thesiger LJ. It is not necessary to use the word "fraud" or "dishonestly" if the facts which make the conduct complainedof fraudulent are pleaded; but, if the facts pleaded are consistent with innocence, then it is not open to the court to find fraud.As Buckley LJ said in <em>Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20Ch%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] Ch. 250</a>, 268:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"An allegation of dishonesty must be pleaded clearly and with particularity. That is laid down by the rules and it is a well-recognisedrule of practice. This does not import that the word 'fraud' or the word 'dishonesty' must be necessarily use...The facts allegedmay sufficiently demonstrate that dishonesty is allegedly involved, but where the facts are complicated this may not be so clear,and in such a case it is incumbent upon the pleader to make it clear when dishonesty is alleged. If he uses language which is equivocal,rendering it doubtful whether he is in fact relying on the alleged dishonesty of the transaction, this will be fatal; the allegationof its dishonest nature will not have been pleaded with sufficient clarity."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">That case is authority for the proposition that an allegation that the defendant "knew or ought to have known" is not a clear andunequivocal allegation of actual knowledge and will not support a finding of fraud. It is not treated as making two alternative allegations,i.e. an allegation (i) that the defendant actually knew with an alternative allegation (ii) that he ought to have know; but rathera single allegation that he ought to have known (and may even have known - though it is not necessary to allege this).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Before turning to the pleadings I would add one thing more. In order to allege fraud it is not sufficient to sprinkle a pleading withwords like "wilfully" and "recklessly" (but not "fraudulently" or "dishonestly").

So does the bulk of the other complaints ventilated before us. That being so, it is important toremember this. Our procedure aims to ensure that litigation, particularly the trial itself, is conducted fairly, openly, free fromsurprise, and without unnecessary delay or expense. In the attainment of that objective, pleadings have a fundamental role to play.Accordingly, there are a number of things which pleadings should do. Ideally, they would do them from the outset. In any event, theymust do them by the time they have been properly particularized - whether particularized on the pleader's own initiative, upon theother side's request, or pursuant to the court's order.</p>        <p class="quote">What those things are is to be gathered from the decided cases. That exercise has been performed by the learned editors of the <em>1993 Supreme Court Practice</em>. And, as one sees from note 18/12/2 at pp 307-308 of Vol. 1 thereof, the things which properly particularized pleadings must do areto:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(1) inform the other side of the nature of the case they have to meet as distinguished from the mode in which that case is to be proved;</p>            <p class="quote">(2) prevent the other side from being taken by surprise at the trial;</p>            <p class="quote">(3) enable the other side to know what evidence they ought to be prepared with and to prepare for trial;</p>            <p class="quote">(4) limit the generality of the pleadings, the claim and the evidence;</p>            <p class="quote">(5) limit and define the issues to be tried, and as to which discovery is required; and the hands of the party so that he cannot withoutleave go into any matters not included (although if the opponent omits to ask for particulars, evidence may be given which supportsany material allegation in the pleadings).</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">...<em>and especially where fraud is alleged</em></p>        <p class="quote">To the generality of the foregoing must be added the special rule that allegations of fraud must be pleaded distinctly and with theutmost particularity. The word 'distinctly' is the one used by Thesiger LJ in his well-known statement in <em>Davy v Garrett</em>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%207%20Ch%20D%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 7 Ch. D 473</a> at p. 489 as to how fraud is to be pleaded. And the expression 'utmost particularity', as one sees from note 18/8/8 at p. 297 ofVol. 1 of the 1993 <em>Supreme Court Practice</em>, is the one chosen by its learned editors and has the authority of their combined experience. That special rule arises in this case.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>Never before as much as now</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">None of the basic rules of pleading have anything to do with technicality. All of them have everything to do with practical justice.They have always been of importance. Never before as much as now. For these days, there are more and more cases so vast and so complexthat they push practically to its limit our system's capacity effectively to cope with them. Any laxity in their proper management,whether in regard to pleadings or anything else, can all too easily result in such cases spinning into confusion if not chaos - evenbefore trial but especially at trial. The present case, for the trial of which half a year has been reserved, is such a case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Fraud - defectively pleaded</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> On any fair reading, paragraphs 5B to 5E must be read and regarded as pleading a case of fraud against TM Fok, although in the bodyof those paragraphs, the word "fraud" has not been used, and Mr Alexander Wong - counsel who signed the latest draft - did not shyaway from this reading of his pleading at the hearing. As has been pointed out by Millett LJ in <strong>Armitage</strong>, it is indeed not necessary to use the word "fraud" or "dishonesty" if the facts which make the conduct complained of fraudulentare pleaded. Furthermore, these paragraphs are, as I observed above, pleaded under the caption "Fraudulent Practice on the part ofTM Fok".</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> No or no proper particulars of the allegation of fraud or "fraudulent practice", or the allegation of knowledge, alleged in paragraphs5B to 5E of the latest draft are pleaded. This is particularly objectionable when the translation was not done by TM Fok but by asolicitor (Albert Ho), and has been certified by a court translator, as indeed has been pleaded in paragraph 5A of the same draft.Although it is pleaded in paragraph 5B that TM Fok was "well versed with the Chinese language", in the absence of a further pleathat he was also well versed in the English language as well as the art of translating documents written in one language to another(as to which there is no evidence), the bare allegation that he was aware of the alleged mistranslation is totally hopeless.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The "ought to know" and "ought to have known" alternatives are totally insufficient to support an allegation of fraud. In any event,no particulars whatsoever are pleaded in support of these bare allegations.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> The allegation of "collusion" pleaded against TM Fok and Fok Yan Nung to "mislead" the court in the construction summons (paragraph5F) is likewise devoid of particulars.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> The "should have been well advised" in paragraph 5G is neither here nor there and certainly cannot support a case based on fraud.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> The fraud pleaded against TM Fok and his legal advisers in paragraph 5H is open to the same fatal objection.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> For this reason alone, insofar as this part of the draft seeks to plead a case of fraud against TM Fok, it is absolutely objectionableand cannot be allowed to remain in any statement of claim that the court may be minded to allow the Plaintiff to file out of time.Put another way, this part of the Plaintiff's case that is included within the ambit of the general endorsement in the writ of summonsmust be struck out as being scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or otherwise being an abuse of the process of the court.</p>    <p class="heading">Fraud - unsustainable on the pleaded facts</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> There are further reasons for objecting to this part of the latest draft. The alleged mistranslations are totally irrelevant to thePlaintiff's claim against TM Fok (and Kimball Wong) in respect of the administration of the estate. The simple fact is that bothZimmern J and the Court of Appeal, which arrived at opposite constructions relating to the (purported) power of appointment in question,based their different decisions on the same certified English translation that is now said to have contained mistranslations. Inother words, the alleged mistranslations of themselves did not cause the estate any loss.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> The absurdity of the situation is compounded by the fact that in fact two of the four Children have since commenced a negligencesuit against Albert Ho in relation to the alleged mistranslation of the Chinese will (HCA 9590/2000). In that action commenced bythem, <em>no</em> allegation of fraud was made against Albert Ho (or for that matter the court translator). Nor was TM Fok alleged to be a wrongfulparty to the alleged mistranslation. It should be remembered that according to the Plaintiff's own pleaded case (para. 5A), AlbertHo translated the will into English, which translation was certified by the court translator. Yet in this action, the Plaintiff,i.e. the judicial trustee, sees fit to plead through counsel a case of fraud against TM Fok who did not do the translation or thecertification.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> As to the bringing of the construction summons, and the appointment of the representative defendant to represent the interest ofthe 16 potential appointees, Mr Alexander Wong, in seeking to uphold the latest draft which bears his signature, tries hard to arguethat this caused loss to the estate (unlike the alleged mistranslations). Essentially he argues that nobody was named as a defendantto represent the next-of-kin (i.e. the lawful widow and the Children) who were interested in the construction issue because if thecourt construed the power as a general power of appointment, it would be void for uncertainty, and a situation of partial intestacywould arise.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> Putting aside pleading for the time being, on the material before me, the question of possible intestacy was a question squarelyplaced before Zimmern J, because this was one of the questions specifically raised in the originating summons (by way of an amendmentto the originating summons) for the court's determination. The appointment of Fok Yan Nung to represent the 16 potential appointees'interest under any specific power of appointment cannot be faulted. He was one of those potential appointees. As to the possibleinterest of the next-of-kin in case of intestacy, it must be remembered that at the time, neither the solicitors nor counsel of TMFok, nor the court, thought it necessary or desirable to appoint another representative defendant to represent their (the next-of-kin's)potential interest. The natural inference to be drawn must be that they were all satisfied that that interest would be well protectedby TM Fok as executor of the deceased. After all, although TM Fok was also one of the 16 potential appointees, he held his officeas executor under the probate granted by the court. He was represented by solicitors and counsel. There was no reason to supposethat his solicitors and counsel would not have put before the court all possible arguments regarding the true construction of thepower of appointment in question. Mr Alexander Wong accepts in argument that in order to make out a possible case of fraud, he needsto go further and ask the court to <em>infer</em> that TM Fok must have given instructions to his solicitors and counsel not to put forward wholeheartedly or at all the case of ageneral power of appointment and thus a possible case of partial intestacy, as a possible alternative for the court's consideration,in the construction summons.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> I can find no or no sufficient warrant for drawing that inference on the material before me. In any event, no such case has beenpleaded in the above extracted paragraphs in the latest draft whether by way of material facts or particulars. The one fact thatstands out from the material before me is that by way of an amendment to the originating summons, the court's attention was specificallydrawn to the possibility of partial intestacy.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> As regards informing the immediate family members or children of CM Fok regarding the proceedings, which is the subject matter ofparagraph 5H, by the nature of things, in order to sustain a case of fraud, the Plaintiff must also include the legal advisers ofTM Fok as party to the fraud, because after all, TM Fok commenced and prosecuted the construction summons through solicitors andcounsel. Indeed, this is what the Plaintiff has done in the latest draft, by pleading a case of fraud against not only TM Fok butalso his legal advisers. I have been referred to much of the material that has been filed for the purpose of the present applications.I can find no trace of any evidence suggesting fraud on the part of TM Fok's then legal advisers. As I noted above, in the otheraction commenced by two of the Children against Albert Ho, no fraud was alleged. I am very surprised that in this action, now maintainedby the judicial trustee, such an allegation of fraud is made.</p>    <p class="heading">Limitation periods</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> I now direct my attention to the limitation periods. Paragraph 7 of the latest draft pleads that as a result of the judgment of ZimmernJ, TM Fok exercised the power of appointment and "appointed and distributed to himself a sum of HK$494,316.66". Further, "a totalof about HK$13 million in cash and in kind had been distributed by TM Fok to persons who were otherwise not beneficiaries nor haveany beneficial interest in the estate".</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Paragraphs 20 to 33 of latest draft statement of claim go on to plead that TM Fok (and after his death Kimball Wong) failed to renderany account relating to the administration, particularly after the reversal of Zimmern J's decision by the Court of Appeal in 1986,and the discharge of Kimball Wong as successive executrix in 1987.</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> In the prayer for relief, the Plaintiff claims for an account and other mostly consequential relief, as well as damages.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> As regards limitation periods, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 4(1)(a)</a> and (2), <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">20</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">21</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>) are relevant, and it is convenient to reproduce them here:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"<em>4.

Any action against TM Fok (or Kimball Wong) regardingrecovery of any share in the residuary estate would therefore become time-barred by 1988 pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 21.</a></p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Mr Alexander Wong, in a desperate effort to rescue this part of the Plaintiff's claim, seeks to argue that in relation to the residuaryestate, the right of the Children to receive their share did not accrue until the Court of Appeal overturned the judgment of ZimmernJ in 1986. Therefore, so he argues, in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 21</a>, the claim was not time-barred in 1992 when the writ was issued. (Of course, even under this argument, unlike the purported causeof action based on fraud, the cause of action would have become time-barred by now if the writ had not been issued in 1992 - a matterthat is relevant to the Defendant's application to strike out for want of prosecution: see below.)</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> I am prepared to accept that based on cases like <strong>Re Johnson</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%2029%20Ch%20D%20964" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 29 Ch. D. 964</a>, time would not begin to run against a next-of-kin when there was no "present right to receive" his share of the estate, and therewas no present right to receive until the assets had been actually recovered by the administrator. That does not assist Mr AlexanderWong at all. Between 1975 when the deceased passed away and 1979 when Zimmern J rendered his (erroneous) construction of the purportedpower of appointment, the assets comprising the residuary estate (including the shares in Thailand - see below) were already formingpart of and in the possession of the estate of the deceased. The estate was already "in possession" of the assets. There was no questionof the estate or any personal representative of the estate taking any further action to recover the assets from an outside source.The reliance on <strong>Re Johnson</strong> is totally inapt. From 1975 onwards, the Children had a present right to receive their share in the residuary estate, and that isquite sufficient to dispose of Mr Alexander Wong's argument here. But in any event, as a matter of principle, I do not consider thatin the present context, an erroneous determination by a lower court of the right to distribution of an estate that was subsequentlycorrected by a higher court, can constitute a good reason for postponing the running of the limitation period.</p>    <p class="heading"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20(1)(a)</a> - fraud</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> However, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 21</a>, like <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 4(1)(a)</a> (tort) and (2) (account) as well as <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 20(2)</a> (trust), is subject to the provisions of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 20(1).</a> And <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 20(1)(a)</a> provides for a fraud exception.

In other words, so far as limitation is concerned, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 20(1)(a)</a> does not assist the Plaintiff.

(As analysed above, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 21</a> does not apply in any event.)</p>    <p class="heading"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26</a> - "concealed fraud"</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> In yet another desperate attempt to rescue this part of the Plaintiff's claim, Mr Alexander Wong seeks to pray in aid <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 26</a> of the Ordinance, i.e. "concealed fraud", based on cases like <strong>Tito v Waddell (No. 2)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%203%20All%20ER%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 3 All ER 129</a>, 244. That case was based on the now replaced s. 26(b) of the Limitation Act 1939, whereas the present s. 26 of our Ordinance isbased on s. 32 of the Limitation Act 1980. However, Mr Alexander Wong argues that at the material time, the old s. 26 of our Ordinance(which was replaced by the present s. 26 in 1991) was the applicable provision, and therefore it is the old s. 26 which should belooked at.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Regardless of the correctness of Mr Alexander Wong's argument in relation to which section one should look at, and regardless ofwhether "concealed fraud" needs to be pleaded in the statement of claim (or may be pleaded in the reply after the limitation defencehas been raised in the defence), the short and complete answer to counsel's argument is that no evidence whatsoever has been putforward by Cynthia Fok or her siblings of their having been kept in the dark for any material period of time as a result of any allegedconcealment. So far as the material that has been presented before the court is concerned, the Children were fully aware of the mattersnow being complained of for a long long time. In fact according to Cynthia Fok herself, in as early as 1986, she had already commencedan action (Miscellaneous Proceedings No. 1673 of 1986) against TM Fok's estate, and a statement of claim was indeed settled by counsel.But the writ was never served. Counsel's argument based on concealed fraud or deliberate concealment does not even get off the evidentialground.</p>    <p class="heading">Section 20(1)(b) - constructive trust</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Next, Mr Alexander Wong seeks to rely on s. 20(1)(b), already extracted above, to rescue the claim. He argues that given the Courtof Appeal's reversal of Zimmern J's order, TM Fok or his estate held the money distributed to him as constructive trustee. In otherwords, this is an action to recover from the constructive trustee the money wrongly distributed to him and converted to his use,within the meaning of s. 20(1)(b). It should be remembered that according to paragraph 7, TM Fok is only said to have pocketed $494,316.66personally; the rest of the residuary estate was distributed to others. In other words, at best, Mr Alexander Wong's argument isonly valid in respect of this sum of $494,316.66.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> But even in relation to this relatively small sum, Mr Alexander Wong's argument is hopeless for the simple reason that constructivetrust is never pleaded in the latest draft.</p>    <p class="heading">Shares in Thailand company</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> I now revert to the rest of the latest draft statement of claim. Paragraphs 8 to 19(1)-(3) of the latest draft plead a claim in relationto the deceased's shareholding in a company in Thailand. To cut a long story short, the Plaintiff's complaint is that the shareswere fraudulently transferred by the deceased's estate's nominee and trustee (SK Fok, the son of Fok Yan Nung) to his own name, whichwere then mortgaged to a bank for money used by SK Fok. This was discovered by TM Fok who then in his capacity as executor of thedeceased entered into a deed of undertaking and indemnity with SK Fok on 17 February 1981, providing for the repayment of the proceedsof sale of the shares (which sale was to be conducted by SK Fok himself) to the estate by instalments, in return for TM Fok's nottaking immediate action for recovery against SK Fok. However, no repayment was made, and in paragraph 19 the following is pleaded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"19. In the premises, TM Fok and the Defendant were guilty of wilful default and/or reckless or negligent misconduct in their dutiesin administering the estate of CM Fok.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:center" class="quote"><em>PARTICULARS</em></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(1) Allowing SK Fok to continue to exercise control and custody over the shares in the Thailand company, notwithstanding full knowledgeof his breach of trust;</p>        <p class="quote">(2) Sanctioning the sale of 205,920 shares by SK Fok and allowing him to receive the proceeds of the sale, notwithstanding full knowledgeof his breach of trust;</p>        <p class="quote">(3) Failing to take any action whatsoever against SK Fok or to recover the said shares or the proceeds or any part thereof."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> It should be noted that paragraph 19 does not plead any fraud. "Wilful default" or "recklessness" is not a plea of fraud, as hasbeen explained by Millett LJ in <strong>Armitage</strong> in the passage extracted above (see also pp. 250H-251D of his lordship's judgment in that case).</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> Insofar as this part of the case is based on tort, trust or account as explained above, the claim was long time-barred prior to thecommencement of action in 1992. Insofar as the Plaintiff's claim is one falling within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 21</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, it had also become time-barred by the time the writ was issued in 1992.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> Earlier on, in paragraph 10, fraud is pleaded in relation to a transfer of the shares from one set of nominees to a second set afterthe death of the deceased. Paragraph 10 reads as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Either SK Fok and/or TM Fok had fraudulently making use of the Powers of Attorney and transfer forms given by the following nomineesand deposited with and/or in the custody of him transferred their nominee shares from them to the following transferees.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="90%">            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote"><em>Transferor</em></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote"><em>Transferee</em></td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote">Fok Shiu Kong</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Fok Cho Moon</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote">Fok Sew Ki (Fok Shiu Kee)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Sewlong Sae Wong (Wong Sui Loong)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote">Fok Sew Chieng (Fok Shiu Cheung)</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Fok Sew Yew (Fok Cho Yue)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote">Fok Yin Hee</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Jinkong Sae Kwan (Kwan Chin Tong)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Yenghong Saw Fung (Fung Ying Hung)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Kompor Sae Wong (Kimball Wong)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Yee Lam Sae Low (Lo Yu Lam)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Kwong Wai Sae Lee (Lee Wong Wai)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote">Cynthia Fok Lee</td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Yenghong Sae Fung (Fung Ying Hung)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Yee Lam Sae Low (Lo Yu Lam)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td valign="top" width="42%" class="quote"></td>                <td valign="top" width="58%" class="quote">Tadseng Sae Lai (Lai Tat Shing)"</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> Everything I said above in relation to pleading fraud applies with equal force to paragraph 10. It is a hopeless plea. It is alsohopelessly confusing grammatically and in meaning. Likewise, it is wholly unsustainable in terms of substance. For it is clear, evenfrom reading the latest draft statement of claim itself, that the alleged fraudulent transfer of the shares from the first set ofnominees to the second set (pleaded in paragraph 10) did not cause the estate any loss, because the second set of nominees did nothingto cause the estate any loss. None of these nominees denied their status as nominees or trustees. Furthermore, although it was they(the second set of nominees) who eventually transferred their shares in favour of SK Fok, no allegation of fraud was alleged againstthis second set of nominees (paragraph 11A). Fraud was only alleged against SK Fok (but <em>not</em> TM Fok) in relation to this second transfer (paragraph 12).</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Indeed, no relief is sought in relation to the fraud alleged in paragraph 10, insofar as it constitutes an allegation of fraud againstTM Fok.</p>    <p class="heading">Miscellaneous complaints</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Next, several miscellaneous items of complaint are strangely pleaded as particulars under paragraph 19 of the latest draft, i.e.particulars (4) to (6). They relate to certain land owned by the deceased, the repayment of a debt in favour of a Japanese creditorand the mortgage of certain land belonging to the lawful widow of the deceased. Without burdening this judgment with further details,all that I would like to say is that insofar as they are intended to constitute complaints against TM Fok (or Kimball Wong), theyare most confusing if not unintelligible. In any event, from the limitation point of view, whatever the complaints are meant to be,they must have become time-barred well before the commencement of proceedings in 1992.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> Paragraph 38 of the draft statement of claim contains bare allegations of fraud and wilful default - "by reason of the matters aforesaid".No particulars whatsoever are supplied under paragraph 38. Likewise, wilful default and fraud are pleaded in paragraph (2) of theprayer for relief. For the reasons set out above, insofar as pleading fraud is concerned, they are all objectionable and hopelesspleas.</p>    <p class="heading">Summary</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> This ends my survey of the latest draft statement of claim and the relevant limitation periods. In summary, so far as the allegationsof fraud contained in the latest draft are concerned, they are wholly objectionable, unsustainable and hopeless. No statement ofclaim containing these allegations should be allowed to be filed out of time by the Plaintiff. Put another way, this part of thePlaintiff's claim, insofar as it is covered by the general endorsement, must be struck out. Secondly, all the other causes of actionrelied on in the latest draft, with the exception of the complaints based on tort, trust and/or account against Kimball Wong arisingafter the Court of Appeal judgment in March 1986, had become time-barred by the time the writ was issued in 1992. In other words,no statement of claim that the Plaintiff may be allowed to file out of time (if any) may be allowed to contain these claims, subjectto the above exception. Put another way, insofar as the general endorsement contains these claims, it should be struck out.</p>    <p class="heading">Application to strike out</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> I shall now move on to consider the Defendant's application to strike out based on want of prosecution, abuse of process and laches.Some preliminary remarks are required. I need to consider the Defendant's application to strike out for two reasons. First, in caseI am wrong with my determination relating to the viability of the various pleas of fraud, or the expiry of the limitation period(s)relating to the various pleaded causes of action (apart from fraud) prior to the commencement of action in 1992, I need to considerthe Defendant's alternative argument based on want of prosecution, abuse of process and laches. The other side of the same coin isthat the Defendant's argument may, in any event, provide an additional reason for my rejecting the Plaintiff's case based on fraudand these other causes of action. Secondly, I need to deal with the Defendant's argument based on want of the prosecution, abuseof process and laches because as I analysed above, the complaints based on tort, trust and/or account against Kimball Wong arisingafter March 1986 were not time-barred in 1992 when the action was commenced.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Want of prosecution is referred to in the Defendant's summons to strike out. Abuse of process is not. Nor is laches. However, noobjection was taken by the Plaintiff in relation to these further arguments based on abuse of process and laches, and indeed bothcounsel addressed me thoroughly on the relevant principles and their application to the facts of the present case. In those circumstances,there is no question of my not entertaining these additional grounds to strike out.</p>    <p class="heading">Want of prosecution</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The law on striking out based on want of prosecution is reasonably well established. The relevant principles may be convenientlyfound in <em>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2002</em> para. 25/L/1 <em>et seq</em>. A very convenient summary of these principles may also be found in the judgment of Poon DJ in <strong>Formative Way Co. Ltd v Lam Soon Warehouse Co. Ltd</strong>, HCA No. 5312/1991 (22 October 2001) paragraphs 16-33. I will not burden this judgment further by reciting these well-establishedprinciples here.</p>    <p class="heading">Inordinate delay</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> I have no doubt on the material before me, including the chronology of events in the present case, that this is a case of inordinatedelay. The writ was issued in 1992. It was not served until 1994. As has been made clear by Ribeiro JA (as he then was) in <strong>Hymer v Mass Transit Railway Corporation</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%202%20HKLRD%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 2 HKLRD 589</a>, 606I-J, the inactivity pending the service of a writ can be taken into account when assessing the overall delay in the event thatinordinate and inexcusable delay subsequently ensues, although the writ remains valid for service for such a period under the Rulesof the High Court. See also <strong>Roebuck v Mungovin</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20AC%20224" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 AC 224</a>, 234. The significance of this will emerge in due course.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> After service of the writ in 1994, and after receiving the acknowledgement of service from Kimball Wong indicating her intentionto defend the action, nothing was done by the then Plaintiffs. No statement of claim was filed, or was sought to be filed until July2000 (by the judicial trustee). It is true that the judicial trustee was appointed by the court in 1997, and the court authorizedthe judicial trustee to carry on with the present action. But no action was taken by the judicial trustee for almost 3 years, inrelation to the filing of a statement of claim (out of time).</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> The delay involved in the present case is inordinate.</p>    <p class="heading">Inexcusable delay</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> Likewise, I am of the view that the delay involved is inexcusable. Both the judicial trustee and Cynthia Fok have filed affirmationsto explain to the court the reasons for the delay. In a nutshell, Cynthia Fok could not find a single counsel who was prepared toplead and put forward on her behalf a case that accorded with her subjective understanding of the estate's claim or the Children'sclaim against TM Fok and Kimball Wong. According to the evidence, no less than 20 counsel, all eminent - many of them silks (or havesince taken silk), have been retained by Cynthia Fok and her siblings at one stage or another. Both local counsel as well as Londonsilks were involved. Some of the counsel involved have since become most prominent members of the Judiciary. Yet according to CynthiaFok's own affirmation (as supplemented by counsel's explanation from the bar table), none of them agreed to put forward her casein the way she wanted it to be done. Because of disagreements between clients and counsel (and I should add, solicitors - and therewere quite a number of them involved throughout the years), as well as arguments amongst the Children themselves, no statement ofclaim could be finalized until 2000.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> The situation did not improve after the appointment of the judicial trustee, who however never sought the court's direction in relationto his difficulties. The judicial trustee, being personally removed from the facts involved, was in fact in a worse position thanCynthia Fok and her siblings, because he needed, according to his affirmation, to obtain instructions from these children of thedeceased (which was, according to him, no easy task), in order to finalize the statement of claim, and proceed with the present action.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> The draft exhibited to the judicial trustee's supporting affirmation for leave to file a statement of claim out of time was settledby counsel and finalized eventually in 2000. The Plaintiff's present counsel was instructed subsequently, and as noted above, hecame up with an amended draft statement of claim literately minutes before the scheduled hearing before Yam J. Except the bare referencesto fraud contained in paragraph 38 and prayer (2) of the draft (- for which the present counsel must also bear "successive" responsibility),all other allegations of fraud were penned by the present counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> I consider all this as no excuse or justification for the delay. In my judgment, the internal disagreements between lawyers and clients(or amongst the Children) cannot, on the facts, constitute an excuse for the inordinate delay. The matter has to be viewed from theangle of the Defendant, or at least objectively: <strong>Ho Hip Lik v Kwan Man Ho</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20HKLR%20184" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 HKLR 184</a>, 186A.</p>    <p class="heading">Bar Code paragraph 113</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> Incidentally, if the latest draft statement of claim, which apparently received Cynthia Fok's blessing and approval, does reflectthe type of case (i.e. a case of fraud) that she unsuccessfully wanted her many previous counsel to plead and lend their names to,I can well understand why (at least until recently) no counsel worth his salt agreed to do so (if I may say so with the greatestrespect). The repeated refusal of counsel and solicitors to put forward Cynthia Fok's intended case on her behalf speaks volumesof the utter lack of merits of her intended case (in relation to fraud).</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> I would venture to add that the general trust and confidence that members of the Bar enjoy from the Bench in respect of their workin court are, to a not insignificant extent, established and maintained by their vigorous adherence to salutary rules of conduct,such as the one that prohibits counsel from putting forward a case of fraud (and the like) without proper foundation: see <em>Code of Conduct of the Bar</em>, para. 113<sup>1</sup>; any erosion of these rules in practice, particularly by senior and experienced members of the Bar, would not only be regrettablebut would also threaten to undermine the Bench's general trust and confidence in the professional integrity of those appearing beforeit, which is of great importance to the proper and efficient administration of justice. Rules of conduct must take precedence overpressure from lay clients to which counsel must not succumb; they must not allow themselves to degenerate into their clients' meremouthpieces. Indeed rules of conduct like paragraph 113 are designed to protect counsel from unjustified demands made of them bylay clients.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> All this is really trite. That I find it necessary to make the above observations in this case is of itself disturbing.</p>    <p class="heading">Prejudice</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> Returning to the question of delay, the next question is prejudice. Here, not only must the Defendant show prejudice, she must alsodemonstrate a causal link between the delay complained of and the prejudice. Prejudice caused by pre-writ delay, no matter how serious,is of itself insufficient. However, it may be taken into account if post-writ delay did cause some further or other prejudice tothe defendant: see <strong>Birkett v James</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 297</a>, 323G-H.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> The prejudice in the present context basically relates to the risk that it is not possible, because of the delay, to have a fairtrial of the issues; further, the delay is such as is likely to cause or to have caused serious prejudice to the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> So far as prejudice caused by pre-writ delay is concerned, one must remember that most of the persons concerned died before 1992.So for instance, Fok Yan Nung died in 1982. TM Fok died in 1983. Moreover, so far as the shares in the Thailand company are concerned,SK Fok died in 1990.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> But perhaps more importantly, in terms of post-writ delay, Kimball Wong, who according to the available evidence, should have beenprivy to many of the matters pertaining to the administration of the deceased's estate whilst her husband was still alive, and whowas herself responsible for its administration between 1983 and 1987, passed away in 1995. If the writ had been served promptly afterits issue and the statement of claim filed within time accordingly (which is relevant to post-writ delay as has been explained above),Kimball Wong should have had a decent opportunity to respond to the various allegations that are now being belatedly made againsther late husband and herself. It may be that even if the action had been prosecuted expeditiously, there would not have been a trialof the action prior to 1995 when Kimball Wong died. But at the very least, Kimball Wong would have been in a good position to giveall the necessary instructions and statements to her solicitors in defence of the (then) Plaintiffs' claim, and if that had beenthe case, her daughter, Eugina Fok, who does not, according to the evidence available, know anything about her parents' dealingswith the estate, would not have been in the same position as she now finds herself to be in, i.e. being totally in the dark in relationto the complaints now belatedly made by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> In my judgment, this is a very serious prejudice. I am tempted to say that this alone is sufficient to satisfy the need to establishprejudice and a causal link between delay and prejudice. But of course, this is not the only prejudice that the Defendant can identify.The lapse of time must have had a great and serious impact on the recollection of all potential witnesses, such as TM Fok's and KimballWong's former legal advisers, including Albert Ho and his colleagues in C Y Kwan &amp; Co. at the time, as well as those in Baker&amp; McKenzie who had the opportunity of advising Kimball Wong afterwards - assuming that these potential witnesses can be locatednow. All this must be viewed in the context that the complaints in question relate to matters that happened almost 20 years ago ifnot longer.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> Of course, once prejudice resulting from post-writ delay can be established, the Defendant can pray in aid the prejudice flowingfrom the <em>pre-writ</em> delay as well. I have already mentioned the demise of people like SK Fok, the alleged culprit in relation to the shares in the Thailandcompany. He passed away in 1990, whereas the complaint relating to the shares can be traced to the deed of undertaking and indemnitythat was executed back in 1981. It should also be noted that between 1987 and 1997, the four Children were themselves administratorsof the estate, yet they took no action against SK Fok when SK Fok was still alive. Ten years after his demise, the surviving Children,through the judicial trustee, first sought to lay the blame on TM Fok in respect of the deed and his alleged inaction, as well asKimball Wong (in respect of her period of executorship). And 3 years afterwards (i.e. 20 years after the death of TM Fok, 13 yearsafter the death of SK Fok and 8 years after the death of Kimball Wong), serious allegations of fraud were added against all thesedeceased persons. In my judgment, all this is totally unfair, and viewed in the context of prejudice, seriously prejudices the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> I wholly disagree with the suggestion made by counsel in his written submission that this is a typical Chancery case that can bedecided by reference to documents. I need only refer to the various serious allegations of fraud and factual issues to demonstratethe nonsensical nature of this submission.</p>    <p class="heading">Expiry of limitation periods</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> The next question is the often-vexed question of limitation. It is of course trite that generally speaking, unless the cause of actionhas by the time of application to strike out become time-barred (but for the commencement of the action that is being sought to bestruck out), there is no point in striking out the action, because the plaintiff can always commence a new action on the followingday.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> I have already analysed above why in my judgment, subject to one exception, all causes of action relied on in the latest draft areeither unsustainable (i.e. those fraud pleas) or were already time-barred when the writ was issued. Moreover, in relation to theonly exception, i.e. those complaints based on tort, trust and/or account against Kimball Wong in respect of matters arising afterthe Court of Appeal judgment in 1986, they have also become time-barred by now (but for the issue of the present action). In thosecircumstances, so far as these complaints are concerned, limitation period does not provide an answer to the Defendant's applicationto strike out based on want of prosecution.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> For all these reasons, in my judgment, as an additional or (as the case may be) alternative reason for striking out the general endorsement,and dismissing the present action, the Plaintiff is guilty of inordinate and inexcusable delay in the prosecution of the presentaction, resulting in serious prejudice to the Defendant, and in the exercise of my discretion, I would also order the striking outof the general endorsement, and in particular the Plaintiff's complaints against Kimball Wong following the Court of Appeal judgmentin 1986. In my judgment, this is a plainly bad case of want of prosecution.</p>    <p class="heading">Strike-out even if limitation periods had not expired</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> For the sake of completeness, I should go one step further. Even if I am wrong above and the pleas of fraud are sustainable, andthe other causes of action are still not time-barred even up to now, I would still be of the view that this is a case for strikeout for want of prosecution. The non-expiry of the limitation period is <em>not</em> an absolute bar to a strike out: <strong>Barclays Bank Plc v Miller</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20WLR%20346" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 WLR 346</a>; <strong>Hicks v Newman</strong>, Hoffman J (6 July 1986), referred to in <strong>Barclays Bank</strong> on p. 348C-G; <strong>Wright v Morris</strong>, Millett J (25 October 1988), also referred to in <strong>Barclays Bank</strong> on pp. 348H-349C, just to cite a few authorities. The question depends on whether there is anything to be gained by dismissing thecurrent action now. This must depend on the facts. For instance, if the question of whether the limitation period has expired isa serious and difficult one, something may be gained by dismissing the action now, leaving the plaintiff, if he so chooses, to commencea fresh action, and until he does so and until the defendant applies to strike out the new action or to have the matter tried someother way based on the limitation defence, the court need not expend valuable court time and resources in resolving the questionof limitation: see <strong>Barclays Bank</strong> at p. 348A-C (per Staughton LJ).</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> Another possible benefit is where it is not certain that the plaintiff will commence a new action if his current one is dismissed.For instance, if he is on legal aid, or otherwise lacks means to commence a new action, striking out his current action may be anadvantage to the defendant: see <strong>Hicks</strong>, <strong>supra</strong> (<strong>Barclays Bank</strong> on p. 348F-G).</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a> The benefit, if any, to be gained by the court or by the defendant, to strike out the current action prior to the expiry of the limitationperiod, must depend on the facts, and cannot be exhaustively stated.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a> Returning to the facts of the present case, assuming that the limitation period(s) involved in the Plaintiff's claims have not expiredby now, I am of the view that nonetheless the action should be struck out, given the inordinate and inexcusable delay, and giventhe prejudice caused (and to be caused) to the Defendant. The benefit to be gained by the Defendant is this. The administration ofthe estate is now in the hands of the judicial trustee appointed by the court pursuant to Part VI of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29">Cap. 29</a>). He is subject to the control and supervision of the court as an officer of the court: <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 63(3).</a> The court may, either on request or without request, give to him any general or special directions in regard to the trust (estate)or the administration of the trust (estate): <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 63(4).</a> See generally <em>Halsbury's Laws of Hong Kong</em> Vol. 26 para. [400.148].</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a> On the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, if the action is struck out, and if the judicial trustee is requiredby the Children to commence a fresh action against the Defendant, in my judgment, there are very good reasons to think that he should(and thus it is likely that he would) seek the specific direction of the court for sanctioning the intended (new) action. I totallyreject Mr Alexander Wong's argument that if the judicial trustee is indemnified (as to costs) by any interested party to commencethe new action, he can commence the second action without reference to the court. As I said, according to law, he is under the controland supervision of the court as the court's officer in the administration of the estate. What is involved is not only the privateand personal interest of the Children. What is also involved is first, the due, proper and prompt administration of the estate inquestion (for which the judicial trustee was appointed in the first place); and secondly and more importantly, the public policythat valuable court time and resources should not be wasted, and the process of the court abused, by litigants - least of all a judicialtrustee - commencing or maintaining frivolous or vexatious actions against others.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> And if the judicial trustee does decide to seek such a direction from the court, with a view to persuading the court to sanctionthe new action, he would most likely require a good counsel's opinion (probably an experienced silk's opinion) on the merits of theproposed action in support of his application for sanction. Based on what I know about this case, and given the repeated refusalby numerous prominent and eminent counsel both local and London to run the Children's case before, I doubt very much whether he canobtain such a good counsel's opinion. And certainly, I doubt very much whether the court hearing his application would sanction thesecond action. But in any event, that is not precisely the point here: the real point here is that the very existence of a real possibilitythat the judicial trustee, for his own protection if not for anything else, may find it necessary to seek and obtain the court'ssanction before commencing a second action must be considered as a benefit to the Defendant if the present action is struck out notwithstanding(<em>ex hypothesi</em>) the non-expiry of the limitation period. The situation is akin to the one about legal aid referred to by Hoffman J (as he then was)in <strong>Hicks, supra</strong>.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> As regards Mr Alexander Wong's argument that apart from the judicial trustee, the surviving Children may bring a fresh action againstthe Defendant if the present action is struck out, whilst I cannot exclude such a possibility given the characters involved in thepresent case, the matter should be looked at from the opposite angle. The benefit to the Defendant if the present action is struckout notwithstanding the (assumed) non-expiry of limitation period up to now is that the possibility of the surviving Children bringinga fresh action is just a possibility. In other words, there is equally a possibility that no such action will be brought by theseelderly persons. That (i.e. the chance) of itself is some benefit that I can take into account. Moreover, any such action will notbe as straightforward as an action brought by the judicial trustee, because the administration of the estate is now vested by thecourt in the judicial trustee's hands. For one, the Children would need to join the judicial trustee as a co-defendant in order tosue the Defendant. Secondly, the refusal (<em>ex hypothesi</em>) of the judicial trustee to commence a fresh action would constitute additional ammunition to the Defendant in her defence of thenew action. This again must be a benefit to the Defendant as well.</p>    <p class="heading">Abuse of process</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> I now turn to the argument based on abuse of process. Regardless of whether this is regarded as falling within the contumelious defaultlimb for striking out, or as a separate ground for striking out based on abuse of process, there is more than sufficient authorityto the effect that if a plaintiff has no intention to bring to a conclusion an action commenced by him, the commencement or the continuationof the action amounts to an abuse of process, and the action is liable to be struck out notwithstanding the absence of prejudiceor the non-expiry of the limitation period. Delay is very often relevant here because it is good evidence of a lack of intentionto bring to a conclusion the litigation. See for instance, <strong>Grovit v Doctor</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20WLR%20640" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 WLR 640</a>; <strong>Arbuthnot Latham Bank Ltd v Trafalgar Holdings Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%201426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 1426</a>; <strong>Advaita Enterprises v Seafast Marine Transport Inc</strong>, HCCL No. 241/1995 Chung J (24 November 2001) where the learned judge explained the lack of an intention to bring to a conclusiona piece of litigation on the part of the plaintiff as meaning the lack of a "definite" intention to do so, as is in the case of theissue of a so-called "protective writ" (which was the case in <strong>Arbuthnot</strong>).</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> In my judgment, the present case is a worse case than the case where a plaintiff commences or continues a piece of litigation withno intention, or no definite intention, to bring it to a conclusion. This is a case where a plaintiff commences an action when hedoes not know how to formulate his case. In other words, he sues before he knows what to sue, or before he can make up his mind asto the subject matter of his complaint. In this regard, the plaintiff must be equated with his counsel and solicitors. In other words,in the present case, the four Children commenced the present action before they and their legal advisers were <em>ad idem</em> and thus knew what they wanted to sue about, and of course it is the function of a statement of claim to set out precisely what aplaintiff wishes to sue and ask the court to grant him relief about.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> Moreover, one must not forget that one only needs to resort to abuse of process here if the limitation period has not expired evenup to now. In other words, based on that assumption, there is really no rush to commence the action, as the limitation period hasnot expired. There is therefore no justification for commencing the action before knowing what one really wants to complain about(which of course has to be fully reflected in a statement of claim). The plaintiff can always wait, as the limitation period hasnot and will not expire (<em>ex hypothesi</em>, such as in a case based on fraud), until he and his legal advisers can agree on a definite version of the statement of claim, or(failing that) until the plaintiff prepares his own statement of claim acting in person.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> That, shortly put, is why in my judgment, this is a worse and therefore an <em>a fortiori</em> case, when compared with the typical cases for strike out based on abuse of process.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> This is therefore an additional or (as the case may be) alternative reason for striking out the present action.</p>    <p class="heading">Laches</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> Finally, laches is also relied on by Mr Horace Wong (counsel for the Defendant - who has argued the Defendant's case, if I may sayso with respect, with competence and restraint) as an additional reason supporting the strike out application. The general principlesmay be conveniently found in <em>Spry, Equitable Remedies</em> (6th ed.) 431 to 438. Whilst usually laches is relied on as a substantive defence at trial, there is authority to the effect thatit may be relied on in support of a strike out application if the facts are clear: <strong>The estate of</strong> <strong>Yang Sen-hui (deceased) v Pao Yuen Tung Hsing Yieh Co. Ltd</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20HKLR%20124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] HKLR 124</a>, see the majority judgment of Kempster J (as he then was) on pp. 145G-147D.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> The two essential requirements here are delay and resulting prejudice. I do not wish to lengthen this judgment unnecessarily by dwellingon these points. Delay and prejudice have been canvassed in some detail above. The same points may be made in the present context.For the reason of laches as well, I am of the view that first, insofar as the want of prosecution ground is concerned, this plugsthe hole created by the non-expiry of any limitation period (which is, as discussed above, in any event not fatal), and secondly,it constitutes a ground of itself to strike out any claim that is not statute-barred.</p>    <p class="heading">Order</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> In conclusion, I dismiss the Plaintiff's application to file a statement of claim out of time. I order that the writ of summons bestruck out, and the action be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Indemnity costs</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> As regards costs, I make a cost order <em>nisi</em> that the costs of the two summonses in question be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant forthwith, 50% on a full indemnity basisand the remaining 50% on a party and party basis it must be apparent from the above judgment that I consider that this is a reallybad case in relation to the various hopeless pleas of fraud, and also when a judicial trustee, an officer of this court, is involvedwithout any updated direction from this court (after the original directions given by Pang J back in 1997 regarding the continuationof the present action), such costs to be taxed if not agreed. As regards whatever costs that are left of this action, I also orderthat they be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant but only on a party and party basis, subject to taxation as well. Unless eitherparty applies to vary this order <em>nisi</em> within 14 days after this judgment is handed down, the same shall become absolute upon the expiry of the 14-day period.</p>    <p class="heading">Directions to judicial trustee</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> As foreshadowed by my above discussion relating to the role of the judicial trustee, and in the exercise of the court's jurisdictionto control and supervise the judicial trustee as an officer of this court pursuant to the provisions in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/29/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 63(3)</a> and (4), I give the following directions (which can be made without any request), subject to any further or other directions of thecourt:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The judicial trustee shall seek and obtain the sanction of the court if he wishes to lodge an appeal from this judgment, and ifnecessary, he shall apply for an extension of time to appeal pending the obtaining of the sanction of the court;</p>        <p>(2) The judicial trustee shall obtain the sanction of the court before he can (if he so wishes) commence a fresh action against theDefendant based on the same or similar facts;</p>        <p>(3) The above direction shall take effect despite the offer (if any) of an indemnity for costs or otherwise by anybody regarding thelodging of the appeal and/or the commencement of a fresh action.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> In so giving the directions, I wish to make two things clear: First, the directions are not intended or designed to take away orotherwise affect the estate's general right to appeal against this judgment; rather they are directed at the control and supervisionof the judicial trustee in the proper performance of his duty in the administration of the estate as an officer of the court.</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> Secondly, in my above consideration regarding whether I should exercise the court's discretion to strike out the present action forwant of prosecution on the assumption that the limitation periods have not expired by now, and in particular in my above deliberationregarding whether any benefit would be gained by so striking out the present action, including the possibility that the judicialtrustee may for good reasons wish to apply for the court's sanction for the commencement of a fresh action, I have <em>not</em> taken into account the above directions that I have decided to give. Instead I worked on the assumption that no directions wouldbe given by the court of its own motion, but that there is a real possibility that for his own good or otherwise, the judicial trusteewould on his own initiative seek the court's direction and sanction.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> I make the above clear to avoid any possible argument that I based myself on a self-manufactured (as it were) reason to support mydecision to strike out.</p>    <p class="heading">Judgment handed down in court</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> The seriousness of the matters raised in these applications and the importance of some of the matters discussed in this judgment,particularly in relation to the pleading of fraud, convince me that I should adjourn the matter to open court for handing down thisjudgment, with a view to achieving a wider circulation of this judgment and thus a better awareness of what is said in the judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> I regret that I find it necessary to use strong words relating to what has happened in the present case.
