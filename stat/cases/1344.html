The action was based on a loan agreement signed by theparties dated 27 February 1998 in which the plaintiff agreed to lend the money to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and which the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant agreed to repay by 28 February 2001. </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiff pleaded that the loan was made by the plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for the discharge of other loans previously lent by the plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The defence raised by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was that the loans were not lent to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant but to another company registered in British Virgin Islands (âBVIâ) whose name was exactly the same as that of the1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  That company is the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant in the present action. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiffâs application in that action for summary judgment against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on the loan was dismissed. </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The plaintiff then on 16 October 2006 commenced the present action against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant who was a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants was also sued.  The plaintiff obtained judgment against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 3 November 2007.  The documents disclosed that the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was struck off from the register of companies in BVI. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Hence the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is the only remaining defendant in this action.  It applied to strike out the plaintiffâs claim.  The application wasrefused by the Master who granted leave to the plaintiff to amend its statement of claim.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant appealed to Suffiad J who allowed the appeal and set aside the orders of the Master.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant now appeals to this Court. </p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The background of the case has been succinctly summarised by Suffiad J which I will gratefully adopt in this judgment :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â <i>Ba</i><i>ckground</i></p>        <p class="quote">2.  The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Hong Kong with backing from Hainan Development Bank.</p>        <p class="quote">3.  Upon its incorporation in Hong Kong, its two directors were Liu Yu and Gu Rong who were also the shareholders nominated by HainanDevelopment Bank to hold the shares in the plaintiff on its behalf.</p>        <p class="quote">4.  Liu Yu was the managing director responsible for the day to day running of the plaintiff while Gu Rong was a non-executive directortaking no active part in the management of the plaintiff.</p>        <p class="quote">5.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was incorporated in Hong Kong on 20 January 1997 initially under the name of Fine Honest Development Ltd.  On 18 May 1997it changed its name to Concord International Group Ltd.  On 19 September it further changed its name to Concord Strategic InvestmentsLtd.</p>        <p class="quote">6.  The 3<sup>rd</sup><sup> </sup>defendant is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Island on 12 December 1996 initially under the name of Union System Ltd. On 22 May 1997, it changed its name to Concord International Group Ltd and on 29 August 1997 it further changed its name to ConcordStrategic Investments Ltd.</p>        <p class="quote">7.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was at all material times a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.</p>        <p class="quote">8.  Prior to 15 October 1997, the shareholders of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant were :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">(a) the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant (about 40%);</p>            <p class="quote">(b)   the plaintiff (about 30%);</p>            <p class="quote">(c) China Great Wall Coins Investment Ltd (about 30%); and</p>            <p class="quote">(d)   Liu Yu (about 0.0024%).</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">9.

As of 31 August 2000, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant still held a 70% interest in Concord Group (BVI) Ltd, the parent company of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>        <p class="quote">12.  During the period between April 1997 to September 1997 a total of eight loans were advanced by the plaintiff pursuant to eightwritten loan agreements.  In February 1998 a 9<sup>th</sup> loan agreement was entered into by the plaintiff which was a consolidation of all the outstanding amounts from the earlier eightloans advanced by the plaintiff and stated therein to be $30,281,806.33.</p>        <p class="quote">13.  In the 1<sup>st</sup> loan agreement, the borrower was named as Fine Honest Development Ltd.</p>        <p class="quote">14.  In the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> loan agreements, the borrower was stated to be Concord International Group Ltd.</p>        <p class="quote">15.  In the remaining six loan agreements including the 9<sup>th</sup> loan agreement, the borrower was stated to be Concord Strategic Investments Ltd.</p>        <p class="quote">16.  The 9<sup>th</sup> loan agreement was effectively an embodiment of the total outstanding sums (including interest) owed to the plaintiff from the earliereight loan agreements which was stated therein to be $30,281,806.33. In that sense, it embodied and superseded the earlier eightloan agreements.</p>        <p class="quote">17.  All the nine loan agreements were executed by Liu Yu for and on behalf of the plaintiff on the one hand, and by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for and on behalf of the borrower on the other hand.</p>        <p class="quote">18.  In May 1998, Liu Yu suddenly left Hong Kong and resigned all his executive posts with the plaintiff only remaining as a non-executivedirector.  Since then Liu Yu has not returned to Hong Kong.</p>        <p class="quote">19.  On 26 April 1999, Cheng Xiaoling and Chen Bing Lian were appointed as additional directors of the plaintiff.  Upon their appointment,one of their tasks was to recoup the outstanding loans owed to the plaintiff.</p>        <p class="quote">20.  In this respect, a settlement agreement was entered into by the plaintiff dated 17 October 2000 with the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.  In that settlement agreement, it was (<i>inter alia</i>) stated that the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant owed to the plaintiff (up to 31 August 2000) the principal amount of $45,280,000 and interest thereon of $12,000,000. I am told that the principal amount of the loan stated in the settlement agreement includes the amount of $30,281,806.33 being thesubject matter of the present claim.</p>        <p class="quote">21.  When no payment of the outstanding loans and/or any sums under the settlement agreement was received by the plaintiff, the plaintiffcommenced HCA4442/2003 against the present 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for repayment of such loan.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The additional information relating to the background of the case is Liu Yu (âMr. Liuâ) apart from being a shareholder of the1<sup>st</sup> defendant, was also one of its directors. </p>    <p class="heading">Basis of striking out</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The striking out application was based on the following grounds :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1.The cause of action of fraud was not properly pleaded.</p>        <p class="quote">2.The plaintiffâs claim was time-barred.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Judge struck out the claim on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on fraud but he refused to strike out the claim by reason of limitation.</p>    <p class="heading">Principles on striking out</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Striking out application is a drastic remedy.  As it is an attempt by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to drive the plaintiff from its judgment seat, the Court must exercise great caution and would only accede to the applicationin clear and plain cases.

Fraud must be distinctly alleged and as distinctly proved: <i>Davy v Garrett</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%207%20Ch%20D%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 7 Ch. D. 473</a>, 489, per Thesiger LJ.  It is not necessary to use the word âfraudâ or âdishonestlyâ if the facts which make the conductcomplained of fraudulent are pleaded; but, if the facts pleaded are consistent with innocence, then it is not open to the court tofind fraud.  As Buckley LJ said in <i>Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20Ch%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] Ch. 250</a>, 268:</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">âAn allegation of dishonesty must be pleaded clearly and with particularity.  That is laid down by the rules and it is a well-recognisedrule of practice.  This does not import that the word âfraudâ or the word âdishonestyâ must be necessarily use... The factsalleged may sufficiently demonstrate that dishonesty is allegedly involved, but where the facts are complicated this may not be soclear, and in such a case it is incumbent upon the pleader to make it clear when dishonesty is alleged.  If he uses language whichis equivocal, rendering it doubtful whether he is in fact relying on the alleged dishonesty of the transaction, this will be fatal;the allegation of its dishonest nature will not have been pleaded with sufficient clarity.â â</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The plaintiffâs argument</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr. Chua, SC who appeared together with Ms Teresa Wu for the plaintiff, submitted that the plaintiff is no longer able to locateMr. Liu its former managing director and its current management does not have a full picture of the circumstances of how the loanagreements were entered.  He frankly and properly admitted that the current pleading on fraud is not adequate but he submitted thatthe claim of the plaintiff should not be struck out.  He argued that the circumstances surrounding the loans when the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants changed their names to identical names in close proximity were so suspicious that there must be a scheme going on.  Hesubmitted that the plaintiff should be allowed to conduct discovery and administer interrogatories so that the particulars of fraudcould be supplied later.  In <i>Leitch v. Abbott</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281886%29%2031%20ChD%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1886) 31 ChD 374 (C.A.)</a> where Bowen L.J. at 378-379 stated thatï¼</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Ought, then, the generality of an allegation of fraud to be a bar to the right to discovery?  It seems to me that the very factthat the pleader is unable to plead except in general terms, is in many cases the very reason why he should have discovery from theother party, so as to enable him to plead the fraud in detail.  If at a particular stage of an action you are stopped by reason ofyour ignorance of some fact which is known only to the other party, that is the very reason why you should have discovery of thatfact from him, and what difference does it make whether you are stopped at the trial or before?â </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Likewise in <i>Deak Perera Far East Ltd v.

This is not a case of a party saying âwe think you have defrauded us and now wish to look at your records tosee if we can prove itâ.  Full particulars of fraud do have to be given but in my view this is an appropriate case where the plaintiff,DPFE, is entitled to discovery before giving such full particulars.â </p>    </blockquote>    <p>In the same case Nazareth VP at page 37 also stated that,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â Those conclusions are not affected by the <i>possibility</i> that further particulars <i>might</i> be given after discovery. I would add that, given the circumstances and the nature of what is averred and particularized, Chase Manhattanshould be left in little doubt as to the plaintiffâs case that it has to meet, particularly as the matters involved seem to bepeculiarly within its own knowledge and unlikely to be within that of the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Reliance on fraud</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In my view the Judge was correct to hold that the claim on fraud was not properly pleaded and the plaintiffâs claim was properlystruck out by the Judge on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  It is not apparent from the pleadings as to how the fraud was practised.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was a separate legal entity and operated by those who controlled it.  At the material time, the plaintiff together withthe 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant were the majority shareholders of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  To say in the circumstances that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant caused or procured the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant to âimpersonateâ the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and to conclude the loans with the plaintiff is farfetched.  If the plaintiff was one of the majority shareholders of the1<sup>st</sup> defendant, how could it have believed that the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant when the loan agreements were signed? </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  One of the essential requirements of fraud and deceit is that the victim relied upon the fraud and deceit to his prejudice.  Inthis case it is clear that the plaintiff has not pleaded that it had relied on the fraud and deceit practised on it by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (even assuming that was the case) to enter into the nine loan agreements. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Despite Mr. Chua, SCâs submission to the contrary, I do not agree that the fact the plaintiff entered into these agreements inthe light of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs fraud (again assuming that was the case) would necessarily mean that the plaintiff had relied upon the fraud or deceit. If the matter is so straightforward one may ask why is this not pleaded explicitly?  Instead, even at the hearing of the appeal,no further amendment has been provided on this point.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In my view the plaintiff has not even reached the stage where it can be said that it has sufficiently pleaded a general case offraud and it is merely the particulars that are lacking and allowance should be given to it to flesh out the details later on.  Whetherthe plaintiff had relied upon the fraud or not must be within its particular knowledge through its own managing director, Mr. Liu. The difficulty faced by the plaintiff is that Mr. Liu played a dual role in the transactions.  While on the one hand he signed theagreements on behalf of the plaintiff, on the other hand, he was also a shareholder and a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at the time when the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant changed to its present name.  Mr. Liu also signed the shareholders resolutions for the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant to change to its name.  As the Judge observed, it is inescapable that Mr. Liu must have known of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants changing their respective names to the same name, not once but twice in 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In my view the plaintiff has not satisfied the threshold that the law requires for pleadings when it seeks to pursue a case of fraudagainst the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  Ultimately the requirement is one of fairness : you must let your opponent know what is the case against him so thathe can respond accordingly.</p>    <p class="heading">Limitation</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  As the 9<sup>th</sup> loan agreement was entered into on 27 February 1998 which the parties agreed was for the purpose of consolidating all the previousloans, it is common ground that the limitation period of the cause of action of six years commenced on that date.  The present claim,however, was only commenced on 16 October 2006 which was beyond the limitation period.  The plaintiffâs case is that the limitationperiod has been extended under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(1)</a> of the <i><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a></i> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>) by reason of fraud.  The section provides that in action for fraud the period of limitation shall not begin to run untilthe plaintiff has discovered the fraud, concealment or mistake (as the case may be) or could with reasonable diligence have discoveredit.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The Judge refused to strike out the plaintiffâs claim by reason of limitation.  He held that this is a fact sensitive issue.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant by respondentâs notice seeks to affirm the judgment on the ground that the limitation period has expired.  Mr. Chan,SC who appeared together with Mr. Stanley Siu for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, argued that the plaintiff could with reasonable diligence have discovered the fraud within the limitation period becausethe plaintiff through Mr. Liu was well aware of the identical names of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants.  Mr. Chan, SC argued that this is sufficient to strike out the plaintiffâs reliance on <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26(1)</a> even without the additional factors such as the plaintiff must be aware that the accounts of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not record the loans or that the plaintiff had demanded repayment and received part repayment from the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In my view the personal involvement of Mr. Liu in the change of names of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants provides strong argument that the fraud could have been discovered with reasonable diligence.  However, at the same time,the disappearance of Mr. Liu from Hong Kong in May 1998 may have put a different complex on the matter in terms of discovery of thefraud.  This may be as the Judge said a fact sensitive issue.  Bearing in mind that this is a striking out application and havingbeen satisfied that the claim was properly struck out by reason of insufficiency of pleadings, it is not necessary for me to decideon the issue of limitation.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Accordingly the appeal must be dismissed.  There will be no order made on the respondentâs notice.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The plaintiff is to pay the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant the costs of the appeal.  As to the respondentâs notice, the issue raised was not a cross appeal and as the argumentdid not materially prolong the appeal, I will not make any costs order on the respondentâs notice.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Sakhrani J :</b></p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Peter Cheung)</td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Arjan H.
