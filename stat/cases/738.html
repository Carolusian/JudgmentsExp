Both actions concerned disputes arising out of the handling ofMuiâs estate, with their causes of action being essentially the same except that different defendants were involved.  The causesof action that the plaintiffs relied upon against the defendants were negligence and unreasonable conduct in their management ofMuiâs estate, and their error in including in the estate two properties that Mui had already gifted to them, one of which beinglocated in Happy Valley (âHappy Courtâ), while the other in Shouson Hill (âHenredon Courtâ).</p>	<p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The defendants in Civil Action No. 742 of 2007 (âHCA 742 of 2007â) were Lai Kar Yan, Lo Kin Ching and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu(âDeloitteâ). Lai and Lo were appointed by the court as interim administrators to take over Muiâs estate, and they were alsopartners in Deloitte.  They instructed Deloitte to assist in the handling of Muiâs estate.  Deloitte and the defendants named belowwere the defendants in Civil Action (âHCA 679 of 2007â). Hau Yan Company Limited (âHau Yanâ) is the company which owns HappyCourt and Henredon Court.  Taplow Company is the holding company of Hau Yan.  Vincent (Nominees) Limited (âVincentâ) is the companysecretary of Taplow Company.  The Estate of Mui Yim Fong (No.1) Limited, The Estate of Mui Yim Fong (No.2) Limited and The Estateof Mui Yim Fong (No.3) Limited are the directors of Hau Yan appointed by Lai Kar Yan and Lo Kin Ching.  Lin Yim Fai Alan is anotherdirector of Hau Yan.  The plaintiffsâ claim against Vincent was dismissed by the Registrar on 24 April 2009.</p>	<p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The Mother and Peter Mui acted in person in these proceedings.    In view of her advance years, and upon her request, I made anexception and allowed Lee Ngan Shui (transliteration) to represent her in the trial to address the court and cross-examine witnesses. Lee was a friend of the plaintiffsâ.  He was not a lawyer with a practising certificate, but he claimed to possess legal knowledgeand have dealt with legal matters.  Indeed some of the documents and pleadings filed by the Mother and Peter Mui in these actionswere drafted by him.</p>	<p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Mui was admitted to Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital for treatment of uterine cancer on 27 September 2003.  She executed a willon 3 December 2003, leaving her entire estate to a trust known as the Karen Trust, the trustee of which being HSBC InternationalTrustee Limited (âthe trusteeâ), which was also the executor of the will.  It was a discretionary trust and the beneficiarieswere Muiâs four nieces and nephews and the Mother, with the final repository being New Horizon Buddhist Association Limited.  Muipassed away on 30 December 2003.</p>	<p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In 2004, the Mother commenced Probate Action No. 2 of 2004 (âHCAP 2/2004â) against the trustee, seeking a declaration that MuiâsWill dated 3 December 2003 was invalid.  On 19 July 2004, the court appointed Lai Kar Yan and Lo Kin Ching as interim administratorsof the estate.  The court also authorized them to instruct Deloitte to assist in the handling of the estate on 3 January 2005.  AndrewCheung J pronounced for the force and validity of Muiâs Will on 16 June 2008 and dismissed HCAP 2/2004 instituted by the Mother:see <i>Estate of Mui Yim Fong</i> [2008] HKEC 999.  The Mother lodged an appeal against Andrew Cheung Jâs decision, which was eventually dismissed by the Court ofAppeal on 2 July 2010: see CACV 200 of 2008.</p>	<p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In HCA 679/2007, Lai Kar Yan, Lo Kin Ching and Deloitte adopted a neutral stance on the plaintiffsâ title dispute in respect ofHappy Court and Henredon Court, but the other defendants put the plaintiffs to strict proof as to their beneficial ownership in thetwo properties.  They also argued that the plaintiffs should have claimed against the executor of the Will for the relief they soughtinstead of suing the defendants.  Therefore, the court should not grant the plaintiffs any relief in any event.  In respect of HCA742/2007, the defendants denied that they owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs and maintained that they had not been negligent intheir handling of Muiâs estate.</p>	<p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Both the Mother and Peter Mui gave evidence in court, but they had never filed any statements in the title action about HenredonCourt and Happy Court.  Having heard and analyzed their evidence, I found their evidence to be neither truthful nor credible.</p>	<p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Deloitte instructed two of its employees, Chan Mei Ying (transliteration) and Law Sau Ying (transliteration) to give evidence onbehalf of the defendants.  In the two and a half years before 1 August 2006, Chan was the associate director of Deloitte and wasresponsible for managing Muiâs estate. Later, from 17 July 2006 onwards, Law took over Chanâs duties.  Their evidence was abouthow Deloitte handled Muiâs estate and was not seriously challenged by the plaintiffs.  I accepted their evidence.</p>    <p class="heading">Background</p>	<p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In 1962, the Motherâs husband passed away.  She brought her three children, Peter Mui, Mui Tak Ming and Mui Oi Fong to Hong Kongand settled here.  She later gave birth to Mui.  At that time, the family was poverty-stricken and Peter Mui had to work as a casualworker in a restaurant to support the family, who enjoyed a close relationship among themselves. After Mui Yim Fong had made a namefor herself in singing, she not only took care of the Motherâs living expenses, but she also funded Peter Muiâs investment inhis kennel business, which however ended up with a loss of a hundred thousand-odd dollars.  In 1989, Peter Mui emigrated to the USand invested in the catering and entertainment business.  Indeed, Muiâs concerts in the US were organized by Peter Muiâs US KoShing Entertainment Production Company (translation and transliteration) (âKo Shingâ).  Mui Tak Ming, on the other hand, remainedin Hong Kong to work in the Shatin racecourse.  He has not taken part in the plaintiffsâ actions.</p>	<p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Mui had, at an earlier stage, bought a flat in La Vogue Court, Happy Valley (âLa Vogue Courtâ) as the Motherâs residence. La Vogue Court was a property jointly owned by Mui and the Mother.  When one party died, the title of the property would be automaticallytransferred to the surviving party.  After Muiâs death, the Mother sold La Vogue Court and used the proceeds of the sale to purchasea flat in Ascot Tower in her own name (âAscot Towerâ).</p>	<p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Previously, Mui also bought, in the name of Leisure Gain Limited, the 24<sup>th</sup> floor together with the rooftop of Yuk Sau Mansion, Happy Valley as Mui Oi Fongâs residence.  The rooftop was extended to becomethe 25<sup>th</sup> floor (âthe 24<sup>th</sup> &amp; 25<sup>th</sup> floors of Yuk Sau Mansionâ).</p>	<p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In 1993, Mui bought Henredon Court as her own residence in the name of Hau Yan.  At that time, Mui, Mui Oi Fong and the Mother werethe directors of Hau Yan.</p>	<p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Subsequently, Mui Oi Fong was diagnosed with cancer.  Mui bought Happy Court in the name of Hau Yan in August 1999 as her sisterâsresidence so as to allow the Mother to take care of her.  The 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> floors of Yuk Sau Mansion were leased out.</p>	<p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Mui Oi Fong passed away on 16 April 2000.  In October of the same year, the Mother resigned from her post as director of Hau Yan,thereby leaving Mui and Cheng Yuk Ying (transliteration) as the two remaining directors in Hau Yan.   Upon Muiâs eventual deathon 30 December 2003, her directorship was taken up by Lin Yim Fai Alan.</p>    <p class="heading">Title to Happy Court</p>	<p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Hau Yan was the registered title owner of Happy Court.  That was strong and powerful evidence to show that Hau Yan had beneficialownership in the said property.  If the plaintiffs intended to challenge that evidence, they must bear the burden of proof and adducecredible and powerful evidence to substantiate their claim.</p>	<p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The major factual allegations set out by the plaintiffs in the amended statement of claim as to how they acquired title to HappyCourt are as follows.  In paragraph 3, they claimed that Happy Court was gifted to the Mother by Mui while she was alive, to be whollyowned by the Mother, who could decide by herself whether to share it with other members of the family.  In paragraphs 6A to 6F, theyalso claimed that when Mui bought Happy Court in August 1999, she already promised the Mother that the property would be wholly owned,enjoyed and controlled by the Mother, who then asked Peter Mui if he would consider returning to Hong Kong to live in Happy Courtand manage Muiâs career.  Peter Mui, however, decided to continue to stay in the US for his own development. In October 1999, theMother invited Mui Oi Fong to live with her in Happy Court.  However, Mui Oi Fong died shortly after she had moved in.  In 2000,while Mui was on concert tour in the US, she requested that Peter Mui should return to settle in Hong Kong and accompany the Mother. Mui further indicated that she and the Mother had agreed to let Peter Mui and his family live in Happy Court. Peter Mui said thatsince he had settled down in the US and his career had built up momentum, he did not want to give up everything and return to HongKong just yet.  Mui further made it clear that her suggestion would continue to be effective and Peter Mui could come back to settlein Hong Kong anytime he wished and Happy Court would be available to him and his family as their residence at any time.  Later, theMother made the same promise and indication to Peter Mui.  After Muiâs death, the Mother again made the same promise and invitationto Peter Mui, who therefore gave up his career in the US and returned to Hong Kong to keep the Mother company.  According to thisversion, Mui had already gifted Happy Court to the plaintiffs while she was alive. Happy Court therefore was not part of Muiâsestate and the interim administrators had no right to deal with the title to Happy Court.</p>	<p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The defendants did not put forward allegations or evidence to the contrary to contradict the plaintiffsâ evidence but merely putthem to strict proof as to their beneficial ownership in Happy Court.  In the absence of other corroboration, the inherent probabilityof the plaintiffsâ case was still the best indicator for evaluating the credibility of their evidence: see para. 140 of LittonNPJâs judgment in <i>Tradepower (Holdings) Ltd and</i> <i>Tradepower (HK) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%201%20HKLRD%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] 1 HKLRD 674.</a></p>	<p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In terms of evidence, the plaintiffs mainly relied on the testimony of the Mother and Peter Mui.  The Mother, however, gave threedifferent versions as to when the plaintiffs acquired title to Happy Court.  According to the first version, on 15 April 2005, atthe meeting between Deloitte and Mr Ho Kwan Yiu and Harrison Ho, of K. C. Ho &amp; Fong, acting on her behalf, the Mother claimedthat Mui made an oral undertaking and gifted Happy Court to her at the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2003.  In addition, the Mother repeatedthis claim when she wrote Deloitte a Chinese letter stating what was on her mind.  However, she wrongly stated the date of gift asthe Mid-Autumn Festival in 2004, when Mui had already passed away.</p>	<p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In paragraph 9 of her 4<sup>th</sup> Affirmation filed in July 2006 in respect of HCAP 2/2004, the Mother claimed that during a dinner gathering at her home in the Mid-AutumnFestival in 2003, Mui made an oral undertaking and gifted Happy Court to her.  She said:</p>		<blockquote>		<p class="quote"><i>âIn relation to Happy Court, my late daughter had promised that this property will be a gift to me. In September 2003, my late daughterhad told the Hong Kong media that she had cancer. Shortly afterwards during Mid Autumn Festival dinner at my home in 2003, she toldme that she would like me to have Happy Court. Happy Court is currently occupied by my sons (i.e. Mui Tak Ming and Mui Kai Ming)and their families.â</i>(original in English)</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Based on this first version, Mui gave the Mother an oral undertaking that she would gift Happy Court to her at the Mid-Autumn Festivalin 2003.</p>	<p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The second version was given in paragraph 2 of the statement of claim filed on 23 April 2007, where the plaintiffs claimed thatMui purchased Happy Court in around 1993.  That was apparently a mistake since the time was actually August 1999.  Indeed, the plaintiffsdid make an amendment to that effect in their amended statement of claim.  What was important was that in paragraph 3, the plaintiffsalleged that:</p>		<blockquote>		<p class="quote">âThe Happy Court property <s>and the Henredon Court property were</s> was gifted during Muiâs lifetime to <s>herself and</s> the plaintiff, <u>Mui Tam Mei Kam, to be wholly owned and decided by herself as to whether it should be shared with other</u> and (sic) family. <u>And Mui intended to enjoy the Henredon Court property herself together with her family.</u> Moreover it became effective at the time when the above two properties were held in the name of Hau Yan Company Limited.â</p>			<p>(The crossed-out and the underlined parts are the amendments)</p>	</blockquote>		<p>According to this version, Mui gifted Happy Court to the plaintiffs and her family in August 1999.  Both the alleged date of giftand the alleged recipients were inconsistent with the first version.</p>	<p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In her testimony, however, the Mother gave a third version, which was slightly different from what was contained in the amendedstatement of claim.  Her evidence was that Mui bought Happy Court for Mui Oi Fong to live in.  She made it clear that Mui did notgive any oral undertaking to gift Happy Court to her when she bought Happy Court in August 1999.  Rather, it was after Mui Oi Fongâsdeath in April 2000, when Mui went to Happy Court to sort out Mui Oi Fongâs belongings, that she undertook to gift Happy Courtto her.  Her other assertions about how Happy Court became the home of Peter Mui and his family were basically the same as thosecontained in the amended statement of claim. Eventually, Mui instructed the Mother to lease out Happy Court and use the rental depositand one monthâs rent paid in advance, which were equivalent to two monthsâ rent, to settle the renovation fees and to pass therent to Hau Yan.  Meanwhile, Mui told the Mother that she had asked Peter Mui to return to Hong Kong from the US and move into HappyCourt to take care of the Mother. Later, however, the Mother pocketed the rent herself, right up to Muiâs death.</p>	<p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Peter Muiâs evidence was also roughly consistent with the third version.  According to him, he had already settled down in theUS and owned a seafood restaurant and Ko Shing in Las Vagas.  In 1999 and 2000, he organized three concerts for Mui.  During theconcert in 2000, Mui told him that since Mui Oi Fong had passed away and the Mother was already 80 and suffered from chronic heartdisease, and as Mui herself had to leave Hong Kong for work from time to time, she asked Peter Mui to return and settle in Hong Kongin order to take care of the Mother.  Peter Mui said that he would have to think about it and did not agree to her suggestion immediately. In reply to the courtâs question, he indicated that he decided to return to Hong Kong in 2002.  When Lee Ngan Shui asked him ifhe thought it was unreasonable for Mui to ask him to give up everything in the US and return to Hong Kong to take care of the Mother,he stressed that family bonds were the most important and that he had not given up his career in the US for a flat of several hundredsquare feet.</p>	<p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In relation to the title to Happy Court, the Mother put forward three contradictory versions at different times.  Her version givenas early as in April 2005 was that Mui orally undertook to gift Happy Court to her at her home at the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2003. Two years later, in April 2007, she claimed that when Mui bought Happy Court in August 1999, she already made an oral undertakingthat she would gift Happy Court to the Mother and all the family for their enjoyment.  Some three years or so later, during the trialin June 2010, she said that it was only after Mui Oi Fongâs death, in April 2000 that Mui gifted Happy Court to her.  Just on theissue of when the gift of Happy Court was made to her, it can be seen that the Mother gave different versions at different timesand in different circumstances.  In his closing speech, Peter Mui sought to defend the Mother and said that the discrepancies inher evidence were due to her old age, which were understandable and should not be regarded as contradictions.  Moreover, her claimthat Mui had orally undertaken to gift Happy Court to her was true and firm and the difference was only in terms of the time whenthe words were spoken.  I did not accept Peter Muiâs explanation.  It was not the Motherâs evidence that Mui gifted Happy Courtto her in August 1999 when it was bought and then reiterated that wish at different times.  According to the amended statement ofclaim, Mui only undertook to gift Happy Court to the Mother and all family members for their enjoyment.  The first version givenby the Mother was stated in her affirmation with her solicitorsâ assistance and should be accurate and correct.  The second versionwas given in the amended statement of claim.  That was a statement of her case and it should be a solemn legal document made aftercareful consideration, which formed the most important basis of her case.  The third version, on the other hand, was her evidencegiven under oath, which was also a statement given in solemn circumstances and should be accurate.  However, her evidence was inconsistentwith the case set out in her amended statement of claim.  All these showed that the Mother was hesitant and not forthcoming in herevidence, and that her evidence was neither credible nor truthful.</p>	<p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In his closing speech, Peter Mui submitted that after Mui had given the undertaking, he and the Mother behaved in a manner whichwas consistent with their claim that they regarded Happy Court as their property: they were in possession of the keys and paid variousfees in relation to that property.  I did not accept that statement.  The Mother was in possession of the keys because she had totake care of Mui Oi Fong, and at the early stages she did return to Hau Yan the rent that she had collected from the premises. SincePeter Mui occupied Happy Court at the end of 2004, however, he did not pay the management fees, as a result of which the IncorporatedOwners filed a claim against Hau Yan in the Small Claims Tribunal in 2006.  Solicitors acting for the Mother also demanded that Deloittepay the management fees.  It was only at a later stage that the Mother and Peter Mui paid the management fees and repairs chargesin respect of Happy Court.</p>	<p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Mother also admitted that she found it very strange when Mui told her that she had undertaken to allow Peter Mui to live inthe Happy Court property during her concert tour in the US.  Since Mui had already gifted Happy Court to her, why would she allowPeter Mui to live there?  In fact, at the material time, the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> floors of Yuk Sau Mansion had been left vacant for a long time and Mui could have arranged for Peter Mui to live there instead ofasking the Mother to make Happy Court available.  That also reflected the inherent incredibility of the plaintiffsâ case.</p>	<p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Mui made delicate arrangements about her properties and used different companies to hold different properties and vehicles.  Hercompanies were incorporated in Hong Kong, British Virgin Islands and Liberia. In addition, she held La Vogue Court with the Motherunder joint tenancy.  It can thus be seen that she had some knowledge about the individual capacity of a company or a corporationand about the form of holding title to a property, be it in the name of a company or an individual or under joint tenancy, as wellas its legal implications.  And she had also sought legal advice in those regards.  An inference can thus be drawn that she musthave had some reason for arranging Hau Yan to hold Happy Court.  After Mui Oi Fongâs death, Mui arranged for the Mother to resignfrom her directorship in Hau Yan, which obviously contradicted the claim that she had gifted Happy Court to the Mother. Accordingto the Mother, her resignation from the directorship of Hau Yan was arranged by Muiâs godmother and she had absolutely no knowledge. Again, that was beyond belief since the documents relating to her resignation from the directorship were signed by the Mother herself. In any event, it was immaterial whether or not she had knowledge.  Mui, rather than the Mother, was the only substantial holderof shares and controller of Hau Yan.  Therefore, the fact that Mui arranged for the Mother to resign from her directorship showedthat Mui had no intention to transfer the interests in Happy Court and Henredon Court to the Mother.</p>	<p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Mui and her companies held numerous properties and she must have known that for property transfers and assignment to take effect,there must be corresponding legal procedures, such as preparation of a deed by a solicitor and registration with the Land Registry. If she had really promised to gift Happy Court to the Mother or Peter Mui, she would definitely have retained a lawyer to completethe procedures required by law.  Further, why would she make a will in 2003 and give her estate including Happy Court and HenredonCourt to Karen Trust, with New Horizon Buddhist Association Limited named as the final repository?  Mui knew deep down that she wasgoing to die. She made a will and gave her estate worth over $100 million to Karen Trust, instructed the trustee to gift the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> floors of Yuk Sau Mansion to Lau Kai Eddie, and made generous and well-thought-out arrangements for the Mother to cater for her futureneeds.  If Mui had intended to gift Happy Court to the Mother or Peter Mui, why had she not given proper instructions to the trusteeand made arrangements in the will?  She could have instructed the trustee to transfer Happy Court to the Mother or Peter Mui, asin the case of making the gift to Lau Kai Eddie, but she did not do so.  It was extremely hard to believe the plaintiffsâ caseif one looked at Muiâs arrangement.</p>	<p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  If Mui had given an undertaking as alleged by the plaintiffs, then she had reneged on her promise.  The plaintiffs, however, failedto provide any reasons to explain why Mui would do so.  Up until her death, Mui had not changed the form in which the title to LaVogue Court was held, thereby allowing the Mother to inherit her interests in La Vogue Court and solely own and enjoy the property. She also purposely made the Mother a beneficiary of the Karen Trust and arranged for her to have a monthly allowance of $70,000as her living expenses.  All such arrangements showed that Mui had already made ample provisions for the Motherâs future life sothat she could live out her remaining years in comfort.  The Mother already owned La Vogue Court and did not need to own other properties. Further, neither Mui Tak Ming nor Peter Mui was a beneficiary of the Karen Trust, which illustrated that Mui intentionally leftnothing to her two brothers.  Accordingly, in my view, it was hardly inherently probable that Mui had promised to gift Happy Courtto the Mother and Peter Mui as they claimed in their evidence.</p>	<p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  During cross-examination, the Mother claimed that she did not know she would have to go through any procedures for the title toHappy Court to be transferred to her.  However, she admitted that when Hau Yan bought Henredon Court, she had signed the relevanttransaction documents and deed. More obviously, she sold La Vogue Court and bought Ascot Tower in 2005, so she must have been awarethat property assignment or transfer must be by way of deed and could not be completed merely on an oral undertaking.  Moreover,it was even ridiculous for the Mother to claim that she did not know that Happy Court was held by Hau Yan.  At the early stage ofher cross-examination, she said that she had discussed with Mui the ways of handling the rental income from Happy Court and she gavea definite answer that the rent had been given to Hau Yan.  She had all along known that Hau Yan owned the title to Happy Court.Apparently, she would resort to lying in order to achieve her aims.  She was not a credible witness.</p>	<p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Nor did Peter Mui appear to be credible during cross-examination.  Despite having lived in Happy Court since the end of 2004, heclaimed that he had no knowledge that his failure to pay the management fees had resulted in the Incorporated Ownersâ filing aclaim in the Small Claims Tribunal in 2006 for the outstanding management fees, and it was only after Deloitte had settled the amountsdue that he became aware of the matter.  In fact, as early as 22 August 2005, when Deloitte replied to K. C. Ho &amp; Fong actingon behalf of the Mother, it mentioned that the other party, in their letter dated 1 August 2005, had indicated that $22,577 in managementfees of Happy Court was due and requested over the phone that Deloitte pay the said sum on their behalf.  It can thus be seen thatPeter Muiâs claim that he had absolutely no knowledge was an utter pack of lies and he had shifted all the responsibility for defaulton the management fees onto the Mother and K.C. Ho &amp; Fong.  His explanation was that there had been some communication problemsbetween the Mother and her solicitors, and since he had just returned to settle in Hong Kong then, it was not surprising that therewas carelessness and negligence in the handling of the relevant matters.  In my view, it is extremely rare that a solicitor wouldhave communication problems with his client.  Further, the Mother was unable to provide any evidence to support such a claim. TheMother was aware of the default on management fees.  Peter Mui and the Mother shared the same stance on the title dispute of HappyCourt, and it was just sophistry on his part to shift the responsibility onto the Mother and her then solicitors.  I did not believehim.</p>	<p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In answering the courtâs questions, Peter Mui said he decided to return to Hong Kong in 2002.  Later in cross-examination, however,he corrected himself by saying that he made the decision in 2001, and yet later he also claimed that it was after Muiâs death,i.e. in late 2003 or early 2004 that he decided to come back to Hong Kong.  His evidence was inconsistent. Peter Mui described himselfas a straightforward and sentimental person and it was normal for him to make slight mistakes about the time sequence.  He came backto Hong Kong to carry out inspection for one month in 2001 before making preparations for his return here, and eventually his wholefamily moved back to Hong Kong in 2004.  Later, in January 2005, he returned to the US and stayed there for one week.  Afterwardshe and his family continued to live in Hong Kong.  However, what cannot be disputed is that he only returned to settle in Hong Kongafter Muiâs death.  Although his explanation was that he had to stay in the US to deal with some matters before returning here,if Mui had invited him to come back in late 2000 and if he had decided to accept the invitation in 2001, it would be difficult toenvisage that he would only come back three years later, particularly when he had all along emphasized that the purpose of his returnwas to take care of the Mother.  His evidence cast doubt on the credibility of his claim that he had returned to Hong Kong on theinvitation of Mui or the Mother.  I found him an incredible witness and I did not accept his evidence.</p>	<p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In view of the above analysis, I found that neither the Mother nor Peter Mui was a credible witness and I did not accept their evidence. They failed to prove and substantiate their case as pleaded in their amended statement of claim.</p>	<p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Even if they could establish their pleaded case, the amended statement of claim did not disclose any cause of action regarding theirpurported title to Happy Court.  According to the plaintiffsâ claim, their acquisition of the title to Happy Court could be dividedinto three stages. The first stage was that Mui already made an oral undertaking to gift Happy Court to the Mother when she boughtHappy Court in August 1999.  However, Mui did not buy Happy Court in the name of the Mother, nor did she transfer the title to HappyCourt to the Mother in writing or through legal procedures. Although Mui gave an oral undertaking to gift Happy Court to the Mother,she did not carry out that wish and complete the gift of the property by proper legal procedures.</p>	<p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The second stage was when Mui suggested to Peter Mui in 2000 that he should return to Hong Kong to live in Happy Court and keepthe Mother company.  Peter Mui, however, did not accept her invitation and hence no binding agreement was formed.  Indeed, even ifthere had been an agreement, it could not have been carried out since there was no written agreement or substantial performance. Although Mui indicated that her invitation to Peter Mui continued to be effective, she passed away before the latter accepted theinvitation. Since he must have known that Mui had passed away, such invitation lost its effect with Muiâs death: see <i>Re Whelan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%201%20IR%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] 1 IR 575</a> and <i>Coulthart v Clementson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281879%29%205%20QBD%2042" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1879) 5 QBD 42.</a>  The title to Happy Court still belonged to Mui, and it became part of her estate after her death.</p>	<p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The third stage was when the Mother offered to Peter Mui to move into Happy Court to keep her company after Muiâs death.  PeterMui and Lee Ngan Shui stressed that after Muiâs death, Peter Mui found that the Mother was alone and helpless in Hong Kong, sohe, upon the Motherâs request and on acceptance of Muiâs invitation, gave up his career in the US and returned to Hong Kong tolive in Happy Court in order to accompany and care for the Mother.  Therefore he should acquire the title to Happy Court in equity. Apparently, the plaintiffsâ statement was based on the principle of estoppel in the law of equity.  Riberio PJ of the Court ofFinal Appeal of Hong Kong made the following observations at paragraph 55 of the judgment in <i>Luo Xing Juan and</i> <i>Estate of Hui Shui See</i> (2009) 12 HKCFAR:</p>	<blockquote>	<p class="quote">âA promissory estoppel may be said to arise where (i) the parties are in a relationship involving enforceable or exercisable rights,duties or powers; (ii) one party (the promisor), by words or conduct, conveys or is reasonably understood to convey a clear and unequivocalpromise or assurance to the other (the promise) that the promisor will not enforce or exercise some of those rights, duties or powers;and (iii) the promisee reasonably relies upon that promise and is induced to alter his or her position on the faith of it, so thatit would be inequitable or unconscionable for the promisor to act inconsistently with the promise.â</p>	</blockquote>	<p>But I must point out that since I did not accept the plaintiffsâ   evidence, they did not have any factual basis upon which theycould resort to the law of equity.</p>	<p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  But assuming that I had accepted their evidence, since the Mother was not the beneficial owner of Happy Court, nor was she authorizedto deal with the title to the property, her offer was not binding on the interim administrators or trustee of the estate and hadno effect on how the title to Happy Court should be handled.</p>	<p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In summary, the title dispute raised by the Mother and Peter Mui in respect of Happy Court had no factual and legal basis at all.Their evidence was totally unbelievable.  They failed to prove their case set out in the amended statement of claim, but even ifthey had successfully proved it, the said amended statement of claim did not disclose any cause of action regarding their purportedtitle to Happy Court.  Their claim in respect of the title to Happy Court must be dismissed.  I therefore reject the plaintiffsâclaims for a declaration that they owned the title to and the interests in Happy Court; an injunction restraining the defendantsfrom selling the said property or an order that the defendants compensate them for their losses.</p>	<p class="heading"><i>Title to Henredon Court</i></p>	<p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In the two original statements of claim, the plaintiffs claimed that Mui bought Happy Court and Henredon Court in the name of HauYan as a gift to herself, the plaintiffs and her family for their common enjoyment.  However, late last year, in the two amendedstatements of claim, they intentionally crossed out the assertion that Mui gifted Henredon Court to herself and the plaintiffs, etc. The amended statement of claim did not contain any other assertion which served to support their claim to having any interests inHenredon Court, nor was there any basis for such assertion. Accordingly, I need not concern myself with their claim in respect ofHenredon Court.</p>	<p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  However, in their closing speech, the Mother and Peter Mui mentioned the title to Henredon Court and that to Happy Court in thesame breath.  Since they were not legally represented, and because of the Motherâs advanced years, I did, where possible, offerthem assistance on procedural matters.  I assumed that they mistakenly deleted Henredon Court when they amended their statement ofclaim, and I would allow them to re-amend their statement of claim and assist them in that regard if they could successfully provetheir interests in Henredon Court.</p>	<p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In her testimony, the Mother agreed that Mui did not give her Henredon Court as a gift, but she asserted that at the Mid-AutumnFestival in 2003, Mui told her that she would give Henredon Court to her for her to handle and to collect its rent as her livingexpenses and for the enjoyment of her nieces and nephews.  She gave two reasons to support her claim in relation to Henredon Court: (1) when Henredon Court was purchased, she was one of the signatories; and (2) Mui said to her at the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2003that she would take care of the rent collection and management of Henredon Court after Mui left Hong Kong.  Henredon Court was purchasedin the name of Hau Yan.  The Mother signed the deed in her capacity as a director of Hau Yan, which does not mean that she was thepurchaser or the title holder.  The fact that the Mother managed Henredon Court and collected the rent during Muiâs absence fromHong Kong was not enough to prove that Mui had gifted Henredon Court to her.</p>	<p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  On the contrary, the Motherâs conduct in 2005 implied a recognition of the fact that Henredon Court was part of Muiâs estateand that the interim administrators were entitled to dispose of the said property.  At that time, through K. C. Ho &amp; Fong, theMother wrote to Deloitte and repeatedly objected to the selling of Henredon Court, but she agreed that they should explore the rentalmarket and consider leasing it out.  Although that was not a direct admission that she did not own the title to the said property,in the solicitorsâ letters written on her behalf and the minutes of the meetings with Deloitte that she had attended in the companyof her solicitors, she never declared that she was the title holder of Henredon Court or that she had any interests in the propertyat all.</p>	<p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  In the dispute over Happy Court, I found that the Mother was not a credible witness.  In the dispute over Henredon Court, I alsofound that her evidence was ambiguous and unreliable.  Based on the same considerations leading to my finding that the Mother hadno title to Happy Court (see paras. 26 and 29 above), I did not believe that Mui would gift to the Mother a property worth tens ofmillions of dollars at the time in such a loose verbal manner.  She did not transfer the title to Henredon Court to the Mother throughHau Yan in writing or by way of a deed, nor did she instruct the trustee to do so.  In summary, the Mother failed to meet the standardof proof required to show that she had the title to Henredon Court.</p>	<p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  There was no definite indication at all as to how long Mui would let the Mother collect the rent of Henredon Court.  On the contrary,Mui already made arrangements for the future needs of the Mother and her nieces and nephews in her will.  The assertions put forwardby the Mother and Peter Mui in respect of the title to Henredon Court lacked substance and were unbelievable. Further, this allegedgift was indeed a contract for the disposition of land, which, pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a>, must be made in writing for it to take effect.</p>	<p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In conclusion, the plaintiffsâ assertion that Mui gave Henredon Court to the Mother for her to collect the rent thereof had nofactual and legal basis at all and must be dismissed.  I therefore reject the plaintiffsâ claims for a declaration that they ownedthe title to and the interests in Henredon Court; an injunction restraining the defendants from selling the said property or an orderthat the defendants compensate them for their losses.</p>	<p class="heading"><i>Negligence</i></p>	<p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The plaintiffs alleged that Lai Kar Yan, Lo Kin Ching and Deloitte were negligent in respect of the following matters when dealingwith Muiâs estate:</p>		<blockquote>		<p>(1)The jewellery, Hong Kong and foreign currencies and securities, etc that had been stolen from the safe in Henredon Court;</p>		<p>(2)Between 19 July 2004 and 31 May 2006, over $8.75 million in estate management fees were spent;</p>		<p>(3)Remuneration in the approximate sum of $4 million for the concert held in November 2003;</p>		<p>(4)Muiâs life insurance benefits in the sum of about $40 million;</p>		<p>(5)Copyright royalties of about $10 million;</p>		<p>(6)Outstanding loans to be recovered in the sum of several tens of millions;</p>		<p>(7)The property on the 24<sup>th</sup> &amp; 25<sup>th</sup> floors of Yuk Sau Mansion;</p>		<p>(8)The property in Singapore;</p>		<p>(9)The property in Japan; and</p>		<p>(10)  The property in London.</p>	</blockquote>	   <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Mr Lau on behalf of the defendants contended that the Mother and Peter Mui had no locus standi to sue the interim administratorsand Deloitte for negligence.  As a matter of law, only the trustee, i.e. the trustee of Karen Trust, would have such a locus standito seek damages against a third party in respect of the loss incurred to the property held in trust.</p>	<p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  I accept this submission.  In <i>Lewin on Trust, Eighteenth Edition</i>, the author states that the trustee deals with the property in trust as principal but not as agent for the beneficiaries.  Hencethe trustee, in administering the trust, is entitled to commence proceedings against a third party in respect of tort, breach ofcontract and other cause of action.  Only in special circumstances may a beneficiary sue a third party directly by way of derivativeaction.  Further, if the special circumstances relied upon resulted from the trusteeâs refusal to bring an action against a thirdparty, that fact should be stated by the beneficiary in the statement of claim.  The author said in paragraphs 43-01 and 43-05:</p>		<blockquote>		<p class="quote">â43-01 Since trustees administer the trust fund as principals, not as agents for the beneficiaries, albeit in a fiduciary capacityon behalf of the beneficiaries, the trustees are normally proper claimants in proceedings against agents and other third partiesin actions based on breach of contract or tort, and other causes of action arising in the course of administration of the trust.</p>		<p class="quote">43-05    Where the trusteesâ refusal to sue is part of the special circumstances justifying the action being brought in the nameof a beneficiary, then the fact should be stated in the particulars of claim.â</p>	</blockquote>		<p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In <i>Bradstock Trustee Services Ltd and another v Nabarro Nathanson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%204%20All%20ER%20888" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 4 All ER 888</a>, the trustees commenced an action but considered withdrawal since they might have to personally bear the costs liabilities. The beneficiariestherefore applied to be substituted as plaintiffs, but the application was rejected by the court.  It was held that the trusteeshad not failed in the performance of their duty to protect the trust estate and that the applicants had no cause of action againstthe third party since they had no legal or equitable property in the subject matter of the action.  Recently, that legal principlewas not challenged by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Mark</i> <i>Roberts and Gill &amp; Co. &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/803.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] EWCA Civ 803.</a></p>	<p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The same applies to the instant case.  The plaintiffs had no legal or equitable property in the subject matter of the action.  Nordid they state in the amended statement of claim the special circumstances which caused them to sue instead of the trustee.  Apparentlythe trustees had not failed in the performance of their duty to protect the trust estate.  Based on the above legal principle, theplaintiffs had no cause of action to bring proceedings against the defendants.  I could well dismiss the plaintiffsâ negligenceclaim, but I would like to consider it and make some observations.</p>	<p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  At the trial, the plaintiffs failed to provide concrete evidence of the allegations of negligence against the defendants in respectof their handling of the estate.  They only challenged the evidence of Chan Mei Ying and Law Sau Ying when cross-examining them. They did not make any submission on allegations (3) and (5) at their closing speech either.</p>	<p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  With respect to Muiâs jewellery, Hong Kong and foreign currencies and securities, etc kept in the safe at Henredon Court (thefirst allegation), the Mother claimed that Mui had opened the safe in her presence at Henredon Court and showed her a diamond necklaceworth $6 million, which Mui said would be worn by her at the 2003 concert.  At that time, the Mother noticed a large quantity ofornaments inside the safe, including diamonds, jade pendants, gold ornaments, jewels, earrings, foreign and Hong Kong currencies,etc worth between $20 million and $200 million.  She also claimed that three days or so after Muiâs death, she went to HenredonCourt but the caretaker would not allow her in, stressing that he was acting on the instruction of Lau Sau Lin of the trustee andwould only allow Lau herself, Lau Kai Eddie, Wong Man Wai and Yu Tin Lok etc to enter Henredon Court.  Subsequently the Mother wentto Wong Chuk Hang Police Station to file a report.  In January 2004, she came to know that the safe at Henredon Court had been prizedopen.  With the belief that the property kept inside the safe had been stolen, she went to the police station to make a report. She alleged that the interim administrators had not taken proper steps to safeguard Muiâs property and to make appropriate enquiriesand find out who was to blame for the theft.</p>	<p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  According to Chan Mei Yingâs evidence, before Deloitte inspected Henredon Court for the first time on 12 August 2004, the trusteeof Karen Trust had removed all the contents from the safe at Henredon Court and transferred them to a safe deposit box of the trusteein the Hongkong Bank. Deloitte therefore enquired with the trustee and transferred the relevant property to a safe deposit box inthe Bank of China, which is currently in the safekeeping of the interim administrators.  Accordingly, Deloitte was not negligentat all regarding the taking over of Muiâs property from the trustee.</p>	<p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Further, in this matter the Mother was the only one who claimed to have seen the property inside the safe at Henredon Court andher valuation was totally groundless.  The defendants contended that the property that they took over from the trustee included thebatch of property in question, which included the diamond necklace worn by Mui at her 2003 concert as alleged by the Mother.  However,upon Sothebyâs valuation, the said necklace and earrings were found to be produced by Buccellati and worth about $500,000. Therelevant valuation report was already disclosed to the Mother during the hearing of HCAP 2/2004.  Peter Mui did press criminal chargesagainst Lau Kai Eddie and Lau Sau Lin of the trustee, who were found not guilty after trial.  Peter Mui did not believe that theforeign currencies inside the safe were only equivalent to HK$19,000, but that was just speculation on his part and there was noevidence to show that the foreign currencies inside the safe had been stolen.  Nor did the plaintiffs adduce any evidence to proveany negligence on the part of Deloitte in respect of this allegation.  In such circumstances, the plaintiffsâ allegation of theftwas merely speculation and the interim administrators had no responsibility to pursue that matter.</p>	<p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The plaintiffs alleged that since the interim administrators and Deloitte took over Muiâs estate from the trustee, their managementhad been unsatisfactory with low efficiency, they had headed in the wrong direction, incurring high extra administrative costs withoutany economic benefits, and they had failed to believe in the plaintiffsâ allegations, etc (which could be summarized as the secondand the sixth allegations).  Not only did these allegations lack substance, but they were also completely hollow. The interim administratorsand Deloitte contended that they had tried their best to investigate and recover the debts owed to Mui.  Their investigation effortsincluded inspecting Muiâs cheque stubs, copies of cheques and monthly statements for the three years immediately prior to Muiâsdeath obtained from the bank, and other documents accessible to the administrators.  They also made enquiries with payees of chequesin the sum of over $50,000.  They already included a list of the suspected debtors in their report and disclosed it to the partiesinvolved in HCAP 2/2004.  In my view, they already took realistic and practicable investigative steps.  The plaintiffs claimed thatMui had debts of tens of millions owed to her.  Deloitte indicated that they would be happy to make enquiries with the plaintiffsand follow up the matter.</p>	<p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The plaintiffs contended that Muiâs funeral was held on 12 January 2004, but funeral expenses in the sum of US$130,020 were alreadypaid out on 6 January 2004.  They considered that the interim administrators were negligent but failed to give any details.  Thefact that funeral expenses were paid out before the funeral was not sufficient to support the allegation of negligence.</p>	<p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  The plaintiffs pointed out that the interim administrators spent over $8.75 million in administrative fees in less than two years. That was an enormous amount of money.  According to the defendantsâ amended defence, Deloitteâs fees were $7.07 million-odd,the two interim administratorsâ fees were $400,000-odd, the expenses accounted for were about $60,000, legal fees including thoseincurred in HCAP 2/2004 amounted to over $1.2 million.  The legal costs in HCAP 2/2004 are to be taxed.  The defendants (sic) mainlyfocused on the fees incurred by the interim administrators and Deloitte.  However, part of the two sums was actually spent on handlingthe proceedings in HCAP 2/2004 and the present case.  In any event, the fees charged by the interim administrators and Deloitte werecalculated as per their appointment order and the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/10" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Ordinance</a>.  Any disputes over the fees should have been dealt with in HCAP 2/2004 instead of the present case.</p>	<p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Regarding the remuneration of $4 million for Muiâs concert held in November 2003 (the third allegation), Deloitteâs reply wasthat according to the contract signed between Muiâs Mui Music Limited and Yiu Wing Entertainment Company Limited, the remunerationwas $4.1 million, which was properly paid by Yiu Wing Entertainment Company Limited by three instalments to Mui Music Limited on26<sup>th</sup> September, 4<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> of November 2003.  The plaintiffs did not raise any dispute as to that reply.</p>	<p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In respect of Muiâs life insurance benefits in the sum of about $40 million (the fourth allegation), Deloitteâs reply was thatthe total life benefits were $3,509,126, out of which $1,926,262 was already given to the Mother in early 2004 with the rest goingto the estate.  To that reply the plaintiffs did not raise any dispute either.  Further, Deloitte admitted that Mui had two othertravel insurance and accident benefits insurance policies.  However, no compensation was obtained since Muiâs cause of death didnot meet the eligibility requirements for death benefits.</p>	<p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Peter Mui also accused Deloitte of being negligent in handling Muiâs insurance benefits.  He asserted that they should not havebelieved the insurance companyâs one-sided claim, criticising in particular their failure to investigate a $10 million insurancepolicy.  According to Chan Mei Yingâs evidence, Deloitte had at an early stage enquired with AIA Company about all of Muiâs insurancepolicies and AIA Company had already replied in writing confirming all such policies.  After the Mother had indicated to Deloittethat there might have been one more $10 million insurance policy, Deloitte did cautiously write to AIA Company again to enquire aboutthe said policy.  AIA Company confirmed in writing that there was no other policy.  The Mother did not provide any details aboutthe policy in question.  It can thus be seen that Deloitte was not negligent in this matter.  I believed Deloitte had conducted properinvestigations and the plaintiffsâ allegation was hollow and groundless.</p>	<p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  With regard to the allegation about the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> floors of Yuk Sau Mansion (the seventh allegation), as per Muiâs will, Lau Kai Eddie had beneficiaryâs rights to the Yuk Sauproperty, which was one of the matters dealt with by the HCAP 2/2004 decision.  I do not intend to deal with this issue.</p>	<p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  As regards the allegation that the properties in Singapore, Japan and London were sold well below the market price (the eighth totenth allegations), the plaintiffs contended in their final speech that the interim administrators and Deloitte handled their salein a time-consuming and inefficient manner and that they failed to obtain the best price available. However, at the trial, the Motherdid not adduce any evidence to show that Deloitte was negligent in the sale of the property in Japan, and Peter Mui also made itclear that he had no complaints whatsoever and withdrew that allegation.  Nor did they produce any evidence in relation to the allegednegligence about the sale of the London property.</p>	<p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In respect of the negligence about the sale of the property in Singapore, the plaintiffs alleged in the amended statement of claimthat: about 17 November 2006, a Mrs On (transliteration), who was a fan of Muiâs, was willing to offer S$ 2.5 million to purchasethat property, whose then prevailing market price stood at S$3.5 million.  At 6:52 p.m. on 20 November 2006, through Lai Ka Yan andLo Kin Ching, Deloitte informed Kong &amp; Associates, the then solicitors acting for the plaintiffs, by fax that Mrs On was to deliverthe deposit to their appointed estate agency in Singapore before 12 noon on 22 November 2006.  Since Mrs On failed to do so by thedeadline, Lai Kar Yan and Lo Kin Ching sold that property cheaply at S$1.67 million.</p>	<p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Law Sau Ying said in her evidence that on 1 November 2006, before receiving the offer of S$1.6 million from the first buyer, Deloittehad already obtained the valuation of the property from four estate agencies, namely, Knight Frank Pte Ltd, Savills Residential PrivateLimited, Colliers International and Jones Lang Lasalle, and the valuation ranged from S$1.3 to 2 million.  On 13 November 2006, Deloittesought the advice of the parties involved in HCAP 2/2004.  All parties except the Mother agreed to the sale. Kong &amp; Associateswrote to Deloitteâs solicitors, Messrs Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, to indicate that the price offered was too low.</p>	<p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  On 17 November 2006, Deloitte received an offer of S$1.73 million from a second buyer and the deadline was 4 p.m. on 22 November2006. Since the other parties to the proceedings agreed in principle to sell the property for S$1.6 million, Messrs Paul, Hastings,Janofsky &amp; Walker merely sought the Motherâs opinion on this offer.  The said solicitorsâ firm wrote to Kong &amp; Associatesto inform them of the second offer and made it clear that they intended to sell that property for S$1.73 million if no higher offerwas received by 22 November 2006.</p>	<p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  On 22 November 2006, Kong &amp; Associates replied in writing that the Mother was prepared to accept the second offer on two conditions,namely, that the interim administrators should set aside HK$1 million from the sale proceeds as her living and medical expenses,and that the interim administrators must protect her against any damages she might suffer as a result of any bankruptcy petitionfiled against her by the Cancer Association.  The interim administrators took the said reply letter to mean that the Mother acceptedthe sale of the property at the price of S$1.73 million.  Messrs Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker therefore reported to theparties in HCAP 2/2004 that the said property would be sold for S$1.73 million and replied to Kong &amp; Associates that they wouldnot accept the two conditions proposed by the Mother.</p>	<p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  Law Sau Ying claimed that the plaintiffs had asked to participate in the sale of the said property, and that Deloitte subsequentlyreceived a sole agency agreement issued by Rainbow Cottage Pte Ltd, the plaintiffsâ estate agency.  Messrs Paul, Hastings, Janofsky&amp; Walker then wrote to Kong &amp; Associates to indicate their willingness to let Rainbow Cottage Pte Ltd participate in thesale of that property on a non-sole agency basis, and they also asked for ways of contacting Rainbow Cottage Pte Ltd.  Kong &amp;Associates, however, did not give any reply.  During the process of the sale of the said property, Law Sau Ying had never learntfrom the Mother or Peter Mui of the allegation about Mrs Onâs offer of S$2.5 million.</p>	<p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The plaintiffsâ allegations against the interim administrators and Deloitte were very serious, yet they were not supported byany evidence.  The Mother adduced no evidence at all to support the plaintiffsâ allegations.  In respect of the valuation of theSingapore property, Peter Mui said that he had made enquiries with some estate agencies in Singapore and was told that the said propertycould have fetched a higher price.  He, however, did not produce any valuation report or letter.  As to Mrs Onâs offer, he evenclaimed that she was a friend of the Motherâs and hence he was not very clear. What was more suspicious was that if Mrs On wasa friend of the Motherâs, why did the latter not adduce any evidence in court?  Conversely, on 22 November 2006, through Kong &amp;Associates, the Mother issued a letter indicating her willingness to sell the said property for S$1.73 million.  If Mrs On had reallyoffered S$2.5 million, why would she have accepted an offer of S$1.73 million? And why did the plaintiffs not call Mrs On and thestaff of Kong &amp; Associates to give evidence?  Obviously, the assertion that Mrs On had made an offer of S$2.5 million was purefabrication, which showed that the Mother and Peter Mui were dishonest and incredible witnesses.</p>	<p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  The plaintiffs alleged that the interim administrators left Henredon Court vacant for a long time and did not rent it out for thepurpose of selling that $70 million-worth property at a cheap price of $40 million, which was serious negligence on their part andthey should make compensation for the loss of rental income.  That was an allegation outside the amended statement of claim.  I donot intend to consider it here.</p>	<p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In summary, regarding all the allegations of negligence set out above, the plaintiffsâ evidence was weak and failed to meet thestandard of proof required to show any negligence on the part of Lai Kar Yan, Lo Kin Ching and Deloitte.  More importantly, theyhad no locus standi to bring an action against the said three parties.</p>	<p class="heading"><i>Summary</i></p>	<p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In view of the above reasons, the plaintiffsâ claim in both HCA No. 679/2007 and HCA 742/2007 are dismissed and they are to bearthe defendantsâ costs, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>	<p> </p>		<p> </p>		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">		<tr>			<td width="50%" valign="top"></td>			<td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Anthony To)<br />Judge of the Court of First Instance<br/>High Court</td>		</tr>	</table>	<!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p> </p>	<p>The plaintiffs, unrepresented, acting in person</p>    <p>Raymond Lau, instructed by Messrs Tanner de Witt, for D1 to D3, D5 to D9 in HCA 679/2007 and D1 to D3 in HCA 742/2007</p>	</representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>	<p>Translated by the Judgment Translation Unit of the Judiciary and approved by Mr. P.
