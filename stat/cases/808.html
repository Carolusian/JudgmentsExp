The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (â<u>Huang</u>â) was/is the sole director/shareholder of a Hong Kong company, ie the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (â<u>HK Zhongxing</u>â), and was at all material times the legal representative, director and 80% shareholder in æ·±å³å¸ä¸­èæ¿å°ç¢éç¼éå¬å¸(â<u>S</u><u>Z Zhongxing</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On 29 April 2009, the Plaintiff commenced the present proceedings against Huang and HK Zhongxing.  Their respective address andregistered office given in the Writ of Summons was 15<sup>th</sup> Floor, CRE Building, 303 Hennessy Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong (â<u>1<sup>st</sup> Address</u>â).  The affirmation of service filed by the Plaintiffâs solicitors Messrs Simon Ho &amp; Co (â<u>SHC</u>â) verified that the Writ of Summons was served to the 1<sup>st</sup> Address on 29 April 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 29 May 2009, SHC confirmed to the court that âthe Plaintiff have abandoned the claims sought in the prayers (1) and (3) ofthe Statement of Claim [ie âall necessary accounts, directions and inquiryâ and âfurther or in the alternative, damagesâ]so far as [HK Zhongxing] is concernedâ (â<u>SHC Election Letter</u>â).  On the same day, the Plaintiff entered final judgment against HK Zhongxing (â<u>HK Judgment</u>â) in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNo notice of intention to defend having been given by [HK Zhongxing] herein, it is this day adjudged that [HK Zhongxing] do paythe Plaintiff the sum of RMB5,000,000.00 or its Hong Kong dollar equivalent at the time of payment together with interest thereonfrom the 29<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2009 at judgment rate until payment and HK$11,045.00 fixed costs.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  On 3 June 2009, the Plaintiff petitioned to wind up HK Zhongxing under HCCW 326/2009 (â<u>WU Action</u>â) pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s177.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 177</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap.32</a> based on a statutory demand dated 16 October 2008 for the Sum (â<u>Petition</u>â).  The Petition also referred to the HK Judgment which was said to be unpaid and unsatisfied.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 10 June and 14 July 2009, Messrs Kelvin Cheung &amp; Co (â<u>KCC</u>â) on behalf of Huang respectively gave notice of intention to defend and filed a Defence and Counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 14 July 2009, KCC on behalf of HK Zhongxing applied by summons to (a) set aside the HK Judgment on the ground of there beinga good defence to the Plaintiffâs claim, (b) seek leave to give notice of intention to defend, and (c) apply for stay executionof the HK Judgment pending final determination of (a) above (â<u>Summons</u>â).</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 6 August and 22 September 2009, the Plaintiff respectively filed their Reply and Defence to Counterclaim to Huangâs Defenceand Counterclaim and gave further and better particulars of such pleading.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 23 July 2009, KCC on behalf of HK Zhongxing applied by summons in the WU Action (â<u>Petition Summons</u>â) to strike out the Petition under Order 18 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 19</a> of the Rules of the High Court (â<u>RHC</u>â).  On 12 August 2009, Master J Wong adjourned the Petition and the Petition Summons to be heard before the Companies Judge.  On17 August 2009, Kwan J granted further adjournment with directions for filing affidavits and obtaining translations.  On 21 September2009, Kwan J set the matters down for substantive argument.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  At the substantive hearing of the Summons on 12 October 2009, Master Levy granted leave for the Plaintiff to add a further groundfor their application to set aside the HK Judgment, ie that such judgment was irregular in failing to comply with Order 13 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6</a> of the RHC.  The amended Summons filed on 15 October 2009 (â<u>Amended Summons</u>â) was adjourned for substantive hearing on 30 December 2009, but such hearing was vacated and further adjourned by consent on 28December 2009.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 8 September 2010, the Plaintiff was ordered to provide security for Huangâs costs in the sum of HK$441,000.00, but failed todo so notwithstanding an âunlessâ order by Master de Souza dated 11 November 2010.  On 19 November 2010, the Plaintiffâs claimagainst Huang was struck out and their action against Huang was dismissed with costs.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  On 27 October 2010, SHC applied to restore the substantive hearing of the Petition and the Petition Summons, which was fixed tobe heard on 25 November 2010.  But pursuant to KCCâs application dated 18 November 2010, Barma J on 25 November 2009 granted leavefor the parties to file further affidavit evidence and adjourned the aforesaid substantive hearing to a date not before 21 February2011 after the hearing of the Amended Summons.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Amended Summons was restored in November 2010 for substantive hearing on 26 January 2011 (â<u>Hearing</u>â).  HK Zhongxing filed 3 supporting affirmations of Chen Yu (â<u>Chen</u>â, officer-in-charge of HK Zhongxingâs administration office) on 14 July, 11 September and 11 September 2009 respectively anda supporting affirmation of Cheung Ka Wai (partner of KCC) on 15 October 2009. The Plaintiff filed 2 affirmations of Chow Chiu ChungAlexander (â<u>Chow</u>â, manager of the Plaintiff) respectively on 14 August and 27 October 2009 in opposition.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  At the Hearing, I granted leave (a) for the Plaintiff to rely on the affirmation of Wong Vai Nang (solicitor of SHC) dated 21 January2011 which exhibited Chowâs 2<sup>nd</sup> affirmation dated 22 December 2010 and Chenâs 3<sup>rd</sup> affirmation dated 19 January 2011 both filed in the WU Action, and (b) for HK Zhongxing to rely on the 2<sup>nd</sup> affirmation of Cheung Ka Wai dated 21 January 2011 which exhibited HK Zhongxingâs amended draft Defence and Counterclaim (â<u>Amended Draft</u>â).

On22 February 2008, SZ Grand Field through its Hong Kong parent company Grand Field Group Limited (â<u>HK Grand Field</u>â) deposited a cheque in the sum of HK$5,484,000.00 into the Account.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Although Huang and HK Zhongxing had no knowledge of the Plaintiffâs financial or internal affairs and/or its operation, and donot admit the aforesaid alleged arrangements, they do not dispute that the sum of  HK$5,484,000.00 was deposited into the Accounton/about 22 February 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The Plaintiff claims that after investigation and understanding it decided not to exercise the Option, and by a notice dated 30April 2008 they informed Huang of SZ Zhongxing that â[the Plaintiff]ä½åºæ±ºå®ï¼ä¸åè[SZ Zhongxingâs]æéé ç®æè³ï¼å¸æ[SZZhongxing]å¨2008å¹´5æ7æ¥åå°ä»¥ä¸ææ¬ æ¬¾é 500è¬åäººæ°å¹£åé[the Plaintiff]ï¼å¦åï¼[the Plaintiff]å°ééæ³å¾ææ®µç´¢åï¼å¼è¦æ±æä¿äºº[Huang]æ¿æé£å¸¶è²¬ä»»â(â<u>Withdrawal Notice</u>â).

Further, HK Zhongxingavers that even if the Plaintiff had served the Withdrawal Notice (which is denied), such notice not having been served within areasonable time before 30 April 2008 was not a proper and/or valid Notice under the Agreement.

But Chow points out that when SHC conductedcompany search of HK Zhongxing on/about 21 April 2009 and served the Writ of Summons to the 1<sup>st</sup> Address on 29 April 2009, the up-to-date record of HK Zhongxingâs registered office as shown in the Annual Return was still the1<sup>st</sup> Address, and the Plaintiff could not be blamed if HK Zhongxing only lodged Form R1 with the Companies Registry on 27 May 2009, ieoutside the prescribed 14 days from the date of change of address of registered office.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  For the purpose of the Amended Summons, Mr Lam concedes that service of the Writ of Summons on HK Zhongxing was regular. [1]  Instead,he submits that the HK Judgment is irregular because it fails to comply with Order 13 rule 6(1) of the RHC. Order 13 rules 5 and6(1) of the RHC provide as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â 5. Where a writ issued against any defendant is indorsed with two or more of the claims mentioned in the foregoing rules, andno other claim, then, if that defendant fails to give notice of intention to defend, the plaintiff may, after the prescribed time,enter against that defendant such judgment in respect of any such claim as he would be entitled to enter under those rules if thatwere the only claim indorsed on the writ and proceed with the action against the other defendants, if any.</p>        <p class="quote">  6.(1)    Where a writ is indorsed with a claim of a description not mentioned in rules 1 to 4, then, if any defendant fails to givenotice of intention to defend, the plaintiff may, after the prescribed time and, if that defendant has not acknowledged service,upon filing an affidavit proving due service of the writ on him and, where the statement of claim was not indorsed on or served withthe writ, upon serving a statement of claim on him, proceed with the action as if that defendant had given notice of intention todefend.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The Statement of Claim indorsed on the Writ of Summons claims <i>inter alia</i> for â(1) All necessary accounts, directions and inquiry; (2) the Sum; (3) Further or in the alternative, damages; â¦â¦.â (iemixed claims with (1) being outside the scope of Order 13 rules 1-4 of the RHC), so the Plaintiff could not, after the prescribedtime for giving notice of intention to defend, enter default judgment against HK Zhongxing for the Sum in the manner âas it wouldbe entitled to enter under [Order 13 rule 1 of the RHC] if that were the only claim indorsed on the writâ, and would have to proceedwith the action under Order 13 rule 6(1) of the RHC as if HK Zhongxing had given notice of intention to defend.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  However, a plaintiff may abandon inappropriate claim(s) and bring himself within Order 13 rules 1-4 of the RHC in order to enterjudgment in default of notice of intention to defend under those rules. [2]  The commentary on Order 13 rule 6 of the RHC in <i>Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2011</i> Vol.1 para.13/6/1 at p.204 states as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe effect of para.(1) is to preclude a plaintiff from entering judgment in default of notice of intention to defend in every casein which the indorsement on the writ contains or includes a claim which is not squarely within rr.1 to 4 of this Order, and to requirehim to proceed with the action as if that defendant had given notice of intention to defend. If, therefore, there is indorsed onthe writ a claim for an account, â¦â¦ or other remedy or relief which falls outside the descriptions specified in rr.1 to 4, theplaintiff cannot enter judgment in default of notice of intention to defend, unless he expressly and finally abandons every suchremedy or relief. On the other hand, the plaintiff is free to elect which relief he wants to pursue and he is under no duty to giveprior notice of his election to abandon any form of relief which he originally claims, and on the effective abandonment of everyremedy or relief outside the descriptions specified in rr.1 to 4 he is entitled to enter a default judgment under these rules (<i>Morley London Developments Ltd v. Rightside Properties Ltd</i> (1973) 231 E.G. 235, CA).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  In <i>Morley London Developments Ltd</i>, dispute arose between the respondents (who agreed to buy various properties from the appellants) over the sale and purchase of oneof the properties, which resulted in proceedings by the respondents against the appellants for specific performance, alternativelydamages, and all necessary accounts and inquiries.  Upon the appellants entering an appearance, the respondents applied by summonsfor judgment pursuant to Order 86 for damages to be assessed and an account of all sums received by the appellants.  Subsequently,the respondents withdrew the Order 86 summons and, having made plain to the appellants they were going to do so, signed judgmentin default under Order 19 rule 3.  The default judgment expressly stated that with no defence served and âthe [respondents] abandoningtheir claim to the other relief sought in the statement of claim, it is this day adjudged that the [appellants] do pay to the [respondents]damages to be assessedâ.  Upon the appellants applying to set aside the default judgment, Edmund Davies LJ said at p.237 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAt any time, a plaintiff was free to elect to abandon a particular form of relief. â¦â¦ The fact was that a plaintiff was freeto choose the relief he wished to pursue, the only requirement being that at the time when the matter came before the court he mustmake it plain what remedy he asked for. <i>He was under no duty to give prior notice to the other side of his election, though in the present case there seemed to be no doubtthat the respondents had made clear to the appellants their decision to abandon their claim for specific performance and to seekonly unliquidated damages.</i> On November 22, then, <i>the respondents having informed the court</i> and (indeed) the appellantsâ advisers <i>of their decision to seek only the remedy of damages, nothing more was required of</i> <i>them</i> <i>and they were free to sign judgment</i>.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  <i>Morley London Developments Ltd</i> was referred to in <i>Craig Osborne v Patricia Leighton</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/1314.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] EWCA Civ 1314</a> (unreported, 30 April 1999).  In that case, the appellant issued a writ followed by a statement of claim seeking damages for libel,slander and unlawful interference with his contractual relationship with his employer, and an injunction restraining the respondentfrom repeating the various libels and slanders.  The appellant sighted the defence which was served a few hours after the extendedtime limit, but still proceeded to enter default judgment under Order 19 rule 3.  He eventually conceded that the default judgmentought to be set aside, and it was set aside by consent.  The remaining issue before the court was the matter of costs. Mantell LJ(with whom Simon Brown LJ agreed) said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ It is clear, however, from <u>Morley London Developments Ltd v Rightside Properties Ltd</u> (1973) 117 SJ 876 that it is open to a claimant to withdraw part of his claim without notice to the other side in order to take advantageof the administrative procedures provided by Order 19 rule 2 or, for that matter, Order 19 rule 3. But, as was made plain in thatcase, the judgment taken in such circumstances must make it clear on its face that the inappropriate claims have been abandoned,and that was what had happened in <u>Morley London Developments Ltd</u>. â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Here, the first question is whether the Plaintiff had effectively abandoned the remedies or reliefs that were outside Order 13 rules1-4 of the RHC so as to be able to enter default judgment under Order 13 rule 5 of the RHC?</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The Plaintiff did not inform HK Zhongxing about the SHC Election Letter, but when I gave a copy to Mr Lam at the Hearing, he readilyconceded that the Plaintiff had expressly informed the court their abandonment of claims outside the scope of Order 13 rules 1-4of the RHC. But relying on Mantell LJâs above observations, Mr Lam argues that the HK Judgment is irregular in failing to makeclear <i>on its face</i> that the claim for âall necessary accounts, directions and inquiryâ (ie an inappropriate claim outside the scope of Order 13rules 1-4 of the RHC) has been abandoned.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Mr Lam accepts there is no express statutory provision or form in the RHC which requires any default judgment under Order 13 rule5 of the RHC to expressly state on its face that the plaintiff has abandoned all inappropriate claims.  Further, as evident from<i>Craig</i> and as conceded by Mr Lam, Mantell LJâs above observations were <i>obiter</i>. In such circumstances, it is therefore necessary to revisit <i>Morley London Developments Ltd</i> to see whether Mantell LJâs above observations can be supported.  In that case, although it was expressly endorsed on the faceof the default judgment that the plaintiff had abandoned âtheir claim to the other relief sought in the statement of claimâ,such express indorsement was not specified by Edmund Davies LJ to be a necessary requirement for the default judgment to be validand effective.  Indeed, he made clear there was no need to give prior notice of any abandonment of inappropriate claim(s) to thedefendant, and once the plaintiff informed the court of such decision, ânothing more was required of them and they were free tosign judgmentâ.  In my view, the <i>ratio</i> in <i>Morley London Developments Ltd</i> does not support Mantell LJâs interpretation of there being an additional requirement to spell out the abandonment of inappropriateclaim(s) on the face of the default judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr Lam submits that such additional requirement will help the defendant appreciate that inappropriate claim(s) have been abandonedand that the default judgment is therefore regular in this respect.  Even if this amounts to convenient or even good practice, Iam not persuaded that failure to do so will render any default judgment irregular in the sense of being an irremediable nullity. Even assuming there is such additional requirement (which I disagree), if a plaintiff has informed the court (without any need tonotify the defendant) of his abandonment of inappropriate claim(s), the absence of express indorsement of such abandonment on theface of the relevant default judgment at most can only be a remediable procedural irregularity and not an irremediable fundamentalirregularity that nullifies the default judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  I therefore conclude that the HK Judgment is a regular default judgment. For the avoidance of doubt, at the Hearing Ms Lau, counselfor the Plaintiff, abandoned the arguments set out in paragraphs 12-15 of her written submissions. There is no need for me to considerher arguments in paragraph 17 of her written submissions, which are only relevant if the HK Judgment is irregular.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>V.  Merits of the defence</i></p>    <p><i>(a)  Legal principles</i></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Since the HK Judgment is a regular judgment, HK Zhongxing must show a meritorious defence with real prospect of success or whichcarries some degree of conviction. [3]  It has been said that âunless potentially credible affidavit evidence from the defendanthas demonstrated a real likelihood that he will succeed on fact, he cannot have shown that he has a real prospect of successâ.[4]  In <i>Tong Yi Sang &amp; anor v Fung Law &amp; Ng &amp; ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20HKC%20665" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 HKC 665</a>, 672, Kaplan J said as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ I believe that there is a substantial onus on an applicant who seeks to set aside a regular judgment. This is clear fromthe <i>Saudi Eagle</i> [1986] 2 Lloyds Ref. 221. In a case such as this, I would expect a defendant to condescend to particulars of his Defence on the meritsin his own words. â¦â¦ What is far more preferable (and I leave over the question whether it is strictly necessary) is an affidavitin narrative form explaining precisely what the proposed defence will be so that the court can be assisted in forming a value judgmentas to whether it can be satisfied that there is some degree of conviction and a real prospect of success in the proposed defence.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  This requires the court to form some provisional view of the probable outcome of the action.  Where the outcome depends on whoseevidence is likely to be accepted, the appropriate test for determining whether the defendant has real prospect of success is toask whether the defence âcould well be establishedâ at trial or whether the defence witnesses could well be believed at trial.[5]</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  There are other considerations which a court must consider in deciding whether or not to set aside a default judgment, such as thereason why default judgment was allowed to occur in the first place, any delay in making the application to set aside the defaultjudgment, and any consequent prejudice caused to the plaintiff.  The courtâs approach is to conduct a balancing exercise of allrelevant factors. [6]  But the critical factor and starting point are the merits of the defence. [7]  If the defence has no realprospect of success, there is no point in setting aside the same. [8]</p>    <p><i>(b)  Breach of the Agreement?</i></p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr Lam argues that on a true construction of the written Agreement, should the Plaintiff exercise the Option to give up the LandInvestment, SZ Zhongxing must (âå¿é â) repay the Sum before 30 April 2008 (âæ¼2008å¹´4æ30æ¥åâ). He contends thatit is implicit from such provision and from the fact that the Sum was a sizable sum that the Notice âmustâ be given at a reasonabletime âbeforeâ 30 April 2008 so that SZ Zhongxing could arrange for repayment of the Sum to the Plaintiff âbeforeâ 30 April2008, failing which the Plaintiff would be deemed to have irreversibly committed to the Land Investment and deemed to be irreversiblyprecluded from seeking repayment of the Sum.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Further, Chen in his 2<sup>nd</sup> affirmation has denied receipt of the Withdrawal Notice.  Although Chen has complained that the Plaintiff failed to give particularsof their alleged service of the Withdrawal Notice, the Plaintiff has failed to provide any such particulars whether by way of Chowâsaffirmations or otherwise.  Mr Lam submits that the Withdrawal Notice is not unlikely to be an afterthought and/or fabrication tosupport the Plaintiffâs claim, but even if the Plaintiff did issue the Withdrawal Notice (which is denied), he argues that it cannotamount to a valid exercise of the Option.  After all, the Withdrawal Notice only came into existence on 30 April 2008 and could nothave been served within a reasonable time for SZ Zhongxing to repay the Sum to the Plaintiff âbeforeâ 30 April 2008.  By 30 April2008, the deadline for repayment of the Sum and hence exercise of the Option had expired, so the Plaintiff had irreversibly losttheir right to any repayment of the Sum and had irreversibly committed to the Land Investment.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  Ms Lau reminds that certain allegations in the Amended Draft (eg the averment that HK Zhongxing transferred the Sum to Tai Lee)are unsupported by credible affidavit evidence, so the court should view HK Zhongxingâs above arguments, which are newly pleadedin the Amended Draft, with caution and conclude that HK Zhongxingâs defence is without merit.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  It is true that HK Zhongxingâs above arguments are freshly pleaded in the Amended Draft, but they are premised on the writtenagreement exhibited to Chenâs 1<sup>st</sup> affirmation (see paragraph 17 above).  The parties have no dispute over such document, and plain reading of such written agreementsuggests it can be respectably argued that the Plaintiff agreed to pay the Sum to SZ Zhongxing as their first instalment for acquiring24.5% interest in the Land Project with an option for them to back out whereupon SZ Zhongxing must repay the Sum to them before 30April 2008.  Since the written Agreement provides for repayment of the Sum âbeforeâ 30 April 2008, it is also seriously arguablethat the deadline for exercising the Option so as to trigger the repayment obligation must likewise be âbeforeâ 30 April 2008,and hence the Withdrawal Notice dated 30 April 2008 is too late.  The Withdrawal Notice also raises a question as to whether thePlaintiffâs unilateral extension of time for repayment of the Sum to âon or before 7 May 2008â in the absence of any contractualprovision permitting the same (and none has been pleaded in the Statement of Claim) is sufficient to validate the late WithdrawalNotice.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Ms Lau submits that such contentions are incredible because if the Withdrawal Notice were invalid and the Plaintiff had irreversiblycommitted to the Land Investment, then Chenâs affirmations are conspicuously silent on any subsequent communications with the Plaintiffabout their share in the Land Investment. But it must be remembered that SZ Zhongxing and not HK Zhongxing is party to the Land Project. In my view, it is unsurprising that Chen on behalf of HK Zhongxing (which is not privy to the Land Project) does not depose to (a)the progress of the Land Project and/or (b) further communications (if any) amongst the investors concerning such project/investment.</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  But more importantly, I am of the view that it is not possible to form any provisional view as to whether the Withdrawal Noticehad been served on Huang and/or SZ Zhongxing in face of the contradictory factual assertions by the Plaintiff and Chen on behalfof HK Zhongxing.  Indeed, given the Plaintiffâs reluctance to divulge particulars as to whom, how and when such notice was serveddespite HK Zhongxingâs complaint of lack of such particulars, I am convinced that HK Zhongxingâs denial of receipt of the WithdrawalNotice could well be established at trial.  In my view, HK Zhongxing has raised a defence with real prospect of success.</p>    <p><i>(c)  HK Zhongxingâs liability under the Agreement</i></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  Pursuant to the trite principle in <i>Salomon v Salomon &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%20AC%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] AC 22</a>, Mr Lam argues that since Huang and HK Zhongxing are separate legal entities, HK Zhongxing is not liable for Huangâs liabilities(if any) under the Agreement simply because Huang is its sole shareholder/director. [9]  Ms Lau does not challenge such proposition,and Chow accepts that the party liable to repay the Sum under the Agreement was SZ Zhongxing and not HK Zhongxing.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Mr Lam goes on to argue that since HK Zhongxing was merely an agent/nominee for receipt of the Sum on behalf of SZ Zhongxing justas HK Grand Field acted as agent for effecting payment of the Sum on behalf of the Plaintiff, so the Plaintiff (and not HK GrandField) is the plaintiff in the present proceedings and likewise HK Zhongxing cannot be a proper defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  <i>Halsburyâs Laws of England</i> 4<sup>th</sup> ed reissue Vol.2(1) para.189 at p.133 provides as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â The receipt of money from a third person by an agent on his principalâs behalf does not in itself render the agent personallyliable to repay it when the third person becomes entitled as against the principal to repayment, whether the money remains in theagentâs hands or not. If, however, a third person pays money to an agent under a mistake of fact, or in consequence of some wrongfulact, the agent is personally liable to repay it, unless, before the claim for repayment was made upon him, he has paid it to theprincipal or done something equivalent to payment to his principal â¦â¦ Where, however, the agent has been a party to the wrongfulact, â¦â¦ in consequence of which the money has been paid to him, he is not discharged from his liability to make repayment byany payment over to his principal.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>It therefore appears to be two different lines of reasoning which can be taken in recovery of money from an agent.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The first uses the notion that money paid to an agent for his principal and received within the agentâs actual or apparent authority,or the receipt of which is ratified, is regarded as having been paid to and is recoverable from the principal because the agent recipientis regarded as a mere conduit for the money so that âin contemplation of law the payment is made to the principal and not to hisagentâ. [10]  The principal âmay be permanently entitled to it; but by virtue of subsequent events it becomes repayable, as wherea deposit correctly paid is justifiably reclaimed, or there is a total failure of consideration on a contractâ [11] (ie where themoney becomes reclaimable at a later stage than payment), it is then arguable that the principal should alone be liable, for theagent does not receive the money on a conditional basis, and may not be in a position to know whether the money has become returnable,and the matter should therefore be disputed between the principal and the third party. [12]</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The second uses the notion that where the agent holds money to which neither he nor the principal is entitled, it can be interceptedand recovered at this stage unless without knowledge of the claim the agent has paid it over to the principal. ââ¦â¦ If the agentretains the money, the plaintiff may elect to sue either the principal or the agent, and the agent remains liable if he pays overthe money to his principal after notice of the claim.  If he wishes to protect himself, he should interplead. But once the agenthas paid over the money to his principal or to his order without notice of the claim, the plaintiff must sue the principal.â [13] This covers those situations where the liability to repay arises immediately on payment, as where money is paid by mistake, wherethe right to intercept subject to a payment over defence is more easily acceptable. [14]</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  In my view, the defence argument described in paragraph 64 above has real prospect of success.  There is no dispute that under theAgreement the Plaintiff was contractually obliged to pay the Sum to SZ Zhongxing, and that Huang requested the Plaintiff to depositthe monies into the Account.  In my view, it is strongly arguable that (a) HK Zhongxing received the Sum as agent or conduit forSZ Zhongxing, (b) the Sum was correctly paid, and (c) HK Zhongxing did not receive the Sum on a conditional basis.  Further, evenon the Plaintiffâs case, the requirement to repay the Sum arose from a subsequent event being service of the Withdrawal Notice. In such circumstances, the defence contention premised on the first line of reasoning as discussed in paragraph 66 above (ie SZZhongxing as principal should alone be liable irrespective of whether there was any payment over of the Sum received by HK Zhongxingto SZ Zhongxing) has real prospect of success.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  But Ms Lau submits that the first line of reasoning is inapplicable since HK Zhongxing through its sole director/shareholder (ieHuang) was well aware that the Sum had become returnable, and HK Zhongxing was therefore liable to repay the Sum to the Plaintiffby virtue of the various causes of action discussed below.</p>    <p><i>(d)  Alleged breach of the Undertaking Agreement</i></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The Plaintiff claims that pursuant to the Undertaking Agreement HK Zhongxing took up a personal liability to ensure that the Sumwas transferred to SZ Zhongxing immediately or no later than 1-2 days upon receipt of the Sum, but even if the Undertaking Agreementdid not exist (which is denied), a reasonable time for such transfer would still be within 1-2 days of HK Zhongxingâs receipt ofthe Sum.  The Plaintiff further contends that in breach of the Undertaking Agreement, HK Zhongxing failed to transfer the Sum toSZ Zhongxing, and wrongfully and unlawfully misappropriated, spent and/or used the Sum without accounting for and/or returning thesame to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  But the Undertaking Agreement is disputed. Not only does HK Zhongxing denies the existence of such agreement, they positively averthat when and how such transfer were to be done was left to their discretion.  It is true that it is newly pleaded in the AmendedDraft that on/about 27 February 2008 the Sum was transferred from the Account to Tai Lee and that such fact has not been verifiedby affidavit, but I am not persuaded that such lacuna in the affidavit evidence renders HK Zhongxingâs defence incredible.  Afterall, on the primary issue of whether there was any Undertaking Agreement, the Plaintiff has not condescended upon any particularsof when, how, with whom, where and why such oral agreement was made notwithstanding HK Zhongxingâs denial of such agreement.  Thereis also no explanation why the Sum must be transferred to SZ Zhongxing within 1-2 days of receipt by HK Zhongxing.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Ms Lau submits that commercial reality makes it unlikely that the Plaintiff, having lent the Sum to SZ Zhongxing, would agree todeposit such Sum into the Account without any corresponding undertaking by Huang and HK Zhongxing to remit the Sum to Shenzhen Zhongxingwithin a reasonable time (ie within 1-2 days) after receipt of the Sum.  Ms Lau submits that although HK Zhongxing is not entitledto rely on the averment in the Amended Draft that HK Zhongxing transferred the Sum to Tai Lee on/about 27 February 2008 (ie 8 daysafter the Agreement) without affidavit evidence, the Plaintiff can rely on such assertion in support of the existence of the UndertakingAgreement.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  I am not persuaded by Ms Lauâs submissions. Commercial reality can only be considered in context, ie against the whole transactionand possibly also its background, which can only be canvassed at trial.  I am unable to draw any irresistible conclusion from thenomination of HK Zhongxing to receive monies on SZ Zhongxingâs behalf that HK Zhongxing as agent will necessarily assume a personalliability by separate undertaking to the Plaintiff as third party to remit the monies to SZ Zhongxing, which argument essentiallyrenders the first line of reasoning discussed in paragraph 66 above redundant.  The first line of reasoning clearly suggests thatHK Zhongxingâs contrary contention is seriously arguable with real prospect of success.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  For the purpose of the Amended Summons, there is no need for me to consider Mr Lamâs submissions that the Undertaking Agreementis likely to be a recent fabrication by the Plaintiff in their attempt to drag HK Zhongxing into present litigation.  But I agreewith Mr Lam that it is not possible for the court to form any provisional view as to the existence of the Undertaking Agreement atthis stage, and there is real possibility that HK Zhongxing may succeed in its denial at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  Further, even if the Plaintiff were able to establish the existence of the Undertaking Agreement, HK Zhongxing denies any breachthereof.  Interestingly, apart from alluding to some hearsay information in mid-2008 from persons who knew Huang but whose identitiesthe Plaintiff could not recall, the Plaintiff is unable to provide any further particulars of breach of the Undertaking Agreement. The evidential further basis for the Plaintiffâs serious allegation of wrongful and unlawful misappropriation, spending and/oruse of the Sum by Huang and/or HK Zhongxing without the Plaintiffâs approval, consent, authority and knowledge cannot be said tobe strong, and upon considering all the circumstances, I am of the view HK Zhongxingâs denial of any breach of the UndertakingAgreement (if any) is seriously arguable.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  For the present purpose, I shall not rely on HK Zhongxingâs plea in the Amended Draft that they transferred the Sum to Tai Leeon/about 27 February 2008.  But if I am entitled to do so, such plea must be placed in the relevant context, ie HK Zhongxingâscase that such Sum was the Plaintiffâs first instalment for their share of the Land Investment.  In such circumstances, it is arguablethat such transfer of the Sum to Tai Lee (being the PRC company which acquired the Land Project) was for the purpose of the LandInvestment as specified in the Agreement, and hence such transfer arguably does not amount to any breach of contract.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Mr Lam goes on to submit that even if HK Zhongxing were in breach of the Undertaking Agreement, the Plaintiff would only be entitledto claim for damages for such breach, ie loss and damages arising from the difference between transferring the Sum to SZ Zhongxingwithin 1-2 days of receipt of the Sum and failing to transfer such Sum at all.  There is no affidavit evidence and no material factspleaded in the Statement of Claim showing how such loss and damages are quantified at the amount of the Sum and/or how SZ Zhongxingâsrefusal to refund the Sum was caused by HK Zhongxingâs failure to transfer the Sum to them.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  I agree. In any event, even if the Plaintiff were able to establish the existence and breach of the Undertaking Agreement and toquantify their loss and damages at RMBÂ¥5,000,000.00, the Plaintiff is not entitled to recover the Sum by entering final judgmentby default (which is only suitable for a liquidated claim) in contra-distinction to an interlocutory judgment for damages for breachof contract to be assessed. [15]  In such circumstances, the HK Judgment is liable to be set aside.</p>    <p><i>(e)  Money had and received</i></p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Mr Lam submits that the essential elements of a claim for money had and received are as follows [16]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1. the defendant must have received a definite and ascertained sum of money; â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">2. the money received by the defendant must be either the plaintiffâs own money or money in which the plaintiff is directly interested;</p>        <p class="quote">3. the money or its equivalent must be clearly proved to have come into the defendantâs hands;</p>        <p class="quote">4. there must be privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, even if the defendant is wrongfully in possession ofmoney held for the benefit of the plaintiff or is in possession of the plaintiffâs own money: the relationship on which the quasi-contractualobligation is based must be between the plaintiff and the defendant. â¦â¦ privity of contract for this purpose [is not established]between a creditor and the debtorâs servant or agent â¦â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Mr Lam further cites <i>Stephens v Badcock</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281832%29%203%20B%20%26%20Ad%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1832) 3 B&amp;Ad 354</a>, which headnote reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>âJ., an attorney who was accustomed to receive certain dues for the plaintiff, his client, went from home, leaving B., his clerkat the office. B., in the absence of his master, received money on account of the above dues for the client (which he was authorizedto do), and gave a receipt signed âB., for Mr. J.â J. was in bad circumstances when he left home, and he never returned, butit did not appear that his intention so to act was known at the time of the payment to B. B. afterward refused to pay the money overto the client, and on assumpsit brought against him for money had and received, it was held, that the action did not lie; for thatthe defendant received the money as the agent as his master, and was accountable to him for it, the master on the other hand beinganswerable to the client for the sum received by his clerk; and there was no privity of contract between the present plaintiff anddefendant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Mr Lam argues that since HK Zhongxingâs principal was SZ Zhongxing and/or Huang (who directed HK Zhongxing to receive the Sum),there was no privity of contract between the Plaintiff and HK Zhongxing, so any claim by the Plaintiff for money had and receivedshould lie against SZ Zhongxing and/or Huang and not against HK Zhongxing.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  Ms Lau in her written submissions argues that since (a) the Sum was deposited into the Account and (b) Huang was/is HK Zhongxingâsonly director/shareholder, HK Zhongxing must have been fully aware of the Plaintiffâs claim for repayment of the Sum, and havingknowingly and wrongfully kept, misappropriated, spent and/or used the Sum should repay such Sum to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  There is no dispute that the first 3 conditions set out in paragraph 79 above have been satisfied.  In saying that HK Zhongxingis immune from the Plaintiffâs claim for money had and received and that the Plaintiff is restricted to his rights (if any) againstSZ Zhongxing and/or Huang, Mr Lam is essentially relying on the first line of reasoning in paragraph 66 above.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Ms Lau concedes that for the Plaintiff to make good their cause of action on money had and received, it is essential for the Plaintiffto establish that they are entitled to repayment of the Sum under the Agreement and that HK Zhongxing still retains the Sum and/orhas wrongfully and unlawfully misappropriated, spent and/or used the same, which brings in the second line of reasoning in paragraph67 above. [17]  However, as I have already concluded above, HK Zhongxing has raised defence that has real prospect of success againstsuch contentions.  Therefore, there is likewise a viable basis for setting aside the HK Judgment based on the cause of action formoney had and received.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  But I need to go further because at the Hearing Ms Lau submitted that the common law cause of action for money had and receivedshould be regarded as a species of restitutionary claim based upon the principles of unjust enrichment. She relies on <i>Brennan v Brighton Borough Council</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/1628.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] EWCA Civ 1628</a> (7 May 1997) to submit there can be a restitutionary remedy even if some elements of the common law cause of action are absent, anda plaintiff can recover simply by establishing that recovery will be just.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  The short answer to such submissions is the absence of any express cause of action in the Statement of Claim for any stand-alonewrong based on unjust enrichment.  The pleaded claim is one of money had and received.  But even if a free-standing claim of unjustenrichment can be elicited from the Plaintiffâs pleadings, I am still convinced that HK Zhongxing has an arguable defence withreal prospect of success.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  First of all, judicial statements in various authorities suggest that unjust enrichment is not of itself a cause of action, butis merely an underlying principle for the formulation of claims and defences. [18]  So how does <i>Brennan</i> feature in such context?</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In that case, the plaintiff on the advice of the defendants formed a company which was merely his corporate personification andthrough which he controlled the development of a site as a tennis centre.  He advanced substantial sums and did a lot of work inthe expectation that the defendants would grant a 31-year lease on completion of the tennis centre.  The defendants refused to grantsuch lease to the company, which went into liquidation, and they subsequently acquired the tennis centre for a total outlay thatwas much less than its value.  An application to strike out the plaintiffâs claim was mounted on the assumed facts that the defendantswrongfully and in breach of contract refused to grant the lease and thereby forced the plaintiffâs company into liquidation andthat they were enriched by being able to take over the tennis centre.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  The defendants opposed the application on the basis that such enrichment was at the expense not of the plaintiff but of the companybeing a separate legal entity, so the plaintiffâs restitutionary claim was objectionable for subverting the doctrine of privityof contract.  On the other hand, the plaintiff argued that the defendants encouraged him to work through the medium of his companyand required him to control the venture personally through such medium, so his company was only a âconduitâ through which hisfunds enriched the defendants.  The Plaintiffâs counsel seized on some remarks by Lord Goff of Chieveley in his dissenting judgmentin <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20All%20ER%20961" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 All ER 961</a>, 980-981, and argued on the basis of a general rule of restitution to correct injustice that courts should act on the reality ofthe situation and hold the loser to be the plaintiff and not his company.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Despite the principle of separate corporate personality, the English Court of Appeal in <i>Brennan</i> refused to strike out the claim of unjust enrichment, but acknowledged that such argument was at the very outer limits of arguability. Pill LJ  said <i>inter alia</i> that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ I see considerable force in the submissions of [the defendantsâ counsel], particularly that based on the principle in<i>Salomon</i>. <i>The proposed claim would have been a most difficult one and I would not rate the prospects of success at all highly.</i> However, given the relationship between the three parties, that is the plaintiff, the [plaintiffâs company] and the defendants,the conduct of the defendants towards the plaintiff and the enrichment of the defendants which resulted from the transactions, Iwould not have been prepared to hold that it was a plain and obvious case in which the jurisdiction to strike out should have beenexercised. However, for reasons given earlier, I would dismiss this appeal.â(my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Slade LJ said that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦â¦ The major hurdle facing the plaintiff would be that of satisfying the court that, for the purposes of the law of restitution,the enrichment could properly be regarded as having been at the expense of the plaintiff and not exclusively at the expense of thecompany.</p>        <p class="quote">I think that the plaintiffâs prospects of surmounting this hurdle would have been somewhat slender, since it would have involvedpersuading the court in effect to lift the corporate veil. â¦â¦</p>        <p class="quote">On the assumed facts, it can well be said that in the events which have happened the defendantsâ enrichment has in broad terms beenat the plaintiffâs expense. Notwithstanding the Salomon principle, I would not for my part have ruled out the possibility thatat the trial, the court, after full investigation of the special circumstances of this case, and the special relationship betweenthe plaintiff, defendants and company, might have considered it essential to allow the plaintiff a restitutionary remedy in orderto do full justice as between him and the defendants. Accordingly, by a narrow margin, I would not have considered this such a plainand obvious case as to justify the court exercising the draconian remedy of striking out the statement of claim.â (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  It is plain from the above that both Pill and Slade LJJ did not rate the plaintiffâs arguments on his restitutionary claim highly. Indeed, Slade LJ regarded the prospects of such claim âsomewhat slenderâ so that such claim merely survived the striking outâby a narrow marginâ.  As observed by Mann J in <i>Charles Uren v First National Home Finance Limited</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/$(division)/$(year)/$(decno).html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] EWHC 2529</a> [Ch] para.17, âthe Court of Appeal in [<i>Brennan</i>] expressed the view that it was only just on the âsurvivalâ (my word, not theirs) side of the survival/striking out lineâ. Further, the proceedings in <i>Brennan</i> were in fact struck out on different grounds for breach of the limitation rules.  Again as noted by Mann LJ in <i>Charles Uren</i>, the above observations by Pill and Slade LJJ, which were made without deep analysis, were plainly <i>obiter</i>.  In my view, surviving a strike out application on the basis that the claim as framed is at the outer limits of an evolving areaof the law that has yet to be authoritatively decided provides little basis for undermining the real prospect of success posed bydefence arguments premised on the more orthodox first line of reasoning in paragraph 66 above and on the essential elements for aclaim for money had and received in paragraph 79 above.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  Neither counsel referred to <i>Charles Uren</i>, but this is understandable since Ms Lau only referred to <i>Brennan</i> at the Hearing.  In fact, there is a sequel to the <i>Brennan</i> saga. After the plaintiffâs High Court claim was struck out, he resurrected an earlier claim which he commenced in the County Courtand applied to amend such claim by inserting the High Court claim that was struck out and then to have such amended claim transferredto the High Court.  The English Court of Appeal in <i>Brennan v Brighton Borough Council</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/689.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] EWCA Civ 689</a> (23 April 1998) refused him leave on the grounds of want of prosecution and abuse of process.  It is interesting to note that BuxtonLJ (with whom Auld LJ agreed) stated that Slade LJâs observations in <i>Brennan</i> âabout the arguability of the unjust enrichment were obiter, and we are not bound by them.  For the purposes of this applicationI am prepared not to go behind those observations, but I wish it to be specifically understood that I am not thereby to be takento be agreeing with them.â  This lends weight to Mr Lamâs suggestion that the counter-arguments to the above observations byPill and Slade LJ have real prospect of success.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  Again, neither counsel has referred to the local authorities on unjust enrichment [19], but the Court of Final Appeal and Courtof Appeal did emphasise that under the law of restitution, in determining whether the enrichment was unjust, it was essential toconsider how such claim fitted with the contracts of the parties because serious difficulties would arise if the law of restitutionwas expanded to redistribute risks for which provision had been made under an applicable contract.  The law of restitution shouldnot without compelling reasons interfere with the contractual allocation of risks: attempting to do justice by a revision of risksas between, say, A and B might lead to injustice as between, say, B and C or others in the contractual network.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  I accept that unjust enrichment is a developing area of law. [20]  But an application for setting aside default judgment is plainlynot the proper forum for continuing that development.  Although I should not avoid deciding questions of law simply on the basisthat this is a difficult and developing area, it is still appropriate to consider the present context and to further consider whether,despite the scope for evolution of the law, HK Zhongxing has nonetheless shown a defence that has real prospects of success so thatthe HK Judgment ought to be set aside.  Taking all of the above matters into account, I am persuaded that HK Zhongxing has raiseddefences to the cause of action on money had and received that have real prospect of success.</p>    <p><i>(f)  Conversion</i></p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Mr Lam submits that in order to succeed on its claim on conversion, the Plaintiff must establish that HK Zhongxingâs dealing withthe Sum was without their authority.  Since the Plaintiff entered into the Agreement for the purpose of the Land Investment and wasaware that the Land Project involved SZ Zhongxing and other PRC parties through which the Land Project was acquired, the Sum oughtto be transferred to the relevant parties for investment purpose.  Mr Lam says this accords with the fact that HK Zhongxing transferredthe Sum to Tai Lee within 8 days of receipt into the Account for the purpose of the Land Investment, and in the absence of contraryinstructions by the Plaintiff to Huang and/or SZ Zhongxing, such transfer could not have been unauthorised.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  However, the averment in the Amended Draft in respect of the transfer of the Sum by HK Zhongxing to Tai Lee has not been verifiedby affidavit evidence, so I do not propose to rely on the above argument.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Mr Lam next submits that for the conversion claim the Plaintiff has to establish their entitlement to possession as well as wrongfuldealing of the Sum, but as shown above HK Zhongxing has raised good arguable defence with real prospect of success against the Plaintiffâsallegations of (a) breach of the Agreement and (b) existence and breach of the Undertaking Agreement.  Although Ms Lau submits thatthe conversion claim is a stand-alone cause of action free from the Undertaking Agreement, her argument that HK Zhongxing committedconversion by refusing to return the Sum when through Huang it must have had constructive knowledge of the Plaintiffâs demand forrepayment is necessarily premised upon proper service of a valid and effective Notice being the Withdrawal Notice on SZ Shenzhen(ie immediate right to possession) and misappropriation, spending and use of the Sum by HK Zhongxing (ie act of conversion).  Again,as seen above, HK Zhongxing has raised defence with real prospect of success against such arguments.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Ms Lau cites <i>China Everbright â IHD Pacific Ltd v Châong Poh</i> CACV 513/2001 (unreported, 19 February 2002) in support of the conversion claim.  In that case, a fraudulent scheme of sale and purchaseof shares in a company was made possible because all involved parties were ultimately controlled by the culprit and his associates. Under the schemeâs circular transaction, monies went from a bank to the company as cashier orders procured by a related companyand intended as a discharge of the liabilities owed to the company, and then moved from the company to its subsidiary as purportedinvestment, from such subsidiary to a related company as payment towards the purchase price, and from such related company back tothe bank.  The process took a few moments with credit entries followed by corresponding debit entries, but the cash position of theparticipants was not affected.  The company commenced proceedings against the defendant being the purchaser of the companyâs sharesalleging <i>inter alia</i> conversion.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  The Court of Appeal held that the conversion took place when the defendant put in train the active part of the conspiracy by passingthe cashier orders to the company in circumstances where the immediate withdrawal of the proceeds of the cashier orders had alreadybeen secured by the deposit of cheques in favour of its subsidiary.  In short, once the cashier orders were delivered as part andparcel of the fraudulent scheme, the plaintiffâs right to possession of those cashier orders was complete</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  At the Hearing, Ms Lau was unsure whether the defendant in <i>China Everbright â IHD Pacific Ltd</i> lodged any appeal. In fact, he did. [21]  Although the Court of Final Appeal upheld the finding that the defendant was guilty ofconversion of the cashier orders, the judgment of Lord Millett NPJ at pp.661-662 provided useful insight for the present purpose.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  First, Lord Millett NPJ accepted âas trite law that conversion must be conversion of corporeal personal property; choses in actioncannot be converted: see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (18<sup>th</sup> ed.) p.744 para.14-41. â¦â¦â  Here, the Statement of Claim pleads that the property converted was the Sum and not the chequedeposited into the Account on 22 February 2008.  Even on the Plaintiffâs case, their right to demand for repayment of the Sum onlyarose upon service of the Withdrawal Notice dated 30 April 2008 and not at the time of deposit of the cheque into the Account on22 February 2008.  But once the cheque was deposited into the Account, the monies passed into currency.  By 30 April 2008, all thatremained was a chose in action and no longer a cheque.  Quite simply, conversion does not lie for money which has passed into currencyin the sense that if the alleged wrongdoer were sued he could not be required to repay in specie. [22]</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  Secondly, Lord Millett NPJ went on to say explain that the cashier orders in that case were converted because of the unusual factualcircumstances whereby the proceeds were paid into the companyâs account with the specific purpose that they be immediately withdrawnand misapplied, so that the companyâs affirmation of the transaction did not preclude there being a conversion.  Lord Millett NPJplaced weight on the fact that the money was paid with the intention not only that the existing indebtedness owing to the companybe discharged but also to fund the purchase of the shares.  This was not authorised by the company, and was the cause of the loss. But in the present proceedings, the Plaintiff does not allege that HK Zhongxing converted the cheque that was deposited into theAccount.  Unlike <i>China Everbright â IHD Pacific Ltd</i>, there was no matching between the payment of the proceeds of the cheque into the Account and any misapplication of such proceeds. Even on the Plaintiffâs own case, there was a lapse of time between 22 February and 30 April 2008 before the Plaintiff has anyright to demand repayment of the Sum.  Hence, the present case is wholly unlike the unusual circumstances found in <i>China Everbright â IHD Pacific Ltd</i> and arguably the established principle of conversion of only corporeal personal property is applicable.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  In all the circumstances, I am persuaded that there is substantial arguability with real prospect of success against the Plaintiffâsconversion claim.</p>    <p><i>(g)  Conspiracy</i></p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  The Plaintiffâs pleaded claim for conspiracy alleges that Huang and HK Zhongxing were co-conspirators.  This raises an interestingquestion as to whether Huang as sole director/shareholder can conspire with HK Zhongxing as a separate legal entity but at the sametime Huangâs âalter egoâ.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  Neither counsel addressed this issue in their written submissions.  It has been held that a criminal conspiracy between a âone-manâcompany and its sole director is an impossibility because it is not possible to find an agreement between two minds [23], but ithas been suggested that â[this] might not be the case in a civil action where the controller had used the corporate machinery inwhat was alleged to be a conspiracy to damage the claimantâ. [24]  In <i>Taylor v Smyth</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20IR%20142" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] IR 142</a>, 165, McCarthy J noted that no authority was cited in support of extending the principle in <i>R v Donnell</i> to an action for civil conspiracy.  âIn principle, it would seem invidious, for example, that the assets of a limited company shouldnot be liable to answer for conspiracy where its assets had been augmented as a result of the action alleged to constitute the conspiracy. Essentially, it would be permitting the company to lift its corporate veil as and when it suits.â</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  In light of the above discussion and in the absence of detailed submissions by counsel, for the purpose of the Amended Summons,I will not find any defence with real prospect of success based on the above arguments.</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  There is no dispute that the essential ingredients for conspiracy are as follows [25]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn order to make out a case of conspiracy the claimant must establish: (1) an agreement between two or more persons; (2) either,where the means are lawful, an agreement the real and dominant purpose of which is to injure the claimant or, where the means areunlawful, an agreement a purpose of which is to injure the claimant; and (3) that acts done in execution of that agreement resultedin damage to the claimant.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  For lawful means conspiracy, Mr Lam submits that HK Zhongxingâs involvement in accepting the Sum and transferring it to Tai Leewas for the purpose of the Plaintiffâs participation in the Land Investment, so it cannot be said the combination between Huangand HK Zhongxing (if any) was for the predominant purpose of injuring the Plaintiff.  He argues that to the contrary the combinationby Huang, HK Zhongxing and SZ Zhongxing might potentially benefit the Plaintiff if the Land Investment proved to be successful.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  Although there is no affidavit evidence that verifies HK Zhongxingâs transfer of the Sum to Tai Lee, Ms Lau concedes it is anessential element of lawful means conspiracy that the conspirators (ie Huang and HK Zhongxing) retained, misappropriated, spent and/orused the Sum and that such acts were done with the predominant purpose of injuring the Plaintiff.  Since I have found that in thisrespect HK Zhongxing has raised defence with real prospect of success or which could well be believed at trial, there is likewisestrongly arguable defence to the Plaintiffâs claim based on lawful means conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  For unlawful means conspiracy, Mr Lam complains that the Plaintiff has not pleaded the alleged unlawful means.  Ms Lau did not clarifythis in her submissions, but I assume the Plaintiff relies on the plea of wrongful and/or unlawful retention, misappropriation, spendingand use of the Sum by Huang and/or HK Zhongxing in breach of the Agreement and/or the Undertaking Agreement.  Again, since I havealready found that in this respect HK Zhongxing has raised defence with real prospect of success or which could well be establishedat trial, there is likewise similar defence to the Plaintiffâs claim based on unlawful means conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  More importantly, the plaintiff has to prove he has suffered loss or damage as a result of such conspiracy.  Even if the plaintiffcan enter judgment by default, a conspiracy claim can only lead to interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed and does notoffer any basis for entering final judgment (such as the HK Judgment) for payment of a liquidated sum (such as the Sum in the presentcase).</p>    <p><i>(h)  Constructive trust</i></p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  According to <i>Halsburyâs Laws of England</i> 4<sup>th</sup> ed 2007 reissue Vol.48 para.687 at pp.468-469,</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[a] constructive trust attaches by law to specific property which is neither expressly subject to any trusts nor subject to a resultingtrust but which is held by a person in circumstances where it would be inequitable to allow him to assert full beneficial ownershipof the property. Such person will often hold other property in a fiduciary capacity and it will be by virtue of his ownership ofor dealings with that fiduciary property that he acquired the specific property subject to the constructive trust. A third partywho receives property in circumstances where he has actual or constructive notice that it is trust property being transferred tohim in breach of trust will, however, also be a constructive trustee of that property. As a general principle it may be said thatproperty subject to a constructive trust must have come into the hands of the alleged trustee as a result of unconscionable dealingor in breach of a fiduciary obligation.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  Mr Lam submits that there is no breach of contract, no unconscionable dealing and/or no breach of any fiduciary obligation whatsoever. In the absence of the Plaintiffâs instructions to the contrary, the actions of Huang, HK Zhongxing and/or SZ Zhongxing were merelyto carry out the purpose of the Plaintiffâs investment in the Land Investment.  Mr Lam further submits there was no fiduciary relationshipbetween the Plaintiff and HK Zhongxing that might give rise to any constructive trust, and fiduciary relationship (if any) only existedbetween HK Zhongxing (as agent) and SZ Zhongxing (as principal), which means only the latter can complain against the former forany withholding of the Sum (which is denied).</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Ms Lau concedes that to maintain this cause of action the Plaintiff has to establish the existence as well as breach of the UndertakingAgreement to show that HK Zhongxing had actual and constructive notice that their retention, misappropriation, spending and use ofthe Sum was in breach of trust.  Since I have found there is real prospect of success in respect of HK Zhongxingâs defence againstthese contentions, there is likewise similar defence to this cause of action.</p>    <p><i>(i)  Set-off and counterclaim</i></p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  If the Plaintiff is able to establish its claim for the Sum (which HK Zhongxing denies), HK Zhongxong relies on the assignment ofdebt dated 25 May 2009 in respect of the HK Zhongxing Debt (which exceeded the Sum) to raise a defence of legal set-off between mutualliquidated debts [26] and to claim for any shortfall by way of counterclaim.  For the purpose of the Amended Summons, there is nodispute that there would be an arguable defence of legal set-off if there was a valid assignment of the HK Zhongxing Debt as alleged.

The defendant argued that such judgment was not final and conclusiveand therefore not enforceable in Hong Kong.  It was recognised that under PRC law, apart from a two-tier court system which allowedonly one appeal to a higher level Peopleâs Court from a lower level court, the Code allowed for âtrial supervisionâ wherebya party to a case, the Peopleâs Court or the Supreme Peopleâs Procuratorate could, under circumstances specified in Article 179of the Code, apply to the Peopleâs Court where the original trial took place or to a higher level Peopleâs Court for re-trial.

He found such system similar to the circumstances under which an appealcould be brought against a judgment made by a Hong Kong court as provided in the RHC. Further, Hong Kong courts also had power toorder re-trial.  He noted that these local provisions would not render a Hong Kong judgment inconclusive and not final. In any event,the PRC judgment in that case was not intended to be merely provisional.</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  In <i>Wu Wei</i>, DHCJ Lisa Wong SC said at para.99 that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>â99.     â¦â¦ In the context of a PRC judgment, what may potentially render the judgment not final and inconclusive is the âtrialsupervisionâ system under Chapter 16 of the [Code] under which in addition to a party to the case, the Peopleâs Court or theSupreme Peopleâs Procuratorate can, under specified circumstances, apply to the Peopleâs Court before whom the original trialtook place or to a higher level Peopleâs Court for a re-trial. Essentially, those circumstances were where the judgment were erroneousor based on insufficient evidence, where the judgment was obtained in violation of the prescribed procedure and the judicial officersconducting the original trial were guilty of embezzlement, corruption or other malpractice (<i>Lee Yau Wing v Lee Shui Kwan, supra</i>). Hence, it appears to me that the dismissal of the Plaintiffâs application for a re-trial by [the PRC 3<sup>rd</sup> Court] is not a complete answer.</p>        <p>   100.   â¦â¦ In any event, in <i>Lee Yau Wing v Lee Shui Kwan, supra</i>, the Court of Appeal held by a majority (Cheung and Yuen JJA) that whether the existence of the âtrial supervisionâ system <i>per se</i> rendered a PRC judgment inconclusive and not final involved complicated legal questions that could not be determined in the absenceof trial.</p>        <p>   101.   In the circumstances, the PRC Judgment merely adds to the serious issues to be tried in this action.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>On appeal, Tang VP at para.7 referred to<i>æç¥æ¦®</i>and agreed that the question as to whether the PRC judgment in the case before him should be recognised as âfinal and conclusiveââå¿é å¨æ­£å¯©ä¹å¾æå¯ä»¥ä½åºè£å®â.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  In my view, the legal effect of the PRC Judgment is not a simple matter and should not be dealt with in summary way. Given (a) PRClaw is a matter of fact to be proved by PRC legal experts, (b) there is fundamental conflict between the PRC expert opinion adducedby the Plaintiff and that by HK Zhongxing as to the effect of re-trial on the PRC Judgment and on the assignment of the HK ZhongxingDebt, (c) the guidance in the above authorities that such issue should be resolved at trial, (d) the dissenting judgment of ChungJ in<i>æç¥æ¦®</i> to the effect that the trial supervision or re-trial system under PRC law did not undermine the final and conclusive nature of anyPRC appeal judgment under the two-tier court system, I am convinced that HK Zhongxingâs assertion of there being a valid and effectiveassignment of the HK Zhongxing Debt in its favour to buttress the defence of set-off has real prospect of success and should be leftto trial.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  To accede to Ms Lauâs submission that suspension of the legal effectiveness of the PRC Judgment pending the re-trial as directedby the PRC 3<sup>rd</sup> Court leads to suspension of the legal effectiveness of the assignment of the HK Zhongxing Debt is tantamount to accepting the PRClegal opinion adduced by the Plaintiff and ignoring not just the PRC legal opinion by HK Zhongxing but also Chung Jâs reasoningin <i>æç¥æ¦®</i> (which arguably is more broadly applicable than the limited factual context of that case where the defendant did not petition forre-trial).  There is no persuasive reason why all these matters should be ignored at this stage of the proceedings when all HK Zhongxingneeds to establish is a defence with real prospect of success.  In any event, I am not persuaded by Ms Lauâs submissions that afair reading of the PRC Pre-trial Decision and the provisions of the Code will necessarily lead to the construction she advocated.However, for the present purpose, I do not take into account the steps taken by the PRC 1<sup>st</sup> Court for enforcement of the PRC Judgment after the PRC Re-trial Decision because such decision directed a temporary stay of execution.</p>    <p><i>(j)  Summary</i></p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  In all the circumstances and looking at the totality of the affidavit evidence, I am of the view that HK Zhongxing has dischargedits burden in showing defence arguments which have real prospects of success or which could well be established at trial.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>VI.  Discretion</i></p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  Ms Lau submits that even if I were minded to set aside the HK Judgment against HK Zhongxing, I should impose a condition requiringHK Zhongxing to pay a sum of HK$5,484,000.00 into court.</p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  The relevant principles can be found in the judgment of Ribeiro JA (as he then was) in <i>L &amp; M Specialist Construction Ltd v Wo Hing Construction Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%203%20HKLRD%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] 3 HKLRD 262</a>, 268-269.  Whilst he agreed that Order 13 rule 9 of the RHC made clear the court had jurisdiction to impose appropriate terms forsetting aside default judgment, â[most] of these [examples] involve terms requiring payment of the other partyâs costsâ.  Thelearned judge referred to examples of conditions requiring money be brought into court in <i>Richardson v Howlett</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281892%29%208%20TLR%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1892) 8 TLR 445</a> where the defendants appeared to play for time and the defence was shadowy (although in modern times a shadowy defence might notbe sufficient for setting aside a default judgment) and <i>City Construction Contracts (London) Ltd v Adan</i> (unreported) The Times January 4, 1988 where it was said the imposition of such condition was ânot to punish the defendant butto encourage the proper conduct of the litigation and to provide a measure of security for the plaintiffâ.  The learned judge wenton to say as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn my view, it must be rare that a payment into court is made a judgment of setting aside a judgment. It may in theory do so, â¦â¦However, there is a certain logical tension between a court deciding that the defendant has real prospects of succeeding in his defenceand the court considering at the same time that the defence is in shadowy realms. While I do not consider such an outcome impossible,<i>I would expect it to be exceedingly rare</i>. I do not consider the present case to come within that category.</p>        <p class="quote"><b>â¦â¦</b> As I have pointed out, the procedural infraction in the present case is very minor and no basis has been made out for providing thepresent plaintiff with security, either for its claim or for its costs.</p>        <p class="quote">The abovementioned examples of course are not exhaustive. However, to my mind, what they show is that where the defendant has a reasonablyarguable defence which ought to be allowed to go to trial, there must be something specific in the defendant's conduct or in thecase which justifies the imposition of a condition such as that imposed here. There must, in other words, be some material upon whichthe court can exercise its discretion in that manner: <b><i>Ratnam v Cumarasamy</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%201%20WLR%208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 1 WLR 8.â</a> (my emphasis)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  The above principles were endorsed by Ma J (as he then was) in <i>Dah Chong Hong (Engineering) Limited v Boldwin Construction Company Limited</i> HCA 1291/2002 (unreported, 11<sup>th</sup> October 2002) at paras.29-31.  He went even further as follows: âI would venture to add that in most cases, a suitable order forcosts will often be the only appropriate term to impose on a defendant.â</p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  I respectfully agree with all of the above observations. Here, the âprocedural infarctionâ was not substantial.  A failure topromptly notify the Companies Registry of change of address of registered office is not such as to attract the stringent conditionsuggested.  I am also not persuaded that in taking out the Summons on 14 July 2009 the application was intolerably late.  Further,notwithstanding Ms Lauâs criticisms of HK Zhongxingâs case which I have carefully considered and analysed above, I am not preparedto order that HK Zhongxing should be asked to pay money into court as a condition of setting aside the HK Judgment.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>VII.  Conclusion</i></p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  In the circumstances, the HK Judgment is set aside unconditionally.  The relief sought in the Amended Summons set out in paragraph6(c) above is therefore redundant, and I make no order accordingly.  I also grant the following case management directions:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(a) HK Zhongxing do within 7 days from today file Acknowledgment of Service;</p>        <p>(b) HK Zhongxing do within 14 days from today file and serve their Defence and Counterclaim  as <i>per</i> the Amended Draft, and such Defence and Counterclaim shall be accompanied by its statement of truth;</p>        <p>(c)  leave to the Plaintiff to file and serve Reply and Defence to Counterclaim within 28 days thereafter, and such Reply and Defenceto Counterclaim shall be accompanied by its statement of truth;</p>        <p>(d) within 28 days after the close of pleadings, the Plaintiff and HK Zhongxing do respectively file and serve timetabling questionnaireon each other.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The Plaintiff and HK Zhongxing should comply with Order 25 of the RHC and, where appropriate, the Plaintiff should promptly take outa case management summons.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  I further direct that within 14 days from today the Plaintiff and HK Zhongxing do jointly report in writing to Barma J in the WUAction the results of the Amended Summons and seek all necessary and appropriate case management directions for the expeditious disposalof the Petition and the Petition Summons with a view to saving costs and achieving procedural economy.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  I also grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that save and except for costs of and occasioned by the Hearing before me, HK Zhongxing should pay to the Plaintiff costs of theSummons and Amended Summons (including all costs reserved, if any) in any event to be taxed if not agreed with certificate for counsel. The HK Judgment is a regular judgment, and HK Zhongxing in making the present application seeks an indulgence of the court, so theyshould bear the costs of the Summons and Amended Summons up to the time when the Plaintiff had sufficient information to reasonablyand realistically consider whether they should oppose the application.  Since (a) HK Zhongxing only abandoned their challenge againstthe HK Judgment on the grounds of irregular service of the Writ of Summons and <i>forum non conveniens</i> by way of Mr Lamâs written submissions for the Hearing, (b) both the Plaintiff and HK Zhongxing filed and served further affirmationsas late as in late December 2010 and mid-January 2011 in the WU Action, which were adopted for the purpose of the Amended Summons,and (c) HK Zhongxing only presented the Amended Draft at the eve of the Hearing, it is appropriate that HK Zhongxing should bearthe costs of the Summons and Amended Summons save and except for costs of and occasioned by the Hearing before me.</p>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  As regards costs of and occasioned by the Hearing, even though HK Zhongxing successfully set aside the HK Judgment, I do not losesight of the fact that their application was made to enable them to raise a defence and counterclaim.  It is therefore inappropriateto order the Plaintiff to immediately bear any part of the costs of the application given the possibility that HK Zhongxingâs defencemay eventually turn out to be unmeritorious.  In the circumstances, I grant a costs order <i>nisi</i> that costs of and occasioned by the Hearing before me be HK Zhongxingâs costs in the cause with certificate for counsel.  Havingconsidered the nature of the application and the arguments raised by counsel, I am not persuaded this is a matter fit for two counsel.</p>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  I have debated whether to require summary assessment of costs in respect of the costs order nisi in paragraph 140 above.  However,giving the overlap and duplication with the WU Action, including adoption of affidavits used in those proceedings, conventional taxationof costs with more detailed analysis will be fairer to the parties.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>VIII.  Postscript</i></p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  As I informed counsel at the Hearing, it has given me concern, especially after implementation of the Civil Justice Reform, thatan application to set aside default judgment is only disposed of 1Â½ years after issuance of the relevant summons.  Both partieshave taken a leisurely approach to producing affidavits, and neither party is able to offer any good reason for the delay for almosta year in restoring the Amended Summons for substantive hearing (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above).  After all, it is not necessaryfor the PRC proceedings to run their full course before the substantive hearing since the PRC appeal and re-trial procedures areset out in PRC legislation and PRC legal opinion can be obtained on such basis.  In any event, this only goes to one line of defenceamongst many put forward by HK Zhongxing.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  Not only is the aforesaid delay tantamount to flaunting the courtâs case management directions for adjourning the Amended Summonsfor substantive hearing, such folly is compounded by the parallel WU Action and the corresponding deferral of the substantive hearingof the Petition and the Petition Summons.  It is of no benefit to either HK Zhongxing and/or their creditors to keep the Petitionin limbo for over 1Â½ years.</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  It is the duty of both the Plaintiff and HK Zhongxing and their legal representatives to assist the Court in furthering the underlyingobjectives of ensuring expeditious progress of litigation, saving costs and encouraging procedural economy.  Had the parties appliedfor the Summons or Amended Summons to be heard by a Judge of the Court of First Instance together with the Petition and the PetitionSummons and promptly set those matters down for substantive hearing, there would have been no need to file parallel affidavits inboth sets of proceedings and it is highly probable that all outstanding matters would have been resolved long before now. Both partiesare directed to bring the above matters to the attention of (a) the Taxing Master for the purpose of taxation of the above costsorders and (b) the Companies Court when dealing with the question of costs.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Marlene Ng)<br />          Master of the High Court <br /></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>          </p><!--sino section representation --><representation><p>Ms Lorinda Lau instructed by Messrs Simon Ho &amp;
