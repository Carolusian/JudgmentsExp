Liberty to apply was reservedin respect of costs. On 24th February 1987 I heard various applications for costs and reserved judgment. I now hand down judgmenton costs, pursuant to Rules of the Supreme Court Order 42 Rule 5B.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> In the substantive action for damages judgment was given for the plaintiffs against the 2nd defendant. The plaintiffs claim againstthe 1st defendant was abandoned. The plaintiffs claim against the 3rd defendant was dismissed. By consent, the issue of liabilitybetween the 3rd defendant and the 1st Third Party and 2nd Third party, was tried at the same time as the plaintiffs claim againstthe defendants. In those third party proceedings the 3rd defendant claimed an indemnity against the third parties. The third parties,in turn, counterclaimed for an indemnity against the 3rd defendant. In view of the plaintiffs claim against the 3rd defendant beingdismissed, the question of an indemnity against the third parties did not arise. The third parties own counter claim against the3rd defendant was dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> I would record that when the action first came on for trial on 27th June 1986 the hearing, on the plaintiffs application, was vacated.The Court then ordered that the costs of that adjournment were to be paid by the plaintiffs, in any event, on a common fund basis.Any order I may now make for costs will, of course, be subject to that prior order of 27th June 1986.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Counsel for the plaintiffs sought the following order as to costs:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="11%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="89%" valign="top">                That the 2nd defendant pay the plaintiffs costs;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="89%" valign="top">                That the 2nd defendant pay the 3rd defendant's costs;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(c)</td>            <td width="89%" valign="top">                That the plaintiffs pay the 1st defendant's costs.                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Counsel for the 1st and 2nd defendants agreed that the 2nd defendant should pay the plaintiffs costs but only those incurred againstthe 2nd defendant and accepted that the plaintiffs should pay the 1st defendant's costs. Counsel further submitted that the plaintiffsshould pay the 3rd defendant's costs and that there should be no order as to costs in the third party proceedings. Counsel for the3rd defendant submitted that its costs in the action should be paid by the plaintiffs and that the 2nd defendant should pay the costsof the third party proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> I am satisfied, in accordance with the principle that costs should follow the event, that the plaintiffs are entitled to their costsinourred against the 2nd defendant. I am equally satisfied that the plaintiffs should pay the costs of the 1st defendant. The onlydifficulty in relation to costs, arises as a consequence of the plaintiffs claim again 2t the 3rd defendant being dismissed and theconsequential issue of third party proceedings costs.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> The Court has a discretion as to costs but that discretion must be exercised judicially in accordance with the appropriate principles.I listened to lengthy submissions by all Counsel, but with Lord Greene's injunction in <u>Hong v A.&amp; R. Brown Ltd.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%201%20All%20E%20R%20185" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 1 All E R. 185</a>, increasingly ringing in my ears:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Everbody knows that discussions as to costs are discouraged, and rightly discouraged, by judges when they are convinced that theyhave all the materials before them and there is no arguable point of law. It happens everyday. If it did not, it would be a greatmisfortune, since costs, being in the discretion of the judge, are not matters which are susceptible to sustained argument unlesssome proposition of law is involved."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The submissions were largely based on and did not dispute, the general principles appearing in 1 ''<u>The Supreme Court Practice 1985</u>" 874 and in particular paragraph 62/2/46. However, I recognise that the issue as to costs was on this occasion more complex thanis common and I was considerably assisted by Counsels industry.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that where it is reasonable for a plaintiff to sue two defendants, making his claim against themin the alternative, but succeeds only against one defendant, the Court has a discretion to order the unsuccessful defendant to paythe successful defendant's costs. It was submitted that on the facts known to the plaintiffs before trial, made the more complicatedby death of both deceased, it was entirely reasonable to sue the 3rd defendant as well as the 2nd defendant. The pond, I was reminded,was within the apparent contractual area of the 3rd defendant and it was only during oral evidence that the delayed possession ofthe pond became clear. Equally it was only during oral evidence that the 3rd defendant's steps to avoid the accumulation of water,from its works into the pond, became known. Further, it was clear that the 3rd defendant had carried out repair work beyond its areaon the road but it was only at the trial that the limited basis of that work was revealed to the plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Counsel for the plaintiff recognised that the order he sought, sometimes called a Bullock order but in the direct form sought, moreaccurately called a Sanderson order, is not made where the causes of action are separate and distinct or the claims are in the alternativeor are based on a different set of facts. It was his submission that the causes of action against both remaining defendants werefounded in tort and that the particulars of negligence were directly related to each other. The facts, it was submitted, arose fromthe same incident, and were similarly interrelated.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Counsel for the 2nd defendant reminded the Court that although it might have been reasonable to sue both defendants, it did not automaticallyfollow that the plaintiff was entitled to a Bullock or Sanderson order. The making of such orders was a matter of discretion to beexercised in accordance well settled principles governing the exercise of that discretion. Counsel referred to <u>Hong v A.&amp; R. Brown Ltd.</u>, <u>Salsbury v Woodland</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%203%20All%20ER%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 3 All E.R. 215</a>, <u>MuIready v J.H. &amp; W.

Nor would an order be made where the causesof action were separate and distinct. In the present case, it was submitted the plaintiff was not in a dilemna and the facts weresimilar to those in <u>Salsbury v. Woodland</u> where it was held that no dilemna existed. Further, the causes of action, although within the very broad tort of negligence, werequite distinct. The claim against the 2nd defendant was based on an allegation of negligent driving. The two fold claim against the3rd defendant was based on occupiers liability and the creation of a hazard. It was submitted that the causes of action were alsono more connected than those in <u>Mulready v J.H. &amp; W. Bell</u>. Further, that in the instant case the Court had not gone so far as to hold that the 3rd defendant as occupier was not liable, buthad merely found that it had not been established that the 3rd defendant was the occupier. This was a case where the plaintiff had,so far as occupier's liability was concerned, mistakenly sued a non-occupier. The position may have been different if the actualoccupier had been sued.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Counsel for the 3rd defendant submitted that the crucial factor which the plaintiffs were unable to overcome, was that before a Bullockorder could be made, the claims must be in the alternative. The plaintiff had never claimed in the alternative but up to the endof the trial had claimed that both defendants were liable. Further, it was submitted that the causes of action were separate andbased on different facts. In the 3rd defendant's view, the fact that it was not  the occupier, was clear from the documentary evidenceavailable to the plaintiffs well before trial. Accordingly, in the 3rd defendant's submission, the plaintiff and not the 2nd defendant,should be ordered to pay the 3rd defendant's costs.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In reply Mr. Pritchard submitted that the occupation issue was irrelevant, for the 3rd defendant was in any event potentially liableas a creator of the hazard quite independently of occupation. It was also submitted that alternative causes of action were not limitedto where one was exclusive of the other, for the question of apportionment might arise. Here, it was submitted, there were trulyalternative causes of action. In that event the Court had a discretion to make a Bullock or Sanderson order and on the facts suchorders were reasonable.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Against the background of those submissions, I would record that as a matter of law, the Court has a discretion as to costs. However,in the case of Bullock or Sanderson orders, I accept that judicial discretion must be exercised in accordance with well establishedcommon law principles. One of those principles is that an order should not be made, where the doubt giving rise to the plaintiffsuing several defendants, is limited to a matter of law. Examples of the application of that principle from the cases cited were<u>Donovan v Cammell Laird &amp; Co</u>, <u>Kelly's Directories Ltd. v Gavin</u> and <u>Poulton v Moore</u>. In this action no doubt existed as to the law so, to that extent, the Court's discretion remains untrammeled.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> As to the facts, I am satisfied that the unclear pro-trial position made it entirely reasonable for the plaintiffs to sue both defendants.However, that right does not necessarily entitle a plaintiff, successful against one only of such defendants, to the orders now sought.<u>Hong v A. &amp; R. Brown Ltd</u>. is clear authority for that proposition. There are also a number of cases where, even though the facts giving rise to the injuriesfor which damages were claimed, arose out of the same incident, the Court held that the causes of action more separate and distinct.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In <u>Salsbury v. Woodland</u> the plaintiff suffered personal injuries and sued several defendants. The plaintiff while removing some fallen telephone lines fromthe road, had been injured when avoiding an oncoming car. The wires had been fouled by the second defendant negligently falling atree. The second defendant was employed as an independent contractor to fell the tree, by the occupier of the land, who was the firstdefendant. The plaintiff succeeded against the second defendant but the action against the first defendant was dismissed. The Courtof Appeal held that no dilemma existed which would have justified a Bullock order.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> In <u>Mulready v J H &amp; W Bell Ltd</u> the second defendant contracted with the first defendants to carry out construction work on the latter's factory. A workmen employedby a sub-contractor was injured. The plaintiff's action was founded on alleged breaches of two different statutory duties by thedefendants. The first defendant was alleged to be in breach of a duty under the Factories Act 1937. The second defendant was allegedto be in breach of a duty under the Building (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1948. Damages were awarded against the seconddefendant but the claim against the first defendant was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that a Bullock order was not appropriates,Lord Goddard C .J., stating:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It does not appear to us that it is an appropriate order to make where a plaintiff is alleging perfectly independent causes of actionagainst two defendants where the breaches of duty alleged are in no way connected one with the other."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> In <u>Hong v A.C. R. Brown Ltd,</u> the Court of Appeal emphasised that a Bullock order is a special order. The plaintiffs allegations in that case were expressly madeboth jointly and in the alternative. The plaintiffs were employed as workmen by the first defendants to carry out repairs on a ship,which was under the management of the second defendants. The action was dismissed against the first defendant and damages were awardedagainst the second defendants. The trial judge held that it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to sue both defendants but not reasonablefor the second defendant's also to pay the first defendant's costs. The Court of Appeal, in upholding the judge's refusal to makea Bullock Order, only went se far as to say that the matter was for the judge's discretion which he had properly exercised.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Another case here a trial Judge declined to make a Bullock order, was <u>Dryden v. Surrey County Council</u>, where in a medical negligence case the plaintiff succeeded against the doctor but failed against the hospital owning Council. Onthe question of costs, Finlay J. declared:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Entirely different negligence was alleged against the hospital and against the doctor, although they arose out of the same matter.The acts of negligence were quite different and while I regret it, I must remember that the plaintiff has brought an action againstthe Surrey County Council and in my opinion failed on the facts and the law. In these circumstances I am of the opinion I shouldbe doing injustice if I were to order the defendant doctor to pay the costs of the successful county council, those costs relatingto issues different from those in which he was interested and raising points which did not arise in his case."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> While I share some of the regret expressed by Finlay J., the factors he mentions, seem to me to be very similar to the facts in thiscase which, on similar reasoning, would lead to my discretion being exercised against making the orders the plaintiff seeks. Beforearriving at this conclusion I have also taken into account that in this action, the 2nd defendant expressly pleaded in its Re-AmendedDefence, that the matters complained of by the plaintiffs were caused or contributed by the negligence of the 3rd defendant. On thatissue there are dicta in some of the cases that a factor against making a Ballock Order, is that the unsuccessful defendant did notmake any allegations against the successful defendant. For example in <u>Mulready v J.H. &amp; W. Bell Ltd</u>. Lord Goddard included among the reasons for not making a Bullock order the following:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"That the first defendants denied that they were responsible for the breach of reg. 31 was in effect putting the blame on Keating,but not on the second defendants, and we can see no ground on which the order should have been made..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> However, such dicta do not reduce the force of the fundamental principle that a Bullock order is not appropriate where, as in thisaction, the causes of action are separate and distinct. Having arrived at this conclusion, it is unnecessary to go on to determinewhether the claims were brought in the alternative. I merely record that the claims were not expressly pleaded in the alternative.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> The remaining costs issue between the parties to the action concerns the third party proceedings. The 3rd defendant asks for costsagainst the 2nd defendant. Counsel for the 2nd defendant submitted that there should be no order as to costs on the third party proceedings.I was also reminded of a co-defendant's entitlement, without issuing third party proceedings, to contribution under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Liability (Contribution) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/377">Cap. 377</a>. I have considered the provisions of that Ordinance and the reference to the similar English legislation in 1 '<u>The Supreme Court Practice 1985'</u> 240 at 16/8/2. Notwithstanding those helpful statutory provisions, I appreciate that it will still often be reasonable for a defendantto issue third party proceedings. In particular he will need to do so if he wishes to ask for discovery or leave to administer interrogatoriesto a co-defendant. In fact the pleadings do not disclose that the 3rd defendant took either of these or any other third party interlocutorysteps. When I review all the circumstances relevant to the exercise of my discretion in the third party proceedings, I consider theproper course is not to make any order as to costs.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Accordingly I make the following orders:</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="95%">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top">1.</td>            <td width="82%">                The 2nd defendant shall pay the plaintiffs costs incurred against the 2nd defendant to be taxed if not agreed inaccordance with the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top">2.</td>            <td width="82%">                The plaintiffs shall pay the 1st defendant's costs incurred against the plaintiffs to be taxed if not agreed in accordancewith the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top">3.</td>            <td width="82%">                The plaintiffs shall pay the 3rd defendant's costs incurred against the plaintiffs to be taxed if not agreed in accordancewith the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td width="7%" valign="top">4.</td>            <td width="82%">There will be no order as to costs in the third party proceedings.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Finally, I confirm that the plaintiffs adjourned application against their former solicitors, for an indemnity in respect of thecosts ordered to be paid by them on 27th June 1986, will be heard on 8th June 1987.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">                <p style="text-align:center">(G.N.
