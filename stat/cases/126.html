The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, also a Hong Kong company, is also involved in the supply and manufacture of fabric for the garment industry.  For reasonswhich I need not explain for the purposes of the summonses before me, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is alleging that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff owes it US$100,000 in respect of a substantial contract for the supply of fabric by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to a third party.  The payment for this fabric by the third party to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was arranged by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff who would act on the instructions of the third party and its associates.  It is the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs case that it is not a party to the contract between the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the third party and that it therefore has no liability to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under this contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Notwithstanding the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffâs stated position the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has looked to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff for the outstanding US$100,000 which it alleges is the outstanding balance on the contract.  The recovery of this amountfrom the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was put into the hands of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant which, amongst other things, is a debt collection agency, by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is a senior manager employed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantâs employees and/or agents are said to have used unlawful means to try and persuade the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to pay the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant the amount of US$100,000.  These people are said to have threatened and harassed the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, who is a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, as well as his wife the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff and their daughter the 4<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The amended statement of claim makes two separate claims.  Firstly, for a declaration that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff is not a party to the contract between the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the third party with the result that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is not entitled to look to it for payment of the allegedly outstanding balance of US$100,000 and, secondly, the quite separateclaim against all three Defendants that the Plaintiffs are entitled to damages for harassment and nuisance as well as an injunctionin respect of the debt-collecting activities of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Summonses</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Out of these latter claims the Plaintiffs have taken out two summonses, the principal of which is under Order 14 to enter finaljudgment, with damages to be assessed, in respect of the claim for harassment, nuisance and an injunction.  The other, under O. 18r. 19, is to strike out part of the defence and counterclaim and parts of the Defendants witness statements.  This summons wouldonly be effective or necessary if the Order 14 summons fails.  In these circumstances, I will leave it over to after I have dealtwith the Order 14 summons which I now turn to.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  I should make clear at the outset that the Plaintiffs have disposed of this part of the action against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants, to their satisfaction and presumably to that of these two defendants, by agreement with the result that I am not concernedwith the liability or otherwise of these two Defendants.  These two summonses therefore only stand against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">The Material Facts</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The evidence discloses that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant selected the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to act on its behalf after it had ensured that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was of good standing and repute.  In this regard, it seems to me that I must take the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs case at face value.  The Plaintiffs will therefore only succeed if they can demonstrate that, even on the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs case as its stands on affidavit, it cannot have a defence in law on the respective claims.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  This being so I need briefly to set out the nature of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs evidence, which is well documented, before I consider the law as it relates to these parties in their respective positions. Most of this comes from the witness statement of Mr Anthony Ko, a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  This evidence is at paras. 44-49 and 58.  Given its importance I will set it out here:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="5%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>â</i></td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2"><i>â¦ In about May, 2003, a friend of mine called Mr Alex Wong, introduced me to a firm known as Informlink Consultancy Limited, the2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in this action.

Suffice it to observe at present that having suffered the behaviour of the debt-collectorsemployed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiffs instructed solicitors to write to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to complain on their behalf and to demand that these activities should stop immediately.  As to this correspondence, MrKo says the following in para. 58 of his witness statement which represents the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs stance in this matter:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="98%" valign="top" class="quote"><i>âOur company had no knowledge of the matters alleged in the said letter or whether the alleged acts were committed at all.

This evidence is contained in the hearing bundle and is there to be read.  It tells of threateningand unpleasant visits (some 10 of them) to the offices of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff at Tsimshatsui, the purpose of which were to frighten the Freys into paying up.  These visits were supplemented by attendingthe Freyâs home and backed up by threatening and abusive calls to the Freys themselves and their domestic helper and their youngerdaughter Andrea.  All of this intended to cause them to fear for their well-being and to persuade Mr and Mrs Frey to pay up on behalfof their company, the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  There is no doubt that this behaviour amounts to harassment of the crudest type which, quite apart from being unlawful to amountto a crime, also amounts to the tort of harassment and, subject to some further remarks that I need to make, also to the tort ofnuisance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  This evidence is of course not capable of challenge on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.  Mr Wallace Cheung, who appears for it, says that this is all very unfair.  I should not accept this evidence, which isjust on paper, from Mr and Mrs Frey in the form of their witness statements and attested to on affidavit by Mr Frey in his affidavitof 7 July 2006.  Mr Cheung submits that this evidence should be called at trial in the conventional way so that it can be testedin cross-examination.  He also complains that because the other Defendants (the real villains of the piece) have settled the actionhis client does not have the benefit of what might be said by them to gainsay the Plaintiffâs evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  It seems to me that this part of Mr Cheungâs submission must fail.  At this Order 14 stage each party is at liberty to put insuch evidence as it wishes to.

The contractprovided that only lawful means would be used to collect the debt.  In apparent breach of that contract, the Defendantâs operativesused threats and conducted themselves in a way that constituted, assault and intimidation.  The judge at first instance held thatthe Defendant was not liable for the undoubted torts of the debt-collection agencyâs staff.  The Court of Appeal (Rogers VP, Keithand Le Pichon JJAâs) reversed the trial judge and held that the Defendant was liable for the actions of the debt-collection agencynotwithstanding the terms of the contract between the Defendant and the debt-collection agency.  The courtâs analysis is amplyreflected in the head note of the report.

The principle and approach of the Court of Appealapplies identically to the facts before me and I can find no material distinction between that case and the present one.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Cheung, for the Defendants, has submitted that the Plaintiffs have failed to make out a case on harassment, it being an intentionaltort.  The damage that must result, is physical harm or a recognised psychiatric illness.  He says that the Defendantsâ intentionto cause either or both of these conditions needs to be established.  Secondly, he submits that in respect of the claim based onnuisance it is a requirement that the person wronged must have an interest in the land and that a mere licensee or occupier has noright to sue.  In support of this he cites <i>Artco Properties v Yau Chun Ying</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%201%20HKLRD%20697" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2000) 1 HKLRD 697</a> at 701G and the House of Lords decision in <i>Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20AC%20655" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) AC 655.</a>  He says that <i>Clerk and Lindsell</i>, paras 20-24 is also to the same effect.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  In this regard he submits that the Freyâs (all of them) have not established a sufficient interest or nexus in the land, in thiscase their office and home, to enable them to bring an action in nuisance.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Conclusions</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It seems to me that none of these submissions by Mr Cheung can avert a summary judgment being entered against his client.  Firstly,the facts are all one way in regard to the acts of harassment and nuisance (leaving aside for the moment the question of the Plaintiffsâ<i>locus</i> to sue in nuisance).  As to the question of the need to show a deliberate intention to cause actual bodily harm or inflict some formof recognised psychiatric illness, it seems to me that this grossly overstates the position.  The acts in this case, conclusivelyproved on the evidence, are precisely the sort of acts, with their intended consequence, which the tort of harassment seeks to preventand compensate a victim for by damages and/or injunction.  As to the question of <i>locus</i> in terms of the necessity to show a sufficient interest in the land, being the offices of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff and the Freyâs home, it strikes me that the Freyâs interest in both premises is quite sufficient to qualify them asPlaintiffs.  As to their daughter her interest is derived from her parents, she being a minor, this being her home as well.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I am unable to discover, despite Mr Cheungâs industry, any issue, either of fact or law, that is fit to go to trial.  Accordingly,I propose to enter judgment in favour of the Defendants on this part of the case with damages to be assessed, which can be convenientlyheard by me at the trial of the remaining part of the action which is due to take place shortly.
