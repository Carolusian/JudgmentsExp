INTRODUCTION</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In August 1999 Ms. Chanâs barge (the Tow) sank while being towed by Mr. Wongâs vessel (the Tug).  In April 2005 Ms. Chan issueda writ against Mr. Wong claiming damages for the loss of the Tow.  The writ alleged âbreach of contract on the part of [Mr. Wong]and/or negligent navigation and/or management of [the Tug]â.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In his Defence, Mr. Wong contended that Ms. Chanâs claim was time-barred by reason of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508" class="autolink_findacts">Merchant Shipping (Collision Damage Liability and Salvage) Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508">Cap.508</a>) <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1).</a>  The provision states that, subject to any extension granted by the Court:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âno action shall be maintainable to enforce any claim or lien against a ship or its owners in respect of any damage or loss to anothervessel, its cargo or freight, or any property on board the vessel, or damages for loss of life or personal injuries suffered by anyperson on board the vessel, caused by the fault of the former vessel, whether such vessel is wholly or partly in fault, unless proceedingsin the action are commenced within 2 years from the date when the damage, loss or injury was caused.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Waung J heard the time-bar question as a preliminary issue.  He held that there was no good reason for extending the limitationof two years imposed by the Ordinance and that Ms. Chan was thus out of time in bringing her action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Ms. Chan appealed against Waung Jâs determination.  Mr. Anthony Ismail (appearing on Ms. Chanâs behalf) essentially raised oneground for saying that Waung J was wrong.  The ground was that, on its true construction, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1)</a> only applied to tortious claims.  Mr. Ismail said that, if he is right, Ms. Chanâs claim for breach of contract (arising from allegednegligence in navigation of the Tug) should therefore be allowed to proceed on the basis that the appropriate limitation period was6 years (under the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap. 347</a>)).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The ground advanced by Mr. Ismail was not argued before Waung J.  Ms. Chan did not appeal against Waung Jâs refusal to extendany applicable limitation period in <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1).</a>  After hearing counselâs submissions, we dismissed the appeal with costs, reasons to be handed down in due course.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">II.

On a proper textual analysis, section 7(1) cannot (it is said) encompass a breach of contract.  Mr. Ismail, in particular,focused on 2 expressions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  One expression is the word âfaultâ.  Here Mr. Ismail relied on an obiter dictum of Scott and Asquith LJJ in <i>The TOWERFIELD</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%20P%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] P 10</a> (at 46):-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThat convention was the Collisions Convention, brought into law by the Maritime Conventions Act 1911, and it was primarily art.5 of that convention which called for the alteration of the law as then defined by s.633 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. Theconvention was published by His Majestyâs Government as a White Paper in Cmd. 5558 (1911).  It was made law in the United Kingdomby the Maritime Conventions Act, 1911.  Article 5 read as follows: âThe liability imposed by the preceding articles attaches incases where the collision is caused by the fault of a pilot, even when the pilot is carried by compulsion of law.â  The objectof that convention, signed at a Diplomatic Conference convened by the Belgian Government at Brussels in order to consider a draftconvention previously framed by the ComitÃ© Maritime International was to unify certain rules of the municipal laws of all nationsrelating to collisions between ships, or to damage caused (without collision) by one ship to another ship and her cargo.  It wasconcerned only with what English common law calls âtortâ and English Admiralty law calls âfault,â and what continental law,based on the Code NapolÃ©on, calls by the French word âfauteâ.  That convention had nothing whatsoever to do with contract.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The other expression is found in the words âunless proceedings in the action are commenced within 2 years from the date when thedamage, loss or injury was caused.â  These words (Mr. Ismail submitted) cannot refer to a breach of contract because a cause ofaction for breach of contract arises when a breach is committed.  In contrast, an action in the tort of negligence arises when lossor damage is actually incurred.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  Second, Mr. Ismail invited this Court to construe section 7(1) in light of sections 3(4), 3(5) and 5(2) of the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Section 3 concerns the apportionment of liability for collision damaged caused by âthe fault of 2 or more vesselsâ.  In suchcase, liability for loss is to be assessed âin proportion to the degree in which each vessel was in faultâ. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  But the section provides:-</p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="1">        <tr>            <td width="4%"> </td>            <td width="6%" class="quote" valign="top">â(4)</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote" valign="top">Nothing in this section shall affect the liability of a person under a contract of carriage or any other contract.</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="4%"> </td>            <td width="6%" class="quote" valign="top">(5)</td>            <td width="90%" class="quote" valign="top">Nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing any liability upon a person from which he is exempted by any contract or law,or as affecting the right of a person to limit his liability in the manner provided by law.â</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Section 5 concerns contribution.  Where a collision âowing to the fault of [a] vessel and of any other vesselâ results in lossof life or personal injury and an owner pays more than his proportionate share of damages, then such owner may seek contributionfrom the owners of the other vessels at fault. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  But the section provides:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">â(2)   No amount may be recovered by way of contribution under subsection (1) that could not have been recovered by reason of anystatutory or contractual limitation of, or exemption from, liability, or for any other reason.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr. Ismail observed that the provisos to sections 3 and 5 just mentioned preserve contractual rights and liabilities.  The sectionsare consistent (Mr. Ismail said) with the proposition that section 7(1) does not affect contractual rights.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Third, given its historical background, Mr. Ismail submitted that the Ordinance should be interpreted in the context of the 1910Collision Convention which it brings into effect.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  In particular, referring again to Scott and Asquith LJJ in <i>The</i><i>TOWERFIELD</i>, Mr. Ismail suggested that section 7(1) should be read in light of the premise that the 1910 Collision Convention âhas always beenconcerned with the law of torts and has nothing whatsoever to do with contactâ.  The two year limitation in section 7(1) shouldbe construed (Mr. Ismail said) as only applying to claims in tort and not to claims for breach of contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In support of the contention that the 1910 Collision Convention only applies to tortious claims, Mr. Ismail especially relied onArticle 10 of that Convention.  The wording of Article 10 (Mr. Ismail said) makes it plain that the 1910 Collision Convention (andso any legislation based on it) does not affect a shipownerâs liability in contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">B.      Assessment of Ms. Chanâs case</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  I am not persuaded by Mr. Ismailâs arguments.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  First, the starting point must be a reading of section 7 in the context of the Ordinance itself.  As far as such an exercise isconcerned, it seems to me that the meaning and ambit of section 7(1) is clear.  I find nothing in the section or the Ordinance indicatingthat either is to be construed as applying only to tort and not to contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I do not obtain help from the expressions which Mr. Ismail highlighted within section 7(1).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The word âfaultâ does not by itself normally connote a tortious (as opposed to a contractual) wrong.  In Admiralty law, oneoften refers to the âfaultâ of a vessel without distinguishing whether such âfaultâ constitutes a tort or breach of contract. âFaultâ simply means âblameworthinessâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  In <i>The NORWHALE</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20QB%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 QB 589</a>, for example, Brandon J (at 597C) observed that the expressions âby the fault of two or more vesselâ in section 1(1) and âbythe fault of the former vesselâ in section 8 of the 1911 Act were âentirely general, and are wide enough to include, in theirordinary and natural meaning, not only faults of navigation but other faults as wellâ. Brandon J was rightly concerned not withthe legal classification of a âfaultâ as a breach of contract or tort, but with whether some act or omission could be describedas a âfaultâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The obiter dictum cited by Mr. Ismail from <i>The</i><i>TOWERFIELD</i> is surprising in the way that it unqualifiedly equates âfaultâ in an Admiralty context generally and in the Convention specificallyto tort alone.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  The dictum cannot be right.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Thus, for instance, Article 4 of the Convention gives a right of contribution.  However, the last sentence of Article 4 posits thatthe right to contribution is subject to âthe meaning and effect of any contract ... which limits the liability of the owners ofa vessel towards persons on boardâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  If the dictum were correct, then there would be no need for Article 4 to add the qualification found in its last sentence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  If (as the dictum asserts) the Convention does not concern breaches of contract, it would not be necessary to qualify the rightof contribution in Article 4.  That right would simply not be applicable in a breach of contract case and there would be no needto mention in the Convention that contribution was subject to any contrary agreement in a contract between an owner and passenger.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr. Charles Sussex SC (appearing for Mr. Wong) further noted that s.8 of the 1911 Act (upon which section 7(1) of the Ordinancewas based) provided as follows:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âNo action shall be maintainable to enforce any claim or lien against a vessel or her owners in respect of any damage or loss toanother vessel, her cargo or freight, or any property on board her, or damages for loss of life or personal injuries suffered byany person on board her, caused by the fault of the former vessel, whether such vessel be wholly or partly in fault, or in respectof any salvage services, unless proceedings therein are commenced within two years from the date when the damage or loss or injurywas caused or the salvage services were rendered...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  Section 8 of the 1911 Act must be referring to âany claimâ in contract or tort since salvage services are typically providedpursuant to salvage contracts (such as Lloyds Open Form agreements). </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Any relevant claim (whether or not for salvage) must be in relation to âany damage or loss to another vessel â¦ caused by thefault of [a] vessel, whether such ... be wholly or partly in faultâ.  Since the legal classification of the fault (whether breachof contract or tort) could not be material to a salvage claim, it would be odd if a qualification that the âfaultâ should betortious is to be read into section 8 for claims other than salvage.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  If fault under section 8 of the 1911 Act did not refer only to tortious wrong, it could not suddenly have become so constrainedin section 7(1) of the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  It is true that (in contrast to section 8 of the 1911 Act) section 7(1) of the Ordinance does not contain a reference to salvageclaims.  But that is merely because salvage claims are now governed by the 1989 Salvage Convention, contained in Schedule 1 of theOrdinance.  Otherwise it was not envisaged that section 7(1) would alter the treatment under Hong Kong law of collision cases.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I add that the reasoning of Scott and Asquith LJJ was doubted at House of Lords level in <i>The TOWERFIELD</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1951%5d%20AC%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1951] AC 112</a> (for instance, at 134 (Lord Porter), 145 (Lord Normand) and 155 (Lord Morton)).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  As for Mr. Ismailâs distinction between the accrual of a cause of action in contract and tort, the Legislature (as Mr. Sussexobserved) is entitled to impose whatever limitation it deems appropriate. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  There is nothing odd about this.  The Carriage of Goods by Sea Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/462">Cap.462</a>), for instance, enacts the Hague-Visby Rules. The latter impose by Article III, Rule 6 a one year limitation on actions (whether in contract, tort or bailment) in relation tothe carriage of goods.  The limitation runs from the date when goods are delivered or ought to have been delivered, regardless ofwhen damage or loss is actually caused.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The 1910 Collision Convention imposes its two year limitation from the date of a âcasualtyâ.  Section 7(1) mirrors this by reckoningtime from âthe date when the damage, loss or injury was causedâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Second, I think that Mr. Ismail draws the wrong inference from the provisos in sections 3(4), 3(5) and 5(2).  Those sections expresslyprovide that the rights to apportionment or contribution under the Ordinance are subject to any contrary contractual agreements.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In relation to time-bar, the Ordinance takes a different approach.  It provides in section 7(3) that the two year limit may be extended,but only for good reason.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  Thus, in contrast to sections 3 and 5 where the Ordinance actually provides for contractual arrangements to trump the rights ofapportionment or contribution, the Ordinance deliberately qualifies the possibility of contracts overriding the two year time bar. Whether the two year limit is or is not trumped by a contract, is left to the Courtâs discretion under section 7(3).  Under theOrdinance, the Court may only extend the time bar if the existence of a contract constitutes a good reason for so doing.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Third, assume (without necessarily accepting) that I can look at the 1911 Collision Convention as an aid in the construction ofwhat I believe to be the already clear words of section 7(1).  Even then, Mr. Ismailâs argument finds no support.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  There is nothing in Article 7 to suggest that the âactions for the recovery of damagesâ mentioned in the Article are confinedto tortious actions.  On the contrary, the words are general.  They indicate that all actions for recovery of damages in collisioncases are barred after an interval of two years from a casualty.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  It is true that Articles 3 and 4 refer to liability where vessels are at âfaultâ.  But there is nothing to suggest that theword âfaultâ should be read as meaning only âtortious faultâ.  One can be at âfaultâ by failing to navigate a vesselproperly in breach of a contractual obligation owed (say) to a passenger on the vessel.  Nothing in the text of the Convention indicatesthat one must read âfaultâ in Articles 3 or 4 as somehow excluding such âfaultâ of negligent navigation in breach of contract.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I have already commented on the last sentence of Article 4 and why to my mind, if anything, it militates against Mr. Ismailâssubmissions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Article 10 is of no assistance either.  All Article 10 does is to preserve whatever contractual liabilities or limitations relevantparties may have agreed among themselves.  According to Article 10, any such agreement among relevant parties may override the provisionsof the Convention.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  But then reading the whole of Article 10 into the Ordinance would be of no use to Ms. Chan.  This is because there never was anycontract between Ms. Chan and Mr. Wong to extend the two year time bar in Article 7 of the 1910 Collision Convention or section 7(1)of the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Rather belatedly, Mr Ismail advanced an argument that the present case was caught by Article 10 on the basis that it was an impliedterm of the contract that the parties would be subject to all applicable legislation (notably the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>).  This analysis is incorrect.  Parties to a contract are subject to legislation not by reason of any implied term but by reasonof the natural consequence of applicable legislation: see <i>Secretary for Justice v Lau Kwok Fai</i> [2005] 8 C HKCFAR 304, 323G (para. 43).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In any event, suppose (contrary to what I have concluded above) that Mr. Ismail was right about the wide effect of Article 10. There is still a difficulty.  The fact is that Article 10 was not enacted in the Ordinance to such wide extent.  Article 10 has noprecise equivalent in the Ordinance.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  The 1910 Collision Convention is only part of Hong Kong law to the extent that it is enacted by statute.  Even where the Court construesan Ordinance in light of a Convention, it must be the text of the Ordinance that ultimately governs, not that of the Convention. This is because the Legislature may not have enacted a convention in its entirety.  A statute may modify the terms of a convention. However wide Article 10 may be, the Court can only enforce that part of it which has been brought into effect by the Ordinance.</p>    <p style='text-transform: uppercase;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph' class="heading">IV.     CONCLUSION</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Chanâs action was out of time.  The appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs to Mr. Wong.  TheCourt further directed that Ms. Chanâs costs were to be taxed in accordance with <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/91A" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Aid Regulations</a>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p class="heading"><b>Hon Stone J:-</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  I respectfully agree with the Reasons for Judgment advanced by Reyes J.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  I confess that I struggled to find a point in this appeal which was sustainable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  There is nothing within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508" class="autolink_findacts">Merchant Shipping (Collision Damage Liability and Salvage) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508">Cap 508</a>, to suggest that it has no application to a claim for the consequences to one vessel arising from the faulty navigationof another, even if (as alleged in this case) there existed an oral towage contract between the owners of the two vessels concerned.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The short point, it seems to me, is that in the maritime context canvassed by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1)</a> of this Ordinance the word âfaultâ simply alludes to the causative nature of the act or omission complained of, and whether suchfault is susceptible to legal characterisation as a tortious act and/or as breach of an implied contractual term strikes me as nothingto the point.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Reduced to its essentials, the proposition implicit within Mr Ismailâs argument appeared to be that if a case of maritime faultis expressed (as indeed the Statement of Claim in this case so avers) in terms both of a tortious and a contractual cause of action,then such alternative plea of contractual breach suffices to remove the case from the ambit of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/508/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7(1)</a>, and hence that the two year limitation provision therein is no longer applicable to the claim as thus advanced.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  With respect, I am unable to agree.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In my judgment the submission of Mr Sussex SC that âfault means blameworthinessâ¦[and] is not a term of art synonymous with âtortâin Admiralty lawâ represents a neat and correct statement of the position, and notwithstanding Mr Ismailâs strenuous effortsto convince the court otherwise, I regret to say that in my view his argument did not succeed in getting off the ground.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p align="center" style="text-align:center">(Geoffrey Ma)<br />                Chief Judge,<br />                High Court</p>            </td>            <td width="33%" valign="top">                <p align="center" style="text-align:center">(William Stone)<br />                Judge of the Court of  First Instance,<br />                High Court</p>            </td>            <td width="34%" valign="top">                <p align="center" style="text-align:center">(A T Reyes)<br />                Judge of the Court of  First Instance,<br />                High Court</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Anthony Ismail, instructed by Messrs Ho &amp; Ip, assigned by the Legal Aid Department, for the Plaintiff/Appellant</p>        <p>Mr Charles Sussex SC, instructed by Messrs Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan, for the Defendant/Respondent</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2008/62.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
