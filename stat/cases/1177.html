Thismay well be so but Order 75 r.5 also makes express provisions. The deponent under that rule must depose that in his belief with thegrounds on which his belief is founded that the party who was liable in personam to the Plaintiffs for the loss of the logs at thetime of the loss of the Jelau was the beneficial owner of the Senyiur at the time of the issue of the writ provided that party wasthe owner or charterer or in possession of the Jelau.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> I now turn to the affidavit impugned.

I do not intend to go through the whole affidavit but on the totality of the contents I findit impossible to say that he has not given sufficient grounds for his belief that Kiem Gwan Shipping Co. H.K. Ltd. are liable inpersonam for the reasons given in paragraphs 12 and 13 and that they were the beneficial owners of the Jelau and the Senyiur at relevanttimes alternatively they were the nominees of beneficial owners who were also beneficial owners of the two ships. The affidavit islong and perhaps cumbersome but it was intended to cover wide grounds including four other ships in which the six named persons hadsome connection.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The form of the affidavit is certainly open to criticism for non-compliance with Order 41 r.5(2) in that the sources of informationand belief have in respect of certain hearsay evidence not been disclosed though not to the extent suggested by Mr. Mills-Owens.In a few instances if one were minded to look for them they were there and in a few others where the deponent being a solicitor itis fairly obvious where the sources of the information came from without them being mentioned.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> Mr. Michael Thomas leading counsel for the Plaintiffs put in a supplementary affidavit sworn to by the same deponent setting outthe sources of information. I do not have to decide whether this is possible by reason of the view I take.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> This leaves the burden of proof point. Does the affidavit have to show a prima facie case as contended.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> Mr. Mills-Owens says the vessels are owned by different companies with different shareholders. Only thing common between them arethe directors. This leaves out the Hong Kong company which has the same board. He further says there is no sufficient proper evidencethat the Senyiur is beneficially owned by any person who could be liable in personam for the loss of the logs on the Jelau thereforeno prima facie case has been made out for the issue of the writ to arrest.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> While it is true that there is no direct evidence shown in the affidavit that the Senyiur is beneficially owned by a person who couldbe liable for the loss of the logs, I do not see how this can help the applicants. What they are saying is this "In your applicationfor the warrant you have failed to prove directly what you say I am", whereas what the Plaintiffs have to do is to satisfy the courtfor the warrant to issue is "I for grounds given genuinely believe you are what I say you are." The corporate veil in shipping ispublic knowledge and may I respectfully cite the words of Slynn J. in the "<u>Aventicum</u>"<sup>(1)</sup> at page 187:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have no doubt that on a motion of this kind it is right to investigate the true beneficial ownership. I reject any suggestion thatit is impossible 'to pierce the corporate veil'. I of course remember, as Mr. Howard urges, the case of <u>Saloman</u> v. <u>Saloman &amp; Co</u>.,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%20AC%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] A.C. 22</a>, but of course it is plain that s.3(4) of the Act intends that the Court shall not be limited to a consideration of who is the registeredowner or who is the person having legal ownership of the shares in the ship; the directions are to look at the beneficial ownership.Certainly in a case where there is a suggestion of a trusteeship or a nominee holding, there is no doubt that the Court can investigateit. I think that it may well be, without having to resolve the difference of opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Brandon and Mr. JusticeGoff in the two cases to which I have referred that the Court has the power and should in some cases look even further. The viewI have come to on the evidence before me is such that it is not necessary for me to say any more about that divergence of view."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> The corporate veil is obviously a serious issue in this matter which ought not be dealt with in an application in limine withoutany evidence before the Court other than the affidavit filed in support for the warrant to issue. The applications have the rightto take the objection but I do not think it is one of substance. In my view they are well aware of the case they have to meet andthe matter ought to proceed (see The St. Elefteric  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%20P%20179" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] P 179)</a> in spite of the irregularities contained in the affidavits.

If then the plaintiffs were foundto be wrong in their belief that would be the end of the matter and the plaintiffs would have to pay the costs of a wrongful arrest.If the court were to not to so find then the matter will go to trial and justice will then be done between the parties.

Mutatis mutandis Mr. Thio Tjou Bie swears the same in respect of Samarinda S.A. Panama and the Jelau.</p>    <p align="left">          To the above all I need to add is that all three corporations have the same board and Mrs. Megawati and Mr. Thio are notmembers.</p>    <p align="left">          The defendants' application to strike out the writ is founded on their assertion that the plaintiffs had no right to invokethe jurisdiction of the Court by reason that the identity of the person who would be liable on their claim in personam was not atany time the same person as the beneficial owner of the Senyiur. The defendants have every right to bring the application and theCourt is bound to decide the issue of jurisdiction on the evidence before it. As Goff J. said in The "<u>I Congreso</u>"<sup>(1)</sup> -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It follows as a matter of principle that any question of jurisdiction, such as the question in the present motions, must be dealtwith on the motions, and cannot be dealt with as an issue in the actions. Of course, on the hearing of such a motion, evidence willbe admitted. Usually, that evidence will be in the form of affidavits, though in theory oral evidence, for example by cross-examinationof deponents of affidavits, might be allowed. There has however been no application in the present case for any such oral evidenceto be admitted. On the evidence so admitted, which in the present case is purely affidavit evidence, the question of jurisdictionhas to be decided, and it cannot be right for the decision on that question to be allowed to depend on the decision of some issueto be tried in the actions. If there is no jurisdiction as against Mambisa, they should not be troubled with the actions at all;indeed it cannot be decided whether the actions can be allowed to proceed until the question of jurisdiction has been determined."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">          I deal first with orders for the cross-examination of Mr. Kang Wibisono, Mr. Fong Yuk Lam, Mr. Thio Tjou Bie, Mrs. Megawati.Under Order 38 r.2(3) on any application made by summons evidence may be given by affidavit unless otherwise provided for or theCourt otherwise directs "but the Court may, on the application of any party order the attendance for cross-examination of the personmaking any such affidavit and where, after such an order has been made the person in question does not attend his affidavit shallnot be used as evidence without leave of the Court". The power is discretionary and generally will be exercised where there is conflictin the affidavit evidence and the court has to resolve the issue on such evidence. As Reece J. said in the S.S. "<u>Tasikamlaja</u>."<sup>(2)</sup></p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I am satisfied that there are certain questions of fact to be determined on the motion to set aside the writ before the order soughtcan be granted, and it seems to me undesirable, where there is such evident conflict on the facts alleged, that the Court shouldbe required to draw inferences from the affidavits alone. I have stated earlier in the hearing of this application that as a resultof my experience in these courts I dislike having to rely on affidavit evidence alone and in a matter of such obvious importanceas is now before me I am of the opinion that the veracity of the deponents should be tested by cross-examination. I allow the applicationto cross-examine Mr. Kwee Djee Ho and Major Pamoerahadjo and order that they do attend for that purpose."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">          Here save for the deponent Fong Yuk Lam it is not so much a matter of conflict of evidence as the veracity of the deponents.Firstly have they and each of them told the truth and secondly have they and each of them told the whole story. A court is not boundto accept every fact sworn to in an affidavit as true nor will it reject any such fact lightly or capriciously. In my view whereany such fact is challenged then if the interest of justice and the circumstances of the case so warrant the court will in its discretionallow the veracity of that fact to be tested within the rules. The main issue is the beneficial ownership of the two vessels. Inthe "<u>Merriel</u>"<sup>(3)</sup> Hewson J. defined the beneficial owner under section 3(4) of the act as "the true owner, that is, the only person with a right tosell all the shares." In "<u>The Andrea Ursula</u>"<sup>(4)</sup> Brandon J. differed from the view expressed by Hewson J. and said the term included a demise character. Goff J. in The "<u>I Congreso</u>"<sup>(1)</sup> at 560 refused to allow "<u>The Andrea Ursula</u>" and said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have reconsidered the matter and having done so I have reached the conclusion that the words 'beneficially owned as respect allthe shares therein' refer only to cases of equitable ownership whether or not accompanied by legal ownership and are not wide enoughto include cases of possession and control without ownership however full and complete such possession and control may be".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">Then Slynn J. in The "Aventicum"<sup>(5)</sup> said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"I have no doubt that on a motion of this kind it is right to investigate the true beneficial ownership. I reject any suggestion thatit is impossible 'to pierce the corporate veil'. I of course remember, as Mr. Howard urges, the case of <u>Saloman</u> v. <u>Saloman &amp;</u> <u>Co</u>.,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%20AC%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] A.C. 22</a>, but of course it is plain that s.3(4) of the Act intends that the Court shall not be limited to a consideration of who is the registeredowner or who is the person having legal ownership of the shares in the ship; the directions are to look at the beneficial ownership.Certainly in a case where there is a suggestion of a trusteeship or a nominee holding, there is no doubt that the Court can investigateit. I think that it may well be, without having to resolve the difference of opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Brandon and Mr. JusticeGoff in the two cases to which I have referred that the Court has the power and should in some cases look even further. The viewI have come to on the evidence before me is such that it is not necessary for me to say any more about that divergence of view."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">          The latest comes from the Court of Appeal in Singapore which refused to follow Brandon J. It is the case of The "Permina3001"<sup>(6)</sup> wherein at p.329 the Chief Justice said:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The word 'ownership' connotes title, legal or equitable title whereas the expression 'possession and control' however full and completeis not related to title."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left">I respectfully agree with the opinion expressed by Slynn J.</p>    <p align="left">          On an analysis of the evidence filed on behalf of the defendants one cannot entirely close one's mind to the possibilitythat the timber business referred to by Mr. Kang Wibisono and the shipping required for the servicing of the export of the timbermight be a business wholly owned by a person or persons perhaps a family. Whether it is so or not is in the exclusive knowledge ofthe deponents save perhaps Mr. Fong an employee.</p>    <p align="left">          This is an application in limine in which the plaintiffs may be liable to have their writ set aside. The interest of justiceand the circumstances of the case commend and warrant that the veracity of the deponents be tested. As for two of them being residentswithout the jurisdiction, Indonesia in this age is not so far away. They have allowed their respective ship to be controlled by aHong Kong company and it would appear from the evidence that most of the records are here. No good reason has been advanced why theycannot come. There shall be orders for cross-examination accordingly.</p>    <p align="left">          I now turn to the matter of production of documents. In my view the same principles apply. The defendants say it is a fishingexpedition but there is no suggestion that the plaintiffs will be unable to formula a Statement of Claim before discovery. This applicationis the consequence of the defendants' application to set aside without which discovery would be automatic after the close of pleadings.I am in no doubt in the circumstances of this case the plaintiffs should have their orders but not to the extent sought. There willbe orders in terms of (3) for production and inspection and the taking of copies at the offices of Messrs. Holman, Fenwick &amp;Willan within 42 days from to-day of the documents set out in the schedule limited to paragraphs 1 to 7, (inclusive), 10 and 11 andonly in relation as to vessels "Pangempang", "Jelau", "Senyiur" as to companies Kiem Gwan Shipping Co. H.K. Ltd., Samarinda S.A.Senyiur S.A.</p>    <p align="left">          It is further ordered that within seven days after inspection of the documents, the 1st summons be restored for dates tobe fixed for hearing in consultation with counsel's diaries.</p>    <p align="left">          There will be liberty to apply.</p>    <p align="left">          Costs of the application costs in the cause Certificate for a counsel.</p>    <p align="left"> </p>    <p align="left">Representation:</p>    <p align="left">Michael Thomas Q.C. &amp; W.
