In the present appeals, the competing jurisdictions were Hong Kong and the Ningbo Maritime Court, in the PRC (I will in this judgment,for convenience, use the term âPRCâ to mean the Mainland excluding Hong Kong).  The appeals were heard on 17 October 2008 anddismissed, with reasons to be provided.</p>    <p class="heading">Facts</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On 17 March 2007, the bulk carrier âPENG YANâ (which was on a voyage from Huanghua, PRC to Xiji, PRC) collided with a generalcargo ship âHUI RONGâ (which was on a voyage from Xingang, PRC to Bangkok, Thailand) while in PRC territorial waters.  The locationof the collision was Zhou San Dao, off the coast of Ningbo and Shanghai.  The port of registry of PENG YAN was Shenzhen.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  PENG YAN sustained damage to her bow.  HUI RONG sank with the loss of nine crew members, with another eight missing.  The cargoescarried on board HUI RONG were lost.  Apart from this damage, there was also some oil spill and consequent pollution damage.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Inevitably, actions for the loss of the cargoes on board HUI RONG were commenced.  On 5 Mary 2007, certain cargo interests (representedby Richards Butler) commenced in rem proceedings in Hong Kong (HCAJ 76 of 2007) against the owners and charterers of HUI RONG (thevessel carrying their cargo) and also against the owners of PENG YAN.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  A sister ship of PENG YAN (âPENG WEIâ) was arrested on 12 May 2007 in these proceedings.  On 15 May 2007, the release of thisvessel was procured upon the defendant owners of PENG YAN providing a letter of undertaking in the sum of US$2.5 million to coverâsuch sums as may be finally adjudged by the competent Court or on an appeal therefrom or as may be agreed to be recoverable fromthe above-named colliding ship âPENG YANâ and/or the owners thereof in respect of the said claims, interest and costsâ.  Theletter of undertaking expressly reserved the right of the defendant owners to dispute the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts (thuspaving the way for the application for a stay on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens</i>) but did not expressly reserve the right of the owners to limit their liability, whether by reference to statutory or Conventiontonnage limitation or otherwise.  This latter aspect is relevant as will be discussed below.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The letter of undertaking was supplemented by another letter of undertaking dated 3 April 2008, this time in the sum of US$100,000to cover an additional cargo claim.  This was in the same terms as the original one.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 28 December 2007, a third letter of undertaking was provided in respect of more cargo claims, this time to those claimants representedby Clyde &amp; Co in the sum of US$5 million.  This was effectively on the same terms as the others.  It was provided to preventan arrest of either PENG YAN or a sister ship.  The Writ in respect of the relevant cargo claims was issued on 21 January 2008 (HCAJ12/2008).  This action and HCAJ 76/2007 constitute the present proceedings.  The claims in these actions represent approximately92% of the cargo claims arising from the losses on board HUI RONG.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  For convenience, I shall hereinafter use the terms âPlaintiffsâ to mean the plaintiffs in both actions, âDefendantsâ tomean the defendant owners of PENG YAN and the âLetters of Undertakingâ to refer to the three letters of undertaking referredto above.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In March 2008, other cargo claimants (not the Plaintiffs in the present proceedings) commenced actions in the Ningbo Maritime Court.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  On 30 April 2008, the writs in the present proceedings were served on the Defendants.  The same day, the Defendants commenced alimitation action in the Ningbo Maritime Court to set up a limitation fund (I shall refer to these proceedings in Ningbo as the NingboLimitation Action).  A brief word about these proceedings would be of assistance at this point.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Ningbo Limitation Action was brought pursuant to the Maritime Code of the PRC.  Under Articles 204, 207 and 210, shipownersare able to limit their liability (by reference to tonnage) in relation to any claims for loss or damage to cargoes on board ships. The limitations of liability set out in the Code (including any claims in respect of loss of life or personal injury) apply to theaggregate of all claims that may arise from a single casualty (Article 212).  By reason of Article 213, a shipowner is able to setup a limitation fund to cover the various liabilities from an incident.  The Ningbo Limitation Action was the exercise of rightsby the Defendants pursuant to these Articles of the Maritime Code.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The limits of liability as set out in the Maritime Code mirror, save in one respect, the limitation scheme which would be availableto the Defendants in Hong Kong had a limitation action been commenced here.  Hong Kong is subject to the Convention on Limitationof Liability for Maritime Claims 1976 (see the provisions of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/434" class="autolink_findacts">Merchant Shipping (Limitation of Shipowners Liability) Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/434">Cap. 434</a>).</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The only notable point of difference between the two limitation regimes is that the limitations of liability under the MaritimeCode are halved in the case of a ship not exceeding 300 tons and engaging in coastal services within the PRC (see Article 4 of theProvisions Concerning the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims for Ships With a Gross Tonnage Not exceeding 300 tons and ThoseEngaging in Coastal Transport Services As Well As Those for Other Coastal Operations, as promulgated by the PRC Ministry of Communicationson 15 November 1993).</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  PENG YAN, whose gross tonnage was 34,886 tons, was at the time of the casualty engaged in a voyage between ports in the PRC.  Accordingly,one of the reasons for the Defendants commencing the limitation action in Ningbo was to try to seek the above mentioned additionallimitation in liability.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  On 5 August 2008, the Ningbo Maritime Court decided that the 50% reduction in what otherwise would be the appropriate limitationfund, was inapplicable.  On 7 August 2008, the Defendants filed an appeal against that decision.  The purpose of the appeal was,as we have been told in an affirmation from the Defendantsâ solicitor, simply to buy some time to enable the security ordered bythe Ningbo Maritime Court to be paid (so as to constitute the limitation fund).  The appeal was pursued and eventually dismissedon 25 August 2008.  The requisite security was paid (and therefore the limitation fund set up) on 29 August 2008.  I shall have moreto say about this aspect presently.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The current state of the Ningbo Limitation Action appears to be that there are a total of 29 claimants who have registered claimsagainst the limitation fund.  These claimants comprise cargo interests (including the Plaintiffs) as well as the owners of HUI RONG. Other claims have been brought against PENG YAN in the Ningbo courts, such as the pollution damage claim brought by the ZhejingMaritime Safety Administration, but these claims are not part of the Ningbo Limitation Action since there are no applicable limitationsof liability in relation to such claims.</p>    <p class="heading">The applications to stay the Hong Kong proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  On 11 July 2008, the Defendants issued notices of motion to stay the present proceedings in Hong Kong on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  The Defendants also sought orders that the Letters of Undertaking should be returned for cancellation.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Reyes J, the Admiralty Judge, heard the motions on 25 August 2008 and delivered a reasoned judgment the same day dismissing theapplications for a stay.  His reasoning was as follows (I have added some comments of my own) : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class='quote'>(1)  Although the prima facie natural forum for the trial of the action were the courts of the PRC (this being where the alleged negligenceof PENG YAN occurred : see <i>The Albaforth</i> [1984] 2 Lloydâs Rep 91), this was merely a starting point for the consideration of the question of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  The main question for the court was the application of the basic test formulated in <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20AC%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 AC 460</a>, at 476C-D, 477E-F; and in <i>The Adhiguna Meranti</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20HKLR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] HKLR 904</a>, at 907F-908B.</p>        <p class='quote'>(2)  Looking then to the trial of the action to see whether it could be shown by the Defendants that the Ningbo Maritime Court wasâclearly or distinctlyâ more appropriate a forum than the Hong Kong courts, the learned judge then considered a number of factorsin this regard.</p>        <p class='quote'>(3)  First, he did not regard the fact that PENG YAN was registered in the PRC and that her owners were PRC based, carried much weight. In an Admiralty context, it is commonplace for claims (and in particular, cargo claims) to be litigated in jurisdictions other thanthe âhomeâ of either the ship in question or her owners.  Where ships and sister ships ply their trade worldwide, this is inevitableand in my view, will generally carry little or no weight in the consideration of <i>forum non conveniens</i> issues.</p>        <p class='quote'>(4)  Secondly, the learned judge then looked at the fact of the PRC nationality of the crew of both PENG YAN and HUI RONG.  Again,this was not considered a matter of sufficient weight.  He pointed out, correctly with respect, that by the very nature of theiroccupation, crew members were often away from home and that therefore having to attend trial at a foreign jurisdiction would notbe unduly inconvenient.  In any event, the crew came from different parts of the PRC and travelling to Ningbo was really no moreconvenient for a person from, say, Shandong (like the Third Officer of PENG YAN) than coming to Hong Kong.</p>        <p class='quote'>(5)  Thirdly, it was far from clear in any event what relevant testimony would come from crew members.  The main evidence going tothe issue of the respective fault of both ships would come from the reports of the incident compiled by the Hong Kong Marine Departmentand the Shenzhen Maritime Safety Administration.  There was no evidence why the authors of these reports would find any difficultyin attending a trial in Hong Kong.</p>        <p class='quote'>(6)  Fourthly, the Defendants referred to the existence of proceedings which had actually been commenced and pursued in the NingboMaritime Court.  This was the Ningbo Limitation Action to which reference has already been made.  The Defendants emphasized the pointthat the issue of the respective fault of the two ships (this involving of course the crucial issue of PENG YANâs liability) wouldbe decided in the Ningbo Limitation Action.  The shares to which the various cargo interests might be entitled in the limitationfund set up in the Ningbo Limitation Action would also be apportioned in that action.  It is clear, however, that at the time thehearing took place before Reyes J, the Plaintiffs had not yet become parties to the Ningbo Limitation Action.  The position changedby the time the present appeal was heard.  The learned judge was not persuaded that there would be any substantial saving of timeor costs if the dispute in the present action were also litigated in the Ningbo Maritime Court.  He observed that the possibilityof avoiding multiple actions was a distant one, given it was unlikely that the Ningbo courts would consolidate all the claims thatarose from the collision (he referred specifically to the pollution claims and the cargo claims).  The Judge further observed therewas nothing unusual about a limitation action taking place in a different forum to the one in which the question of liability wasbeing determined.  Before us, the Defendantsâ arguments changed somewhat by reason of the Plaintiffs having at that stage joinedin the Ningbo Limitation Action.</p>        <p class='quote'>(7)  Fifthly, the Judge was of the view it was a relevant factor that the applicable limits of liability were potentially differentas between Hong Kong and the Ningbo Maritime Court.  At the time Reyes J heard the motions, there was still in existence the Defendantsâappeal against the order of the Ningbo Maritime Court that the limitation fund should not be reduced by 50% as the Defendants hadoriginally sought (see paragraphs 13 to 15 above).  Although the affirmation evidence before the court was to the effect that theappeal was simply to buy more time to enable the full fund to be established and that once the Defendants were put in funds, theappeal would be abandoned, it remained starkly the fact that the appeal was not abandoned at the time of the hearing below.  Indeed,it never was abandoned and the appeal was in fact proceeded with.  The Defendants had offered to give an undertaking that once theywere in funds, the appeal would be withdrawn.  The judge was not impressed by this : he was of the view that it fell short of a guaranteethat the requisite security would actually be provided.  He concluded on this aspect in favour of the Plaintiffs, albeit in his ownwords only âmarginallyâ.</p>        <p class='quote'>(8)  Although the Judge concluded it had not been shown by the Defendants that there was a forum clearly or distinctly more appropriatethan Hong Kong, he nevertheless considered the submissions made by the Plaintiffs based on loss of personal or juridical advantagesshould the Hong Kong proceedings be stayed.  Though unnecessary to decide, he nevertheless dealt with these points but was not persuadedthat there would be any loss of such advantages.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">The issues on appeal</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In this appeal, the Defendants challenged the Judgeâs decision in three respects : -</p>    <blockquote>        <p class='quote'>(1)  There was a failure to take fully into account the importance of the fact that the natural forum for the adjudication of thedispute between the parties were the courts of the PRC (and specifically the Ningbo Maritime Court), the PRC being where the allegedtort took place.  In other words, the Judge had failed to apply <i>The Albaforth</i> principle referred to in paragraph 18(1) above.</p>        <p class='quote'>(2)  The learned judge failed to consider the factor based on multiplicity of proceedings (see paragraph 18(6) above).  I have indicatedearlier that the Defendantsâ arguments here changed on appeal.  In the Court below, the argument proceeded merely on the basisthat the dispute between the parties in the Hong Kong proceedings ought to be litigated in the Ningbo Maritime Court as that wasclearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum (there being at the time of the hearing below no existing proceedings between theparties there).  By the time the appeal was heard, the Plaintiffs had joined as parties to the Ningbo Limitation Action.  The argumentbefore us therefore proceeded on the basis that there should be a stay on the ground that there were concurrent proceedings in thePRC and that a stay was needed to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings over the same subject matter.  This was really an argumentbased on <i>lis alibi pendens</i>.</p>        <p class='quote'>(3)  The Judge was wrong in his view that the limitation amounts in the Ningbo Limitation Action differed from what otherwise wouldbe the position in Hong Kong.  Here, the Defendants contended that the Judge did not take fully into account the undertaking thathad been offered to the court to the effect that once the Defendants were put in funds by their insurers, the appeal from the decisionof the Ningbo Maritime Court refusing the 50% reduction in the limitation amount (see paragraph 15 above), would be withdrawn.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  I will presently deal with these issues in turn.  All relate principally to the aspect of whether the Ningbo Maritime Court wasclearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum.  The issues raised in the Court below by the Plaintiffs in respect of the assertedloss of personal or juridical advantages, were not pursued on appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">The approach to applications for stay based on forum non conveniens in admiralty proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Before dealing with the three issues identified above, I would reiterate that the basic approach of the court in determining applicationsfor stay based on <i>forum non conveniens</i> in admiralty proceedings is the same as in any other action, that is, the application of the principles enunciated in <i>Spiliada</i> and <i>Adhiguna Meranti</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The basic approach is well known : where jurisdiction in Hong Kong has been founded as of right, a stay will only be granted whereit is shown that there is another forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate.  Only if this has been shown will questionsof the deprivation of personal or juridical advantages and any consequential balancing exercise, arise.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In admiralty proceedings, the founding of jurisdiction as of right usually arises upon an arrest of the ship in question or a sistership.  The court has on numerous occasions emphasised this unique feature of the admiralty jurisdiction : see for example, <i>The</i> <i>Convenience Container</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%202%20HKLRD%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 2 HKLRD 575.</a>  In <i>The Kapitan Shvetsov</i> [1998] 1 Lloydâs Rep 199, this court alluded to the importance of the jurisdiction of the admiralty court having been founded asof right in this way.  The foundation of the courtâs jurisdiction to arrest is of course the provision of security for varioustypes of maritime claims and it is this facet that gives the admiralty jurisdiction its uniqueness.  Where jurisdiction is foundedby an arrest, then, notwithstanding that there may be little or no connection with Hong Kong other than the fact of arrest, the burdenon the party applying for a stay based on <i>forum non conveniens</i> is still to demonstrate that there is another jurisdiction that is clearly or distinctly more appropriate.  The legal burden is noton the party suing in Hong Kong to demonstrate the appropriateness of continuing proceedings here.  Further, as cases like <i>The Kapitan Shvetsov</i> (at 217(2)) and <i>The</i> <i>Caspian Basin</i> [1997] 2 Lloydâs Rep 507 (at 525(2)) show, the existence of parallel proceedings in admiralty matters is by no means unusual, norshould the mere existence of such by itself incline a court towards staying an action on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i> (as to this latter point, see <i>The</i> <i>Abidin Daver</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20AC%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] AC 398</a>, at 423F-H).</p>    <p class="heading">The Albaforth principle</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In <i>The</i> <i>Albaforth</i>, it was said at 96(2) in the judgment of Robert Goff LJ, that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIf the substance of an alleged tort is committed within a certain jurisdiction, it is not easy to imagine what other facts coulddisplace the conclusion that the Courts of that jurisdiction are the natural forumâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  No doubt this is correct as far as it goes.  However, as confirmed by this court in <i>Esquel Enterprises v Tal Apparel Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%202%20HKC%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 2 HKC 384</a>, this is but a starting point.  The basic principle or test is that stated by Lord Goff of Chieveley and Hunter JA in <i>Spiliada</i> and <i>Adhiguna Meranti</i> (see paragraph 22 above).  The decision of <i>The</i> <i>Albaforth</i>, of course, predated <i>Spiliada</i>.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  I believe the underlying reason for <i>The</i> <i>Albaforth</i> principle is that, often in tortious claims, there are one or more elements that have a real connection with the place of the commissionof the alleged tort.  Thus, for example, where the extent of loss and damage (a requisite element to be proved in all tortious claims)in a particular location is an important issue, the place of the tort must be an important factor in determining the appropriatenessof any given forum.  <i>Distillers Co. (Biochemicals) Ltd. v Laura Ann Thompson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20458" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 458</a>, an authority referred in <i>The</i> <i>Albaforth,</i> was a case involving the use of Thalidomide in Australia.  Delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Pearson said at 468D:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe defendant has no major grievance if he is sued in the country where most of the ingredients of the cause of action againsthim took placeâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The factual issues in that case involved the warnings that had been given by the manufacturers of the drug in New South Wales andthe extent of the use of Thalidomide there.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Other examples where the location of the tort is important from the point of view of the trial of the action include misrepresentationclaims where the alleged misrepresentation is acted upon in a particular country : see <i>The</i> <i>Albaforth</i> itself; <i>Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20QB%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] QB 333.</a></p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It is therefore important when applying <i>The</i> <i>Albaforth</i> principle in the context of <i>forum non conveniens</i> applications, to examine just how close a connection there really exists with any given forum.  In some cases, the place of the commissionof the tort may be decisive; in others, perhaps not weighty at all.  The underlying principle to be firmly borne in mind is the basictest in <i>Spiliada</i> and <i>Adhiguna Meranti</i>.  The place of the commission of the tort may in some cases be quite fortuitous and may provide no more than a convenient startingpoint or prima facie position.  The court is required to look into more substantial factors in the application of the basic test. The present case involved a collision where, quite often, there is no obvious or natural forum : see <i>Spiliada</i>  at 477C-D.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  In my view, the approach of the Judge cannot really be faulted.</p>    <p class="heading">Multiplicity of proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  This became the main focus of the appeal.  I have already mentioned above how the argument as presented to us by the Defendants,differed from that before the judge below.  Put simply, the Defendantsâ submissions can be distilled into the following.  The issuesof the liability of PENG YAN, of the fault to be attributed to that ship and HUI RONG, and of the quantum of the Plaintiffsâ claims(these being issues raised for determination in the Hong Kong proceedings) are all to be decided in the Ningbo Limitation Action. The amount of security available to the Plaintiffs in the Ningbo Limitation Action is now no different from the security that isavailable in Hong Kong.  Following the unsuccessful appeal in the PRC, the applicable limits of liability under the Maritime Codeof the PRC are now the same as those that would be applied in Hong Kong under the 1976 Convention (see paragraph 15 above).</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  There is a certain attraction in the simplicity of the Defendantsâ submissions, but upon closer analysis, it amounts to sayingno more than, at its highest, there exist parallel proceedings in Hong Kong and in the Ningbo Maritime Court.  As stated above, thisis by no means unusual in admiralty matters and specifically within this rubric, limitation actions (see paragraph 23 above).  Itmay have been of some relevance had it been shown that the Ningbo Limitation Action was near conclusion but this was not the case. Rather, the impression I gained at the hearing was that the Ningbo Limitation Action was not at an advanced stage.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  I have of course not lost sight of the argument that there may be a risk of inconsistent findings were the Hong Kong courts andthe Ningbo Maritime Court to adjudicate on those issues common to both proceedings.  I have already identified some of these issues. This factor was not before the Judge below since it will be recalled that the Plaintiffs were not at that time parties to the NingboLimitation Action.  The latest affirmation from the Defendants, however, indicated that they now are.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Nevertheless, it seems clear that the reason for the Plaintiffs joining in the Ningbo Limitation Action was really only as a protectivemeasure in case a stay was granted in Hong Kong.  From the affirmation evidence filed on behalf of the Plaintiffs, their primarystance was not to litigate in the Ningbo Maritime Court.  Without a stay, I daresay the Plaintiffs would most likely withdraw ormodify their participation in the action there.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The risk of inconsistent findings is, therefore, in my judgment, more apparent than real.  One is accordingly left in more or lessthe same position as the Judge below in having to determine whether a trial in the Ningbo Maritime Court would, compared with a trialin Hong Kong, be clearly or distinctly more convenient.  Here, the careful analysis undertaken by the Judge directed at what waslikely to occur at trial (which analysis was not really challenged on appeal) clearly justified his conclusion it could not be shownthat the Ningbo Maritime Court was clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum for the trial of the disputes.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In his judgment, the Judge remarked that nothing prevented the owners from pleading limitation in the Hong Kong action and arguingthat, in the determination of liability, the court should for some reason recognize any limitation decree by the Ningbo MaritimeCourt (see paragraph 35 of the Judgment).  The Judge, however, also mentioned in his judgment the possible difficulties that mayarise in the recognition by the Hong Kong courts of a PRC limitation decree.  There may or may not be such difficulties, but at thepresent stage, it cannot be said that insuperable difficulties would be caused by the existence of contemporaneous proceedings inthe Ningbo Maritime Court and in Hong Kong.  Certainly, it cannot be said that this aspect was sufficiently strong to justify a stay.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  I have so far proceeded on the assumption that the Hong Kong proceedings and the Ningbo Limitation Action are indeed parallel proceedings. Strictly speaking, however, they are not and there are important differences.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  First, the security for the Hong Kong proceedings comes in the form of the Letters of Undertaking (this is of course not the positionin the Ningbo Limitation Action where a limitation fund has been established).  I have earlier noted the fact that they do not containany express reservation of the Defendantsâ right to limit liability by reference to the 1976 Convention (or indeed any other applicablelimitation).  The only reservation was to challenge the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  It is the Plaintiffsâ position that whatever limitation may be applicable in the Ningbo Limitation Action under the PRC MaritimeCode, this would be inapplicable as far as the Hong Kong proceedings are concerned.  They contend that on the true construction ofthe Letters of Undertaking, the Defendants have unconditionally undertaken to secure any damages ordered to be paid up to the limitsset out in them.  This was the price that was exacted to enable the arrested ship to be released or to prevent further arrest.  TheDefendants of course contend otherwise.  Mr Clifford Smith SC (for the Defendants) submitted forcefully that the Plaintiffsâ positionwas untenable.  He submitted it was unnecessary to set out in a letter of undertaking the full extent of any defence that would reduceor eliminate what otherwise might be the liability of the Defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  Mr Russell Coleman SC (for the Plaintiffs) pointed out, on the other hand, that the omission to refer to tonnage limitation in theLetters of Undertaking in the present case reflected the position in cases like <i>The</i> <i>ICL Vikraman</i> [2004] 1 Lloydâs Rep 21, at 25(2) (paragraph 8).  It was at least arguable that tonnage limitation would not avail the Defendantsin the Hong Kong actions.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Mr Smith may or may not be right, but this is an issue which the court is unable at this stage to determine (indeed we were notexpressly invited to do so).  Ultimately, this aspect was one which, in my view, strongly militated against a stay being granted. Put simply, the Plaintiffs would be secured in the Ningbo Limitation Action only to the extent of the limitation fund establishedthere.  In Hong Kong, they could be secured in respect of a considerably larger amount.  The existence of security for a claim isa relevant factor in the consideration of stay applications based on <i>forum non conveniens</i><i> </i>: see <i>Spiliada</i> at 483D.  As mentioned earlier, one of the orders sought by the Defendants in the application for stay was the cancellation of theLetters of Undertaking.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The second difference is that in HCAJ 76/2007, the Plaintiffs claim against, in addition to the Defendants, the owners and charterersof HUI RONG, with whom the Plaintiffsâ cargo interests had contractual relations.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  Lastly, it is worth a reminder that the Ningbo Limitation Action was commenced the very day that the writs in the present proceedingswere served.  While it is to be acknowledged that the owners of PENG YAN were free to commence a limitation action wherever theychose (see <i>The Volvox Hollandia</i> [1988] 2 Lloydâs Rep 361), this cannot be given undue weight by itself.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In my judgment, this ground of appeal similarly fails.</p>    <p class="heading">The undertaking issue</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  The Defendants contended the Judge fell into error in failing to take sufficient account of the undertaking offered by the Defendantsto withdraw the appeal against the decision of the Ningbo Maritime Court not to apply the 50% reduction in liability under the MaritimeCode (see paragraph 18(7) above), once funds were available.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  This point can be disposed of shortly.  At the hearing below, the position was that the said appeal from the decision of the NingboMaritime Court was still in existence and had not been withdrawn.  Accordingly, there obviously remained the possibility that thelimitation fund in the Ningbo Limitation Action would only be 50% of the applicable limitation in Hong Kong (assuming tonnage limitationwas applicable in the first place).  In the affirmation placed before us for the purposes of the appeal, it was revealed that infact, on the same day as the hearing below (that is, 25 August 2008), a series of coincidences occurred : (1) the motions for staywere dismissed, (2) the funds necessary to constitute the full limitation fund in Ningbo did however materialize that day and (3)the decision of the Ningbo Maritime Court was upheld on appeal by the Zhejiang Higher Peopleâs Court.  It is not clear the orderin which these three events occurred except it appears that the fact the Defendants were put in funds was only known to the Defendantsâsolicitors after Reyes J had already given his decision to dismiss.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  In spite of these matters revealed in the new affirmation, the Judge was entirely correct, in my view, in his analysis.  It wasfar from clear that there would definitely be in existence 100% limitation fund in the Ningbo Limitation Action.  The latest affirmationreinforces this conclusion.  The appeal was in fact at no stage withdrawn (not even an adjournment appears to have been sought). Indeed, it was proceeded with and a decision of the Zhejiang Higher Peopleâs Court was given.  One must ask rhetorically here: if the appeal had gone in favour of the Defendants, would they still have constituted the fund to the extent of 100%?</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  This ground also falls away.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  For the foregoing reasons, the appeals were dismissed.  I would also make an order nisi that the costs of the appeals be to thePlaintiffs to be paid by the Defendants, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon A Cheung J :</b></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  I agree.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Ma CJHC :</b></p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The appeals having earlier been dismissed, we now make an order nisi that the costs of the appeals be to the Plaintiffs to be paidby the Defendants, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width='100%' border='0' style='border-collapse: collapse' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0'>        <tr>            <td width='50%' style='text-align:center'>(Geoffrey Ma)</td>            <td width='50%' style='text-align:center'>(Andrew Cheung)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width='50%' style='text-align:center'>Chief Judge, High Court</td>            <td width='50%' style='text-align:center'>Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p><u>CACV 269/2008</u></p>        <p>Mr Russell Coleman, SC, instructed by Messrs Clyde &amp; Co for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Clifford Smith, SC &amp; Mr Nigel Kat, instructed by Messrs Holman Fenwick Willan for the Defendants</p>        <p><u>CACV 270/2008</u></p>        <p>Mr Russell Coleman, SC, instructed by Messrs Richards Butler for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p>Mr Clifford Smith, SC &amp; Mr Nigel Kat, instructed by Messrs Holman Fenwick Willan for the 3rd Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2008/505.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
