For reasonswhich will be apparent from this judgment, the issues raised are interrelated, albeit it is probably fair to say that such interrelationshipbegan to be more fully appreciated, certainly as far as the Court was concerned, as the adjourned argument progressed. For the purposesof introduction, however, I set out below the applications in chronological order :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) <em>Summons dated 26th January 1998</em> whereby the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs sought, <em>inter alia</em>, to be deleted as Plaintiffs and to be added as Defendants to this action, together with consequential procedural directions. Forpurposes of immediate reference, I shall call this "the reconstitution summons";</p>        <p>(2) <em>Summons dated 21st May 1998</em> whereby the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs sought an Order that Messrs Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan do cease to act for the 1st, 2ndand 3rd Plaintiffs herein, and an Order that such firm do refrain from releasing to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs confidentialcommunications passing between themselves and the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs and the People's Insurance Company of China ("PICC").In this application, the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs also seek an Order for indemnity costs against Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willanpersonally.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>This I shall refer to as the "injunction summons";</p>        <p>(3) <em>Summons dated 17th November 1998</em> wherein the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs seek an Order for leave to amend their pleadings in the alternative forms annexed to thesummons, the relevant form dependent upon such direction as is made upon the reconstitution summons.</p>        <p>This I shall call "the amendment summons".</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">THE BACKGROUND</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> These applications have generated a good deal of heat. They have also generated an inordinate amount of paper. Perhaps in part thisis because what was no more than a slightly unusual cargo claim has been permitted to descend into a bizarre and somewhat bad-temperedprocedural muddle. Neither the current state of this action, nor the argument upon the trio of applications now for decision, canbegin to be understood without brief reference to the factual background.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> This action (which in the procedural melÃ©e has been all but forgotten) first saw the light of day in 1989 in HCA No.A3575, and arisesout of a fire in a cargo of 2,000 metric tonnes of bagged anti-oxidant treated Peruvian fishmeal carried on a vessel named the 'Hobbit'from Huacho, Peru to Far Eastern ports in or about June 1988. It is therefore clear that the case itself is hopelessly stale.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Be that as it may. The make-up of the six Plaintiffs in the action as originally constituted is a little complex, owing to the particularsale contract arrangements which had been entered into with regard to this particular cargo of fishmeal. Suffice to say that thecargo in question was part of a consignment of 5,000 metric tonnes originally sold by the 3rd Plaintiff, General Feeds Inc., to Taiwanesebuyers. However, this sale did not go through, and General Feeds Inc. took back the cargo, applying it instead to pre-existing salecontracts with the 2nd Plaintiff herein, Luckmate Investment Ltd. In turn, Luckmate applied the entire cargo to contracts with the4th Plaintiff, Quan Wa Cheong, for delivery at Huangpu, China, and Quan Wa Cheong then on-sold the cargo to the 5th and 6th Plaintiffs.Accordingly, the claim as originally brought was by all six of the Plaintiffs against the Defendant owners of the 'Hobbit', EurcoElf Co. Ltd., and was for the sum of US$373,601.52 in respect of cargo damage due to the fire, and associated survey expenses.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> Given this broad sequence of events, Mr Sussex was probably correct when he suggested that this particular claim was not in conventionalcargo claim form, and that in this instance there were additional complications regarding, for example, possible problems in termsof title to sue. Which brings us back to the constitution of this particular action, and the discrete disputes with which the Courtis presently concerned.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> It is, I think, entirely common ground that the PICC, a mainland Chinese underwriter, has exercised insurer's rights of subrogation,albeit not with regard to the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs, Luckmate and General Feeds, who were C &amp; F sellers and as far as I am awarehad no insurance. What appears to have happened is that at the time that PICC and the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs came into the pictureand instructed Messrs Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan with regard to the 'Hobbit', the latter firm were already acting for Luckmateand General Feeds, who themselves were concerned about the events on board the 'Hobbit' in respect of loss and damage to the cargo.Accordingly the writ in this action, as settled by Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan, named all six Plaintiffs, and it appears that PICCeither approved or (at the least) raised no objection to this course, although I note that in evidence filed on its behalf PICC maintainsthat it has only ever instructed Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan on behalf of the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In any event, I am told by Mr Sussex that his lay clients, initially the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs, never had any desire to pursuethe cargo recovery claim in their own right, and had agreed to co-operate with PICC and to lend their names to this action <em>solely</em> in order to ensure that no problems would be encountered in terms of title to sue. Mr Sussex further submitted that it had been agreed,expressly or by necessarily implication, that in the circumstances PICC in turn would indemnify these three Plaintiffs in respectof their costs.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> What appears to have happened, however, is that relations between PICC and Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan began to deteriorate. Theallegations levelled each against the other are various. Whether such deterioration was primarily because PICC had become disillusionedwith the way the case was being handled, or with the advice it was receiving, or whether relations were souring because of non-paymentby PICC of costs incurred, are not matters which are presently required for decision. Suffice to say that in July 1997 PICC withdrewinstructions from Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan to act on behalf of the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs, and instructed as solicitorsin their place Messrs Hill Taylor Dickinson, which firm on 28th August 1997 succeeded in filing at the Registry a Notice of Changeof Solicitors acting on behalf of the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It is not clear why the new solicitors thought that this was appropriate procedure, given that Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan clearlyremained on the record for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs, but there it is. Perhaps more surprising in the circumstances was thatthe Registry saw fit to accept such Notice, the effect of which was to bring about the curious situation wherein two different firmsof solicitors are on record as acting for what amounts to two tranches of Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> Whilst these matters were occurring, there were other developments in the action itself, most significant, perhaps, being an applicationby Messrs Ince &amp; Co., the Defendant shipowners' former solicitors, to come off the record on behalf of their client, an Orderto this effect being made on 1st May 1998. This in turn stimulated interest in the case on behalf of the Defendant owners' P &amp;I Club, the North of England Protection and Indemnity Association Limited, represented by Clyde &amp; Co., whose application to intervenein this action was granted on 4th September 1998. Although the Defendant, a Maltese company, appears to be no longer interested inthis case, or indeed in pursuing the Counterclaim filed on its behalf (there is evidence before the Court that the Defendant wasdissolved under Maltese law on 31st August 1989, that it has since been in a process akin to liquidation, and that in all probabilitythe 'Hobbit' has now been scrapped), nevertheless I am told that there is in place a Club Letter of Undertaking which was issuedas the result of the events the subject of this action; hence the Club's present interest in participating in this action in orderto protect its interests.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The only other matters of background worthy of note are first, that Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan no longer act for the 1st Plaintiff,a Peruvian company, having obtained an Order permitting that firm to come off the record on 27th August 1998, and second, that the4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs are now formally represented by Messrs Dibb Lupton Alsop and not Messrs Hill, Taylor Dickinson, a Noticeof Change of Solicitors in this regard having been filed on 15th October 1998.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> With this short introduction, I now turn to the three particular applications presently before the Court for decision.</p>    <p class="heading">(1) The reconstitution summons dated 26 January 1998</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Despite the widespread disagreements that this case has engendered, one area at least which attracts no dissent is the clear necessityto unravel the existing procedural muddle, and to enable the action itself to proceed in proper form.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It is trite law that co-plaintiffs must be represented by the same solicitors and counsel : see <em>Supreme Court Practice 1999</em>, Volume 1, MN62/B/127; <strong>Lewis v. Daily Telegraph Ltd.</strong> (No.2),  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%202%20QB%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 2 QB 601.</a></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Logically it makes good sense in the circumstances, as Mr Barlow suggested, for the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs to remain as Plaintiffsand for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs to become Defendants. Other considerations apart, the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs have madeit plain that they remain interested in pursuing their cargo claim against the Defendant, presumably because the Letter of Undertakingwhich is in place offers some prospect of recovery where otherwise there would be none, given the present status of the Defendant.In addition, however, leave is now sought to amend the pleadings to permit the 4th Plaintiff also to commence proceedings <em>against</em> its former co-plaintiffs, the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs, in terms of the draft pleading annexed to the amendment summons; once again,therefore, in these circumstances it would be logical for them to remain <em>dominus litis</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> To a reconstitution in this manner Mr Sussex had no objection in principle. He candidly told the Court that his lay clients (who,since the commencement of these interlocutory debate, have been reduced to two, namely, the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs) had and haveno interest in pursuing a case against Defendant owners, to which they initially permitted themselves to be added as nominal Plaintiffsonly. The situation now, as Mr Sussex so described it, is that his clients seek "peace with honour", and that as soon as was possibleconsistent with the protection of their interests they intended to drop out of the picture completely.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> However, Mr Sussex sought to impose terms upon such a reconstitution; first, he wished to avoid his clients in any way being rendered"sitting ducks" and to preclude any claim being brought against the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs in their new capacity (an issue consideredlater in this judgment), and second, with regard to costs.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> In this latter regard, he submitted that any reconstitution order, whereby his clients are now to be Defendants, should be made <em>only</em> upon the basis that the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs do provide security for his clients' costs. He put the argument thus. There isno doubt, he said, whether as a matter of express agreement to be gleaned from the earlier correspondence between PICC and Holman,Fenwick &amp; Willan, or at any rate by a process of necessary implication consequent upon PICC exercising rights of subrogation,that PICC must be responsible for the costs of his clients, who for all practical purposes are in the circumstances nominal Plaintiffsonly. Instead, what had happened in this action is that PICC "decamped" with the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs to Hill Taylor Dickinson,leaving the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs in the lurch and unprotected. Accordingly, the "substantial justice" of the situation, arguedMr Sussex, would undoubtedly be met if, upon the necessary revamping of the instant proceedings, the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffswere now to provide the security for the undoubted costs liability hitherto rejected by PICC.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> I reject this contention, persuasively though it was advanced, and I decline to exercise what Mr Sussex was constrained to call "ahands-on approach to the injustice of the case", based upon PICC "repudiating its responsibility" to bear the costs of the 1st, 2ndand 3rd Plaintiffs. Even if I had jurisdiction so to do (and I am inclined to think that I have, despite Mr Barlow's argument tothe contrary) in the exercise of my discretion I decline to encumber what should be a straightforward reconstitution issue with whatare evidently hotly-disputed costs considerations. In this context, I note that in his skeleton argument Mr Sussex confined his submissionsto the provision of security against contingent liability for the Defendant shipowner's costs (at the end of August 1997 estimatedto be in the region of US$115,000), although in affidavit evidence filed by Mr Dunlop of Holman, Fenwick and Willan, security forcosts is sought not only in such contingent terms in the event that the claim pursued against the Defendant shipowners proves unsuccessful,but also in terms of "the First to Third Plaintiffs' own costs liability incurred as Plaintiffs to this firm as their solicitors(no part of which has been paid by PICC to date) ...".</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> It has been starkly apparent throughout the hearings of these applications that the question of unpaid costs is a significant pointof dissension between PICC and Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan, and I do not overlook the fact that such costs are the subject of separateproceedings issued (but not, I think, yet served) by Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan in HCA No.A1441 of 1998 against PICC and all sixof the Plaintiffs in the present action, whilst the costs issue again rears its head in this action by means of a fourth summonsdated 1st April 1998 issued on behalf of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs, whereby Orders are sought for the joinder of PICC as 2ndDefendant herein and for service upon PICC out of the jurisdiction, the point of such joinder being the pursuit of PICC for costs.This fourth summons presently stands adjourned <em>sine die</em> with liberty to restore, and I assume that the intention is that it will be so restored once it is ascertained whether the Courthas been minded to impose the terms as to costs now sought upon this reconstitution summons.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> However, as already indicated, I am not minded to impose such terms, nor to permit what is no more than a logical (albeit forced)procedural adjustment to be fettered with what is likely to be a highly contentious collateral issue. In effecting such necessaryadjustment to the parties in this action, and in naming the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs as Defendants, it seems to me that theseparties are in no worse position than they currently are, whilst the action itself is effectively removed from its current paralysisand once again is able to proceed. In my judgment, any costs question should be confronted and considered directly, and ought notto be resolved by what amounts to a side-wind, via the imposition of terms; indeed, in my view Mr Barlow was near the mark when hesuggested that there was "no justification on a reconstitution summons to invite the Court to address the whole history of the marriage".</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> It follows from the foregoing, therefore, that my Order on the reconstitution summons is that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs areto be deleted as Plaintiffs from the writ of summons herein and that henceforth they be added as the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendantsrespectively. In due course I will hear Counsel on the precise form of this Order.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> I now turn to consider the considerably more vexed issue of amendment.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) The amendment summons dated 17th November 1998</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> This application for leave to amend is chronologically the last in the sequence of summonses, and is framed in the alternative whereinthere are exhibited to the relevant summons alternative drafts, the applicability of each depending upon the decision of the Courtin the reconstitution summons. That decision now having been made, it follows that the precise application for consideration is whetherthe 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs, whom I have ordered shall remain as Plaintiffs in this action, should be granted leave to amendtheir pleading in terms of the draft Amended Points of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> It is common ground, and the starting point for this particular argument, that the causes of action now sought to be pursued by the4th Plaintiff against the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs are time-barred, and it was with this particularly in mind that Mr Sussex was disinclinedto accept a situation whereby his clients, if recast as Defendants, thus became susceptible to prosecution of an otherwise time-barredaction. In the course of argument in opposition to the proposed amendments, he drew the Court's attention to the provisions and effectof <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 35</a> of the <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a></em>, in particular <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 35(2)</a>, (3), (5) and (6), and to the provisions of Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6</a>, in particular Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6(6)</a>, in support of his submission that such amendments did <em>not</em> fall within the terms of these provisions and accordingly should not be permitted.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> Mr Sussex further pointed out that the draft amended Points of Claim as framed against the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs were posited uponthe assumption that that cargo claim against Defendant owners is lost; in other words, if PICC (through the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs)should succeed against the original Defendant, nothing remained that would be 'live' against the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs, a propositionfrom which Mr Barlow did not dissent when specifically accepting that the claims now sought to be mounted against the 2nd and 3rdPlaintiffs were in the alternative and contingent upon failure of his clients' action against the existing Defendant. Moreover, submittedMr Sussex, the very act of a permitted joinder (or for that matter of amendment under Order 20 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5)</a> effectively disposed of any ability on the part of his clients to plead a time bar defence by virtue of the statutory relation backin <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 35(1)(b)</a>, <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a></em> unless (which was not the case in the revised draft pleading) the vehicle for the new claim was a third party proceeding which, pursuantto <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 35(1)(a)</a>, <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a></em>, was deemed to have commenced at the date of such third party proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> Mr Sussex concluded that joinder under Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6</a> was not possible given that the statutory scheme provided in Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rules 5</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a> was not met, and that what was involved here was the joinder of "a new party". The proposed amendments, said Mr Sussex, would createa <em>lis</em> between the 4th Plaintiff on the one hand and the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs on the other where none had existed before, and as suchwould constitute the addition of new parties. In support of this contention, he relied upon a English Court of Appeal judgment in<strong>Reed Publishing Holdings Limited &amp; Others v. King's Reach Investments</strong> [1983] (unreported, CA transcript), a decision upon an interlocutory appeal against an Order of Judge William Stabb, sitting as anOfficial Referee, whereby leave was given for the Statement of Claim in that action to be amended so as to enable the 2nd Plaintiff,Reed Properties Limited, to claim against the 1st Defendant in contract.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> The factual background of this case is far removed from that presently before the Court. In <strong>Reed</strong>, the Writ was issued on 8th June 1981 and the 1st Plaintiff alone sued the 1st Defendant for damages for breach of a building agreementin respect of defective windows, and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs sued the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants in negligence for damagesin connection with the design, supply and fixing of the glass panels. So at that stage there were, as the judgment of Dunn LJ makesclear, two quite separate claims, the only claim in contract being a claim by the 1st Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant. Furtherand Better Particulars of the damages were requested, and given, and thereafter an amendment, the subject to the appeal in <strong>Reed</strong>, was formulated to the Statement of Claim, paragraph 7 thereof pleading an assignment dated 4th October 1977 of the residue of theterm of the building lease (which contained full repairing covenants) from the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs. The proposed amendment thencontinued with the plea that at all material times the 1st Plaintiff intended to assign the benefit of the building contract dated20th September 1972, and that the benefit of that agreement was assigned to the 2nd Plaintiff in equity at the date of the assignmentof the lease. The judgment of Dunn LJ in <strong>Reed</strong> continued as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It was accepted in this court, and the learned judge assumed, that any contractual liability of the first defendants under the agreementof 20 September 1972 is in respect of a breach of contract which is agreed to be outside the limitation period. The question arises,therefore, whether the claim may be made by way of amendment. The learned judge held that it could, and in his short judgment hegave his reasons as follows :</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'If the application is to be construed as one for the introduction of a new plaintiff, it is simply giving that new plaintiff a newcause of action alleging the same facts as the first plaintiffs: it does not make one whit of difference to the first defendantson the facts, because they are precisely the same facts. Accordingly, I think that whether the matter is put as one of adding a newparty or as one of adding a new cause of action, since the facts are the same in either case, I should give leave'.</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>Mr Blackburn has very wisely accepted, in this court, that the effect of this amendment, if it were allowed, would be to add a newparty to the proceedings.</em></p>        <p class="quote"><em>That, if I may say so, is plainly right. Although the second plaintiffs are in fact parties, as the unamended pleadings stand thereis no lis between the second plaintiffs and the first defendants, and to allow this amendment would constitute the addition of anew party.</em></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">The other concession which Mr Blackburn made was that the approach of the judge on the basis that this amendment did involve the additionof a new party, namely, that the question was whether the facts on which the claim was based were the same as the facts as betweenthe first plaintiffs and the first defendants, was the wrong test. Once again Mr Blackburn was right to make that concession, becausethe matter is now governed by section 35 of the Limitation Act 1980 and the rules which have been made under it. This section putsa restriction on amendments made, or desired to be made, after the expiration of the limitation period, especially where the additionof new parties is concerned ..." (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> Mr Sussex submitted that on the basis of the reasoning of the Court in <strong>Reed</strong>, the amendments now proffered clearly served to add new parties in the absence of a pre-existing lis, and this could be effectedonly in the circumstances laid down in Order 15 rule 6(5) and (6), none of which applied, so that in the circumstances the Courtwas left with the blanket prohibition within Section 35(3), <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a></em>, none of the exceptions thereto applying either.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr Barlow attacked this submission as contrived and illogical. He pointed out with some force that the decision in <strong>Reed</strong> had gone forward by concession of counsel, and suggested that, as a result, it was not altogether easy to understand the reasoningunderlying that decision. The 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs had always been 'parties' in the strict sense, and so far as <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 35</a>, <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a></em> was concerned, he further suggested that once rules of court had been made pursuant thereto, this statutory provision was, to usehis term, 'spent', and that "<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 35</a> does not apply in the present context".</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> This latter contention is, I suppose, either right or wrong, and for my own <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347#p1" class="autolink_findacts">part I</a> think that it is wrong. With respect, I am unable to grasp how the enactment of rules of court pursuant to primary legislation couldhave the effect of effectively negating the primacy of the legislative provisions underpinning their existence. So whilst I can seewhy Mr Barlow seeks to make this argument, in my judgment the point fails.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> I have more instinctive sympathy with the suggestion that the use of the term 'party' in Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6</a> must mean "party to the proceedings", and that if this be correct, Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 6</a> has nothing to do with the present application to amend, and that argument should be centered squarely and solely upon the applicationof the provision of Order 20 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5(5)</a>, an issue which I shall shortly address. Order 15 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">rules 6(5)</a> and (6) do not 'bite', says Mr Barlow, because the present application is to add new claims to <em>existing</em> parties to the proceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> This argument has its attractions, not least in terms of the literal meaning of the term 'party', and by reason of the happenstancethat the claim now sought to be brought involves former co-plaintiffs. I am, however, unable to persuade myself that this is correcteither. The existing rules on joinder anticipate the addition (or substitution) of a new party in situations wherein, absent suchjoinder (whether above or below the line), the existing claim cannot properly be determined, and is therefore considered 'necessary'in the circumstances, notwithstanding the expiry of the limitation period. It is not, in my view, correct to assert, as I think inthis context Mr Barlow so asserted, that because the intended targets of the amendment are already in the action <em>qua</em> Plaintiffs that therefore this enabled new <em>alternative</em> claims to be made against the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs upon the reconstitution of the action to change their status to Defendants,and this in circumstances in which there had been no pre-existing <em>lis</em> between these two groups of Plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In my judgment it cannot be right, and it is not right, to permit the extraordinary procedural events in this case, whereby two setsof solicitors came to be on record representing two sets of Plaintiffs, to be the fortuitous vehicle for the 4th Plaintiff to bepermitted to sidestep the strictures present within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 35</a>, <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a></em> and Order 15 rule 6(5) and (6), provisions which are specifically designed to safeguard the joinder of parties outside the relevantlimitation period. Had there been an attempt to join the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs as Defendants to this new claim at this stage <em>without</em> these entities having already been part of this action, the application would never have got off the ground; as Mr Barlow accepted,if his clients were forced to issue new proceedings, "the limitation period would be insurmountable". In my view, therefore, thiscase is in an <em>a fortiori</em> position to <strong>Reed Publishing</strong>, wherein the 2nd Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant were already on different sides of the line, so to speak, but where there had hithertobeen no <em>lis</em> between them, the introduction of such a <em>lis</em> effectively being considered by the English Court of Appeal (albeit via a concession) to constitute the addition of a new party.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> Accordingly, on the issue of Section 35(3), <em><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/347">Cap.347</a></em> and Order 15 rule 6(5) and (6), I agree with Mr Sussex, and reject Mr Barlow's arguments in terms of their non-applicability.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> That in itself is sufficient to decide the amendment argument. However, if I be wrong in this conclusion, I move now to considerthe argument centering upon Order 20 rule 5(5), which rule Mr Barlow maintains is the only applicable provision in the circumstances.In a nutshell, he says that the amendments proposed fall squarely within the terms of Order 20 rule 5(5) in that the present applicationis one arising out of the same or substantially the same facts as the cause of action in respect of which the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffsare already claiming in the action against Defendant owners.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> To this contention, Mr Sussex again joins issue. If he is wrong on the joinder argument, he says, and, contrary to his submissions,Order 20 rule 5(5) does come into consideration, his primary point is that there is a significant difference between the facts reliedupon as against the Defendant owners and those facts relied upon as constituting the alleged new cause of action against the 2ndand 3rd Plaintiffs. Against the Defendant shipowner, the key is the contract of carriage evidenced by the bills of lading, with causesof action in contract, bailment and tort, whereas the draft claim against the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs arises out of a sales contract,to whit, that goods shipped under that sales contract did not conform to contractual specification. Moreover, all that is soughtto be pleaded against the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs cannot be pleaded against Defendant owners, for the very good reason that this woulddefeat the causes of action extant against them. In the event, therefore, what was being proposed constituted alternative claimsonly, with the substratum of relevant fact needed to sustain these contingent claims being substantially at variance with the factualmatrix, including the fire on board the 'Hobbit', sufficient to run the case against Defendant owners.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Further, if he be wrong on this analysis, Mr Sussex went on to submit that in any event there is a discretion vested in the Court,and that the Court is entitled to take into account the issue of prejudice occasioned by such amendments, in this connection citingthe well-known passages from the judgment of Staughton LJ in <strong>Hancock Shipping v. Kawasaki Heavy Industries Limited</strong>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20WLR%201025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 WLR 1025</a>, at 1028-1032 (CA). Moreover, if prejudice came into the equation at all, the Ninth Affidavit of Mr Dunlop of Holman, Fenwick &amp;Willan clearly set out the difficulties and problems that would undoubtedly arise if the proposed amendments were to be permitted.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> In response, Mr Barlow argued that there was no relevant prejudice, and that allegations of prejudice are and were 'misconceived';and that if the Court was against him on this submission, any such prejudice was "prejudice for which both parties to the applicationare to blame", in that "they jointly should bear responsibility for that done or not done by their joint agent, their common solicitor".</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The latter is an interesting approach, and I reject it. Were amendments in the terms proposed to be permitted, the case is manifestlyold and stale (as Mr Barlow accepts), and in my view it is clear that relevant prejudice would arise. Nor, in my judgment, is ita satisfactory answer to this particular point to inveigh about the responsibility of Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan for the situationwhich is said to have come about. The clear and obvious remedy available to the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs and/or PICC is to bringa claim in negligence against Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan, as appears to have been repeatedly threatened albeit (as Mr Sussex arguedin the context of his submission that the present claim is, in his words, "trumped up" to support the injunction summons) such acourse thus far has pointedly not materialised, notwithstanding that, on the evidence, PICC had threatened Holman, Fenwick &amp;Willan with a negligence suit as long ago as 15th July 1997, on which date they wrote, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"Dear Sir,</p>        <p class="quote">Re: HOBBIT</p>        <p class="quote">We wish you to immediately transfer all papers to M/S. Hill Taylor Dickinson for further conduct of the case by HTD on behalf ourinsureds and ourselves.</p>        <p class="quote">Your negligence and mistakes in dealing this case appear to us to have seriously prejudiced our position. We consider that your servicesin this case do not merit any remuneration. On the contrary, we are presently considering pursuit of a claim against your firm ....."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> Whilst in similar vein PICC's then new solicitors, Hill Taylor Dickinson, subsequently wrote an extensive and detailed letter ofcomplaint to Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan dated 5th August 1997 in, <em>inter alia</em>, the terms set out below :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"3. We consider, on the basis of the information and documents which we have to hand in relation to this case, that you have negligentlyfailed to perform your duty as solicitors for PICC and are liable in damages to PICC.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">.....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">9. PICC has suffered loss in that the litigation has been mishandled, various subrogated causes of action have become time-barredand it is now committed to the cost of litigation in respect of subjectmatter nearly ten years old without the benefit of evidencewhich should have been timeously collected by you a long time ago with no prospect of achieving the recovery to which it should beentitled.</p>        <p class="quote">10. We are about to prepare instructions to Counsel to draft Points of Claim in respect of the commencement of proceedings againstMr. Guy Hardaker and your firm for substantial damages for negligence. Kindly inform us promptly whether you wish us to serve theproposed proceedings upon Mr. Hardaker and your firm at your place of business in Hong Kong or, alternatively, of the identity ofsolicitors appointed by your insurers to accept service of the proceedings on both of your behalves.</p>        <p class="quote">11. In the meantime, in the event that you consider that the above fails to take account of material facts or circumstances whichyou consider are relevant to the allegations raised against you, we shall be pleased to receive your comments in order to enableus, if appropriate, to reconsider our views upon your negligence. ....."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> Viewed against this background, therefore, I find it difficult to accept, and I reject, Mr Barlow's closing submission that judicialdiscretion should now be exercised "to permit matters which should have been addressed now to be litigated" and that there is andwas no reason to exercise such discretion "to further disadvantage the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs". Nor do I accept his forcefulsubmission that reconstitution <em>absent</em> leave to amend in the terms desired would be 'illusory' given that the "onset of the present paralysis" resulted from his client's"desire to raise their alternative claim". I can identify no such 'illusion'. I have earlier dealt with the history of the procedural'paralysis' of this case, whilst it seems to me to be abundantly clear that a negligence remedy against Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willanhas throughout squarely been in the sights of PICC and, for that matter, their new legal advisers, Hill Taylor Dickinson. Thus, whenMr Barlow posed the rhetorical question "the Court will have to ask itself, is the consideration [of a negligence writ against Holman,Fenwick &amp; Willan] sufficient to weigh in the balance in the exercise of its discretion?", this seems to me clearly to permitof an affirmative response. For similar reasons I do not consider it correct, as Mr Barlow further submitted, that if reconstitutionis permitted <em>absent</em> leave to amend that this would be "wholly unjust" because the effect would be that the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs "would enjoy the advantageof the unsatisfactory way that Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan have 'served' all the Plaintiffs from 1989 to 1997".</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> In summary, therefore, I am also against Mr Barlow in his argument that the proposed amendments fall within the terms of Order 20rule 5(5), and that, if I be wrong in that conclusion, I further decline to exercise my discretion to permit these amendments inlight of all the circumstances of this case and, in particular, the evidence of resultant prejudice.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> Lastly under this head, and for the avoidance of doubt, in arriving at my conclusion upon the amendment issue I have not placed anyweight upon Mr Sussex's further contention that such amendments proposed in any event should not be permitted because there had effectivelybeen a settlement of the alternative contractual claim, or what is termed within the affidavits a "commercial arrangement", and thatin this regard PICC could not be in a better position than its assured, the 4th Plaintiff, whose contractual rights had effectivelybeen subject to accord and satisfaction. In this context I tend to agree with Mr Barlow. The affidavit evidence regarding a settlementbetween the 2nd and the 4th Plaintiff is not entirely satisfactory, this is not a strike-out point in the sense of being plainlyor obviously bad, and this is not an argument which is conclusive and which in itself would justify the refusal of leave to amend;had such amendments in fact been permitted, the 'settlement' point could have been pleaded in defence thereto, and the issue thereafterdebated at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> It follows from the foregoing that leave to amend in the draft terms before the Court is refused, and that the amendment summonsis dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> This brings me, finally, to the injunction summons.</p>    <p class="heading">(3) The injunction summons dated 21st May 1998</p>    <p><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> Somewhat curiously, the application seeking to enjoin Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan from further acting for any party in this action,which clearly started life as the main item upon the PICC agenda and which was the first of the applications to be argued, has nowcome to be recognised (I think) as an issue which can properly be dealt with <em>only</em> upon the determination of the two other applications. These latter matters having been resolved, I consider now the issue which hasbeen primarily responsible for a distinct sense of animus pervading this case; indeed, in his closing submissions Mr Barlow describedthe "true position" as being a "standoff between Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan and the indemnifiers of the 4th to 6th Plaintiffs",a turn of phrase which in my view aptly mirrored the reality of the situation.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> Be that as it may. By the injunction summons, the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs seek the following specific orders :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) that Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan ("HFW") do cease to act for any parties to this action forthwith;</p>        <p>(2) that HFW do refrain from releasing confidential communications between the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs and PICC and HFW to the1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs and any solicitors to be appointed by them; and</p>        <p>(3) that the costs of this application be paid by HFW to the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs and, if not agreed, be taxed on a full indemnitybasis.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> So far as this application is concerned, Mr Sussex does not stand on ceremony. He contends that the application is misconceived andrepresents a serious abuse of process which, he says, has been brought solely "as a weapon to discomfort" his clients. To the contrary,Mr Barlow asserts that such injunctive relief is both highly necessary and appropriate in the circumstances which have arisen. Clearly,therefore, there is little scope for any meeting of minds upon the substance of this issue, although happily there was a considerablemeasure of agreement between Counsel as to applicable legal principles.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> Although the Court has been treated to an interesting (and educational) survey of the law in this area, by the time of conclusionof argument I think it fair to say that both Counsel accepted that the relevant legal principles to be applied in terms of enjoiningsolicitors from acting were as laid down by the English Court of Appeal in <strong>In Re A Firm of Solicitors,</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20QB%20959" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 QB 959</a>, in which it was held that the Court would intervene if a risk of a breach of the duty not to communicate confidential informationcould reasonably be anticipated, a test which had its origin in the judgment of Buckley LJ in the landmark case of <strong>Rakusen v. Ellis, Munday and Clarke,</strong> [1912] 1 Ch.831, and which led Parker LJ in <strong>In Re A Firm of Solicitors</strong> to observe (<em>op.cit. at 969</em>) :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... This appears to me to suggest that the proper approach is to consider whether a reasonable man informed of the facts might reasonablyanticipate such a danger."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> At the conclusion of argument, however, Mr Barlow was good enough to inform the Court that he understood that the written judgmentof the House of Lords in the case of <strong>Prince Jefri Bolkiah v. KPMG (a Firm)</strong> was shortly to be expected, a judgment which he considered was likely to be of great relevance if it became available prior to thedecision on this application. Through the industry of those instructing him, I have now been sent a hard copy of that judgment ofthe House of Lords as published on the Internet on 18th December 1998, oral judgment in this case having been delivered earlier bytheir Lordships on 18th November 1998. As Counsel anticipated, I have been very considerably assisted by the published report, inwhich Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Hope, Lord Clyde and Lord Hutton unanimously agreed with the principal speech of Lord Millett.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> In <strong>Prince Jefri</strong>, the factual matrix was that the Prince ultimately was successful in enjoining KPMG, the large and well-known firm of chartered accountants,from acting for a Finance Task Force appointed by the Government of Brunei to conduct an investigation into the activities of theBrunei Investment Agency (of which Prince Jefri was for many years Chairman) against a background whereby KPMG had undertaken a priormajor assignment ("Project Lucy") and a number of other personal assignments for Prince Jefri, in the course of which the firm hadbeen entrusted with, or had acquired, extensive confidential information concerning Prince Jefri's assets and financial affairs.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="pseudopara" id="p53">53.</a> In allowing Prince Jefri's appeal, and in reinstating the injunction granted by Pumfrey J. at first instance, Lord Millett notedthat the issues raised in these proceedings had not previously been considered by the House of Lords, and confirmed, in a situationin which a solicitor was in possession of information confidential to the former client wherein such information was or might berelevant to the matter upon which he was sought to be instructed by a second client, that :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... the Court's intervention is founded not on the avoidance of any perception of possible impropriety but on the protection of confidentialinformation."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p54" class="pseudopara" id="p54">54.</a> Lord Millett then went on to observe :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Where the court's intervention is sought by a former client, however, the position is entirely different. The court's jurisdictioncannot be based on any conflict of interest, real or perceived, for there is none. The fiduciary relationship which subsists betweensolicitor and client comes to an end with the termination of the retainer. Thereafter the solicitor has no obligation to defend andadvance the interests of his former client. The only duty to the former client which survives the termination of the client relationshipis a continuing duty to preserve the confidentiality of information imparted during its subsistence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Accordingly, it is incumbent on a plaintiff who seeks to restrain his former solicitor from acting in a matter for another clientto establish (i) that the solicitor is in possession of information which is confidential to him and to the disclosure of which hehas not consented and (ii) that the information is or may be relevant to the new matter in which the interest of the other clientis or may be adverse to his own. Although the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, it is not a heavy one. The former may readilybe inferred; the latter will often be obvious. I do not think that it is necessary to introduce any presumptions, rebuttable or otherwise,in relation to these two matters. But given the basis on which the jurisdiction is exercised, there is no cause to impute or attributethe knowledge of one partner to his fellow partners. Whether a particular individual is in possession of confidential informationis a question of fact which must be proved or inferred from the circumstances of the case. In this respect also we ought not in myopinion to follow the jurisprudence of the United States.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="quote"> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>The extent of the solicitor's duty</em></p>        <p class="quote">Whether founded on contract or equity, the duty to preserve confidentiality is unqualified. It is a duty to keep the information confidential,not merely to take all reasonable steps to do so. Moreover, it is not merely a duty not to communicate the information to a thirdparty. It is a duty not to misuse it, that is to say, without the consent of the former client to make any use of it or to causeany use to be made of it by others otherwise than for his benefit. The former client cannot be protected completely from accidentalor inadvertent disclosure. But he is entitled to prevent his former solicitor from exposing him to any avoidable risk; and this includesthe increased risk of the use of the information to his prejudice arising from the acceptance of instructions to act for anotherclient with an adverse interest in a matter to which the information is or may be relevant.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><em>Degree of risk</em></p>        <p class="quote">It follows that in the case of a former client there is no basis for granting relief if there is no risk of the disclosure or misuseof confidential information. This was the ground on which the Court of Appeal discharged the injunction in Rakusen's case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%201%20Ch%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] 1 Ch. 831..."</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p55" class="pseudopara" id="p55">55.</a> Lord Millett specifically noted, and accepted as "well-founded", criticisms of the test "supposed to have been laid down in Rakusen'scase", namely, "that the Court will not intervene unless it is satisfied that there is a 'reasonable probability of real mischief'",observing that, if this were to be the test :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"...It imposes an unfair burden on the former client, exposes him to a potential and avoidable risk to which he has not consented,and fails to give him a sufficient assurance that his confidence will be respected. It also exposes the solicitor to a degree ofuncertainty which could inhibit him in his dealings with the second client when he cannot be sure that he has correctly identifiedthe source of his information.</p>        <p class="quote">It is in any case difficult to discern any justification in principle for a rule which exposes a former client without his consentto any avoidable risk, however slight, that information which he has imparted in confidence in the course of a fiduciary relationshipmay come into the possession of a third party and be used to his disadvantage. Where in addition the information in question is notonly confidential but also privileged, the case for a strict approach is unanswerable. Anything less fails to give effect to thepolicy on which legal professional privilege is based. It is of overriding importance for the proper administration of justice thata client should be able to have complete confidence that what he tells his lawyer will remain secret. This is a matter of perceptionas well as substance. It is of the highest importance to the administration of justice that a solicitor or other person in possessionof confidential and privileged information should not act in any way that might appear to put that information at risk of cominginto the hands of someone with an adverse interest..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p56" class="pseudopara" id="p56">56.</a> Lord Millett also took the opportunity to reject the "many different tests" that appear in the authorities, such as "an appreciablerisk" or "an acceptable risk", further observing :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"... I regard such expressions as unhelpful : the former because it is ambiguous, the latter because it is uninformative. I prefersimply to say that the court should intervene unless it is satisfied that there is no risk of disclosure. It goes without sayingthat the risk must be a real one, and not merely fanciful or theoretical. But it need not be substantial. This is in effect the testformulated by Lightman J. in <strong>Re a Firm of Solicitors</strong> [1997] Ch.1, at p.9..."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p57" class="pseudopara" id="p57">57.</a> It is clear that the strict test as now formulated, wherein any question of a "balancing exercise" is firmly rejected, puts the caseas high as that of a "no risk basis" (always assuming the existence of confidential information) and places a "heavy burden" (suchas Lord Millett said was faced by KPMG in this case) upon the solicitor acting or seeking to act for the new client to establishthe absence of any risk that confidential information obtained in the course of a former client relationship may unwittingly or inadvertentlycome to the attention of the new client.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="pseudopara" id="p58">58.</a> Since <strong>Prince Jefri</strong> is now the leading authority in this area, I propose to follow the approach therein laid down, notwithstanding that it has not beenthe subject of submissions by Counsel. In this regard it seems highly probable that the strictness of the test propounded by LordMillett could not but be welcomed by the Applicants for the relief presently sought, whilst so far as the Respondents are concernedsuffice to say that in any event I would have arrived at the same conclusion on the basis of the agreed test in <strong>In Re A Firm of Solicitors</strong> <em>(op.cit.)</em>, which test has hitherto received the approval of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. How, therefore, should the recent formulation bythe House of Lords in <strong>Prince Jefri v. KPMG</strong> be applied to the facts of the instant case?</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="pseudopara" id="p59">59.</a> At the outset of such consideration it seems to me that there is a primary factual distinction to be drawn between the type of situationsuch as occurred in <strong>Prince Jefri</strong> and that in the present proceedings. The latter do <em>not</em> involve Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan in choosing to act in a matter for a new client or clients with claim(s) or interest(s) adverseto those of the previous client. To the contrary. The departure of PICC with the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs to what was then MessrsHill Taylor Dickinson (now Dibb Lupton Alsop) had simply left Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan to <em>continue</em> to attend to the interests of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs, who were, as earlier noted, pre-existing clients before PICC and the4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs also began to be represented by that firm in circumstances in which, Mr Sussex strongly asserted, thereexisted no conflict, be it then or now, between these two sets of Plaintiffs. Which situation, it seems to me, squarely raises thepreliminary issue as to the existence of confidentiality and privilege between co-plaintiffs.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="pseudopara" id="p60">60.</a> In <strong>Prince Jefri</strong>, <em>op.cit.</em>, the case at hand was, of course, about the duties of accountants, but Lord Millett made it plain that "the case for a strict approachis unanswerable" where the information in question is not only confidential but also privileged (whether in terms of litigation privilegeor solicitor-client privilege). However, whilst recognizing the importance of solicitor-client confidentiality, a constant withinMr Sussex's submissions in opposing the injunctive relief claimed was that there is and can be <em>no</em> confidentiality as between co-plaintiffs, for which proposition he relied upon <strong>Re Konigsberg (A Bankrupt)</strong>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20WLR%201257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 WLR 1257</a> at 1265, <em>per</em> Peter Gibson J. :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" Finally I return to the first ground on which Mr Walker relies for his submission that privilege cannot be asserted by Mrs Konigsbergagainst the trustee. Mr Walker referred me to the following passage in <em>Phipson on Evidence,</em> 13th ed., para.15-11, under the heading 'Joint retainer':</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">'When two parties employ the same solicitor, the rule is that communications passing between either of them and the solicitor, inhis joint capacity, must be disclosed in favour of the other - e.g. a proposition made by one, to be communicated to the other; orinstructions given to the solicitor in the presence of the other; though it is otherwise as to communications made to the solicitorin his <em>exclusive</em> capacity.'</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Thus if the communication with or from the solicitor in his joint capacity must be disclosed, privilege cannot be asserted by oneof the two parties against the other in proceedings against each other. This is established by <em>Shore v. Bedford</em> (1843) 5 M. &amp; G. 271. In that case the plaintiff having a claim against the defendant went with the defendant to the plaintiff'ssolicitor, who agreed to write on the defendant's behalf to a third party. The defendant made a statement in the plaintiff's presenceto the solicitor and the plaintiff subsequently brought an action against the defendant. It was held that the statement was not aprivileged communication and questions could be asked of the solicitor's clerk as to what had been said."</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="pseudopara" id="p61">61.</a> The same point is put, in a somewhat different context, by Rix J. in "<strong>The Sagheera</strong>"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 Ll LR 160</a>, at 165 :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">" As for the submission that there could be no privilege because of lack of confidentiality between the owners and their war riskunderwriters, in my judgment that submission goes too wide. <em>Parties who grant a joint retainer to solicitors of course retain no confidence as against one another: if they subsequently fallout and sue one another, they cannot claim privilege.</em> But against all the rest of the world, they can maintain a claim to privilege for documents otherwise within the ambit of legal professionalprivilege; and because their privilege is a joint one, it can only be waived jointly, and not by one party alone. These principlesare, I believe, well established: see for instance <em>Rochefoucauld v. Boustead,</em> (1896) 65 L.J.Ch.794, <em>Cia Barca de Panama S.A. v. George Wimpey &amp; Co. Ltd.</em>, [1980] 1 Lloyd's Rep.598, In <em>Re Konigsberg (A Bankrupt)</em>, [1989] 1 W.L.R.1257." <em>(emphasis added)</em></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p62" class="pseudopara" id="p62">62.</a> Accordingly, if the principle as to the absence of confidentiality between co-plaintiffs is correct, as I accept it to be, on thisbasis alone this would appear to render unsustainable the relief sought in the instant summons. The stringency of applicable principlelaid down in <strong>Prince Jefri v. KPMG</strong> was predicated upon the established existence of confidential information, and, as Lord Millett commented, in normal circumstancesof a client's previous solicitor acting for a new client in a new and adverse matter, this is something which "may readily be inferred".However, the present case is not such a "new client" situation, and in the particular circumstance of former co-plaintiffs it isnot easy to see how there is to be established the presence of such confidential information requiring the invocation, at the behestof such co-plaintiffs, of the Court's protection against the risk, however slight, of disclosure to the <em>retained</em> client. Possibly this may be the very reason justifying Mr Barlow's categorisation of this case as "a very unusual situation whichhas not been before the Courts in any reported decision".</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="pseudopara" id="p63">63.</a> Be that as it may. Mr Barlow argued forcefully in favour of the relief now sought. A fundamental premise of his argument was thatsolicitors working for multiple plaintiffs have a duty from the outset to identify any areas of potential conflict of interest betweentheir clients <em>qua</em> co-plaintiffs. In the present case, he said, notwithstanding Mr Sussex's firm disclaimer as to the existence of any conflict of interest,there were indeed "fairly obvious" conflicts between the interests of the two groups of Plaintiffs represented by Holman Fenwick&amp; Willan, conflicts which had become "unmistakable" by the time of the filing of the Defence and Counterclaim in the action inearly 1990, and that "without ever advising the 4th to 6th Plaintiffs of these matters Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan continued in therole of the Plaintiffs' solicitors until the 4th to 6th Plaintiffs served notice of dismissal and notice of their intention to claimagainst Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan for negligence and breach of duty". He further suggested that since that time, Holman Fenwick&amp; Willan have adopted procedures which place it in hostile litigation not only against the camp of the 4th to 6th Plaintiffs"but in fact against all the Plaintiffs", a stance exemplified by the application to joint PICC as a party, whom Holman Fenwick &amp;Willan knew, by virtue of confidential information acquired through acting for the 4th to 6th Plaintiffs, " to be driving the 4thto 6th Plaintiffs' involvement in this litigation pursuant to rights of subrogation".</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="pseudopara" id="p64">64.</a> It was "surely nonsense", said Mr Barlow, to suggest, as in evidence Messrs Dunlop and Hardaker had done, that a firm who representedhis clients for almost ten years retained no confidential information, given the conversations and meetings with clients, and inparticular the "sidestepping" by Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan of the very issue of possible conflict raised by PICC in 1991 and 1992.In short, whatever protestations were made in this regard, there had to be in existence a pool of confidential information, not leastbecause Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan appeared to have corresponded separately with their respective clients (an issue not addressedat all by the deponents on the firm's behalf); moreover, whilst a co-plaintiff's confidential information may not be privileged assuch, it may still be confidential, at least to the extent that it had not been communicated to the other plaintiff(s). And thatif the "shared agent" was so remiss as not to recognise obvious conflicts of interest, that agent could not thereafter rely uponsuch dereliction of duty to permit the use of confidential information against a former client. Looked at overall, therefore, MrBarlow suggested that it remained "difficult to comprehend" how in the circumstances Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan could feel ableto resist the present application.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="pseudopara" id="p65">65.</a> I bear well in mind that argument in support of this injunction summons was predicated upon the 4th Plaintiff being permitted, inthe context of a reconstituted action, to advance the alternative claim in contract against the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs, albeit itwas not until relatively late in the day that this draft claim was formulated in terms. Equally, even on the basis of the <em>pre</em>-<strong>Prince Jefri</strong> position Mr Barlow may well have been justified in taking the position (as I think it may fairly be said that broadly he did) tothe effect that he should not be required to identify with particularity what confidential information would be misused should Holman,Fenwick &amp; Willan continue to act, and that it was precisely the risk of unwitting or inadvertent disclosure that posed the problem.Nor, of course, at the time when the matter was debated, had Counsel had the opportunity of reading Lord Millett's speech in <strong>Prince Jefri v. KPMG</strong>, <em>op.cit</em>.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="pseudopara" id="p66">66.</a> Nevertheless, given the view that I have taken on the issue of confidentiality between co-plaintiffs, and, perhaps more importantin the present context, in light of my further decision, for the reasons earlier set out, to refuse leave to amend in the terms nowsought on behalf of the 4th to 6th Plaintiffs, in my view the Applicant's argument on the injunction summons is doomed to fail. Assumingfor purposes of argument that I be wrong on the confidentiality point, the refusal of leave to allow the 4th Defendant now to proceedagainst its erstwhile co-plaintiffs means that any residuum of confidential information assumes no relevance <em>absent</em> any such adverse claim. And, as earlier outlined, Mr Sussex has made it plain that it is the clear intention of the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffsthat Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan should remain their solicitors of record with "the very limited objective" of obtaining the dismissalof the Defendant shipowners' counterclaim (the latter having patently lost interest in the action and Messrs Clyde &amp; Co. havingintervened solely to protect the residual interest of the Defendant's P &amp; I Club), and thereafter to obtain leave to withdrawfrom the action.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="pseudopara" id="p67">67.</a> In the circumstances, therefore, if and in so far as the principles adumbrated by the House of Lords in <strong>Prince Jefri</strong> are in fact applicable in the very particular circumstances of this case, it is clear that in the situation in which (as is now theposition) the 4th, 5th and 6th Plaintiffs and PICC, as subrogated insurers, have been left to their remedy, if any, in negligenceagainst their former solicitors, Messrs Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan, no sufficient basis has been established for the Court to exerciseits jurisdiction to remove these solicitors from continuing to act on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs. It follows, therefore,that this injunction application must also be dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="pseudopara" id="p68">68.</a> I do not wish to conclude this final element of this judgment without commenting upon the type of procedure which has been adoptedin this application. At the beginning of this debate, which due to diary exigencies regrettably took place some six months' ago,Mr Sussex made the general point that the injunction summons of 21st May 1998 was addressed not only to the 1st to 3rd Plaintiffs,but <em>also</em> to Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan, their solicitors, a fact which buttressed his contention that the procedure adopted was inappropriateand incorrect, and that the injunction application should have been brought in Miscellaneous Proceedings by way of originating summonsby PICC against Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan. This, he said, was not simply a technical point, because what had happened was thatthe procedure adopted in terms of a summons issued in the present action in the name of the 4th to 6th Plaintiffs in effect had enabledPICC, as subrogated underwriter and quite obviously the "moving genius" behind these proceedings, effectively to snipe from the sidelineswithout incurring any liability for costs occasioned by the application which it had clearly instituted and, perhaps more to thepoint, without risk of being subject to a cross-application by Holman Fenwick &amp; Willan for security for the costs of any suchoriginating summons or motion.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="pseudopara" id="p69">69.</a> There is force in this submission, which seems to me to gain additional impetus from what I understand to be the refusal of MessrsHill Taylor and Dickinson to accept service of proceedings on behalf of PICC, notwithstanding that PICC were clearly clients renderinginstructions in terms of the three applications the subject of this judgment. Such procedure, albeit arising in the highly unusualcircumstance in which two tranches of plaintiffs were concurrently represented by two firms of solicitors, in my judgment shouldnot have been adopted in the context of what is rightly regarded by our system as the serious and important step of applying to preventa solicitor from acting, or from continuing to act, for his clients.</p>    <p class="heading">SUMMARY</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="pseudopara" id="p70">70.</a> In terms of the three applications before the Court the substantive orders thereon are, therefore, as follows :-</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) On the reconstitution summons dated 26th January 1998, that the names of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs be deleted as Plaintiffsin this action and henceforth be added as the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants respectively.</p>        <p>(2) On the amendment summons dated 17th November 1998, that leave to amend in terms of the drafts annexed thereto is refused.</p>        <p>(3) On the injunction summons dated 21st May 1998, the relief sought therein is refused and the summons is dismissed.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p71" class="pseudopara" id="p71">71.</a> I will hear Counsel in due course as to the precise form of the Orders in each instance, and with regard, also, to such consequentialdirections as may be necessary.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="pseudopara" id="p72">72.</a> Absent agreement thereon, I will also hear the parties as to costs in respect of each summons.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="pseudopara" id="p73">73.</a> I thank Counsel for their considerable assistance.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">(William Stone)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%"></td>            <td style="text-align:center" valign="top" width="50%">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Representation:</p>        <p>Mr Charles Sussex, inst'd by M/s Holman, Fenwick &amp; Willan on their own behalf and for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs and (asfrom 27th August 1998) for the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs only</p>        <p>Mr Barrie Barlow, inst'd by M/s Hill Taylor Dickinson and (as from 15th October 1998) inst'd by M/s Dibb Lupton Alsop, for the 4th,5th and 6th Plaintiffs</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1999/1371.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
