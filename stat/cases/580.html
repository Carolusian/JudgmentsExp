They appeared before Deputy Judge Law in the District Court on various chargesof conspiracy to defraud: A1 on counts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, and A2 on counts 3, 4, 5 and 6.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a> Charges 1 and 2 alleged that A1 conspired with Kwok Tai Mei and Ng Kam Fong respectively to defraud the Urban Council (âUCâ). Charge 4 alleged that A2 conspired with Lee Shun and Chan Shu Hung to defraud the Provisional Urban Council (âPUCâ).  Charges3, 5 and 6 alleged that A1 and A2 jointly conspired with Lam Lai Ching, Ngai Ho, Wong Siu Fong and Ip Kwan respectively to defraudthe PUC.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a> A1 and A2 pleaded not guilty to all the charges.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a> A1 and A2 were convicted of all the charges after trial, and were sentenced to 15 monthsâ imprisonment for each count, to be servedconcurrently.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a> The applicants now seek leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a> This case arose out of certain new policies (âthe policiesâ) implemented by the Urban Services Department (âUSDâ) in the1990s.  For present purposes, âUSDâ shall include the UC as well as the PUC, which was set up in 1997.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a> In a bid to reduce the number of itinerant hawkers so as to improve the general environment, the USD implemented the policies andencouraged holders of itinerant hawker licences to surrender their licences.  The policies provided for compensation to be made tothose who were willing to surrender their itinerant hawker licences.  Two of the compensatory measures were as follows: </p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) to enjoy priority in selecting a vacant fixed hawker pitch through the âRestricted Ballot and Selection Exerciseâ; or</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) to enjoy priority in selecting a stall in UC markets through the âRestricted Ballot and Selection Exerciseâ, and to receivea concession on rent for the first 3 years (the rent could be as low as 4% of the market rent of the relevant stall).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a> Those alleged to have conspired with A1/A2 included Kwok Tai Mei (PW6), Ng Kam Fong (PW7), Lam Lai Ching (PW9), Ngai Ho (PW10), LeeShun (PW11), Wong Siu Fong (PW12) and Ip Kwan (PW13).  They all used to be holders of itinerant hawker licences.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a> The prosecutionâs case was that A1/A2 talked the above witnesses into surrendering their itinerant hawker licences to the USD,in exchange for fixed hawker pitches/market stalls (âstallsâ).  However, the witnesses did not use the stalls obtained to carryon business; instead, they assigned/let the stalls to other hawkers through A1/A2 at a high price and let them carry on businessthere.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a> Although the above witnesses all signed âofficial tenancy agreementsâ with the USD and became âregistered tenantsâ, theydid not manage the stalls.  The real managers were a group of nominal âregistered assistantsâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a> But there was no employment or partnership relationship between the âregistered assistantsâ and the âregistered tenantsâ. In fact, the âregistered assistantsâ were those who had the stalls assigned/let to them by A1/A2 for carrying on business.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a> The amount that A1/A2 paid the âregistered tenantsâ for acquiring the stalls was much smaller than the rent they collected fromthe âregistered assistantsâ who rented the stalls from them.  This enabled A1/A2 to gain huge profits that ranged from hundredsof thousands of dollars to over a million dollars.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a> The prosecution said that the agreements and arrangements reached among A1/A2, the âregistered tenantsâ and the âregisteredassistantsâ contravened the relevant terms of the âofficial tenancy agreementâ.  They deceived the USD for their personal gainand this, it is said, constituted conspiracy to defraud.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Clause 4 of the âofficial tenancy agreementâ between the âregistered tenantsâ and the USD provided that âThe Tenant shallnot assign, sublet, transfer or otherwise part with any of the benefits or obligations conferred by this Agreementâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Clause 16 of the âofficial tenancy agreementâ also provided that âThe Council may terminate this Agreement in the event ofany breach of this Agreement by the Tenantâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a> Further, under Clause 2 of the fixed pitch hawker licence issued to the âregistered tenantsâ, âthe licensee shall not assignor re-sell his licence to any person, or sublet or part with possession of the stall, without prior approval in writing from theUrban Council.â</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a> The arrangements made between the âregistered tenantsâ and the âregistered assistantsâ through A1/A2 were not only in breachof Clause 4 of the âofficial tenancy agreementâ, thus entitling the UC to terminate the tenancy agreements and re-possess thestalls, but were also in breach of Clause 2 of the fixed pitch hawker licence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a> At trial, a number of prosecution witnesses were called to testify against A1/A2.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a> Among the witnesses was Mr Lee Kwok Kuen, Assistant Director of the former USD (PW1).  PW1 elaborated on the relevant policies andtheir background.  He specifically pointed out that if a tenant acted in breach of the tenancy agreement by assigning/letting hisstall to others, the USD would issue a verbal warning.  If the tenant failed to rectify the breach, the USD would issue a warningletter, which was commonly known as a âletter of breachâ.  Where three âletters of breachâ were issued to the same tenantwithin a period of 12 months, the USD would refer the case to a Delegated Member of the UC, who would then decide whether to terminatethe tenancy agreement or to cancel the relevant fixed pitch hawker licence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a> PW1 agreed that when tenants assigned/let their stalls, they were merely acting in breach of contract and were not committing a criminaloffence.  The relevant legislation, however, provided that hawker licences were not to be transferred without prior approval.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> PW1 said that they had never come across a case where, before a tenancy agreement was signed or a licence issued, they actually knewthat the hawker concerned intended to contravene the provisions against assignment/letting of stalls.  Moreover, the USD had neverrequired tenants to declare that their stalls were not assigned/let.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> The other prosecution witnesses who worked in the USD also said that stalls were not to be assigned/let.  Unless the tenant passedaway and an application was made by his family, the holder of the hawker licence could not be changed.  Should a tenant be foundto be in breach of the rules, his stall would be repossessed.  The relevant provisions would also be explained to the tenants whenthey signed the tenancy agreements.  But none of them gave very clear evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> The USD officers all emphasized that if a tenant had declared before signing the tenancy agreement that he would assign/let the stallafter signing the agreement, then the USD would not sign the agreement with him; and that if it had been known before issuing a licencethat the applicant for the licence would assign/let the stall, then he would not be issued a licence.  This notwithstanding, theofficersâ evidence also showed that the USD did not take the matter of assigning/letting of stalls by âregistered tenantsâvery seriously.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> PW1 conceded that when the USD publicised and promoted the policies, they did not stress that stalls could not be assigned/let. Nor did the USD require âregistered tenantsâ to declare at the time of execution of the tenancy agreements that they would notassign/let the stalls.  The USDâs objective was to revoke all itinerant hawker licences as quickly as possible.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> The USD had never cancelled any tenancy agreement with a tenant by reason of his assigning/letting his stall.  As a matter of fact,tenants were free to manage the stalls with others and share the profits among themselves.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The USD also allowed one person to enter into tenancy agreements in respect of a number of stalls.  The existence of these âmultiplelicencesâ shows that there were in fact assignments of itinerant hawker licences.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> The USD had never formulated any specific measures to prevent or eradicate the practice of assigning/letting stalls.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> PW2 agreed that he knew there were newspaper advertisements offering to assign/let stalls, but the USD had never instigated any actions,nor had it ever issued any âletter of breachâ.  Although he had heard of verbal warnings being issued, those cases in the endsimply went unsolved.  He said tenants could âlegally get away from itâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> PW2 admitted that the existence of âmultiple licencesâ meant that there were people who held a number of itinerant hawker licenceswhen they selected a stall.  This showed that the itinerant hawker licences concerned were bought from someone else.  PW3 admittedthat he often heard of instances of stalls being assigned/let, but he had never âformallyâ reported them to his superior, norhad he ever taken any action.  He also admitted that the tolerant attitude adopted by the USD might have misled the tenants intothinking that assigning/letting stalls was a lawful âprivate matterâ.  He explained that in order to avoid âgetting into troubleâ,he had told the ICAC that if a tenantâs intention to assign/let the stall was known, definitely no tenancy agreement would be signedwith him.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> We do not wish to go into too much detail about the evidence of the USD officers.  Suffice it to say that, viewed as a whole, theirevidence showed that the USD was well aware that there were stalls being assigned/let and that such practice was quite prevalent. All along, however, the USD had just âturned a blind eyeâ to the problem and had never taken any robust measure to eradicateit.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> We understand that, when they were giving evidence, the USD officers might have tried to play down the matter and present themselvesas responsible officers in order to protect their personal interests.  Nevertheless, the trial judgeâs findings that the USD woulddefinitely not allow stalls to be assigned/let, and that the USD had not lifted the restrictions on the assignment/letting of stalls,were inconsistent with the USD officersâ evidence.  These findings were not beyond reproach.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Indeed, it is also clear from the evidence of Legislative Councillor Mr Fung Kin Kee Fredrick, who was one of the defence witnesses,the practice of tenants assigning/letting their stalls had always existed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> The Hon. Mr Fung, being an experienced Urban Councillor, had a thorough understanding of the policies.  He said that cases of assignment/lettingof stalls happened time and again, and that the problem had been discussed in UC meetings in the past.  The lack of any policy bythe USD to tackle the problem was, in Mr Fungâs words, a âloopholeâ.  Mr Fung also clearly pointed out that some tenants had,after receiving warning letters as a result of subletting their stalls, approached Councillors and asked them to negotiate with theUSD.   Further, even where a stall had been assigned/let, the Councillor on duty would, instead of revoking the relevant licence,take into account âhumanâ factors and allow the licence to be renewed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> The USDâs attitude towards the practice of assigning/letting stalls is also apparent from their approach in dealing with the tenantsinvolved in the present case.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> These tenants had, in breach of their respective tenancy agreements, assigned/let their stalls, and had pleaded guilty to conspiracyto defraud.  However, the USD did not cancel their agreements, so they were still âregistered tenantsâ.  Recently, the USD eveninvited Ms Ip Kwan (PW13) to sign a document regarding reduction in rent.  The USD neither asked her whether the stall was stillbeing managed by her, nor issued any warning letter to her regarding the assignment of her stall. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> Apart from the USD officers, a number of âregistered tenantsâ involved in the âconspiracyâ also gave evidence at trial. They had all been granted immunity from prosecution and therefore testified under immunity.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> These witnesses who were granted immunity all used to be holders of itinerant hawker licences.  A1/A2 talked them into surrenderingtheir licences to the USD âin exchange forâ stalls.  They became âregistered tenantsâ and then allowed A1/A2 to handle theirstalls.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> The âregistered tenantsâ all alleged that, before they became âregistered tenantsâ, they had already agreed with A1/A2 thatafter they have been assigned stalls, they would let them to A1/A2, and A1/A2 would pay them an amount they had agreed on as consideration.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> After a âregistered tenantâ selected his stall, he would sign a declaration of lease of the stall and assign the stall to A1/A2,who would then manage it.  None of the âregistered tenantsâ had any knowledge of the âregistered assistantsâ, who actuallyran business at the stalls and who had nothing to do with the tenantsâ business.  The tenants applied for assistant licences forthe âregistered assistantsâ only because A1/A2 requested them to do so.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> Some of the âregistered tenantsâ claimed that they did not know what the consequences would be if they assigned/let the stallsinstead of doing business themselves at the stalls, and that they had no idea whether the USD permitted them to do what they haddone.  However, they had not disclosed the truth to the USD, nor had the USD ever made any enquiry with them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> At the same time, some âregistered tenantsâ said that they did know that they could not assign/let the stalls in question.  Someâregistered tenantsâ even said that the transaction that they had with A1/A2 was illegal, but they alleged that it was a commonpractice to assign/let the stalls.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> The practice of assigning/letting through A1/A2 the stalls allocated to the âregistered tenantsâ was obviously in breach of therelevant conditions in the tenancy agreements and the licences.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> A1/A2 required the âregistered tenantsâ to declare in the declarations of assignment/sale/letting of the stalls that they wouldfulfil their obligations and that if they could not fulfil the obligations themselves, their successors would be obliged to do so. This shows they were aware that what they did was contrary to the conditions in the tenancy agreements and the licensing conditions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Nevertheless, in the particular context of the present case, the fact that the acts in question contravened the conditions in thetenancy agreements and the licensing conditions did not necessarily mean that the USD did not permit such acts, much less did itmean that the âregistered tenantsâ and A1/A2 knew that the USD did not permit such acts.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> Mr Eric Kwok, counsel for A1/A2, submits that in order to establish âfraudâ, there must be a false representation, but the âregisteredtenantsâ had no duty to disclose to the USD that they would not carry on their business at the stalls that they acquired, and thereforetheir conduct did not amount to a false representation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> Mr Kwok argues that, if âconcealment of factsâ is to be transformed into a false representation, the precondition is that theconcealing party has a duty to disclose the relevant facts to the party from whom the facts are concealed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> In support of his argument, Mr Kwok cited a short extract from the judgment of Slade LJ in an English Court of Appeal case <i>Johnson v Nobbs</i> (unreported, 9 March 1983).  The extract is as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the mere concealment of these facts could, by itself, amount to a false representation only if there was a duty on the concealingparty to disclose the facts to the other party.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> Mr Kwok submits that the âregistered tenantsâ in question had no duty to disclose to the USD that they would not carry on theirbusiness at the stalls and therefore their words and conduct could not possibly constitute a false representation.  In the absenceof any such representation, there was nothing that could amount to fraudulent conduct. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> Mr Chan Kwong Chi, Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions and counsel for the prosecution, emphasized that, taking intoaccount the background and the special circumstances of the present case, the concealment of facts <i>per se</i> constituted a positive false representation.  Mr Chan points out that, before a âregistered tenantâ signed the tenancy agreement,the parties had been in negotiation for quite a long period of time, and the âregistered tenantsâ must have known that the tenancyagreements which they signed did not permit them to assign/let the stalls concerned.  They were able to enter into the tenancy agreementswith the USD solely because of their special status.  First, they had to surrender their itinerant hawker licences.  Then, throughthe arrangements made by the USD, they could enjoy priority in selecting the stalls they liked.  The tenancy agreements were signedonly at the final stage.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Mr Chan submits that, under these circumstances, the concealment of facts by a âregistered tenantâ at the time of signing theagreement had in fact constituted a false representation.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> We understand the above arguments and have considered the transaction which took place between the âregistered tenantsâ and theUSD as a whole.  In our view, the words and conduct of the âregistered tenantsâ, including the concealment of facts in question,could constitute a false representation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> Apart from procedures prior to the execution of the tenancy agreements, the âregistered tenantsâ were entitled to exercise certainrights and also bound to perform certain obligations when the agreements were executed and thereafter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> The âregistered tenantsâ gave up their itinerant hawker licences in exchange for the right to rent the stalls, and they rentedthe stalls at a concessionary rent which was very favourable to them.  When they signed the tenancy agreements, they must have knownthat the conditions in the tenancy agreements and also the licensing conditions did not permit the assigning/letting of the stalls. However, they had already made arrangements long before that to assign/let the stalls through A1/A2. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> The âregistered tenantsâ even promised A1/A2 that they would renew the tenancy agreements with the USD in their own names atthe expiry of the agreements.  They also guaranteed that they would not surrender the tenancy.  Some âregistered tenantsâ didin fact keep their promise upon the expiry of the tenancy agreements by renewing the agreements with the USD.  On the face of it,they continued to rent the stalls for their use, but in reality they helped the lessees continue to run the stalls, thereby obtainingreward for renewing the tenancy agreements. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Needless to say, during the term of the tenancy agreements, the âregistered tenantsâ had to perform, whether by themselves orthrough others, the terms and conditions of the agreements, including the payment of rent to the USD every month.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> All the abovementioned words and conduct could constitute positive representations that the tenants would carry on their businessat the stalls and would not assign/let the stalls.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> In <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Ray</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 370</a>, the defendant and four friends went to a Chinese restaurant intending to have a meal there and pay for it.  After eating the maincourse, however, they decided not to pay for the meal and fled from the restaurant when the waiter went out of the room.  The defendantwas convicted of dishonestly obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> The Privy Council affirmed the conviction.  The majority view of the Council was that the transaction had to be regarded as a whole. The defendantâs conduct amounted to a continuing representation of his intention to pay, the effect of which was that he was treatedas an honest customer whose conduct did not call for alert.  His change of mind, therefore, in itself constituted deception.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Lord Pearson made the following comment at p.390:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âThe essential feature of this case â¦ is that there was a continuing representation to be implied from the conduct of the respondentand his companions.  By âcontinuing representationâ I mean in this case not a continuing effect of an initial representation,but a representation which is being made by conduct at every moment throughout the course of conduct.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> The same comment can apply to the present case.  The âregistered tenantsâ gave up their itinerant hawker licences in exchangefor the right to rent stalls at a concessionary rent.  They also paid rents each month pursuant to the tenancy agreements and, uponexpiry of the term of tenancy, even applied for renewal of the agreements.  They very well knew that they were prohibited by thetenancy agreements and the licences from assigning/letting the stalls.  At no time did they intend to carry on business at the stalls. What they did was to assign/let the stalls immediately through A1/A2.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> The words and conduct of the âregistered tenantsâ throughout the transaction might not merely be âconcealment of factsâ,but might constitute âfalse representationâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> The prosecution case against A1/A2, however, was not built upon the above basis.  The conduct of the âregistered tenantsâ afterthey signed the tenancy agreements had not been relied upon in support of the charges.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> The alleged deception set out in the particulars of charges against A1/A2 was restricted to the fact that, at the time of the signingof the tenancy agreements, the âregistered tenantsâ failed to disclose to the USD the assigning/letting of the stalls.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Nor did the particulars of charges specified any special circumstances which showed that the âregistered tenantsâ had said otherwords or did other acts before or after the signing of the tenancy agreements which produced the effect that their concealment offacts at the time of signing the agreements constituted an operative false representation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> In the circumstances, the prosecution is not entitled to rely on other special circumstances or other words or conduct of the âregisteredtenantsâ.  We can only consider the act of concealment of facts set out in the particulars of charges.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> We accept Mr Kwokâs submission that, unless a special relationship exists between the parties to the contract or the contract isof a special nature so that the concealing party has a duty to disclose the relevant facts to the other party, the concealment ofsuch facts does not constitute a false representation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> There is nothing in this case which shows that the âregistered tenantsâ were under a duty at the time they signed the tenancyagreements to disclose to the USD that they had already assigned/let the stalls.  Therefore, the fact that they concealed those factsfrom the USD did not constitute a false representation.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> It is apparent that the USD âturned a blind eyeâ and was tolerant towards the assignment/letting of the stalls by the âregisteredtenantsâ.  We harbour doubts about the assertion made by the USD officers that if they knew that the âregistered tenantsâ wouldassign/let the stalls, they would definitely not have signed the tenancy agreements.  Up to this moment, the tenancy agreements ofthe âregistered tenantsâ in question are still valid and have not been cancelled.  The USD has even asked some of the âregisteredtenantsâ involved in the present case to sign documents relating to the reduction of rent.  These are inconsistent with the USDofficersâ assertion.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> The practice of âregistered tenantsâ assigning/letting their stalls was clearly prevalent.  The USD had all along adopted a tolerantattitude towards such practice and had never referred the matter to the police.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Further, the existence of âmultiple licencesâ would certainly lead those concerned to think that it was not illegal to assign/lettheir itinerant hawker licences or the stalls in return for which they gave up their itinerant hawker licences.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The fact that those concerned made arrangements for assigning/letting the stalls in order to avoid direct conflict with the tenancyagreements or licences does not mean that their words or conduct must have been dishonest.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> We have carefully considered all the facts of the case as well as the arguments put forward by the prosecution and the defence. Applying the <i>Ghosh</i> test, we are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, whether on an objective or subjective view, that the conduct of the âregisteredtenantsâ in assigning/letting the stalls was dishonest.  Nor can we say with certainty that they had done any fraudulent act.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> The assigning/letting of the stalls by the âregistered tenantsâ was a violation of the tenancy agreements which they signed andwas not to be encouraged.  A1/A2 colluded with them to exploit the âloopholeâ in the USD policy for their personal gains, therebyindirectly causing loss to our public revenue.  Such conduct is immoral and condemnable.  Whether civil proceedings can be institutedagainst the âregistered tenantsâ and/or A1/A2 to claim damages for breach of contract or tort is not something we have to considerin the present appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> The criminal law, however, is not to be used for dealing with breach of contract/tort or moral issues arising from such matters.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> The Court cannot impose criminal sanctions on an accused on the ground that he has acted in breach of contract or has done a tortiousor other immoral act.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> In the present case, we take the view that, no matter how immoral and condemnable A1/A2âs conduct was and how such conduct shouldbe discouraged, such conduct was not sufficient to render A1/A2 criminally liable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> The conviction of A1/A2 for conspiracy to defraud is unsafe.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> Leave to appeal is granted to A1/A2, and the hearing of the application is treated as the hearing of the appeal.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> The appeal is allowed.  The conviction of A1/A2 is quashed and the sentences are set aside.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%">                <p style="text-align:center">(Arthur Leong)<br />                Chief Judge of the High Court</p>            </td>            <td width="33%">                <p style="text-align:center">(Peter Cheung)<br />                Justice of Appeal</p>            </td>            <td width="33%">                <p style="text-align:center">(Wally Yeung)<br />                Justice of Appeal</p>            </td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Chan Kwong Chi, Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions and Mr Lam Kar Yan Gary, Government Counsel, for the Respondent</p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Eric Kwok, instructed by Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master, for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Applicants</p>        <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>        <p style="text-align:justify">Translated by the Judgment Translation Unit of the Judiciary and approved by Mr. Edmund Cham, Solicitor.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align: justify"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2002/3985.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
