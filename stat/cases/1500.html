The plaintiff applied by summons dated 16 July 2007 to amendthe Statement of Claim.  I allowed the plaintiffâs amendments, and now give reasons.  I reserved my ruling on the variation ofthe undertaking and will now deal with that also.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  The plaintiff, Clarkson Asia, is a shipbroking company and part of a larger group, the Clarkson Group.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Mr Huxley, was employed by the Group for many years and was latterly the managing director of Clarkson Asia until he lefton 3 June 2006.  He says that he intended to establish a shipping investment business and to this end he set up the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Mandarin of which he is one of two directors and beneficially owns 65% of the shares.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Mr Huxley was contractually bound not to engage in shipbroking for a period of six months after his departure.  Nevertheless he,through Mandarin, engaged in shipbroking activities in respect of five vessels during the six-month period.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The plaintiff issued proceedings for injunction and damages against Mr Huxley and for declaratory relief and an account of profitsand ancillary orders against Mandarin and applied for an interim injunction.  The matter came before me at a call-over hearing on22 September 2006 when Mr Huxley gave an undertaking that until 2 December 2006 or the date of the substantive hearing of the summonshe would not compete with Clarkson, save that he was to be allowed to finalise the agreements in respect of the five vessels whichwere identified at Schedule A to the order.  In respect of this proviso, there was a condition that Mandarin pay all net brokeragecommission received in relation to these vessels into an escrow account, not to be drawn on other than by agreement or order of thecourt, but subject to Mandarinâs right to withdraw up to $135,000 per month for its business expenses. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  The summons was adjourned for substantive hearing before Chung J on 23 October 2006 but on 20 October the parties agreed to a consentorder vacating the hearing and continuing the undertaking given by Mr Huxley.  The undertaking not to compete was continued up to2 December 2006, but that in respect of the escrow account was continued until judgment in this action or further order of court.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The vessels identified in the schedule to my order are the âArtenaâ (re-named âMajestic Unityâ); the âGateway Bulkerâ;the âHenzaâ; the âNueva Unionâ and the âShinyo Florentinaâ.  Mr Huxley in his second affidavit dated 11 May 2007 saysthat in respect of these vessels the net brokerage commission due to Mandarin is US$1,060,625.  However, payment of the US$432,500payable in respect of the âShinyo Florentinaâ has been delayed because of a dispute; Mandarin has to sue for it.  In his thirdaffirmation dated 17 July 2007 he says that the balance in the escrow account is US$475,866.74.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Amendment of the pleadings</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Statement of Claim was filed on 17 October 2006.  Apart from the injunction, the plaintiff claimed against Mr Huxley for damagesfor breach of contract.  Against Mandarin it claimed a declaration that Mandarin held and holds any commission, etc., arising fromthe breach as a constructive trustee on trust for Clarksonâs benefit and that it was liable to account for such commission etc. It also claimed an account and tracing inquiry.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In the proposed Amended Statement of Claim the claim against Mr Huxley for damages for breach remains.  However, against Mandarinthe equitable claims go out.  Instead there is a claim for interfering with the contractual relationship between Clarkson and MrHuxley, and averments of conspiracy between the defendants and unjust enrichment as a result of that and the breach, as well as aprayer for payment out by Mandarin of all commissions or payments made to it in consequence of the breach, the interference, theconspiracy and the unjust enrichment. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  Apart from taking issue with particulars given âbefore administration of interrogatories and/or discoveryâ because discoveryhas now been completed, the defendantsâ objection is to the averments of conspiracy which appear at the new paragraph 11A and toany pleadings consequential thereon.  The plaintiff avers that Mr Huxley and Mandarin âwrongfully conspired and combined togetherto injure the plaintiff and or to cause loss to it by unlawful meansâ.  The particulars given are:</p>    <blockquote>        <table border="0" width="85%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote">â</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote" colspan="2">Before administration of interrogatories and/or discovery the best particulars the plaintiff can provide at this stage are as follows:</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(1)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="86%" valign="top" class="quote">The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants carried out the shipbroking activities pleaded in paragraph 8 above.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(2)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="86%" valign="top" class="quote">The said activities were, to the knowledge of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, in breach of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs Employment Agreement with the plaintiff.</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="7%" valign="top" class="quote">(3)</td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="86%" valign="top" class="quote">In consequence of the said shipbroking activities, commissions became payable or were paid to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant who in agreement with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant paid or caused to be paid the same or part thereof to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and/or held or holds the same or part thereof on account of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.â</td>            </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The defendantsâ objection to the averments of conspiracy is that no agreement to form a conspiracy or steps taken in furtherancethereof is identified as having taken place.  Any agreement or combination which forms the basis of the conspiracy would have tobe made between Mr Huxley and Mandarin but he is the controlling mind of Mandarin and he cannot conspire with himself.  The defendantsrely on <i>R v McDonnell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%201%20QB%20233" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 1 QB 233</a> in which it was held that a criminal conspiracy between a one-man company and its sole controller is impossible because an agreementbetween two minds cannot be found.  It is argued that the position cannot be any different in a civil action.

Reference is made there to the New Zealand case of <i>Lee v Leeâs Air Farming Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%20AC%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] AC 12</a>, PC, and the Irish case of <i>Taylor v Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20IR%20142" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] IR 142</a>, Ir.

It necessarilyacted through its directors; a company can act in no other way.  <i>Prima facie</i> the controlling mind and will of Mandarin would be found in the two directors acting as the board.  If Mr Huxley says that his andno one elseâs was the controlling mind, that must be a matter for trial.  I do not see how pleadings of a conspiracy between onedirector and the company, in circumstances where there are two directors can be said to be unarguably bad.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  I think the <i>Aktieselskabet</i> case can be distinguished, because it dealt with the situation where alleged misrepresentations were made by one conspirator.  Noagreement was needed with others to make them.  But some agreement was needed here, for Mr Huxley to use Mandarin in the way he isalleged to have done and it cannot be said at this stage that there is no case that an agreement was made between Mr Huxley and Mandarin.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  For these reasons I allowed the amendments.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Variation of the Undertaking</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The defendants seek to vary the undertaking so as to release Mandarin from paying into the escrow account any further net brokeragecommission received and to allow the entire current balance to be paid out to it, or alternatively that 10% of the net brokeragecommission paid or payable be kept in the account and the balance, including interest, be paid out to Mandarin.  In argument, thesecond alternative was chosen.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I do not think there is any dispute that where an undertaking is given purely to maintain the status quo pending a substantive hearing,it may be varied without much difficulty, but where it is given âuntil trial or further orderâ, the variation is not appealableand the party who has given the undertaking must apply to the court to vary it on a specific ground, usually changed circumstancesmaking the continuation of the undertaking unnecessary, oppressive or unjust.  See <i>Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Bell Davies Trading Ltd &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%201%20BCLC%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] 1 BCLC 516</a>, in particular the judgment of Mummery LJ at paragraph 104.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Here the undertaking was given subject to being reviewed at the substantive hearing of the application for interim injunction. However, there was no substantive hearing.  The parties consented to vacate it and by consent the undertaking was continued untiljudgment in this action or further order.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  There was some argument on this point, but I do not see that there can be any doubt that the undertaking is now one which was intendedto continue until the trial, so the defendant must show specific grounds making the continuation of the undertaking unnecessary,oppressive or unjust.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  The defendants rely on the change in the case against them as providing those grounds.  It is said that the plaintiff only relieson post-termination restraints against Mr Huxley in the employment agreement.  There is no claim for breach of fiduciary duty orduty of fidelity and so all it can recover is common law damages for the breach, the measure of damages being the loss to the plaintiff. Now that the case has been amended, the plaintiff does not seek an account of profits from Mandarin either.  As Mr Scott QC SC putit, we have moved from the Chancery to the Queenâs Bench Division.  All that the plaintiff can recover from Mandarin is damagesarising out of interference with the contract, conspiracy or unjust enrichment.  Again the measure of damages is the loss to theplaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The defendantsâ case is that the damages, if liability is proved, will have to be assessed on the basis of putting Clarkson intothe position in which it would have been but for the breach.  In circumstances of competition by an ex-employee it is usually notpossible to show that the work would definitely have been placed with the ex-employer so the court will evaluate the chance of whichthe ex-employer has been deprived.  This is normally expressed as a fixed percentage of the maximum profit.  Reference is made to<i>Brearley and Bloch, Employment Covenants</i>, p.15.7 and to a number of decided cases.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Essentially the defendants say that even if the defendants had not been involved in the transactions involving the five vessels,Clarkson would not have been involved either.  It would therefore not have earned any commission at all.  In this sort of situationthe best the plaintiff can hope for is a nominal amount such as 10% of the net profits; cf. <i>IDC v Cooley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20All%20ER%20162" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 All ER 162.</a>  On that basis they want the amount in the escrow account reduced to 10% of the net profits, i.e. US$106, 625 or its equivalent. But in any event, they say, the plaintiffâs holding company has already received US$183,500 credit in respect of the transactionfor the âHenzaâ; this was as a result of the defendantsâ efforts and should be set off.  They also make reference to the exhibitreferred to in the last paragraph of Mr Huxleyâs third affirmation and in the light of these two matters they say that the plaintiffis already over-protected.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Mr Scott also refers to the principle that in determining the limit for Mareva relief, the court will consider for how much thecourt has a good arguable case.  This is of course not a Mareva injunction; it was an application for restraint of competition whichwas forestalled by the undertaking.  The undertaking was made voluntarily and I do not see that the same duty rests on the courtto police it as rests on the court where circumstances change after a Mareva order. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The defendants, during the six months in which Mr Huxley was contracted not to undertake brokerage work, made the undertaking inorder, presumably, to avoid having the court grant an injunction, or at least in order to avoid having a hearing on the same.  Thatwas the position when they came before me in September last year and it was the same when they were to have come before Chung J inOctober.  By then they knew what their case was and if they wanted to argue this point they could have done so.  Now, it seems tome, I have to exercise discretion and in doing so I have to ask myself whether the freezing of the money by the existing undertakinguntil trial is unnecessary, oppressive or unjust.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  The defendants argue that I should now assess the likely outcome of the trial.  It does not seem to be argued that the plaintiffis unlikely to succeed on liability; rather the emphasis is on quantum.  In fact the change in circumstances relied on is more technicalthan real.  Though quantum will be based on the loss to the plaintiff rather than the profits made by the defendant, either way thecourt will have to decide, after hearing evidence, on a percentage of the brokerage fees received or to be received by Mandarin.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  This is not a Mareva case, where, in circumstances of a draconian order against the defendants, the court must decide for how muchthe plaintiff has a good arguable case and should reduce it on appropriate evidence being given.  Rather it is an application bythe defendants for discretionary reduction of an undertaking which they were ready enough to give when they thought it necessary.While Mr Huxley gives a lot of evidence as to why the plaintiff would not have got the brokerage in any event, all this is contestedand there is contradictory evidence from the plaintiffâs side.  What damages the plaintiff will get is a matter for the trial courton consideration of that evidence.  It is not necessarily going to be a nominal amount.  In this connection I note that the variouscases on assessment of damages for loss of chance to which I have been referred were all decided after trial.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I do not see that the undertaking is any less necessary now than it was at 20 October 2006 when the defendants agreed to continueit until judgment or further order.  Nor do I see that the defendants will suffer any more oppression or injustice now as a resultof the undertaking, than they did when the consented to its continuation. </p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The defendantsâ application to vary the injunction is dismissed.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">Costs</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  I have heard counsel on costs and although this ruling is to be handed down I will make a final order now.  In respect of the summonsto amend, the costs of occasioned by the amendments will be to the defendants in any event, but the plaintiff having succeeded inthe contested application will have the costs of the hearing in any event.  See Hong Kong Civil Procedure, paragraph 20/8/51.  Asto the application to vary the undertaking the costs will follow the event and be to the plaintiff in any event.  The plaintiff willhave a certificate for two counsel.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <p style="text-align:left"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">(G.P.
