judgment Waung J given on 19 July 2005.  The claims in the case arose out of the sale of a commercialproperty, Li Fung House, Kowloon, (also referred to below as âthe propertyâ) which was effected as part of a restructuring agreementdirected to bringing to an end the protracted period during which the plaintiff, Esquire (Electronics) Ltd (âEsquireâ) had beeninsolvent and had had to be ârescuedâ by a consortium of banks of which the first defendant (âthe Bankâ) was the lead bank. In the judgment the judge held that the plaintiff had established liability against the Bank on its claims in respect of breachof fiduciary duty, economic duress and undue influence.  Decisions as to remedies and reliefs to which the plaintiff might be entitledwere left to be decided as a separate matter.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal this court did not consider it necessary to hear argument on the question of limitation,thus, in effect, indicating that the appeal would be allowed.  The reasons for so doing were that, on any footing, the Bank had notacted in breach of any fiduciary duty, it had not inflicted economic duress and it had not been guilty of exerting any undue influence.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  In his judgment, the judge set out at some length, an analysis of the various authorities relevant to each head of claim.  Beforeconsidering the law in relation to each aspect it is important to ascertain the facts.  In this respect, the first matter which mustbe observed is the length of time which elapsed between the conclusion of the trial of the action on 12 March 2004 and the deliveryof judgment, more than 16 months later, on 19 July 2005.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Court of Final Appeal has in other cases made clear that such a lengthy period of delay is unacceptable.  It has done so forvery good reasons.  Quite apart from the effect on the parties and the adverse effect on the public confidence in the due administrationof justice which such a delay has, a period of delay, even considerably shorter than 16 months, immediately raises the question asto how much of what transpired at trial could have been remembered by the judge.  Unfortunately in this case there are factors whichindicate that the judge must have forgotten important events and aspects of the trial.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Comparing the transcript and the judgment there are areas which clearly lead to the conclusion that the judge must have forgottenimportant conclusions to which he had arrived in the course of hearing the case.  What a judge says in the course of argument cannotbe taken to be his final view on a matter, but it is entirely different if a judge, in effect, stops counsel in the course of submissionson a particular point.  He then might be said to be exercising a case management function.  If a judge does stop counsel from addressinghim on a particular point, although it cannot bind him irrevocably in respect of that point, the better course may be to give theparty concerned an opportunity of addressing the court further should the judge, on reflection, form a different view.  At the veryleast, the party concerned would be entitled to an acknowledgment of the change in the judgeâs conclusion on the point and a fullexplanation as to the judgeâs thinking.  The lapses in this case, in this regard, are almost certainly attributable to the delayin the preparation of the judgment having led the judge to forget important factors and the conclusions to which he arrived as aresult of them.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  The importance of the delay goes further.  A trial which lasts 24 working days, of itself, puts a strain on the memory of the judgeas to what took place.  Nevertheless, where there has been no significant delay in giving judgment, an appellate court is entitledto assume that the mere failure to refer to a part of the evidence does not mean that the judge has overlooked it or that other formsof error have occurred.  But delay in preparation of a judgment complicates matters because, as was said by the Full Court of theFederal Court of Australia in the case of <i>Expectation Pty Ltd v PRD Realty Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=209%20ALR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">209 ALR 568</a> at paragraph 72:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHowever, where there is significant delay, no favourable assumptions can be made.  In such circumstances, it is up to the trialjudge to put beyond question any suggestion that he or she has lost an understanding of the issues.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  This case is made even more complicated in this respect by the fact that the events in question took place some 17 years beforethe trial of the action.  In such circumstances contemporaneous documentation is usually of the highest importance.  In a numberof important respects, the judge did not accept contemporaneous documents as being accurate.  That rejection must fall to be consideredcarefully in the light of all the relevant facts and evidence.  One of the matters to which this court has had to give considerationwas as to how far the judgeâs rejection of contemporaneous documentation can be sustained, particularly if the documentation ofone party has been said to be inaccurate but the judge has not referred to the fact that the documentation from the opposing partysupports the accuracy of the documentation that has not been accepted.</p>    <p class="heading">BACKGROUND</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The starting point of an analysis of the facts in this case is the purchase of Li Fung House by Esquire in September 1981.  At thetime Esquire was involved in trading in consumer electronics as an importer and exporter and a retailer as well as a wholesaler. It had been founded sometime prior to the purchase of the property by Sabahagchand Choithramanni Gurdas (âGurdasâ) who held50% of the shares, the other 50% of the Esquire shares was held by his brother Sabahagchand Choithramani Arajan (âArjanâ).  Gurdasâwitness statement puts the commencement of business by Arjan and himself as 1965.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  In August 1981 Esquire obtained a valuation of the property at $151 million.  It was at the time the tenant of part of the groundfloor of the building and the first floor.  Despite the valuation Esquire purchased the property in September 1981 for $180 million. It is possible that at the time inflation was running high: the best lending rate reached 20% in October 1981.  The prevalence ofinflation at the time might have influenced the thinking of Gurdas as to the advisability of the purchase at what at the time mighthave been considered a high price.  Esquire obtained a loan of $180 million from the Bank for the purchase.  The loan was to be repayableas to the first $30 million by 31 December 1982 as to the next $30 million by 1 June 1983 and the remainder over a five-year period.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The property was, of course, subject to a mortgage and for banking purposes that was calculated at a value of $166 million.  Itis noteworthy that the first tranche of repayments (the two repayments of $30 million each) were to be made from the sale of otherproperty assets and the General Manager of the Bank at the time indicated his serious concern as to those sales happening.  The annualturnover of Esquire was said to have been $565 million with a net profit of $16.2 million and that was sufficient to enable consentfor the loan to be given.  The further charge and mortgage which was dated 30 October 1981 provided for banking facilities up to$300 million and was in standard form of an assignment by way of first legal mortgage of amongst other things Li Fung House; themonies secured were repayable on demand.</p>    <p class="heading">The 1984 restructuring</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  All did not go well for Esquire in subsequent years.  Possibly associated with the difficulties which arose in Hong Kong commencingin 1982, financial difficulties arose which necessitated Esquire first of all seeking further facilities and subsequently a restructuringarrangement with its bankers.  There were altogether five banks involved including the Bank.  By far the largest amount owing wasthat to the Bank namely $309 million.  This was divided notionally into the Bankâs non-property portion of something over $127million and the property portion, which was something over $182 million.  The Bankâs non-property portion, on its own, representedsome 62% of the money owing to all the banks.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  By an agreement dated 22 February 1984 Esquire, Gurdas, Arjan and the banks entered what has been termed a restructuring agreement. The effect of the agreement was that the debts owing to the banks would be treated as frozen debt.  That has been referred to ashardcore debt.  It would be non-interest bearing from the effective date of the agreement which was backdated to 13 September 1983. Esquire would have three accounts namely a working account, an escrow account and the hardcore frozen debt account.  $160,000 wouldbe transferred each working day into the escrow account from the working account and $2 million per month would be paid out of theescrow account which would be divided amongst the banks in accordance with the percentage of the total amount owing on their hardcoredebt.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  As already indicated, the property portion of the Bankâs debt was treated separately from the non-property hardcore frozen debt. There would be a separate property account into which the rents payable in respect of the various properties owned by Esquire wouldbe paid.  There were two specific provisions in the restructuring agreement namely clauses 8 and 10 which preserved the Bankâsrights as mortgagee including the right of disposal of any of the properties including, importantly as regards this case, Li FungHouse.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  One of the requirements of the restructuring agreement was that the accounting firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. (âPMMâ)were appointed by the banks to monitor the operation of the agreement and to report at regular intervals in relation to the financialcondition of Esquire and its companies.  The Bank was also given the right to require Esquire to appoint and pay for a controllerto supervise all aspects of the financial affairs of Esquire and its companies.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  In July 1984 PMM reported to the Bank on the financial position of Esquire.  It appeared that the position was stable in that althoughthe hardcore debt had been reduced further facilities had been provided.  That letter pointed out that even taking into account theincome generated by reason of handling the Esquire accounts the return to the Bank on the total money borrowed was only 3.3%.  Theclear implication in the letter was that the Bank should consider the cost of the funds and the letter raised the question as towhether the Bank should continue with the scheme of financial restructuring of the Esquire Group.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  It was shortly after that, in August 1984, that Ramasundara Naga Ratnam (âRatnamâ) was appointed Group General Manager of theEsquire Companies.  Ratnam was a chartered accountant who came to Esquire with a background of having been in senior management ofa company with a US$100 million turnover.  In his witness statement he said that he:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âhad much exposure to complicated corporate finance problems and had acquired a decent working knowledge of commercial contracts,loan agreements and dealt with banks and financial institutions extensively.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  By January 1985 the value of Li Fung House had fallen to approximately $80 million.  This, in itself, did not prevent the otherbanks, other than Bank of America, from agreeing to extend the 1984 agreements until the end of July of 1985.  The minutes of themeeting of representatives of the banks (other than Bank of America) on 29 March 1985 attended by a representative from PMM recordedthe fact that the banks had agreed to continue the restructuring scheme until July and that there should be a moratorium on paymentsfrom Esquire until that date.  This was apparently in the light of losses which had been incurred by Esquire particularly in Januaryand February of that year.  Because of that fact the Bank had considered that tighter control of Esquireâs financial affairs wasrequired and it was recorded that Gurdas had agreed to employ Sajjad Khan (âKhanâ) as the Group Financial Controller.  Khan wouldbe on temporary release from another firm of accountants, Arthur Young and Co.  He was seconded on 1 April 1985.</p>    <p class="heading">Assignment of the Bank of America debt</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Although, at the meeting of 29 March 1985, the Bankâs representatives expressed the view that the Bank would not conclude an agreementto buy out the Bank of America debt until July, the Bank was forced, by reason of Bank of America presenting a formal demand in respectof the sum owing to it, namely some $21 million, to buy out the Bank of America.  There had been internal memoranda within the Bankshowing that consideration was given to buying out the debts of all banks at $0.20 in the dollar, but the Bank was unable to achievethat figure in respect of the Bank of America debt and had to pay some $8 million the equivalent of $0.36 in the dollar.  It is noteworthythat in the internal Bank memos reference is made to the fact that the Bank was taking the advice of leading counsel as to the handlingof the Bank of America debt. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In the internal bank memo dated 20 April 1985 it is specifically stated that any benefit which would eventually arise from the discountwould accrue to the Bank.  The letter of 25 April 1985 to Esquire, Gurdas and Arjan, which was signed as being agreed to and acknowledgedboth on behalf of Esquire and the two directors, records the fact that the Bank of America debt of $21 million was transferred andowing by Esquire and was guaranteed by Gurdas and Arjan.  On this aspect it may be noted that although the Bank of America debt wasassigned to the Bank on 27 April 2005 and notice thereof was given to Esquire on 1 May, the notes of the meeting of 28 May 2005 betweenthe representatives of the banks show that the representatives of the Bank were content to inform the meeting that the Bank was stillnegotiating with Bank of America at $0.20 in the dollar.</p>    <p class="heading">The continuing financial difficulties â discussions of sale of properties</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  At the beginning of 1985 the position of Esquire had begun to look optimistic.  In 1984 the turnover had reached $500 million andit was understood that there had been a net profit of $26 million, of course, that was in a situation where no interest was payableon the hardcore debt.  Nevertheless, there were still difficulties.  According to an internal memo from the Manager Credit Controldated 4 February 1985, Gurdas had an âundisciplined buyingâ policy which led to slow moving inventory.  As a result it was saidthat the Bank would continue to monitor the stock build-up.  That note records the fact that Gurdas was asking for forgiveness ofold hardcore debt.  The Bankâs reaction was that subject to the other banksâ attitude it was a request that might be sympatheticallyconsidered provided there had been successful performance after a further period of two years.  It was in the context of the seeminglysuccessful results, primarily it would seem in 1984, that in early 1985 the property portion of the Bankâs debt became interest-bearing.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  In mid-April 1985 reference was made in internal memos in the Bank to the possibility of selling the various properties owned byEsquire, including Li Fung House.  Shortly thereafter a valuation was obtained from a firm of valuers which put the value of Li FungHouse at $83 million with a rental income of $12 million per year.  That valuation was, no doubt, considered disappointing and theinternal memos within the Bank indicated that the agents who were appointed to dispose of the property considered that there shouldbe a target price of $120 million with the possibility of a price of $140 million being achieved should there be attractive financingattached to the sale.  At that time the Bankâs net cash exposure to Esquire was $337 million.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Esquireâs attitude can be gleaned from a letter written by Gurdas on 3 May 1985 in which he said that Li Fung House could be soldtogether with two other properties if a satisfactory price could be negotiated.  It was Esquireâs intention to move all its activitiesto Wing On Plaza.  That letter appears to have been primarily directed to explaining the downturn in Esquireâs business which hadcommenced in the first quarter of 1985.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  As already referred to, there was a meeting on 28 May 1985 between the remaining banks which supported Esquire, a representativefrom PMM and Khan.  The notes of the meeting, which were recorded by the Bankâs solicitor, record that not only were the firstquarter results for Esquire poor but because there was a deficit at the end of March which was unlikely to be made up until the endof June, the banks would not see any payments out of the escrow account until later in the year.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  By 3 July 1985 it was recorded that the sale price of $140 million for Li Fung House could not be reached and that a more realisticfigure might be $115 million with a âcommercially acceptable finance packageâ.  The rough calculations appear to be that evenif all the properties were sold there would be a shortfall of some $46 million.  Esquire was proposing that it should bear $17 millionby taking out a loan and that the Bank should absorb a loss of some $29 million which was described as âforgivenessâ.  The reasongiven at that stage was that Gurdas felt that the financing arrangements which had been finally put in place in respect of Li FungHouse had caused an excessively fast drain on Esquireâs capital.  There were other factors as well.  Apparently Gurdas felt thatthe interest charged at 2Â½% above prime was a penal rate and he felt aggrieved by not having sold Wing On Plaza because there hadbeen talk of the Bank wishing to use that building.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  There was an internal memo from the Manager of Credit Control dated 15 July 1985 which records that Esquireâs sales in June hadbeen down.  There had been sales of old stock which had improved the liquidity but because it was old stock it did not necessarilytranslate into profit.  Interestingly, there is a reference to a request by Esquire for forgiveness of part of the hardcore frozendebt.  That was considered by the writer of the memo to be out of the question.  He continued:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is paradoxical that we should support a company with on-going trading lines when we have written off-I do not believe our externalauditors would accept the resultant provision.  The answer must lie, I fear, in an equity position.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The reference to equity position was clearly a reference followed up on the following page where it is stated that the writerâsopinion was that in reality the only way the Bank would get its money back was for Esquire to go public.  In effect, the Bankâsdebt would be capitalised.  Suggestions of the banks taking an equity position also appeared in the notes of the meeting of bankrepresentatives on 29 March 1985.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Later that month, on 24 July 1985, Gurdas refers in a letter to the fact that Esquire had made a final offer of $135 million forthe sale of Li Fung House, which was a reduction of some $5 million on their original figure.  The letter went on to indicate thatEsquire would be agreeable to sell the property for $132 million provided that there were certain matters that were agreed to bythe Bank.  Those matters included the Bank waiving $18 million debt and also agreeing to increase the overdraft line from $35 millionto $60 million.  Interestingly, again, the letter records the fact that the stock held by Esquire had been reduced from $60 millionsome 15 months previously to a level of about $32 to $33 million.  On 8 August 1985 Esquire had written under the hand of Gurdasto the agent in charge of selling Li Fung House indicating that they would consider the sale of that property only at a reserve priceof not less than $135 million.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  It appears that there was some disquiet within the Bank as to the handling of the sale by the sales agent although there were indicationsin the correspondence from HS Property Management Company Ltd (âthe second defendantâ), who were also involved in marketing theproperty that difficulties arose from the requirement from Esquire that the marketing should be on a confidential basis.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  A memo from the Deputy Manager (Credit) Mongkok to the Assistant General Manager-Corporate Banking of 7 August 1985 records thaton 11 July 1985 $4 million was transferred from the Escrow Account to the working account as no profit was generated from the operationin the previous months.</p>    <p class="heading">Olinerâs first restructuring proposal</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  It was at about this stage that reference to Oliner first appears in the documentation.  Oliner is a US attorney who was apparentlyengaged by Esquire from time to time.  His first engagement by Esquire appears to have been in relation to a trademark dispute witha well-known magazine of the same name.  It appears that prior to Olinerâs appearance on the scene, Esquire was about to concedeto the magazineâs demands to cease using the name Esquire and this had been upon counselâs advice.  Oliner reversed the situation,it would seem by taking charge of the litigation in England and in the United States and by skilful negotiation.  As a result Esquirewas able to keep its own name.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In a memo of 18 July 1985 from the Deputy Manager (Credit) Mongkok reference is made to a charge being made by Oliner of some US$200,000in relation to his work in relation to negotiating with the other banks.  In a memo of 16 August from the Manager Corporate Bankingto the Assistant General Manager Corporate Banking reference is made to Olinerâs past success in relation to the trademark matterand to some other negotiations in relation to a restructuring exercise, which appear to be unconnected to Esquire.  It is pointedout that Olinerâs fees were US$50,000 in respect of the trademark dispute and that after the Bank had advised Gurdas to engageOlinerâs services, explaining that any proposals had to come from Esquire to its bankers, a further fee had been negotiated betweenOliner and Gurdas of US$75,000.  The suggestion that the fee had been US$200,000 was inaccurate.  This was in the context of Esquirenot having made a profit and the turnover being on average 25% below forecast and 5% below break even.  Reference is also made toGurdasâs inability to match his sales program to his purchasing policy with a consequent buildup of non-selling inventory and hisgeneral lack of sound financial and inventory management as a backup to the âone man bandâ that was said to still exist to someextent.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In a memo dated 23 August 1985 from the Deputy Manager (Credit) Mongkok to the Manager Credit Control Main Office, the net cashexposure of the Bank to the Esquire Group was put at $434 million.  At the same time Oliner wrote from New York to the Bank settingout Esquireâs proposals for restructuring.  In brief they were that after a period of seven years all but $7.85 million would havebeen paid off and that the Bank would be expected to waive that remaining amount.  Central to the proposal was that the propertieslocated in Minden Avenue, Winner Godown and Li Fung House would be sold at the earliest possible date at prices which had previouslybeen discussed and agreed.  In respect of Li Fung House the price was $135 million.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  That was followed by a memo from the Assistant General Manager Credit Control dated 31 August 1985 sent to the Manager CorporateBanking of the Bank.  The memo commences by saying that it is a summary of the recent discussions which had been held with the managementof Esquire and Oliner who had been retained by Esquire to assist in negotiating a long-term restructuring. </p>    <p class="heading">The transfer from the escrow account</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Importantly for the purposes of this case reference is made to the fact that Esquire had not made a profit for several months butthat $200,000 per day had been debited from their account.  That sum had been estimated to be Esquireâs profit but in view of thefact that it was not making a profit the balance would have to be returned.  Part of the problem appears to have arisen from thefact that there had been no write down in the value of the inventory and that as a result of the reduction in the inventory from$70 million to about $32 million there had been a loss which had to be recorded in the accounts.  The memo states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is suggested that HK$11M is refunded to the company to free up their lines and that repayment of this ârefundâ takes priorityover any future disbursements from future profits.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The memo alludes to the problem of excessive inventory, stating that if the Bank was to continue to support Esquire the key to profitabilitywas that inventory over 6 months old should not be allowed to build up.  Reference was also made in this memo to the Bankâs positionthat if Esquire was to continue to retain premises in Wing On Plaza it should pay market rent, which no doubt would go to reducethe amount of the property of the loan.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  There was also a memo dated 31 August from the Manager Corporate Banking to the District Manager Mongkok instructing that the retainedprofits of $15,585,588 for 1989 should be applied to the loans against Imports.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In a further note dated 11 September 1985 from the Assistant Manager Credit Control to the Manager Credit Control reference is againmade to the overstatement of the profits in the opening paragraph which states:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOur recent discussions with District Manager Mongkok, representatives of the company and Arthur Young indicate that a decisionis required on whether we intend to support this Group or not.  If we are going to support the company requires that we will reimbursethem with HKD10.0M representing the overstatement of profits earned in 1984 and subsequently deducted from their facilities throughthe Escrow Account.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  The losses incurred by Esquire were put at $10.9 million.  It will be noted that PMM had been removed in 1985 from their positionand replaced by Arthur Young because, apparently, the cash generated by the Esquire Group had been substantially over stated.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  The memo indicates what, perhaps, might be regarded as a degree of dissatisfaction.  Gurdas and Arjanâs expenses were put at runningat $450,000 per month which included not only their salary but also rent and utilities payments, presumably on their behalf, lifeassurance payments of $200,000 per month and $100,000 per month entertainment expenses.  In addition reference is made to the factthat Gurdas had diluted his shareholding in the âIndian companiesâ but that there had been no repayment of intercompany debt.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  At around this time Gurdas was continuing to attribute the losses to the inability of Esquire to extend its trading lines of credit. An example of this were the explanations contained in his letter of 11 October 1985 to the Mongkok office of the Bank.  That letterreported on the management accounts for Esquire in the 11 months up to August 1985.  What is quite clear from the documentation isthat the memo of 11 September 1985 followed instructions from the Assistant General Manager Corporate Banking to the District ManagerMongkok of 4 September in which it was said that the escrow account should be discontinued for the time being and the credit balancesreversed to the Esquire current account and that the credit balances in the â003â account should also be transferred to the currentaccount. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  The upshot was that of some $24 million which had been transferred into escrow in anticipation of profits being made but which werenot made during 1984, $8 million had been paid to the other banks leaving the Bankâs share of $15.58 million in the escrow account. This had not been transferred to the hardcore frozen debt account to reduce the hardcore debt and, as a result of the various instructionsgiven, the sum of $15,585,588.04 million was transferred on 2 October 1985 from the escrow account to the working account and isshown in the bank statements of both accounts.  No doubt Esquire must have received those bank statements at the time.  The net resultof this was recorded in an internal memo of the Bank dated 25 November 1985.  Later, when in letters of 15 and 18 October 1986 Esquireraised the query as to what had happened to the $15.58 million and why the hardcore frozen debt had not been reduced by that amount,it took the Bank a few days to retrace the steps and work the matter out.  The result was concisely stated in the Bankâs internalmemo of 3 November 1986: that money never had been transferred to reduce hardcore debt and, it would seem, for sound reasons.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  It may also be observed that the memo of 4 September gave instructions to write off the interest in the suspense account as thescheme did not provide for interest to be collected on hardcore debt.  Earlier memos of 29 and 31 August from the Manager CorporateBanking had put the date of the restructuring agreement coming into effect on 1 January 1984.</p>    <p class="heading">Further steps towards the sale of Li Fung House</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  Meanwhile efforts to sell Li Fung House were unsuccessful.  It appears from the correspondence that the only potential buyer wasprepared to offer no more than $128 million which was considered too low, particularly as the buyer required substantial financingtogether with delayed repayment terms.  Despite that, in letters in the second half of November 1985 Gurdas referred to the propertyhaving been sold for $128 million and indeed in the later letter expressed his thanks to the Bank for their âprodigiousâ effortsin selling the property.  This sale, clearly, had not happened, but it is indicative that at that time Gurdas was content that theproperty might be sold at that price.</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  In January 1986 the Bank agreed with Esquire that Li Fung House and Wing On Centre would not be sold during 1986 and that the loanson these properties would be charged at 2% below the best lending rate.  The letter of 25 January 1986 recording that went on tosay that the Bank had agreed to this course in order that Esquire and the Bank should benefit from any appreciation in value of theproperties.  The final paragraph in relation to that stated:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is clearly agreed by both the Bank and by the Esquire Group that if an improved offer for either Li Fung House or your WingOn Centre property is received that you will negotiate in good faith for the sale of these properties.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a>  The response from Esquire four days later requested that if the interest rate were to go up more than 2% from the then prime ratethe matter would be reviewed as to the proportions between interest and principal from rental income.  (The best lending rate roseon 1 April 1986 from 7% to 8%)  As regards the sale of Li Fung House it was said that if any better offer materialised that had tobe subject to a satisfactory sale and lease back of the floors occupied by Esquire.</p>    <p><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a>  Esquireâs financial position did not appear to improve during the course of 1986.  A memo from the Assistant Manager Credit Controlto the Manager Credit Control of 27 May 1986 complains of continuing problems with inventory holdings and also that receivables hadnot been collected on a timely basis.  The memo goes on:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âGurdas is not devoting himself to his business.  Travelling expenditure in April was more than double the monthly average.  Gurdasis attempting to introduce Matsushita to the Indian Government.  This is no benefit to Esquire in the short term and the longer termadvantages are not clear.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  The memo shows that from October 1985 to April 1986 profit had been generated in only two months and the profits in those monthswere significantly lower than the losses in other months.</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  In minutes of a meeting on 30 September 1986 between Ratnam and the Account Manager Credit Control, Ratnam is recorded as inquiringif the Bank was willing to sell Li Fung House.  The minute records that he was advised that the Bank was not willing to do so untilthe property was fully let and then only after major marketing.  Although Ratnam commented on other parts of the minute in a letterdated 3 October 1986 he made no comment as to the entry in respect of Li Fung House.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Shortly thereafter Gurdas was informed by the Bank that $40 million had been transferred from the property account to the frozenhardcore debt account.  The effect of this was that $40 million which would otherwise have been interest bearing in the propertyaccount became non-interest bearing.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Gurdas wrote again to the Bank on 10 October 1986 in relation to Wing On Plaza and in that letter reiterated the agreement whichhad been reached that there would be no sale of Li Fung House during 1986 in order that both the Bank and Esquire could benefit fromany capital appreciation but that Esquire had also agreed that if genuine offers were received in 1986 they would be considered. The second page of the letter commenced with a request that the Bank should grant Esquire âsizeable reliefâ in respect of itsdebts. </p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  As already noted, shortly thereafter on 15 and 18 October 1986 Esquire wrote to the Bank raising queries as to the amounts owingon the hardcore debt.  The first letter, signed by Gurdas, raised the matter in general terms.  The second letter, signed by Ratnam,was more specific.  One query was in respect of interest which had been charged between 13 September 1983 and 31 December 1983. During that period interest should not have been charged on the hardcore frozen debt.  Ratnamâs letter was clear as to what interesthad been charged and what had been credited back.  The other query related to the amount which had been in the escrow account putin the letter at âabout $15.5/16Mâ.  It was suggested in Esquireâs letters that that money should have reduced the hardcorefrozen debt but that had not been done.  Given that Ratnam was a chartered accountant with considerable experience in the commercialfield, it would not have been unreasonable if Esquireâs bank account statements had been checked prior to making that enquiry butthe nature of the enquiry would indicate that had not happened. </p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  In a meeting with Gurdas on 28 October 1986, the minutes of which were signed by the Account Manager Credit Control, the matterof interest was recorded in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHSBC advised that we were still trying to reconcile the problem but it looked as if Esquire was correct about the $13 M interestcharge from Sept-Dec 83.  In such case HSBC intended to offset this against the Bank of America assigned debt.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>In respect of the escrow payments the Bank was still looking into the matter.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  In relation to the Bank of America debt Esquire had written to the Bank four days earlier stating that they had made a request atthe time of the assignment that the benefit should be passed to Esquire âwhich to our belief had been agreed in principle.â That statement as to Esquireâs belief hardly accords with the letter referred to in paragraph 19 above.  The Bankâs positionthat the benefit of the assignment of that debt would be for the Bank was stated clearly in a letter to Gurdasâs attention dated28 October 1986.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  On 30 October 1986 a further Inter-bank Agreement was signed between the remaining banks, obviously not including Bank of America. Indeed reference is made in the Restructuring Agreement signed on the same date, again between the banks, including the Bank, Esquire,Gurdas and Arjan, to the assignment of the Bank of America indebtedness to the Bank.  Also in clause 8 it was stated that in theevent of a full repayment of the Bankâs property portion the income or proceeds from the properties would be paid first in reductionof the Bankâs non-property portion and secondly paid into the escrow account and aggregated with the net income and distributedto the other banks.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  The sale of Li Fung House came up for discussion again on 25 November 1986 when T. R. Sommerfield was the Account Manager CreditControl.  Gurdas commenced by justifying what was referred to as a âWish Listâ which had been provided in anticipation of themeeting.  The first request was in respect of the properties that Esquire should be able to take the benefit of the rising marketrather than having them marketed straightaway.  Sommerfield is recorded as stating that the properties were âlegally, ethicallyand economicallyâ the Bankâs.  The notes of the meeting state clearly that Gurdas wanted to hold the properties whereas Sommerfieldstated that the Bank wished to sell.  Sommerfield also stated that it was a principle of the negotiation that the cash generatedby the sale would have to be used to reduce the outstanding amounts owed to the Bank and that the Bank would not subsidise the tradingoperation since the profits went to all the banks.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Three options were put forward by Sommerfield.  First that the Bank could enter into possession and sell the properties, secondlythat Gurdas could agree to a sale in exchange for some concessions on the money issues and thirdly that Gurdas could arrange a remortgageof the property with another bank.  Gurdas is recorded as saying that there was a fourth option namely to hold the property for afew months.  As will transpire, Gurdas succeeded in this respect.  As Sommerfield said in the course of his cross-examination:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHIS LORDSHIP: You acceded to his fourth option?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.    He asked for a few months and that is what he got.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">MR LEE:      Yes, there is no document that you told him, but effectively he got it.  Is that a fair summary?</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A.    Yes, we acceded to his request.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Q.    Good.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>(Transcript Day 15 p. 47)</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p>It is a fair comment that when it came to the judgment, the judge appears to have forgotten this.  Gurdas confirmed the accuracy ofthis note and the outcome of the meeting: see transcript day 9 pages 27 to 32.  This note also records Gurdas requesting that theBank forgive $30 million debt which was said to arise from the accounting errors identified in the correspondence referred to inparagraph 51 above.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  From a memo of 25 November 1986 from Sommerfield to the Manager Corporate Banking through the Assistant Manager Credit Control itemerges that it was thought there were good reasons to delay selling Li Fung House for a few months until after Chinese New Yearsince the period until then was normally a slack period and informal advice from 2 property companies suggested leaving the matteruntil after Chinese New Year.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  On 1 December 1986 Sommerfield sent a memo to the Deputy Manager Mongkok requesting a revised figure for the interest charged between13 September 1983 and the end of the year.  He also requested information about distributions from the escrow account in 1984 and1985 with details as to which account the various sums had been credited.  At the same time Gurdas wrote to the Bank of Credit andCommerce explaining the poor past results but being optimistic as to the future, partly on the basis of the fact that the Bank hadtransferred the sum of $40 million to the frozen account from the property account whereby the interest was reduced.  He also referredin that letter to the fact that the properties were valued at $170 million with a liability of $82 million.  He anticipated thatthe rental income would increase by 25% every three years and hence with the Bankâs property loan at 2% below prime there wouldbe a substantial reduction in the liability over the next five years.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  The second defendant gave a valuation of Li Fung House on 6 December 1986 and $135 million.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  On 15 December 1986 Sommerfield wrote to Esquire, addressing the letter for the attention of Ratnam but copying it to Gurdas, settingout various matters which arose from recent discussions.  Importantly there was a statement that the Bank would ask the second defendantto value all the properties which were mortgaged by Esquire to the Bank for sale and rental.  In cross-examination at day 9 page41 Gurdas agreed that he would have seen the letter and it would have indicated to him that the Bank was looking to value, amongstother things, Li Fung House, with a view to sale.  On that same day the Deputy Manager Mongkok sent a memo to the Account ManagerCredit Control dealing with the interest which had been charged from September to December 1983 and also the amounts which had beentransferred from the escrow account.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  Matters then moved forward to the end of February.  There was a letter dated 25 February 1987 from Gurdas to the Bank in which Gurdasexpounded on the comparatively good results which had been achieved and was optimistic for the future.  On that letter Pullen, whowas the Manager of Credit Control Department, wrote that he had lunch with Gurdas on 26 February 1987 and that Gurdas wanted forgivenessof debt whereas Pullen had said that the Bank wanted the property sold.  There was then the comment âSuggest this suitable situationfor Oliner to come up with deal.â</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  On that day the Bank sought a further valuation of the Esquire properties.  That was provided on 6 March 1987 and Li Fung Housewas valued at $157 million.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The history of the matter up to the meetings in March 1987 has been set out above in somewhat greater detail than otherwise wouldhave been the case in order to establish the context in which the meetings took place in March 1987.</p>    <p class="heading">The March meeting and the agreement to sell Li Fung House</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  The first meeting on 12 March 1987 took place on the morning of 12 March.  Present were Khan, Ratnam and Oliner on behalf of Esquireand Sommerfield and two others, including the Assistant Manager of Sommerfieldâs Department, on behalf of the Bank.  Sommerfieldâsnote of that meeting commences with Oliner stating that Esquire wished to come to a deal with the banks which allowed the companyto trade profitably and close the open-ended obligations of the current arrangement.  Implicit in that restructuring was the notionthat the property was critical to the companyâs image and provided the backbone to the balance sheet.</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  The note shows that it was Esquireâs position that the amounts owing to the Bank were $86 million in respect of property loans,$159 million in respect of hardcore debt (which included $8 million in respect of the Bank of America debt) and $125 million owedin respect of trading lines.  The Bankâs position was that the hardcore debt should be calculated at $201 million that was statedto be a basic principle within the parameter of which the Bank was willing to be flexible.  The discrepancy between the Bankâsfigures and the Esquire figures lay in the difference in respect of what has become to be known as the â$30 millionâ, namelythe interest charged between September and December 1983 and the $15.85 million transferred from escrow.  In addition the $13 milliondifference between the amount paid by the Bank in respect of the assignment of the Bank of America debt and the value of the debtwas added in.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  The difference in those amounts has come to be an important feature in this case, particularly the $30 million.  When questionedabout it in the course of evidence, Sommerfield referred to the claim in respect of interest as being a dumb negotiating tactic. That it clearly was.  The Bank had already indicated to Gurdas that Esquire was probably correct that interest should not have beencharged in that period and therefore should be reduced in the hardcore debt.  Not only was Esquireâs General Manager at the meetingbut Esquire was also represented at that meeting by, amongst others, another accountant namely Khan.  Olinerâs presence at themeeting was only explicable on the basis that Esquire wished to come to an overall final settlement with the Bank.  His only functionin relation to Esquire, apart from handling the trademark dispute, was to represent Esquire in negotiations with the various banks. The suggested claim by the Bank relating to the interest overcharge was, therefore, no more than, as Sommerfield said, a dumb negotiatingtactic.  As the history has demonstrated Esquire had consistently requested the Bank to write off or âforgiveâ large amounts,particularly when the subject of the sale of the property was discussed.  As will be dealt with below, the negotiations took placewith both sides knowing full well that whatever the calculation of the amount owing, the Bank would have to write off a very largesum if the restructuring were to come to an end. </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  The matter of the $15.85 million transferred from escrow was, rather different.  Here the Bank had indeed, at the relevant time,transferred monies, which seemingly should never have been put into the escrow account, back into the working account.  Those monieshad never been used to reduce the hardcore frozen debt and the Bank was clearly entitled to claim them.  The Bankâs representativesknew that, too, from the memo of 15 December 1986, which was in response to a request for confirmation of what was stated in thememo of 3 November 1986.  The facts relating to this transfer out of escrow were conceded by Ratnam in the course of his cross-examinationafter the documents had been shown to him: see transcript day 6 pages 111-115.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  It is not surprising that after the matter had been fully ventilated at the trial and the matter had been fully explained to thewitness the judge said, in the course of submissions on behalf of the Bank, on day 20 at transcript page 152:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âHIS LORDSHIP:  I have no problem so far as the $15 million with the escrow overstatement is concerned.  I think the bulk of thedocumentation shows either you are right or at least you are arguably right and that you could not possibly say that you did nothave a genuine belief that you are entitled to at least demand that sum.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">MR FOK:  Yes.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">HIS LORDSHIP:  I have greater difficulty with the BOA and the other $15 million.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  In this passage the judge was evidently not merely expressing a provisional view but was directing counsel to move on and addresshim on other issues.  I would simply add that reading the transcript of the argument in the court below gives the impression thateven Esquireâs counsel accepted the true position to be that the Bank had not taken this sum but had credited back to the workingaccount an amount which was considered should never have been in the escrow account.  In all those circumstances the judgeâs treatmentof this matter in his judgment, wherein he appears to hold it as an error, if not an act of dishonesty, on the part of the Bank tomake a claim in respect of the amount of $15.85 million transferred from the escrow account would appear to be another manifestationof delay in the production of a judgment leading to a failure of memory in respect of important matters culminating in a significanterror.</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The discussion then turned to the question of the sale of the properties.  Asked why the Bank wished to sell the properties, theBankâs position was that it had financed the holding of the properties during bad times and it wished to take advantage of therise in prices.  It was pointed out that the properties were only productive because the property loan was $82 million (no doubta reference to the fact that this was only because of the transfer of the $40 million) and that the interest on the loan was at 2%below best lending rate.  The meeting concluded with the suggestion that the Esquireâs team should refer back to Gurdas.  The meetingwas said to have ended amicably.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  There was a second meeting that day.  On this occasion Ratnam and Oliner were on their own and Khan was not there.  Similarly Sommerfieldwas there solely with the other account manager and the Assistant Manager was not present.  In Sommerfieldâs note of that meetingRatnam commenced by saying that Gurdas did not wish to sell the properties and Oliner asked whether the Bank would give the companytime to refinance the assets.  The reply on behalf the Bank was that the Bank was not prepared to do a restructuring which wouldrequire renegotiation in six monthâs time and that the Bank firmly believed that the time had come to sell the properties.  Therewas then a short break requested by Oliner and when the meeting resumed Ratnam confirmed that Gurdasâ instructions were very firm. The note then continued that in view of the irreconcilable differences on basic principles the recommendation to the Bank managementwould be one of the following namely making a demand on the company, entering into possession and subsequent sale of all or someof the properties or thirdly convening a bank meeting and calling the current scheme into default. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  The Bankâs representatives gave the Esquire party 24 hours to reply.  It was also noted that the Bankâs representatives statedthat they considered the market was right for sale.  The note further contained a reference to Gurdas having left Hong Kong for Europeat exactly the time he should have stayed.  Although a 24-hour deadline had been set, 20 minutes after the meeting concluded Ratnamand Oliner returned and asked Sommerfield to return.  They asked for a grace period until the following Monday as they were unsurewhether they could contact Gurdas in 24 hours.  Sommerfield replied that the demand would be issued the next day but no further actionwould be taken until the Monday.  The note concludes âThis arrangement gave the company time to contact G while we loaded our gun.â</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  A number of observations follow upon this.  In the first place there was a brief note of that meeting made by Ratnam.  Ratnamâsnote corresponds very closely to Sommerfieldâs note.  This is important because not only does it inspire confidence that Sommerfieldâsnote was accurate but the judge failed to take this into account when considering the evidence and in particular Sommerfieldâscredibility.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  The reference to Gurdas departing for Europe at a time when he should have remained was an observation made at that time.  It clearlycould not have been something thought up later by Sommerfield or anybody else in the Bank.  The history that has been set out above,admittedly extensively, demonstrates that Gurdas and those at Esquire must have been fully aware that the Bank would wish to sellthe properties, or at least some of them; the question of the sale of Li Fung House had been on the agenda for two years.  Therewas a history of Gurdas agreeing to the sale when the price of the property was very much lower.  Doubtless Gurdas and those at Esquirewere not so keen to sell the property once the Bank had relieved it of the necessity of paying interest on $40 million of the propertyloan and had reduced the amount of interest on the property loan to what could have been little more, if anything, than the costof funds to the Bank.  Furthermore, in view of the arrangement, retention of the property by Esquire could only inure to its benefitif the value of the property went up.  If the value of the property were to decline it would not cause harm to Esquire because therewas in any event a âblack-holeâ to which reference will be made below, specifically an amount of debt which Esquire would neverpay.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  From the Bankâs point of view the sale of the property at the current level was assumably a legitimate aim.  The Bank had consideredthat the property auctions at the end of the previous year had been âtop-ishâ.  There were other indications of that as well. Interest rates had come down in January 1987 but on 2 March 1987 there was an increase of best lending rate from 5% to 6%.  Indeed,interest rates rose rapidly through to October 1987 when they reached 8.5% best lending rate.  That was an event which happened shortlybefore the long remembered stock market crash of that month which precipitated not only a fall in the stock market but a fall ofthe property market as well.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  One other matter which emerges, again, from Ratnamâs note is that he recorded the position of the Bank being:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1)       Not prepared to wait for restructuring in six months time if E cannot arrange other refinance</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> 2)       Will have to ask senior management if HK should enter as mortgagee</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> 3)       To ask G againâ</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  Not only does this confirm Sommerfieldâs note but it also indicates that the threat was to call in the mortgage loan.  This wasalso demonstrated by the letter which Sommerfield drafted.  It was dated 18 March 1987 and signed by Sommerfield and it related simplyto the loan of $82,460,849.69.  That was said to be the amount owing on the property loan and the account number was given.  Theletter was so headed and the only demand in the letter related to the property loan.  In summary, therefore, it is quite clear that,as Sommerfield put at the end of his note to the Manager Corporate Banking: a request to advise whether he approved the issuanceof the demand and on Arjan personally for the property debt only, the threat was in respect of calling in the property loan.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Hence in reaching the conclusion which he did at paragraph 189 of his judgment that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe Bank did not confine itself only to a threat of cutting the trading line or making demand only on the Property loan.  The Bankrelied on the $201,000,000 Hardcore Frozen Debt net...â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>the judge overlooked two very significant pieces of contemporaneous written evidence.  Again, his finding cannot be supported.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  On 12 March the discussion had not been about the amount owing but had been as to whether Li Fung House, in particular, should besold.  It is clear that the Bank was approaching the matter on the basis that there was to be an overall final settlement which would,upon being worked out, conclude the restructuring by enabling Esquire to have a âcleanâ balance sheet.  There was no prospect,however, of Esquire ever being in a position of being able to pay all the money owing to the Bank.  It may be noted that in the originalproceedings brought by Esquire, which were struck out, the allegation was made that the threat by the Bank to persuade Esquire toagree to a sale was the threat to exercise its powers as a mortgagee.  It was not until the second set of proceeding that the allegationsof the threat presently relied upon emerged.  The threat pleaded in paragraph 11 of the reamended statement of claim was that theBank would leave the $30 million discrepancy uncorrected and pursue the Esquire Group for repayment of that sum and the Bank wouldliquidate the Esquire Group immediately.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><i>The telephone calls of 12 March 1987</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Matters moved fairly swiftly after that meeting and in the evening of 12 March 1987 Ratnam spoke to Gurdas, who was in Bombay. He said both in cross-examination and in re-examination that Gurdas agreed to sell the property and he relayed that to Sommerfield. There was then a telephone call from Gurdas to Sommerfield.  A note was made by Sommerfield on the following day, in which it issaid that apart from talking about a large number of irrelevant matters Gurdas had consented to the sale of the property if the Bankthought that that was in the best interests of Esquire.  Sommerfield records his reply as being that it was for the directors (ofEsquire) to decide that and that his overriding interest was the Bankâs shareholdersâ cash but that he also wished to give Gurdaslong-term peace of mind.  It is recorded that the conversation ended amicably.</p>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  Although it was said in Gurdasâs witness statement that Ratnam had said that the Bank would not rectify the matter of the interestovercharge in September to December 1983 and the transfer out of escrow, which two sums had come to be known collectively as the$30 million overcharge, in cross-examination Gurdas conceded that Ratnam had never mentioned a specific figure.  Indeed the upshotof his cross-examination was that he was unable to confirm that any figure had been mentioned.  At this point it should be mentionedthat much of Gurdasâ evidence, particularly in cross-examination, was unintelligible.  Again, as Ratnam made clear in the courseof re-examination if the Bank had indeed made a demand for repayment of the mortgage and called the scheme into default all the tradinglines of Esquire would have been cancelled.  That would have included the trading lines with other banks including the Bank of Creditand Commerce as well as the Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  There were two further meetings in the following week.  Sommerfield took notes at those meetings.  Ratnam, Oliner and Khan all attendedtogether with the Bankâs representatives.  It is clear that the purpose of the meetings was to discuss how the total indebtednessof Esquire would be handled and concluded.  The discussions appear to have centred on whether the future arrangement would last threeor five years, at the end of which all debt would be discharged, and as to how much each month Esquire would pay.  One thing thatmay be noted is that there was to be a set amount to be repaid over and above which Esquire, or Gurdas, would retain the profits. The other matter which emerges is that Esquire was offering total repayments of some $31.2 million whereas the Bank was seekingrepayments of $48 million.  The difference meant that at the end of the day, having discounted the $30 million which Esquire contested,there would still on Esquireâs proposal be $33.8 million owing and on the Bankâs only $17 million.  The amount that would beleft owing was sometimes referred to as the âblack-holeâ.  As it transpired in the memo prepared by Sommerfield and submittedto the Manager Corporate Banking it was Esquireâs proposal, which would end with a $33.8 million debt, or black-hole, owing, whichwas put forward.</p>    <blockquote>        <p><i>The May 1987 agreement and sale of Li Fung House</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  This proposal received scrutiny from the top echelons of the Bank.  In the note it was explained that there would be a $30 millionupfront forgiveness and a final forgiveness of $33.8 million.  In respect of the $30 million upfront forgiveness this was treatedin a global fashion with the explanation that $15 million was interest overcharged to the company and that the other $15 millionconstituted principal repayments which the company claimed to have effected in 1984; the note stated that the Bankâs figures donot reflect the repayments and the records were incomplete.  The Chairman required an explanation as to why the interest paymentswere overcharged and, as to the principal repayments, where the money had gone and why the records did not reflect that.  The replyfrom the Assistant General Manager Corporate Banking explained that the interest overcharge arose because interest had originallybeen taken to book but was never reversed after the original scheme was implemented and that this matter had been used as a âgive-awayâin the recent negotiations.  As to the principal sums the note explained that the $15 million had originally been intended as a hardcorerepayment but was in fact credited back to the working capital accounts.  The note concluded with the statement âFrom the foregoing,you will see that the actual amount forgiven is HKD 15 million rather than HKD 30 million.â</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  Meanwhile matters were moving swiftly with regard to the sale.  On 21 March 1987 Gurdas wrote to the Bank, attention Sommerfield,expressing the view that Esquire considered that marketing Li Fung House at this stage would facilitate the overall exposure to theBank coming down and authorised the second defendant to market the property at the best prices that could be obtained.  The letterasked to be informed of the price before the sale.  A further valuation of Li Fung House was made and on 25 March 1987 the valuersput the value of the property at $161 million.  The valuation report went on to say that in view of the considerable demand for investmentproperty the price achieved on a sale in a âcompetitive situationâ might be in excess of the valuation.  On 27 March Sommerfieldwrote to Esquire setting out broad outlines for the future, urging that Esquire should improve the gross profit margins, sell offold inventory and should make efforts to collect overdue receivables.  The letter went on to refer to negotiations with the otherbanks which it was hoped would be concluded with a restructuring by the end of May.  The letter specifically mentioned that no mentionshould be made to any bank of the recent negotiations and should any bank query the sale of Li Fung House, Esquire should simplysay that advantage was being taken of the strong market.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  The second defendant provided proposals for marketing the property on 19 March 1987 and these proposals were accepted on 23 Marchsubject to bringing forward the marketing by one week from the dates given by the second defendant.  The marketing was to be by distributionof brochures to be prepared as well as by press advertising.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Esquire executed a power of attorney in favour of the Bank and the second defendant.  That power of attorney commenced with theparagraphs:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âEsquire (Electronics) Limited (the âCompanyâ) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally and by way of security of appoints (<i>the Bank and the second defendant</i>) (the âAttorneysâ) jointly and severally to be true and lawful attorneys of the Company for and on behalf of and in the nameof the Company or in the name of the Attorneys or either of them to do the following acts, deeds and things namely: --</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">1. To sell (whether by private contract, auction or other method whatsoever) all that property brief particulars of which are setout in the Schedule hereto (the âPropertyâ) upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the Attorneys or either of themshall think fit in their sole and absolute and unfettered discretion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  It was sought to be suggested in argument that the expression by way of security meant that the Bank had some security that Esquirewould do what it had had agreed to do, namely sell the property.  That argument is fanciful and unsustainable.  The Bank was themortgagee of the property and it could have exercised its powers as mortgagee to sell property.  But, as both the Bank and Esquirewere well aware, if the property were to be sold by the mortgagee it would be likely to cause potential purchasers to consider thatthere were difficulties which required a forced sale and that they could perhaps purchase the property at a lower price because ofthat.  Clearly the sale by an owner who is under no pressure to sell is far more likely to be advantageous than a forced sale ora sale by a mortgagee.  The other matter to be noted in respect of the Power of Attorney is that there was a requirement in the powerthat it was given for the purpose of the sale of the property.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  The first marketing report in respect of Li Fung House was dated 23 April 1987 and in it reference was made to the sales brochuresalready having been sent out to some parties and that the press advertising campaign was being carried out in accordance with a schedule. Copies of the advertisements in both English and Chinese newspapers were enclosed with the report.  It appeared that there had beenresponses from a number of parties including investors and estate agents.  Two offers had been received.  One of $130 million andthat was rejected.  The other was from a Canadian interest and had been an oral offer of $158 million, but that needed to be improved. There was to be a half page advertisement in the Hong Kong Property Journal on 1 May 1987 and the second stage in the advertisingcampaign was to commence on the date of the letter. </p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  Heads of agreement between the Bank and Esquire, Gurdas and Arjan were signed on 26 April 1987.  These provided in the first placethat Esquire would confirm and undertake to maintain the appointment of the second defendant as the sole and exclusive agent forthe sale of Li Fung House and that they agreed that the sale of the property at the best reasonable price was in the best interestsof Esquire and its group.  Paragraph 2.05 of the agreement provided that conditional upon the receipt by the Bank of the net proceedsof sale of Li Fung House, the Bank agreed that interest for the period of 13 September 1983 to 31 December 1983 namely $14,883,815.85should not be chargeable by the Bank and that a principal amount of $15,116,184.15 of the Bank Non Property Portion should be deemedwaived and released.  There was to be a new property loan of some $16 million and the balance of the Bankâs Lenderâs Portionwould be repayable as to $1.56 million on a quarterly basis.  That was to last for a period of five years until 30 June 1992 at whichpoint the remaining portion and any remaining balance of the Bankâs Lenderâs Portions should be waived and released.  This emphasisedthat the proposal put forward by Esquire was accepted: the total payment over the five-year period would be $31.2 million.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  Reverting to the question of the sale of the property the sale eventually took place to Bethlehem Management Ltd (âBethlehemâ). Important evidence in respect of this was not referred to by the judge in his judgment.  For the reasons already set out above,in view of the lapse of time between the hearing and the date of the judgment, no assumption can be made that the judge had takenit into account.  The evidence was in the form of an affirmation of Leung Ka Hung.  It was admitted into evidence at the trial withoutcross-examination, subject to the weight to be given to it.  Various facts are stated therein which would not seem to be subjectto assessment as to weight, rather they were either factually correct or incorrect.  Mr Leung had been the Deputy General Managerof Hang Mow Investment Co. Ltd, which was a subsidiary of Hang Chong Investment Ltd, which was ultimately sold in 1991 together withits subsidiary companies.  Mr Leung stated that in April 1987 he had noticed advertisements in various Chinese newspapers for thesale of Li Fung House.  He had been attracted to it and he had discussed the matter with a director of his company namely Mr Ho SinHang.  Mr Ho was then and was at the date of the action a director of Hang Seng Bank Limited.  He indicated that Hang Mow might beinterested in acquiring the property and asked Mr Leung to make inquiries and an appraisal.  Mr Leung considered that a fair pricefor the property would have been in the region of $160 million.  He exhibited a letter from the second defendant dated 29 April 1987in which a price indication of $175-185 million would be considered.  He recollected being told that the owner wanted a price inthe region of $185 million. </p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  The letter of 29 April refers to a letter from Hang Mow of 28 April but that apparently has not been located.  After discussionswith Mr Ho, Mr Leung was instructed to try and conclude negotiations with the second defendant with a view to acquiring the propertyfor $180 million; that he did in early May 1987.  He then instructed Hang Mowâs solicitors, Messrs. C.Y. Kwan &amp; Co, to writeto the vendorsâ solicitors setting out the terms whereon the property was to be purchased for $180 million.  Mr Ho decided thatthe appropriate company owned by members of the Ho family to purchase the property that was Bethlehem.  Another matter to which thejudge made no reference was that the Bank had absolutely no interest in Bethlehem.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  In the second marketing report provided by the second defendant dated 30 April 1987 it was stated that a meeting had been held withHang Mou Development Co. Ltd and it was understood that one of the directors of Hang Seng Bank was personally interested in the property. The letter gave the indication that there might be an acceptable offer.  It was also said that 150 additional copies of the salesbrochure would be prepared and forwarded to interested parties.  That letter constituting the report was copied to Ratnam.  The factsthat Ratnam had been sent a copy of this letter and that the letter referred to an acceptable offer being likely to come from a companyin which one of the directors was a director of Hang Seng Bank were, again, not referred to by the judge.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  In paragraph 65 of the judgment, the judge makes reference to the lack of any specific written offer to the second defendant.  Hesaid that no explanation was offered as to whether such document did exist.  In making that statement the judge appears to have forgottenthe affidavit of John Richard Arnold, the managing director of the second defendant.  His evidence was that a year after a transactionwas completed the documents would be boxed and sent to storage and the box marked with a date when the contents could be destroyedwhich would be 7 years from the date of the last document.  Hence the second defendant had no documents relating to the sale of LiFung House.  Furthermore, Hang Chong Investment Co. Ltd had been sold.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  There was a memo for the file of the Bank written by Sommerfield on 4 May 1987 in which he stated that he had authorised the seconddefendant to accept the offer of $180 million for Li Fung House.  Interestingly the memo makes no reference as to the identity ofthe purchaser.  The only matter of concern appears to have been simply the price and the memo deals with the consequential financialarrangements between the Bank and Esquire.  There is a letter dated the following day from C.Y. Kwan to the Bankâs solicitors. The letter was subject to contract and it set out the terms and conditions of the proposed sale of Li Fung House.  They were simple. The consideration was $180 million with a deposit of $36 million.  Apart from the fact that no commission was required to be paidto the second defendant, the remaining terms require no comment.  Enclosed with the letter was a cheque for $1 million which wasto be returned within 14 days if there were no formal sale and purchase agreement.  That was followed by letter of 8 May 1987 fromthe same solicitors in almost identical terms save that it was an open letter which stated that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe are instructed that our respective clients have now agreed and confirmed the sale and purchase of the above property on thefollowing terms and conditions.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  Great emphasis has been placed by the plaintiff that the letter of 8 May was copied to the General Manager of the Bank, who wasalso a director of the Hang Seng Bank in 1987, and to the Chairman of the Hang Seng Bank who also happened to be an adviser to theBoard of the Bank.  It was suggested in argument that this demonstrated that those two persons were involved in negotiating the saleof the property.  However, no questions were asked whether by way of interrogatories or otherwise either of the two persons involvedwho received a copies of the letter as to that nor as to why they should have received a copies of the letter.  They were not calledor subpoened to give evidence.  When giving evidence Mr Selway-Swift, who at the time had been the Assistant General Manager CorporateBanking said that he had no idea as to why the letter had been copied to those persons and that he had no idea as to the internalworkings of the firm of solicitors involved.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  Far from indicating that the two persons copied with C.Y. Kwanâs letter had been involved in the negotiations for the purchaseof the property by Bethlehem, the copying of the letter is consistent with Mr Ho Sin Hang, as a director of a public company drawingthe attention of senior persons on Boards of the Hang Seng Bank and the Bank to the fact that a company in which he had an interestwas purchasing a property being sold by the Bank as mortgagee.  Indeed, the evidence of Sommerfield was that the negotiations forthe sale were being conducted on his instructions by employees of the second defendant namely Phil Ashton and Simon Liu.  The evidenceof Leung was that Mr Ho had left it to Leung himself to conduct the negotiations.  Sommerfieldâs evidence was that prior to authorisingthe second defendant to accept an offer of $180 million for the property which is recorded in his memo dated 4 May 1987, he mighthave spoken to, perhaps, the Manager Corporate Banking and possibly the Assistant General Manager Corporate Banking and possiblythe person in charge of the property lending unit of the Bank.  When asked if the matter could have gone higher up in the hierarchyof the Bank his answer was</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âNo, no, I do not think a transaction really as straightforward as a property sale would have required us to go higher up in thiscase.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Selway-Swift, who was the Assistant General Manager Corporate Banking, said in evidence that he could not remember giving specificapproval for the authorisation although he was aware of the sale taking place.  Importantly he said that he considered he would havebeen in a position to approve the sale without the matter going further up in the hierarchy of the Bank : see day 18 page 117.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  Thus, quite the reverse from indicating some kind of illicit complicity between senior directors of the two banks, the copying ofthe letter gives the impression that Mr Ho, who was no doubt the person giving instructions, wanted to be perfectly open about whatwas being done.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  On the 15 May 1987 Gurdas and Arjan, as the directors of Esquire, passed a board resolution to sell the property to Bethlehem andto enter a tenancy agreement in respect of one of the shops on the ground floor.  The sale and purchase agreement was executed on16 May by Arjan on behalf of Esquire.  The assignment took place five days later on 21 May.  On 22 May exactly $30 million was creditedto the hardcore frozen account.  That was confirmed, several months later, in a letter of 29 December 1987 in which it was explainedthat the actual existing indebtedness to the bank was $28,399,380 and not $58,399,380 as stated in the scheme documentation whichwas about to be signed.  It was that letter which eventually, in 1992, apparently led Gurdas to consult leading counsel, Mr HenryLitton QC, and then contact the then General Manager of the Bank on the basis that counsel had advised Gurdas that the Bank owedGurdas an âexplanationâ.  Later, as recorded in the judgment below, Gurdas took the matter up with Government officials and politicians. The restructuring agreement had been extended in October 1987 to the end of that year.  By a further restructuring agreement betweenall the parties dated 1 January 1988, the quarterly repayments to all the banks together was and $1.59 million.  That compares witha figure of $2.55 million which had been the figure agreed in the heads of agreement of 26 April.  The payment to the Bank had correspondinglybeen reduced from $1.56 million to $771,000.  Evidently Esquireâs ability to ask for and succeed in obtaining further concessionswas not diminished after the April 1987 negotiations.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  When, in 1994, it became clear that proceedings were about to be commenced against the Bank and the second defendant, the Bank withdrewits facilities and demanded repayment.  That, of course, placed Esquire into difficulties.  The petition which resulted in the windingup of Esquire was not presented, as might be implied from paragraph 25 of the judgment below, by the Bank, but by two employees. Indeed on the hearing of the winding up petition the Bank took a neutral stance neither supporting nor opposing the petition.  Theliquidation did not take place until 1996, not as the judge suggested in paragraph 25 shortly after the demand for repayment.  Frankly,nothing could have been more natural than for the Bank to have withdrawn facilities.  If it had continued to finance Esquire withthe underlying debt still owing and partly interest free, it would have been financing litigation against itself.  That is somethingthat not even the most astute company directors could ever justify to a bankâs shareholders.</p>    <p class="heading">BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  The judge held that the Bank had been in breach of fiduciary duty in arranging for the sale of the property to Bethlehem.  It willbe noted that although the power of attorney had been executed it was not used.  The sale document to Bethlehem was executed by Esquirein the person of Gurdas and Arjan.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  This ground of complaint by the plaintiff is simply answered by the fact that the Bank had no further duties than that of a mortgageein selling the property.  The property was being sold because the Bank was threatening to exercise the powers that it had as a mortgagee. The Bank caused Esquire to execute the power of attorney in order to avoid the appearance of the sale being a distress sale.  Thatcourse was something that would benefit both the Bank and Esquire.  In the circumstances of a sale of a mortgagee the Bankâs dutywas to obtain the full price for the property.  See for example <i>Farrar v Farrars Limited</i> per Lindley LJ,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2040%20ChD%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 40 Ch.D. 395</a> at 411.  In view of the agreement between the parties recorded at the commencement of the 11<sup>th</sup> day of the trial there can be no question but that the sale price was the full price of the property at that date.  Even if therewere any doubt about it, comparison can be made between the price achieved, namely $180 million, and the valuation which had beengiven of $161 million and that corresponded very closely to the value which Leung had put on the property when it first came to hisattention.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  If there were any doubt about the extent of the Bankâs obligations and duties, it would be resolved by the terms of the powerof attorney.  The power of attorney was given as âsecurityâ.  That meant security for the money owing to the Bank.  The Bankwas given the power of attorney for the purpose of sale.  In respect of that it had the âsole and absolute and unfettered discretionâas to the terms and conditions upon which the property should be sold.  Adopting what was said by Mason J (as he then was) in <i>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%2d85%5d%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984-85] 156 CLR 41</a> at page 97 if a fiduciary relationship were to exist at all it would have to accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so thatit is consistent with it and conforms to it.  A fiduciary relationship cannot be superimposed upon a contract in such a way as toalter the operation which the contract was intended to have according to its true construction.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  I have no doubt that in this case the true construction of the arrangement between the Bank and Esquire which gave rise to the creationof the power of attorney was that the property would be sold at its full market value.  That was achieved.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  The judge summarised his finding in respect of this part of the case in paragraph 83 of the judgment way he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe core complaint in this case can be summarized in my view by one short statement, namely a senior partner has no business sellinghis principalâs property to his junior partner in a private sale.  The partners can be partners in a law firm or a business ora bank such as the Hang Seng Bank.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  The judge did not analyse in any detail how he arrived at the conclusion that the directors of Bethlehem or Hang Chong InvestmentLtd were âpartnersâ of the Bank.  Directors of a company are not partners.  They are in a very different position from partners. They may have to work together with their other directors but that is in the interests of the Company and not in their own personalinterests. </p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  There is no reason suggested in this case that the Bank would have wished to bestow any special benefit on either Bethlehem, HangChong Investment Ltd or the directors of the Hang Seng Bank who were also directors of Bethlehem.  Indeed, such a suggestion wouldbe unrealistic.  The property was being sold at the insistence of the Bank because the Bank wished to recover as much as possiblefrom the wreck of Esquire, knowing full well that at the end of the day in order for Esquire to have a clean balance there wouldstill be a deficit or âblack-holeâ.  There would thus be no incentive to the Bank to achieve a lower price for the sale of theproperty than the best price obtainable.</p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  In paragraph 24 of the judgment the judge referred to the Bank being a close associate of Bethlehem and in paragraph 25 he spokeof the close relationship between the Bank and Bethlehem.  This was simply not the case.  There was no evidence of any such closerelationship or association between the companies.  Furthermore, the 2 directors of Hang Seng Bank who were also directors of Bethlehem,had a miniscule share in the Hang Seng Bank and a mere 5 shares out of a total number of 300 issued shares in Bethlehem.  Ho SinHang had 44 shares.</p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  As was demonstrated in argument by Mr Jarvis QC on behalf of the Bank, any shareholding in Hang Seng Bank by those who had an interestin Hang Chong Investment Ltd or any of its subsidiaries including Bethlehem was minimal and, it would be noted, Hang Sang Bank wasa publicly quoted company.  Even if there were any fiduciary duty involved in the way the judge appeared to consider it arose, itis answered by subjecting everything that was done in the case to vigilant scrutiny, as was said by Lord Mackenzie in the case of<i>Henry Burrell v George Burrell and others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1915%20SC%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1915 SC 333.</a>  In that case a wife of one of the trustees had purchased shares belonging to a trust estate.  Lord Dundas had analysed what hadhappened on the basis that there had been no bargaining of any sort between the wife and the trustees, that the wife had acted onher own, had purchased the shares on her own initiative and not at the instigation or advice of her husband, that the lady involvedwas a capable businesswoman accustomed to managing her own ample means, that the payment had been made out of her own money and finallythat the price was an adequate and even a full one.  In those circumstances the court was unanimous in rejecting any allegation ofimpropriety or breach of trust.  Lord Mackenzie said that he was unable to imagine any case which could be stronger for sustainingthe transaction which the pursuer sought to challenge.</p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  In this case, as already pointed out, the judge overlooked the fact that Leung had become aware of the fact that the property wasfor sale independently of any connection between those having an interest in his employer and the Hang Sang Bank let alone the Bank. There is no question that Hang Chong Investment Ltd was a well-established property company and Bethlehem purchased the propertyfrom its own funds.  The price was the full price.  The only other factor remaining was as to whether there had been any bargainingwhich involved some underhand dealing between directors of the Hang Sang Bank and the Bank.  It was in this respect that the judgeattempted to find some collusion based upon the fact that C.Y. Kwanâs letter had been copied as referred to in paragraph 95 above. Observations in respect of that have already been made.  The suggestion that there had been any impropriety in that respect waswholly speculative, ignored significant evidence and, as has already been said above, commercially unrealistic.</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  In his letter of 8 August 1994 to the member of the Legislative Council, Gurdas indicated that his ârecent inquiriesâ had elicitedthe fact that the purchaser had as its shareholders persons who were directors of the Hang Seng Bank.  If the identity of the purchaserhad been of the slightest interest to Esquire or Gurdas or Arjan at the time of the sale inquiries, which would have been completedwithin an hour, would have revealed from records at the Companies Registry who the shareholders and directors of Bethlehem were. Furthermore as pointed out in paragraph 92 above the letter copied to Ratnam had indicated that a director of the Hang Seng Bankwas interested in the purchase of the property and if any doubt prevailed at the time that the correct price had not been obtainedor that Bethlehem was not connected with âHang Mou Development Co. Ltdâ referred to in that letter a simple inquiry would havesufficed.</p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  Some reliance was placed by the judge on his assessment that the sale had taken place too quickly.  The two reports by the seconddefendant show quite clearly that there had been wide dissemination of the fact that Li Fung House was for sale.  It may be thatthere were further brochures which could have been sent out but, given the advertisements and given the fact that contact had beenmade with a large number of parties who were considered possible recipients, there is no reason to suppose that any party that wasin a position to be able to afford a property such as Li Fung House would not have come to know of its existence on the market andmade approaches if it had any intention of purchasing the property.</p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  The major item for negotiation on the purchase of such a property is the matter of price.  Once a price has been offered by a potentialbuyer and a seller considers that it has achieved the maximum in the circumstances, it would be foolhardy for a seller to delay. Experience of cases that have come through this court shows that many property deals are arranged very quickly.  There was no evidenceto support the judgeâs conclusion that there was anything sinister about the speed at which the negotiations were concluded and,once concluded, there was no reason to delay the signing of the sale and purchase agreement and indeed complete the purchase.</p>    <p class="heading">ECONOMIC DURESS</p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  Before dealing with the issues of economic duress and undue influence, it should be observed that the trial judge took the unusualcourse of splitting the trial between what were termed remedies and reliefs from an assessment of whether there had been economicduress or undue influence.  Whereas it is quite normal that questions of quantum are separated from a trial on liability, the questionas to the existence of a remedy or a relief is fundamental to a cause of action.  Nothing in this judgment should be taken as indicatingthat on the facts of this case a cause of action would exist under the heading of economic duress or undue influence in respect ofa transaction to which the Bank was not a party.  The sale of the property, was effected by Esquire, as opposed to the Bank underthe power of attorney.  The allegations in this case relate to the sale of the property and not to the agreement between the Bank,Esquire, Gurdas and Arjan of 26 April 1987 which the plaintiff treats as a separate matter.  It is, however, for the purposes ofthis judgment unnecessary to decide the matter since there was, in my view, no economic duress nor undue influence.</p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  The judgeâs assessment of the witnesses appears to be more an assessment of their characters and from a point of view of amiabilityrather than credibility.  In respect of Sommerfield, for example he referred to him in paragraph 157 as being shrewd, intelligent,giving his evidence carefully, cleverly, calmly and well thought out.  None of these epithets would indicate that he was dishonestor that his evidence was unreliable.  The judge went on to say that he ranked Sommerfield amongst one of the most formidable witnessesthat he had encountered.  It is difficult to discern what is meant by formidable in those circumstances.  That is, usually, a descriptionused in relation to a well-prepared expert who is familiar with his subject.  The judge concludes paragraph 157 by saying that whereSommerfieldâs evidence conflicted with that of Gurdas or Ratnam he preferred the evidence of Esquireâs witnesses.  That catchallof a conclusion, most apt in other types of cases, for example of an accident where a judge needs to discern which of the witnessesdescribed the accident best, would appear to be inappropriate in this case.  This is particularly so in the instance already mentionedwhere Ratnam had given evidence both in cross-examination and in re-examination that the Gurdas had told him on the telephone conversationin the evening of 12 March 1987 that he agreed to a sale of the property.  When giving evidence on day 9, Gurdas said clearly thathe had not told Ratnam that he was willing to sell the building: see page 77 lines 22-25.  Not surprisingly the opening words ofparagraph 184 of the judgment record that Gurdas had told Ratnam that he agreed to sell.  Surprisingly the next sentence goes onto suggest that it was only at the end of the telephone conversation with Sommerfield that Gurdas confirmed to Sommerfield that hewas willing to sell âafter resistance failedâ.</p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  Given the fact that the judge found that Ratnam was a credible witness and that his evidence coincides with Sommerfieldâs noteof the telephone conversations, it seems a little difficult to understand how the judge could come to the conclusion that Gurdashad not already indicated that he was willing to agree to the sale of the property prior to his conversation with Sommerfield andthat his conversation with Sommerfield was on that basis.  What also has to be borne in mind is that much of Gurdasâ oral evidencewas incoherent and incomprehensible.  This courtâs attention has been drawn to a list of passages in the transcripts where Gurdasevidence was said to be incoherent or unintelligible.  It is not sufficient for the judge to say in paragraph 153 that Gurdas âcouldbe mistaken on the minor detail for example on the matter of the sequence of telephone calls that night of the 12<sup>th</sup> of March.â  What took place on 12 March 1987 forms the foundation of the plaintiffâs case.</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  As set out above, Esquireâs agreement to sell the property as part of the overall scheme of refinancing its debts was broughtabout because of the threat that should Esquire not agree to the sale of the property as part of the restructuring, the Bank wouldcall in the mortgage.  The Bank was perfectly entitled to call in the mortgage.  Argument was addressed to this court on the basisthat that it was illegal for it to have done so because it would have been in breach of the Bankâs agreement with the other banksin the initial restructuring agreement.  As already noted clauses 8 and 10 of the restructuring agreement make it quite clear thatthe Bank was entitled to sell the property as mortgagee without reference to the other banks.  The Bank could also have called inthe trading lines.</p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  What took place in 1987 had to be considered in the light of the Bank having waived by that stage some $100 million in interest. The judgeâs approach to the matter is highlighted in paragraph 185 of the judgment that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt is perfectly possible then Esquire would refuse to sell would require, if pressure of liquidation is applied, a forgivenessby the Bank of say $15 Million to $25 Million (say combination of front-end and back-end) from the $159 Million Hardcore frozen debt.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>That statement that the Bank should be prepared to forego such a substantial sum of money ignores the reality of the situation thatbanks are in business to lend money on the basis that it will be returned together with interest for the ultimate benefit of theirshareholders.  It might also be bourne in mind that the amount which the judge considered the Bank should easily write off, was largerthan a number of initial public offerings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange around that period.</p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  In reaching his conclusion that there had been economic duress the judge painted a picture that amounted to a conspiracy.  He drewadverse inferences against the Manager Corporate Banking, Diccon Pullen.  No allegation had been made against that gentleman in thepleadings and he was not called to give evidence.  The inferences drawn by the judge appear to be based solely upon some short handwrittennotes made by Pullen on memos.  Those notes do not show a conspiracy.  Worse still are the suggestions that the General Manager ofthe bank âallowed himself to be involved in the sale of the Property to a junior partner of the Bank which like his subordinateshe must have known was quite inappropriate.â  As regards Sommerfield no allegation of dishonesty put to him in the course of alengthy cross-examination.  The most that had been said was that it was put to him that it was unprofessional to fail to acknowledgethe mistake in relation to the interest charges and to apologise for it.  Sommerfield accepted that.  That does not show he was adishonest witness.</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  The crux of the plaintiffâs case in relation to economic to duress was that the Bank had refused to correct what was termed the$30 million overcharge error.  As already explained, that was not the subject of the conversations on 12 March 1987.  That was notthe reason why Esquire considered that it had to agree to the Bankâs demand to sell the property.  It was not the subject of thenegotiations that lead to the heads of agreement of 26 April 1987.  What was at issue there was how much Esquire would pay over theremaining period after the sale and before all sums still owing by Esquire were finally written off.  Any allegation of economicduress founded on such an alleged threat therefore fails at the first hurdle.  I would only add that it would seem that Esquireâscase in this regard was constructed five years after the event based upon the letter of 29 December 1987 which Gurdas wished to turnto his own advantage.  It cannot escape observation that prior to that there had been no complaint about the matter.  The complaintshad been that the Bank had required a sale of the property.</p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  It also has to be noted that Esquire was represented at the meetings on 12 March by, on one occasion, two accountants and, on theother occasion, a single accountant.  It can hardly be supposed that, together with Oliner, these persons would not have known thatthe interest charged from September to December 1983 had to be deducted.  If the Bank had indeed sought to exercise legal rightswhich included claiming that sum it would have failed unless, of course, the restructuring agreement had been called into default.</p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  The requirement of the Bank for the sale of the property supported, as it was, by a determination to exercise its powers as mortgagee,could not be said to have been illegitimate.  As already noted, the Bank had supported Esquire to a considerable extent.  It hadwaived interest amounting to $100 million.  On the calculations by the Bank holding the property in the future would only have beenof marginal benefit on a âNet Present Valueâ basis.  To hold on to the property would have risked a downturn in the market whichwas balanced against a possible 4% increase on the current âNet Present Valueâ of a sale of the property.  That was an unsatisfactoryrisk.  These calculations on the part of the Bank were not challenged.  It was for the mortgagee to decide when was an appropriatetime to sell the property.  It may well be, as the judge noted, that if the property had been held the matter might have been different. However, the property scene in Hong Kong has not been uninterruptedly positive.  If attempts had been made to sell the propertyin the period immediately following October 1987 there may have been great difficulties.  Similarly in the period following June1989, not to speak of the period following the Asian financial crisis which commenced in October 1997.</p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  The judge took exception to the statement in the memo of 18 April 1985 from the Manager Credit Control that Bank of America hadundertaken not to inform the other banks of the buy-out price in order that the buy-out could be represented to the other banks as$0.20 in the dollar.  Apart from the notice of the meeting of 28 May 1985 where it was stated that the Bank was still negotiatingwith Bank of America, there is no indication that there was, in fact, any misrepresentation to the other banks.  It is entirely understandablethat the Bank wished to keep the price at which it had purchased the Bank of America debt confidential.  It would have been an openinvitation to the other banks if it had been disclosed that there had been that the Bank had bought out Bank of America at $0.36in the dollar.  Whatever the ethics of being prepared to make a representation in this respect, it would seem that it would havelittle relevance to the allegation of economic duress and the judgeâs statement in paragraph 188 that âThe Courtâs duty insuch circumstances, is to ensure that no victim of such conduct will go away without remedyâ might be apposite if one of the otherbanks had complained about a misrepresentation but can hardly be apposite to an allegation of economic duress based on quite differentmatters by a party not affected by the misrepresentation.</p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  As already indicated, the Bank was fully entitled to claim the full sum of $21 million in respect of the Bank of American debt whichit had purchased.  It may well be that for its own purposes it had entered the amount paid for the debts in its own books at $8 millionand it may well be that it valued that debt at only $8 million.  Nevertheless the legal liability in respect of the debt was thefull $21 million and the documentation indicates that the Bank had made clear to Esquire at the time of the purchase and later thatit intended to regard the full amount as an amount of debt owing by Esquire, whether or not it could in practice recover that amount.</p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  The letter of 29 December 1987 which caused the difficulty of understanding when it was brought to the notice of leading counseldid not portray dishonesty on the part of the Bank.  The amount which had been transferred from the escrow account into the workingaccount was an amount which the Bank was perfectly entitled to claim.  Although arguments were raised in this court that Esquiremight have been misled into thinking it had more money than it actually did and that it had had to pay interest on the working accountamount, it does not detract from the position that the Bank never received that repayment.  Esquire had the benefit of the moneyand had the benefit of the money in order to trade.  In respect of the other $15 million, which was again a rounded off figure, theBank was entitled to claim the balance of the Bank of America debt and to balance one amount against the other.  There is no conceivablereason why if the Bank stepped into the shoes of the Bank of America as regards that bankâs debt Esquire, or indeed the other banks,should benefit from the fact that the Bank paid less for that debt and took on the risk of its being irrecoverable.</p>    <p class="heading">UNDUE INFLUENCE</p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  In this respect it would appear that the approach by the judge was that the Bank being the stronger party had an ascendancy overEsquire.</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  The judge accepted and emphasised that the relationship of banker and customer was not one which would ordinarily give rise to thepresumption of undue influence.  He went on to say that this was not a case where the presumption arose.  Quite apart from that,it is difficult to foresee how a corporation can be subject to undue influence.  Nevertheless, even if such a situation could arise,for example in the case where the banker was a trusted adviser, that situation does not exist in the present case.  This was a case,quite simply, of a mortgagor and borrower on the one hand and a mortgagee and the lender on the other.  The judge painted a pictureof Esquire being under the domination of the Bank and looking to it as its rescuer.  He graphically drew some analogy of a patientin intensive care and a doctor.  As already stated, the Bankâs primary duty was to its shareholders.  Its primary business wasto lend money and recover it with interest.  In so far as rescuing Esquire furthered the interests of the Bank and its shareholdersthen it was right for it to do so.  If rescuing Esquire were not in the best interests of the Bank and its shareholders it had nobusiness to do so.  It was perfectly entitled to change course at any time if it considered the circumstances warranted it.  In themeantime, if the Bank were to provide the finance and respite in order to create circumstances where Esquire might recover financially,it was proper for the Bank to insist on such supervision of Esquireâs business as the Bank thought necessary.</p>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  The plaintiffâs case based upon undue influence was unsustainable.</p>    <p class="heading">CONCLUSION</p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  For the reasons stated I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgment below and make an order <i>nisi</i> of costs in favour of the defendants here and below.  It is necessary, in view of the language used in the judgment in criticismof the Bank, which has been referred to in this court as hyperbole, to state that not only was it unwarranted and of a kind thatshould not find its way into any judgment but the Bankâs actions and those of its personnel in requiring the sale of the propertywere proper.  Indeed, it can be said that the Bank had been extraordinarily accommodating to Esquire and Gurdas.  Far from attractingcriticism the Bankâs actions in waiving interest and debt took their actions, at the very least, to the limit of what could bejustified on a commercial basis by the Bank.  The denigration of the Bankâs personnel up to the highest level was perverse.</p>    <p>Hon Stock JA:</p>    <p class="heading">A summary</p>    <p><a name="p130" class="para" id="p130">130.</a>  There were three heads of claim, each arising from the sale in May 1987 of Li Fung House, the property owned by Esquire but in respectof which the Bank was mortgagee.  The property was sold at the insistence of the Bank, and Esquire complained that it was forcedto agree to the sale of the property, and to execute a power of attorney in the Bankâs favour to effect the sale, as a result ofa threat that was illegitimate.  </p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  The threat pleaded was that unless Esquire agreed to the sale of the property, the Bank would insist on payment of Esquireâs debtsincluding â and here was the rub â a sum of $30 million which, so the case ran, it was known to the Bank was not in fact owing,failing which the Bank would take steps that would result in Esquireâs liquidation.  Esquireâs case was that there was no rightin the Bank to make a demand, that the demand made embraced a fraudulent misrepresentation, namely, that the $30 million was owing,and that in the circumstances the demand constituted an unlawful act but even if not unlawful it was unconscionable conduct, andthat that act or conduct was a significant cause of Esquireâs agreement to sell.  This assertion, that the Bank exerted illegitimatepressure to force Esquire to agree to the sale, founded two of the three heads of claim: a claim in economic duress, and anotherof actual undue influence.</p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  The third head of claim rested on the assertion that in effecting the sale, the Bank owed to Esquire certain fiduciary duties whichit breached.  It was pleaded that the fiduciary duties that were owed by the Bank to Esquire âincluded duties to act in the bestinterest of its principal and not to cause the Property to be sold in circumstances where there was an actual or possible conflictof interestâ¦ .â  The alleged breach was in selling to a company, Bethlehem, with whom it was said the Bank enjoyed a relationshipsufficiently close as to give rise to a real sensible possibility of conflict of interest and duty, and that the Bank had not demonstratedthe absence of such risk.  The pleadings also suggested a discrete breach of fiduciary duty in selling too soon but, as matters transpired,that suggestion was treated at trial and in the judgment as evidence of an unhealthy desire to favour Bethlehem.</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  The trial judge found in favour of Esquire on each of the three limbs of claim.  He was highly critical of the Bank, accepting thetestimony of Esquireâs witnesses and rejecting in strong terms that of the Bankâs witnesses.  He found that Bethlehem was a closeassociate of the Bank, that the sale was effected in over-hasty circumstances and that the Bank had breached the Bankâs duty oftotal loyalty, so he described it, to Esquire.  Esquire thus succeeded in its claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  In relation tothe claim based upon economic duress and undue influence, the judge found that the $30 million sum was deliberately mis-stated orinvented by the Bank as part of a scheme to force Esquire to agree to the sale and that âto defend its hopeless position of the$30 million overchargeâ (para. 146 judgment), the Bank further invented a $12 million debt arising from its buy-out of a debt owedby Esquire to the Bank of America, and that as a result of these tactics which culminated and manifested themselves in meetings andconversations on 12 March 1987, Esquire capitulated whereas otherwise it might not have done so.  This is the appeal from that judgment.</p>    <p class="heading">Delays, fact-finding, and appeals</p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  There is an advantage enjoyed by a trial judge, although its importance is sometimes overstated, in hearing and seeing witnessesand in gleaning the âfeelâ of a case as it develops.  These are advantages that are not enjoyed by an appellate court, and thatis why in relation to findings of primary fact appellate courts will not interfere with such findings unless it be demonstrated thatthe findings are plainly wrong.  That will be a task the more difficult to discharge when the conclusions of the trial judge arebased upon the credibility of witnesses, and it is as well, as Mr McGee QC reminded us, for an appellate tribunal invited to sucha course to recall the caution sounded by Lord Reid in <i>Benmax v Austin Motor Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%20AC%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] AC 370</a>, 375 that â[e]vidence may read well in print but may be rightly discounted by the trial judge or, on the other hand he may rightlyattach importance to evidence which reads badly in print.â  For the principles in general, see <i>Ting Kwok Keung v Tam Dick Yuen &amp; others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 336.</a></p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  In this case, the witnesses testified in February 2004.  The events about which they testified took place in 1985, 1986 and 1987. That is a gap of 17 years and more.  It is thatdelay, the delay between events and trial, a delay that does not lie at the trialjudgeâs door, that seems to me to be of particular significance in this case.  It is an unusually long gap, for which reason theaccuracy of the memory of witnesses was to be approached with especial caution.  Comparison with contemporaneous documentation isalways an aid to reliability of oral testimony, unless there is reason to believe that the documentation is contrived or materiallyincomplete; but where the passage of time between events and trial is as long as it was in the present case, and where there is sucha host of contemporaneous documentation, as there was in this case, the documentation must, I would have thought, assume a specialimportance.  The learned judge seems, however, in large part to have eschewed reliance upon the documentation.  He did so on thefooting (para. 151, judgment) that some of it was missing.  There was indeed some missing but there was little missing; there wassound explanation for what was missing; and there was a wealth of probative documentation, which we have seen, that was not missingand that was before the court below.  In the event, the judgeâs determination of the facts depended, it would seem, largely uponhis âoverall assessment of the character of the persons involved and in the light of such assessment [he made a] determinationof what truly happened.â  In this approach the judge, in my respectful opinion, fell into error.  I do not say that an assessmentof the character of a witness plays no part in the fact finding process, but it is a task that may sometimes be elusive even to thebest trained eye and ear, and I would venture to suggest that the truth, in so far as one is able to reach it or, as is sometimesthe case, to reach a version of it that is more likely to be correct than not, can best be tested by reference to contemporaneousdocumentation where it exists, or to its absence where one would expect it to have been created, as well as to inherent probabilities(though bearing in mind that there may be occasions where the truth may run against that particular grain) having regard to all thefacts that are known.  This is particularly so in a case such as the present, where events have taken place so long before trialand where there exists a mountain of contemporaneous documentation that can be used to point the way.  This is not to say that thedocumentation should have been treated as if it stood on its own, not to be explained, contradicted or supported by oral testimony. It is however to say that in this case the approach adopted to assessment of the facts placed far too much emphasis on characterimpression and too little upon what was suggested by the documentation and by the inherent probabilities in their historical context. That documentation, as well as conflicts within the evidence, inherent probabilities, and a study of how matters were originallypleaded and asserted in witness statements â these are the factors which in a trial such as this, so long removed from the timeof the events in question, were likely to be of particular use in assessing the facts; and I am satisfied that in this case theywere not adequately utilized and that they combine to drive one to conclusions quite different from those reached by the trial judge.</p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  The delay between trial and judgment is a different matter, although in this case its significance is that the delay may accountfor the aspect that I have highlighted, namely, far too great an emphasis upon an overall impression of character at the expenseof hard evidence, contradictions and probabilities.  This was a lengthy trial with much paper work and with difficult issues of lawand, in the event, the time taken to deliver judgment was, unfortunately, too long.  But that in itself is not an automatic passportto appellate success.  What may be the ramifications of excessive delay between trial and judgment is a matter that is inevitablycase sensitive, and it is with that caveat in mind â the caveat that underscores the importance of the circumstances of the particularcase and judgment â that citations from authorities are to be studied.  One such authority, to which our attention was drawn andto which reference is made at para. [6] of the judgment of the Vice-President, merits citation:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â[67] Appellate judges have long given, as a reason for appellate deference to the decision of a trial judge, the assessment ofthe appearance of witnesses as they give their testimony that is possible at trial and normally impossible for an appellate court. On the other hand, for almost as long, appellate judges have cautioned against the dangers of too readily drawing conclusions abouttruthfulness and reliability simply or mainly from the appearance of witnesses: <i>Fox v Percy</i> [(2003)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=214%20CLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">214 CLR 118</a> ] at 128-9... .  In any event, it is appropriate to have some doubt about the ability of judges, or anyone else, to tell truth fromfalsehood accurately on the basis of the appearance of witnesses.  Such considerations should encourage trial judges and appellatejudges to limit their reliance on the appearance of witnesses and to reach conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporarymaterials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events: <i>Fox v Percy</i> at CLR 129.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[68] Where there are relevant contemporaneous materials, such as file notes and correspondence, and there is significant delay betweenthe hearing of evidence and the giving of reasons for conclusions, being reasons that do not advert to the contemporaneous materialsand do not give specific reasoning for accepting or rejecting the evidence of particular witnesses, the conclusions reached shouldbe given careful scrutiny and consideration by an appellate court where the findings are challenged on appeal.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[69] Delay between the taking of evidence in the making of a decision is not, of itself, a ground of appeal, unless the judge couldno longer produce a proper judgment or parties are unable to obtain from the decision the benefit which they should: <i>cf Boodhoo v Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20WLR%201689" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 WLR 1689</a> at [11]-[12].  Nor does such delay of itself indicate that a trial has miscarried or that a verdict is in any manner unsafe.  However,where there is significant delay in giving judgment, it is incumbent upon an appellate court to look with special care at any findingof fact challenged on appeal.  In ordinary circumstances, where there is a conflict of evidence, the trial judge who has seen andheard the witnesses, has an advantage.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[70] That advantage includes seeing the oral and documentary evidence unfold in a coherent manner, which cannot be replicated on appeal:<i>State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20160%20ALR%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 160 ALR 588</a> at 619[90]; 73 AJLR 306 at 330 per Kirby J; <i>Bartlem Pty Ltd v Cox Industries ( Australia) Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%2055%20IPR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 55 IPR 449</a> at 484 [87].  That advantage will ordinarily prove decisive on appeal unless it can be shown that the trial judge failed to use ormisused such an advantage.  The mere fact of a long delay itself weakens the trial judge's advantage.  Thus, delay must be takeninto account when reviewing findings made by a trial judge after a significant delay from the time with the relevant evidence wasgiven.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">[71] In the normal course, statements made by a trial judge of a general assertive character can be accepted as encompassing a detailedconsideration of the evidence.  However, where there is significant delay, such statements should be treated with some reserve. After a significant delay, a more comprehensive statement of the relevant evidence than would normally be required should be providedby the trial judge in order to make manifest, to the parties and the public, that the delay has not affected the decision.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>Expectation Pty Ltd v PRD Realty Pty Ltd and Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282004%29%20209%20ALR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2004) 209 ALR 568</a> at 572.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  What it amounts to in this case is that there were two delays; the first, the very long delay of some 17 years between events andtrial, a delay outwith the judgeâs control; and the second, a delay between trial and judgment.  The first delay was such as torender of particular importance factors such as contemporaneous documentation and inherent probabilities, to which the trial judgepaid, in my respectful judgment, too little regard and, conversely, too much upon his assessment of character.  The relevance ofthe second delay is that it might have contributed to that approach.  In the event, there is not only an absence of sufficient evidentialfoundation for the core findings of fact, but the contemporaneous documentation, a consideration of the contradictions between thatand the oral evidence, and the inherent probabilities in their historical context, point clearly in the Bankâs favour on the threeissues at hand.</p>    <p class="heading">Fiduciary Duty</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  The relationship relied upon by Esquire as creating fiduciary duties on the part of the Bank is that of principal and agent, forit is correctly said that the power of attorney constituted the Bank an agent for Esquire in the sale of Li Fung House.  So muchis common ground.  That being so, what had to be determined by the trial judge was the scope of the agency in this particular case,the extent of the fiduciary duty thus engaged and whether the Bank breached it.</p>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  As to the scope of the agency and the duty imposed, the judge seems to have proceeded on the basis that the relationship was a generalfiduciary one, whereas in truth it was limited.  It was limited by the terms of the contract which created the duty and by the factthat on any view the Bank had its own legitimate interests to safeguard.  That being so, to proceed on the footing that the dutyowed by the Bank was â[no] less complete than would be [the duty] in any other case of an owner asking an agent to sell his propertyâ(see para. 75 Judgment) was to proceed on an inapt footing.  Generally speaking, â[t]he distinguishing characteristic of a fiduciaryrelationship is that its essence, or purpose, is to serve exclusively the interests of a person or group of persons; or, to put itnegatively, it is a relationship in which the parties are not each free to pursue their separate interests.  Thus, the essence ofa trust is that a trustee holds and deals with property in the interests of beneficiaries; the purpose of partnership is the conductof business in the joint interest of the partners; the agent acts for (in the interests of) the principal.â: Meagher Gummow &amp;Lehaneâs â<i>Equity. Doctrines &amp; Remedies</i>â 4<sup>th</sup> ed., p 158.  That was not the character of this relationship or of the contract under which the fiduciary relationship arose.  Thiswas a case in which it was accepted, as it had to be, that in selling the property, the Bank was doing so in the protection of itsown interest, which is not to say that it was free to pay no regard to those of the donor of the power of attorney.  But it is tosay that such fiduciary relationship as existed was a limited and not a general one.</p>    <p><a name="p140" class="para" id="p140">140.</a>  The point was made by Mason J, as he then was, in <i>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 156 CLR 41</a>, 102 that â[the ] rigorous standards appropriate to the trustee will not apply to a fiduciary who is permitted by contract to pursuehis interests in some respects.â  Under the contract in this case, namely, the power of attorney, Esquire conferred on the Bankunconditional authority, by way of security, to sell the property upon such terms as the Bank in its absolute discretion thoughtfit, and that was done in recognition of the fact that the sale was in the interests of the Bank as well as for the benefit of Esquire. Indeed the sale was at the behest of the Bank and the reality is that the relationship remained close to that of mortgagor and mortgageein that both sides recognized that it was to their mutual advantage that the sale be represented to the outside world as a sale bythe owner of the property rather than as a sale by a mortgagee.  This vital attribute of the historical and contractual relationshipbetween these parties may, ultimately, have been accorded insufficient recognition by the judge.  Having rejected, at para. 80 ofthe judgment, the suggestion âthat because the Bank was a mortgagee therefore the Bank was entitled to sell at any time of itschoosing and in any manner of its choosing as mortgagee,â he concluded that the Bank âfor its own good reasonâ required a saleunder a power of attorney so that it was selling âin its representative capacity as agent for Esquireâ¦â(para. 80) and thattherefore that the Bank owed âtotal loyaltyâto Esquire (para. 85).  The tenor of the approach is to assume a general fiduciaryduty, an approach that has insufficient regard to the terms of the contract which constituted the Bank an agent for the purpose ofsale as well as to the true factual matrix in which that contract was concluded.  The duty in this case was not to be categorizedby reference to agency as some general concept.  What was required before the nature of the fiduciary duty could be determined wasclose regard to the terms of the contract in this particular case as well as to the factual circumstances, the history, that gavebirth to that contract.  That is because: </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe categories of fiduciary relationships are infinitely varied and the duties of the fiduciary vary with the circumstances whichgenerate the relationship.  Fiduciary relationships range from the trustee to the errand boy, the celebrated example given by MoultonLJ in his judgment in <i>In re Coomber</i> [[1911]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Ch%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Ch 723]</a>, in which, after referring to the danger of trusting to verbal formulae, he pointed out that the nature of the curial interventionwhich is justifiable will vary from case to case.  In accordance with these comments it is now acknowledged generally that the scopeof the fiduciary duty must be moulded according to the nature of the relationship and the facts of the caseâ¦ . â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>per Mason J in <i>Hospital Products</i> above, page 102.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p141" class="para" id="p141">141.</a>  But it is not merely a question of the particular factual circumstances, for the terms of this power of attorney, this contract,were vital:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThat contractual and fiduciary relationships may co-exist between the same parties has never been doubted.  Indeed, the existenceof a basic contractual relationship has in many situations provided a foundation for the erection of the fiduciary relationship. In these situations it is the contractual foundation which is all important because it is the contract that regulates the basicrights and liabilities of the parties.  The fiduciary relationship, if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the termsof contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to, them.  The fiduciary relationship cannot be superimposed upon the contractin such a way as to alter the operation which the contract was intended to have according to its true construction.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>per Mason J in <i>Hospital Products</i>, above, page 97.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Much the same point was made by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 145</a>, 206:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe phrase âfiduciary dutiesâ is a dangerous one, giving rise to the mistaken assumption that all fiduciaries owe the sameduties in all circumstances.  That is not the case.  Although, so far as I am aware, every fiduciary is under a duty not to makea profit from his position (unless such profit is authorised), the fiduciary duties owed, for example, by an express trustee arenot the same as those owed by an agent.  Moreover, and more relevantly, the extent and nature of the fiduciary duties owed in anyparticular case fall to be determined by reference to any underlying contractual relationship between the parties.  Thus, in thecase of an agent employed under a contract, the scope of his fiduciary duties are determined by the terms of the underlying contract.â¦ The existence of a contract does not exclude the co-existence of concurrent fiduciary duties (indeed, the contract may well betheir source); the contract can and does modify the extent and nature of the general duty that would otherwise arise.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p142" class="para" id="p142">142.</a>  The terms of the contract in this case required the Bank to sell the property and to do so at its absolute discretion.  There wasthereby imposed no duty of consultation and certainly no duty to sell at a time of Esquireâs choosing or even preference.  Thatthe Bank was entitled and expected to have regard to its own interests is a fact that is inimical to the existence of the type ofgeneral fiduciary relationship imposed on an agent for the sale of property, but is not inimical to the existence of a limited fiduciaryduty.  So it was in the <i>Hospital Products</i> case that the capacity of the defendant âto make decisions and take action in some matters by reference to its own interests [was]inconsistent with the existence of a general fiduciary relationship.  However it does not exclude the existence of a more limitedfiduciary relationship, for it is well settled that a person may be a fiduciary in some activities but not in othersâ: see MasonJ at page 98.</p>    <p><a name="p143" class="para" id="p143">143.</a>  That the Bank had legitimate of interests of its own to protect in the sale of the property and that Esquire accepted that to bethe case is, in the context of the facts of this case, almost too obvious a proposition to have to state.  The entire history ofthe restructuring agreements, of the periodic granting of new facilities, of the many proposals for the sale of properties and ofthe periodic granting of relief to Esquire at Esquireâs request â indeed, the very nature of the commercial relationship betweenthis lending bank and its customer â was redolent of dual interests, each of which was legitimate.  The history was one in whichsale of this and other Esquire properties had been discussed â and in the case of a property at Wing On Plaza, agreed â as beingbeneficial to Esquire and to the Bank although on each occasion such discussions were accompanied by requests for forgiveness ofdebt.  The point was made by Mr Gurdas himself in a letter to the Bank dated 3 May 1985:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTaking a longer-term view we have initiated the following steps in order that the strains on both the Bank and Esquire are eased.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)       In view of the rising trend in the property market we plan to move our activities under one roof in Wing on Plaza wherewe have enough spaceâ¦.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b)        Li Fung House â¦  Winner Godown and Minden Houseâ¦ could all be sold if satisfactory price can be negotiated. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">This will then have the effect of considerably reducing the Bank's exposure to Esquire and Esquire's total liabilities and enablethe future cash generation to be utilised for its business rather than service the property loan.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"> Appeal bundle D pages 214-215</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The passage of time since that letter did not change the nature of the relationship or of the nature of the dual interests.  Whatchanged, as is demonstrated by a study of the history, is that whilst once Mr Gurdas was willing to sell, in March 1987 he was not.</p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  What then was the extent of the Bankâs duty to Esquire in the sale of the property?  Mr Jarvis QC submits that having regard tothe terms of the contract (the power of attorney) and the circumstances in which that contract came to be executed, the duty differednot from that owed by a mortgagee in the exercise of a power of sale, for this was in substance a sale at the insistence of a mortgageewith full control reposed in the agent, who was the mortgagee, to sell at its absolute discretion, whilst the form was a matter ofmutual convenience and benefit. If that be a correct analysis, then the duty is that described in <i>Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%201%20WLR%20997" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] 1 WLR 997</a>, 1005 [19]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ if the mortgagee does exercise the power of sale, he comes under a duty in equityâ¦ to the mortgagor â¦ to take reasonableprecautions to obtain âthe fairâ or âthe true marketâ value of or the "proper price" for the mortgaged property at the dateof the saleâ¦ .  The mortgagee is not entitled to act in a way which unfairly prejudices the mortgagor or by selling hastily ata knockdown price sufficient to pay off his debt: <i>Palk v Mortgage Services Funding plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20Ch%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] Ch 330</a>, 337-338 â¦ .  He must take proper care whether by fairly and properly exposing the property to the market or otherwise to obtainthe best price reasonably obtainable at the date of sale.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  It is accepted by the respondent on this appeal that the true market value test was satisfied.  Given the agreement of the partiesat trial that the price obtained was at current market value, it would have been difficult for Esquire to do other than make thatconcession.  But that concession is not necessarily the end of the matter even on the narrow nature of the fiduciary duty that theappellants would have this court derive from this contract in its factual context, for if it be shown that the mortgagor has actedin bad faith, the transaction might be avoided.  That is because, although it is true that a mortgagee does not act as trustee forthe mortgagor, he nonetheless âhas an obligation to act in good faith â¦ and not wilfully or recklessly to sacrifice the interestsof the mortgagorâ: see <i>Meagher Gummow &amp; Lehan</i>, above, at 2-150.  So if there is a sale by a mortgagee in suspicious circumstances, such as to a connected party, it is a transactionto which the court will have close regard to ensure its validity:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âSuch a sale may, for example, be fraudulent or at an undervalue or it may be made under circumstances which throw upon the purchasingcompany the burden of proving the validity of the transaction, and the company may be unable to prove it.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">A mortgagee with a power of sale, though often called a trustee, is in a very different position from a trustee for sale.  A mortgageeis under obligations to the mortgagor, but he has rights of his own which he is entitled to exercise adversely to the mortgagor. A trustee for sale has no business to place himself in such a position as to give rise to a conflict of interest and duty.  Butevery mortgage confers upon the mortgagee the right to realise his security and to find a purchaser if he can, and if in exerciseof his power he acts <i>bona fide</i> and takes reasonable precautions to obtain a proper price, the mortgagor has no redress, even although more might have been obtainedfor the property if the sale had been postponed â¦ â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>per Lindley L.J in <i>Farrar v Farrars Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2040%20Ch%20D%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 40 Ch D 395</a>, 410-411.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  The obligations of the mortgagee on sale are summarized in <i>Snellâs Equity</i> 31st ed., para 38-38:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA mortgagee is not a trustee of the power of sale.

Those normal principles require the court to ask whether the relationship between the Bank and Bethlehem was such as to give riseto a suspicion that there was a âreal sensible possibility of conflictâ (<i>Boardman v Phipps</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%202%20AC%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 2 AC 46</a> at 124C) between the Bankâs interests and such duty as it owed to Esquire to have regard also to Esquireâs interests; that suchconflict is not restricted to the servicing of a fiduciaryâs own pecuniary interests but embraces a further duty not to favoura third party (<i>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20Ch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] Ch 1</a>, 18; <i>Kao Lee &amp; Yip v Kao Hoi Yan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20HKLRD%20296" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 HKLRD 296</a>, at [46]) which I understand to mean not to place anyone âso connected with [the fiduciary] as to stand in a position more advantageousthan an ordinary purchaserâ: see <i>Ex parte Forder</i> (1881) 25 Sol. Journ. 720; that if such a relationship is shown, the transaction is to be subjected by the court to vigorous scrutinyas to the true nature of the transaction (<i>Burrell v Burrellâs Trustees</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1915%5d%20SC%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1915] SC 333</a>, at 338), the burden then resting on the agent to dispel the suspicion (<i>Robertson v Roberston</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1924%5d%20NZLR%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1924] NZLR 552</a> at 554).  How that burden might be discharged will depend on the circumstances of the case and in this regard a passage from thejudgment of Lord Dundas in <i>Burrell</i> above at page 337 merits citation, for the indicia there stated may with use be employed in the present case:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âI think it is clear enough upon the proof in each case that there was no bargaining of any sort between the wife and the trustees;that the wife made a purchase on her own initiative, and neither at the instigation nor under the advice of her husband; that bothladies were capable businesswomen accustomed to manage their own ample means; that payment was made in each case out of the wifeâsseparate estate; and that the price was an adequate, and even a full, one.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  In my judgment, the duties owed in the present case by the Bank were not to be viewed or assessed through the same prism as thatwhich views the duties of a mortagee upon sale, but the result in terms of duties owed is little different.  The prism is not quitethe same for the power of attorney came to be executed as part of a package, a package evidenced by heads of agreement reached beforethe execution of the power of attorney.  That package contemplated steps designed to assist not only the Bank but also Esquire inreducing its property indebtedness as well as its hardcore debt so as to help it on the way to eventual recovery.  To those intereststhe Bank had to have due regard and the fortunes of Esquire could not, as in the case of a forced mortgage sale, be a matter of indifferenceto the Bank, but in the light of the history and the terms agreed under the power of attorney as well as under the 1987 restructuringagreement, that due regard and the concomitant legitimate interests of the Bank were served once the Bank acted bona fide to obtaina fair price for the property.  That said, it matters not for practical purposes in this appeal, whether this narrower test is appliedor the wider duty for which Mr McGee contends, for in my judgment none of the duties said to have been breached was breached andthat is so assuming that the burden of so demonstrating is on the Bank.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  There is in this case no suggestion that by selling to Bethlehem the Bank benefitted financially, whether directly or indirectlyand no scenario is postulated in which such a benefit was conceivable.  All that is suggested is that the Bank was in law prohibitedfrom exercising its power so as to prefer anyone connected with the Bank but that it did so: it preferred Bethlehem, so that Bethlehemwas placed in a position better than that of an ordinary prospective purchaser, thereby resulting in a premature sale or a sale undera price that might otherwise have been achieved.  The evidence gainsays this.  The evidence of Mr Selway-Swift was that he took specificsteps to satisfy himself that the transaction was done at armâs length (transcript, day 17, page 65) and the evidence of Mr Leung,of particular significance but to which the judge has made no reference, was that interest by the Ho family in this property wasnot induced by any approach from the Bank other than the advertising approach which did not itself identify who was selling.  Inso far as cosy dealing is suggested by reference to the speed of the sale as well as by the content of the 8<sup>th</sup> May letter by Bethlehemâs solicitors and its copying to Mr Wrangham and to Mr Q W Lee â indication, it is said, of some contactbetween senior officers of the Bank and Bethlehem â the suggestion of cosy dealing is negated by Mr Leungâs description of themanner or circumstances in which Mr Ho Sin Hang came to the figure of $180 million. This evidence from Mr Leung is important forit was not challenged and was admitted as to contents. That is not to say that it could stand in the face of other evidence to undermineit if had there been such evidence of any force; but there was none.  The much discussed letter of 8<sup>th</sup> May 1987 and the fact of its copying is, against the testimony of Mr Leung, of scant weight, not least because the sinister implicationwhich it is said to carry can only be carried by a purely speculative route.</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  In the event, the evidence is that the offer and the purchase by Bethlehem was at its initiative in response, not to some personalprivate approach by someone at the Bank, but to a wide advertising campaign; that the price was proper and well above the level ofoffers received by any other offeror; that an assessment had been made by the management company that a higher offer from this offerorwas not likely; and that no sensible reason for rushing the sale to favour Bethlehem can be provided.  The judge does not providesuch a reason and his conclusion that this was a âgood dealâ for the Ho family (para. 85 judgment), seen by the Bank âto bea most beneficial deal for the Ho familyâ (para. 84), with its implication that it was somehow especially favourable, was, withrespect, a conclusion without an evidential â certainly without sufficient evidential â foundation. It may be that the basisfor the judgeâs comment was his emphasis on the fact that this was a bullish market so that the deal was favourable because hadthe vendors waited longer, the Hos or others would have had to pay more.  He said as much at paragraph 85 of the judgment where heremarked that by not selling when it did, the Bank risked âthe strong possibility of potential buyers from the second round ofmarketing making a higher bidâ¦ thereby either possibly depriving the Ho family of buying this good Property or at least forcingthe Ho family into paying a much higher priceâ¦ . â  He failed though to explain why the Bank would wish to act against its owninterest, and the line thus taken assumes that which the Bank was understandably not prepared to assume, which was that the marketâscontinued rise was inevitable.  In October 1986 Mr Pullen expressed the view that âHong Kong property prices are now âtoppishââ(Bundle D page 441) and in a paper dated 16 March 1987, Mr Sommerfield said (Bundle Epage 513) that: âHolding the property is ofonly marginal benefit on an NPV basis. At the same time we would be risking a market downturn.â  At the second meeting of 12 March(Bundle E page 518) the Bank asserted that âthe market was right for saleâ and in a manuscript note on the letter from Esquiredated 21 March 1987 authorising the sale, Mr Pullen wrote: âWell done â market looks strong right now for HKD160m [plus].â To these contemporaneous documents the trial judge has made no reference.  It could hardly be suggested that the opinions we theresee expressed were out of touch with commercial good sense or, worse, were fabricated with an eye on some conspiratorial deal tomake a demand for sale in order to favour the Ho family, a theory rejected by the judge himself at the closing stages of the trial(transcript, day 22, page 66).  One wonders what might have been said had the Bank rejected this cash offer, an offer well abovethe valuations that had been provided, well above offers that had been received, to await the bullâs continuing rise for the prospectof a better offer, only to find that by reason of some event or another, the market went down.  The fact is that at the time whenin 1997 the Bank finally determined upon a sale and determined to sell when the market was strong, and had in mind prices much lessthan the price ultimately achieved, Bethlehem had not surfaced as a prospective purchaser, and there is and was no warrant for thefinding that when the Bank did agree to sell to Bethlehem, it was doing so at an unpropitious time or in order to do Bethlehem orthe Hoâs some favour, or that the deal concluded was other than as an armsâ length transaction at a proper price.  </p>    <p><a name="p151" class="para" id="p151">151.</a>  I am satisfied that there was no breach of such fiduciary duty as was owed by the Bank to Esquire and that the judgeâs findingsin this regard cannot stand.</p>    <p class="heading">Economic Duress</p>    <p class="heading">(1) Law: Illegitimacy of pressure</p>    <p><a name="p152" class="para" id="p152">152.</a>  The nature of the creature that is economic duress gives rise to little issue as between the parties to this appeal, save only asto whether the causative act must be an unlawful act or may be a lawful one, an issue upon which there is much learning and whichit is not necessary for this court presently to determine.</p>    <p><a name="p153" class="para" id="p153">153.</a>  The reason that the law enables the weaker party to avoid a contract entered into under duress is that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦  his apparent consent was induced by pressure exercised upon him by that other party which the law does not regard as legitimate,with the consequence that the consent is treated in law as revocable unless approbated either expressly or by implication after theillegitimate pressure has ceased to operate on his mind.

Much commercial activity necessarilyinvolves pressure, often considerable and sometimes overwhelming, exercised by parties who find themselves in powerful bargainingpositions.  But that of itself is not illegitimate.  It was suggested by McHugh JA, as he then was, in <i>Crescendo Management Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2019%20NSWLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 19 NSWLR 40</a>, 46 that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPressure will be illegitimate if it consists of unlawful threats or amounts to unconscionable conduct.

It has been explained in the Australian courts byreference to a special disadvantage suffered by the weaker party of which the stronger party takes advantage and is discussed in<i>Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group v</i><i> Karam and Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282005%29%2064%20NSWLR%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2005) 64 NSWLR 149</a> at paragraphs [46] and [66].

For this he points to a comment by ProfessorBirks, for example, in âAn Introduction to the Law of Restitutionâ (1989) p177 (and approved by Steyn LJ, as he then was, in<i>CTN Cash and Carry Lt</i><i>d  v Gallaher Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%204%20All%20ER%20714" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 4 All ER 714</a> at 718) that were economic duress restricted to unlawful act duress, then âthose who devise outrageous but technically lawful meansof compulsion must always escape restitution. . ,âso that it âis tolerably clear that, at least where they can be confident ofa general consensus in favour of their evaluation, the courts are willing to apply a standard of impropriety rather than technicalunlawfulness.â  There is an attractive certainty of approach in the Australian formula, if I may call it that, which sits wellwith the policy that underlies the law of economic duress, and I am by no means convinced that such English authorities to whichwe have been taken for their refusal to exclude lawful act duress seek to steer a different course.  But it is not necessary to digfurther because whichever of the two suggested tests are applied, and whichever of the causative tests â to which I next brieflyturn â is applied, the facts are against the respondent both as to the nature of the pressure, and on the question of causation.</p>    <p class="heading">(2) Law: Causation</p>    <p><a name="p157" class="para" id="p157">157.</a>  In <i>Huyton SA v Cremer G.m.b.H. &amp; Co.</i> [1999] 1 Lloydâs Rep 620 Mance J, as he then was, comprehensively reviewed authority and academic learning directed at the issueof causation: whether all that had to be shown was that the illegitimate pressure must constitute âaâ reason for the weaker partyto have entered in the agreement now sought to be vitiated (the test applied by the majority in <i>Barton v Armstrong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20AC%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] AC 104)</a>, or (assuming there to be a difference, which I do not think there is) a âsignificant causeâ (<i>Dimskal Shipping Co SA v International Transport Workers Federation ( The Evia Luck)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20AC%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 AC 152)</a>; âa predominant causeâ (Professor Birks in An Introduction to the Law of Restitution (1985); or the âbut forâ test, whichMance J favoured.  Mr Jarvis urges the âbut forâ test upon us; Mr McGee, the test of significant cause.  It is unnecessary todetermine that issue for I am satisfied that on the facts as established by the evidence, none of those tests is satisfied. </p>    <p class="heading">(3) Analysis</p>    <p><a name="p158" class="para" id="p158">158.</a>  In respect of that part of its claim resting upon economic duress, it is the credibility of Esquireâs case that is its downfall. That credibility was most sensibly to be tested by reference to the long history that preceded the meetings of March 1987, especiallythe history of proposals and agreements to sell the property and by reference most particularly to the contemporaneous documentsand to inherent probabilities.  The judge was, however, sceptical about the value of the documentation and instead relied heavilyupon an assessment of character as it emerged primarily from impressions conveyed in the course of oral testimony.  The danger ofthat approach especially in a case where the events were so stale and where there was so much contemporaneous documentation is afactor to which I have earlier alluded in some detail.</p>    <p><a name="p159" class="para" id="p159">159.</a>  The essence of Esquireâs case under the economic duress aspect of its action was the suggested $30 million overcharge.  That ishow the judge put it at para. 136 of his judgment, that â[the] pressure/threat was that the Bank insistedâ¦ that Esquire was owing$30 million overchargeâ¦ and threatened that [the] Bank would make demand including this $30 million overcharge and the Bank wouldliquidate/or finish of Esquire as [a] result.â  He emphasised at paragraph 137 that: âOn Esquireâs claim of economic duress,this court is only concerned with the $30 million overcharge threat and not with the BA extra debt threat or the Arjan home threat.â</p>    <p><a name="p160" class="para" id="p160">160.</a>  The suggested overcharge of $30 million is overstated.  There never was a $30 million overcharge.  Nor was it ever conceded by theBank that there was.  The movement of the sum back from the Escrow account to provide trading funds, rather than to reduce the hardcoredebt, was a response to Esquireâs expressed concern about the shortage of trading funds.  There was nothing underhand about that,nor has it been suggested that there was.  All that had been said by March 1987 was that Esquireâs suggestion that they shouldhave been credited with that $15 million would be investigated.  In the event the money was not owing to Esquire.  Similarly in relationto the suggested Bank of America âextraâ debt, with the implication that the Bank was making a demand for a sum not due or thathad been waived, the implication is ill-founded.  The Bank had purchased the full debt and it was the full debt for which Esquirewas liable.  With an experienced businessman at its helm and with the services of a chartered accountant as well as of a lawyer,Esquire must have known full well that that was the case and that waiver was a matter at the discretion of the Bank.  To say, asdid the judge at para 146 of the judgment, that âthe BA Extra Debt of $12 million was an invention created by the Bank to defendthe hopeless position of the $30 million overchargeâ was not accurate, not least because the $12 million was no invention and theovercharge was not $30 million but rather the $15 million interest overcharge.  In the same vein the judge talked, at para 181, ofa road map which âinvolved the creation of a fictional $42 million ($30 million overcharge plus $12 million BA Extra Debt), a fictional$30 million ($30 million overcharge) a fictional $15 million (Interest overcharge)â. Yet the only error was the error as to interest. The Bank had in October 1986 acknowledged that Esquire was probably correct in its assertion about this overcharge (Bundle D page435) and whilst it does not stand to the Bankâs credit that it allowed that sum to be included in its starting figure of debt dueas if the matter were not resolved, the truth of the matter is that everyone knew what the factual position was in relation to thatsum.  The Bank was hiding nothing in that regard.  It could hardly do so, even had it wished.  Mr Oliner, the lawyer for Esquire,knew full well the terms of the 1985 restructuring agreement, including the waiver of interest for the last quarter of 1983, andhe was present throughout the 1987 negotiations.  There was a chartered accountant engaged by Esquire who knew and could show thatthe sum was not due, and it is in my judgment quite unrealistic to suggest that Esquire buckled to a demand to sell its flagshipproperty because of a demand â assuming that what happened amounted to a demand â for payment of $15 million dollars that everyoneknew was not owed, was not truly at issue, and could at the drop of a hat be shown to be not due.  Had it been truly at issue onewould have seen that reflected either in correspondence or in notes of the March meetings.  The suggestion that was made that thecompany was so in thrall of the Bank, so dependant on it that it dared not complain is also, with respect, unrealistic and sits illat ease with the nature and professionalism of the people in charge at Esquire or with history; and by this reference to history,I mean that the company was ready to assert itself, albeit politely, when it thought it right to do so (see, for example, its complaintto the Bank in October 1985: Bundle F page 1089).  Inherent probability, the professionalism of the persons present, the ultimateissue at stake, all suggest that had this overcharge been a true and significant issue, had it really been considered by Esquireto be a serious demand that the Bank was intent on pursuing, Esquire would have made a vehement protest about it.  Yet none is evidentin the documentation whether in March, when Mr Gurdas is said to have been driven to surrender by the very point, or in April in the weeks before the signing of the powerof attorney that was said be the result of this surrender or later.  The reasonable conclusion is that that was because it was nevera true issue. </p>    <p><a name="p161" class="para" id="p161">161.</a>  It is instructive to see how Esquireâs case was first framed.  In its Statement of Claim dated 3 November 1994, the assertionwas that on each occasion when Esquire raised the question of the suggested $30 million overcharge, the Bank threatened Esquire withliquidation proceedings âif such question was repeatedâ, an inherently unlikely contention if ever there was one, but in anyevent one that was not maintained by Esquire.  This was an assertion that went to the central issue in the case and its improbabilityand its abandonment are matters, I would have thought, of some import.  Then there is a further assertion in this pleading that MrSommerfield told Mr Gurdas that if he, Gurdas, did not return from Bombay to sign a power of attorney, the Bank would enter the property,another important assertion that finds no echo in the evidence.</p>    <p><a name="p162" class="para" id="p162">162.</a>  It is instructive also to see how, in his witness statement dated 12 March 2001, Mr Gurdas couched his reluctance to sell the property:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â74.      Of all the properties, Li Fung House was regarded as the Esquire Companiesâ flagship property.  Indeed the ownershipof this property had a substantial commercial impact.  To me, the existence of such a flagship property was a symbol of Esquireâsstature in the business community which gave its trading partners and customers confidence in their dealings with Esquire, particularlywith trade creditors who would not otherwise have extended the considerably favourable credit terms they did.  I believed at allmaterial times, and still do today, that the sale of Li Fung House was evidence to Esquire's customers and trading partners thatEsquire was unable to repay its debts.  The irony is that Esquire was in early 1987 steadily earning profits and improving its chancesof repaying its debts to its creditors banks. In fact, after the sale of Li Fung House, Esquire's customers and trading partnersdid become more wary of doing business with Esquire and the terms of trade became less favourable towards Esquire.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">75.       As such, Arjan and I as well as the Esquire companies were anxious to ensure that Esquire retained this property and wouldnot have sold it unless compelled to do so.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p163" class="para" id="p163">163.</a>  That was to paint a half picture. In so far as it suggested that in March 1987 Mr Gurdas was reluctant to sell, it was true, butthe fact of the matter is that before that date, Esquire had for long come to terms with the need for a sale of Li Fung House, andthe relevance of this history is that it shows that Li Fung House was not always core, as he suggests in his witness statement, tohis vision of Esquireâs future, and that it had been recognized by all that when the market improved the property should be sold. That improvement had by March 1987 materialized.  It was put to Mr Ratnam in cross-examination that as recently as October 1986Esquire was prepared to consider sale and would probably have been happy to sell if a reasonable price could be achieved, and MrRatnam conceded (transcript, day 4, page 86) that: âThat would be fair to say because we also agreed with Mr Selway Swift in January1986 that later on, a better offer came, we will negotiate in good faithâ.  That agreement is evidenced in a letter from the Bankto Esquire dated 20 January 1986 (Bundle D page 316).  And the good sense of selling Li Fung House was recognized by Mr Gurdas whenhe wrote the letter of 3 May 1985 to the Bank, the letter in which he canvassed the notion of moving Esquireâs activities underone roof in Wing On Plaza, a good address, he said, and of selling Li Fung House and other properties, so that the Bankâs exposurewould be reduced and Esquireâs future prospects improved (see para. 143 above).</p>    <p><a name="p164" class="para" id="p164">164.</a>  In July 1985 Esquire wrote (Bundle D page 236) saying that it would not like to accept a sale price of less than $135 million forLi Fung House but acknowledging that âselling our surplus properties was in the immediate and long-term interests of Esquire andthis could only improve Esquire's overall position with the Bank and not worsen it and with this end in view we should be willingto be somewhat flexible in relation to this particular deal relating to the proposed sale.â  1986 witnessed growing concern onthe Bankâs part about Esquireâs situation, as well as suggestions within the Bankâs ranks that Mr Gurdas was not devoting himselfto the business.  In October 1986 Mr Gurdas wrote to the Bank (Bundle D page 407) recording the agreement that while there wouldbe no sale of Li Fung House and Wing On Plaza during 1986 âin order that any appreciation in the value of the properties couldaccrue to the Bank and the company, [the] company had also agreed that if any genuine offers were received during 1986 it will considerthemâ¦,  â wherefore he accepted the proposal to sell the tenth floor of Wing On Plaza.</p>    <p><a name="p165" class="para" id="p165">165.</a>  It was against that background that the meeting of 12 March took place.  The market had risen considerably, and it could have comeas no surprise to anyone that the Bank raised the question of Li Fung House.  Mr Gurdas said in his witness statement and in hisoral testimony that he could not understand why, indeed he was shocked that, the Bank wished to sell (transcript, day 9 page 48),an odd statement, one might think, in the light of this history.  $30 million as a specific figure was never mentioned on 12<sup>th</sup> March â that much became common ground â a stark admission given the tenor of the pleadings and the witness statements.  Furthermore,the only reason advanced on behalf of Mr Gurdas at those meetings why he did not wish then to sell was that a sale would, he felt,be detrimental to the companyâs image.  It is noteworthy that the reason thus advanced had nothing to do with the state of themarket.  The appreciation in the state of the market which had been awaited by both sides in 1986 had now come to pass, and accordinglyMr Gurdas must have realized that he had as a matter of commercial reality to sell if the Bank so insisted, which it did.  That iswhat forced him to sell.</p>    <p><a name="p166" class="para" id="p166">166.</a>  The finding of the learned judge (para 192 judgment) that the $30 million question was âthe nuclear weaponâ and that âwhatcaused the resistance of Gurdas to crumble was the unreasonable, intimidating and deliberately capricious manner of Somerfieldâsillegitimate pressure, namely the $30 million overcharge threatâ is a finding with which I cannot agree and is a finding whichin my judgment we are entitled to upset.  It does not sit with the realities disclosed by the history, or with the conduct of theparties at the time, or with the contemporaneous documentation.  And the suggestion that this figure was somehow at the heart ofthe discussions and was persuasive in causing Esquire to agree to the sale sits ill also with the fact that the more limited figureof $15 million was known by both sides to be incorrect, and could readily be demonstrated to be incorrect by experts who were presentat the core meetings, experts who were then and later acting for Esquire.  This is not the factual fabric from which a case of economicduress is made. </p>    <p class="heading">Undue influence</p>    <p><a name="p167" class="para" id="p167">167.</a>  It is, I would have thought, unusual to discover an allegation of undue influence in a commercial setting with the weaker partyled by an experienced businessman and advised by a lawyer as well as by a chartered accountant.  Be that as it may, apart from remindingourselves that the burden of proving actual undue influence is upon the party which seeks to set aside the transaction, it is notnecessary to rehearse the law of actual undue influence, for the judgeâs findings necessarily involved a conclusion that such influenceas was exerted by the Bank was undue and causative, and was undue and causative, he held, for the same reason that he held that thepressure exerted by the Bank was illegitimate and causative. Since in my judgment that conclusion under the heading of economic duresscannot be sustained, it can equally not be sustained under this, the last head of claim.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p168" class="para" id="p168">168.</a>  I too would allow the appeal.  I am indebted to counsel on both sides, and to their teams, for the excellence of their presentations.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Tang JA:</b></p>    <p><a name="p169" class="para" id="p169">169.</a>  For the reasons given by the Vice President and Stock JA, I agree that the appeal should be allowed.  Since we are overturning ajudgment which has received substantial publicity because of the trenchant criticism made of the Bank and some of its officers, Iwould add a few words of my own.</p>    <p class="heading">Breach of fiduciary duty</p>    <p><a name="p170" class="para" id="p170">170.</a>  In para. 75 of the judgment, the judge held that the Bank owed to Esquire âthe full duty of loyalty and good faith normally owingby an agent to the principalâ.</p>    <p><a name="p171" class="para" id="p171">171.</a>  With respect, I disagree.</p>    <p><a name="p172" class="para" id="p172">172.</a>  The power of attorney was given by way of security.  In the circumstances of this case, the power of attorney could only have beengiven to secure the proprietary interest of the Bank as mortgagee.</p>    <p><a name="p173" class="para" id="p173">173.</a>  Since the scope of the Bankâs duty must be âmodelled according to the nature of the relationship and the facts of the caseâ,per Mason J in <i>Hospital Products Ltd</i> at 102, I have no doubt that the duties owed by the Bank to Esquire under the Power of Attorney in the sale of property were thosewhich a mortgagee owed to a mortgager.</p>    <p><a name="p174" class="para" id="p174">174.</a>  A helpful statement of such duties can be found in Snellâs Equity 31<sup>st</sup> ed., para. 38-38:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âA mortgagee is not a trustee of the power of sale.  The power is given to him for his own benefit and he need not take accountof the interests of the mortgagor in deciding whether or when to sell.  Accordingly the court will not interfere with his proposedexercise of the power merely because the sale or its timing would be very disadvantageous to the mortgagor or because it appearsthat the mortgagor will soon be in a position to redeem.  However, the mortgagee owes a duty in equity (not in tort) to exercisethe power of sale in good faith and for the sole purpose of securing repayment of monies due under the mortgage.  Furthermore ifhe does choose to sell, he must take reasonable care to obtain a proper price for the property.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p175" class="para" id="p175">175.</a>  At para. 77, the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â77.      The relevant question on breach of fiduciary duty in this case is whether the manner, the person of the purchaser andits relation with the Bank, and the price of the sale by the Bank amount to a breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty and good faith.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p176" class="para" id="p176">176.</a>  Then, at para. 83, he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â83.      The core complaint in this case can be summarized in my view by one short statement, namely a senior partner has no businessselling his principalâs property to his junior partner in a private sale.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p177" class="para" id="p177">177.</a>  The judge concluded that the Bank was in breach of fiduciary duty as a agent because:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the Bank effected an inappropriate sale, namely with undue haste and to a close friend.â  para. 79 of the judgment.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p178" class="para" id="p178">178.</a>  Had the Bank taken reasonable care to obtain a proper price for the property?  Had the Bank sold the property with undue haste?</p>    <p><a name="p179" class="para" id="p179">179.</a>  The judgeâs conclusion on undue haste is based in part on his opinion that the sale took place âin a rising marketâ.  He said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â76.      The then market condition is most relevant in the consideration of the breach of fiduciary duty and in my view Esquirehas rightly stressed the importance of the strong rising market.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p180" class="para" id="p180">180.</a>  However, the judge also accepted the submission of Mr Fok SC who appeared for the Bank below that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ one could not use hindsight and that the Bank did not know that the market would continue to rise so strongly.â  para. 76.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p181" class="para" id="p181">181.</a>  In considering the question of undue haste, it is necessary to state briefly what measures had been taken to market the property.</p>    <p><a name="p182" class="para" id="p182">182.</a>  Advertisements were placed in leading Chinese newspapers for a total of six occasions between 7 and 15 April 1987.  Advertisementsalso appeared in SCMP on 7, 9, 13 and 15 April 1987.</p>    <p><a name="p183" class="para" id="p183">183.</a>  287 brochures had been sent out between 8 and 23 April 1987.  The persons to whom sales brochures were sent on 8 April 1987, includedmany well known property agents, for example, Jones Lang Wootton, Collier Petty, Vigers, Richard Ellis.</p>    <p><a name="p184" class="para" id="p184">184.</a>  With respect, I agree with the Vice Presidentâs conclusion in para. 112 that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ there is no reason to suppose that any party that was in a position to be able to afford a property such as Li Fung House wouldnot have come to know of its existence on the market and made approaches if it had any intention of purchasing the property.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p185" class="para" id="p185">185.</a>  The judge, however, criticized the Bank for not continuing with or waiting until the end of the second stage of press advertisementscampaign which:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ were to appear on 23<sup>rd</sup> April, 27<sup>th</sup> April, 29<sup>th</sup> April, 30<sup>th</sup> April, 4<sup>th</sup> May and 5<sup>th</sup> May.â  para. 62.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>The judge also complained that only 287 out of 445 brochures had been sent, since 158 brochures which were part of the second stageeffect to publicize the property had not been sent.  The evidence is not clear whether any of these other brochures had been sent,but, in my view, that mattered not.</p>    <p><a name="p186" class="para" id="p186">186.</a>  When one considers whether the property had been properly marketed, one should examine the quality of the actual publicity promotingthe sale.  That the judge has failed to do.  If he had done so, I believe he would have come to the same conclusion as the Vice President.</p>    <p><a name="p187" class="para" id="p187">187.</a>  Moreover, in emphasizing the curtailment of the publicity, the judge had overlooked the risk that waiting might have been counterproductive. A potential purchaser might think that in launching a new campaign so soon after the first one, the vendors were âmotivatedâ. That normally leads to lower offers.  On the evidence, I am of the view that the property had been properly exposed to the market. In selling the property when it did, the Bank could not be said to have acted with undue haste.</p>    <p><a name="p188" class="para" id="p188">188.</a>  I then turn to consider the price.  In this, the judge has overlooked the agreement of the parties that a sale at a price anywherebetween $178 million and HK$192.9 million would have been a sale at open market value at the time.  It was also agreed that openmarket value was intended to mean:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the best price at which the sale of an interest in a property might reasonably be expected to have been completed unconditionallyfor cash consideration on the date of valuation assuming:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a) a willing seller;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) that, prior to the date of valuation, there had been a reasonable period (having regard to the nature of the property and thestate of the market) for the proper marketing of the interest, for the agreement of price and terms and for the completion of thesale;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c) that the state of the market, levels of values and other circumstances were, on any earlier assumed date of exchange of contracts,the same as on the date of valuation;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d) that no account is taken of any additional bid by a purchaser with a special interest; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(e) that both parties to the transaction had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p189" class="para" id="p189">189.</a>  Having regard to the agreement, the judge was not entitled to find that the property had not been properly marketed or that thesale had not achieved the open market value of the property.</p>    <p><a name="p190" class="para" id="p190">190.</a>  The judgeâs view on the inadequacy of the price probably stemmed from his view that the sale took place in a strong rising market. In other words, had the Bank waited, the open market value would have become higher.</p>    <p><a name="p191" class="para" id="p191">191.</a>  As the citation from Snell shows a mortgagee is not obliged to wait.</p>    <p><a name="p192" class="para" id="p192">192.</a>  Moreover, even if the Bank had not been the mortgagee but an agent for reward, to sell at the market price in a rising market wouldnot per se be a breach of any duty.  The implication of the judgeâs view is that an agent should not sell in a rising market, atleast, until the market stops rising.  With respect, that is not a tenable view.  Moreover, there was no evidence that an agent forreward would not have sold the property at the time.</p>    <p><a name="p193" class="para" id="p193">193.</a>  As for the judgeâs view that since the purchaser was willing to pay the asking price, that showed that the asking price was settoo low, I will repeat it was agreed that the price was the open market price.  Moreover, it was fully supported by (indeed had exceeded),the contemporaneous valuations and expectation.  A vendor who revises his asking price when it is met will find it difficult everto sell his property.  I do not believe that is how commercial people would or must behave.  Indeed such conduct is likely to dampeninterest in the property since prospective buyers might consider it a waste of time to deal with a moving target.</p>    <p><a name="p194" class="para" id="p194">194.</a>  I turn to consider the sale to Bethlehem.  The agreement for the sale and purchase was dated 16 May 1987 which provided for completionon or before 21 May 1987.  According to Leung Ka Hung, he noticed the advertisements in early April 1987.  He obtained a brochurefrom the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p195" class="para" id="p195">195.</a>  Towards the end of April 1987, at a meeting with 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, he was told that the vendor was looking for $175 to $185 million.</p>    <p><a name="p196" class="para" id="p196">196.</a>  A subject to contract offer was sent by fax dated 5 May 1987 from C Y Kwan &amp; Co to acquire the property for $180 million.  Thesubject to contract offer was accompanied by a cheque for $1 million as earnest money and which was to be refunded if:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe formal Agreement for Sale and Purchase be not signed by our client, for any reason whatever, within 14 days from the day hereof,.â¦..â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p197" class="para" id="p197">197.</a>  By letter dated 6 May 1987, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant informed the Bank, attention âSommerfieldâ:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe consider that this is the best offer that can be obtained from the prospective purchaser, S H Ho of Hang Seng Bank, and we wouldbe pleased if you would formally instruct Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master to prepare the sale and purchase agreement, so that it canbe signed within 14 calendar days (Please note, <u>not</u> 14 working days).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p198" class="para" id="p198">198.</a>  By letter of the same day, Sommerfield wrote to Ratnam:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ and confirmed that its terms are acceptable.  Kindly proceed to complete the sale and requisite tenancy.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p199" class="para" id="p199">199.</a>  There is a memo for file dated 4 May 1987 by Sommerfield which reads:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â<u>Esquire</u></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">I have today authorized HSPM to accept an offer of $180 m for Li Fung.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p200" class="para" id="p200">200.</a>  There were two marketing reports by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant dated 23 April 1987 and 30 April 1987 respectively.  It is clear from these reports that the response had not been overwhelming. The 1<sup>st</sup> report mentioned a possible offer of $158 million which according to the second report âcould possibly be increased to a maximumof $160 million.â</p>    <p><a name="p201" class="para" id="p201">201.</a>  In the circumstances it is difficult to see how the Bank could be criticized for accepting Bethlehemâs offer.</p>    <p><a name="p202" class="para" id="p202">202.</a>  Then came C Y Kwan &amp; Coâs letter of 8 May  987 which was copied to Wrangham of the Bank and Q W Lee of the Hang Seng Bank. I have nothing to add to what my Lords have already said.</p>    <p><a name="p203" class="para" id="p203">203.</a>  Mr McGhee submitted that the Bank should not have put itself in a position where its relationship with Bethlehem possibly mightconflict with the interests of Esquire.  That in selling to the Ho family, the Bank was possibly in a position of conflict.</p>    <p><a name="p204" class="para" id="p204">204.</a>  But as Lord Upjohn explained in <i>Phipps v Boardman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%202%20AC%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 2 AC 46</a> at 125C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe phrase âpossibly may conflictâ requires consideration.  In my view it means that the reasonable man looking at the relevantfacts and circumstances of the particular case would think that there was a real sensible possibility of conflict; not that you couldimagine some situation arising which might, in some conceivable possibility in events not contemplated as real sensible possibilitiesby any reasonable person, result in a conflict.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p205" class="para" id="p205">205.</a>  Here, on the evidence, I see no sensible possibility of conflict.</p>    <p><a name="p206" class="para" id="p206">206.</a>  The ârelationshipâ between the Bank and Bethlehem was wrongly compared with one of âsenior partner and junior partnerâ,or, of âclose friendsâ.  The ârelationshipâ between the Bank and the Ho Family is not the sort of relationship which givesrise to a suspicion that it would give rise to conflict of interest.  Mr McGhee referred us to the evidence of Selway-Swift wherehe said he took steps to satisfying himself that the sale to Bethlehem was at armâs length.  As Mr McGhee accepted that is notdeterminative but he submitted that that showed the relationship was sufficiently close to raise the question.  Although in my viewthe relationship does not give rise to any suspicion of conflict, I have subjected the transaction to vigilant scrutiny.  The VicePresident has dealt in some detail with how Bethlehem came to be the purchaser and I will not repeat them.  I am satisfied that thereis not a sensible possibility of conflict.</p>    <p><a name="p207" class="para" id="p207">207.</a>  Indeed, the Bank and Esquire had an identical interest, namely, to get the best price for the property; just as Mr Farrar did in<i>Farrar v Farrars Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1888%5d%2040%20Ch%20D%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1888] 40 Ch D 395.</a>  Lindley LJ said at 413:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ at this time his interest was to get the best price he could, for his security was by no means ample, he was pursuing thatinterest, and was discharging his duty at the same time, and he had no conflicting interest in the matter.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p208" class="para" id="p208">208.</a>  As the Vice President has explained, it was clear in May 1987, that even with the property sold, a substantial black hole wouldbe left.</p>    <p><a name="p209" class="para" id="p209">209.</a>  In such circumstances, I cannot accept the judgeâs view that the Bank wished to close the transaction quickly to stop a higherbid, or that they would not wish the Ho Family being forced âinto paying a much higher priceâ.  The evidence does not supportsuch a view.  There is no sensible foundation for the judgeâs conclusion.</p>    <p><a name="p210" class="para" id="p210">210.</a>  The judge attached importance to the fact that in the letter of 8 May 1987, C Y Kwan &amp; Co wanted the agreement to be signedforthwith.  The property market in Hong Kong is notoriously volatile.  The law reports are full of cases where the parties enteredinto informal provisional but binding agreements involving millions of dollars.  There was no evidence that the speed of this transactionwas unusual.  Indeed, I note from Mr Gurdasâ witness statement that Esquireâs purchase of the property in 1981, took place withina short time too.  According to him, some time in September 1981, he heard that the property was for sale, and he paid a depositof $3 million on 18 September 1981 upon the signing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.  Esquire needed a mortgage.  Here Bethlehemwas a cash buyer.</p>    <p class="heading">Economic Duress</p>    <p><a name="p211" class="para" id="p211">211.</a>  The judge found that on the night of 12 March 1987:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âGurdas telephoned Sommerfield from India late that night and at the end of that long telephone conversation with Sommerfield, afterresistance failed, agreed to sell.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p212" class="para" id="p212">212.</a>  He said ââ¦ the capitulation was total â¦â and that the quality of the pressure applied âwas the devilâs work and commandswhat I can only call awe and horror for the total lack of morality or legalityâ.</p>    <p><a name="p213" class="para" id="p213">213.</a>  Then at para. 192 the judge said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ what caused the resistance of Gurdas to crumble was the unreasonable, intimidating and deliberately capricious manner of Sommerfieldâsillegitimate pressure, namely the $30 Million Overcharge Threat.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p214" class="para" id="p214">214.</a>  The Vice President has already referred to the first sentence in para. 184 where the judge accepted that at 10 pm on 12 March 1987Ratnam telephoned Sommerfield to inform him that Gurdas would agree to sell.  This is what Ratnam said in re-examination on Day 7at page 145, referring to his own earlier telephone conversation with Gurdas when Gurdas told him to tell Sommerfield that he waswilling to sell the property:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTherefore (Gurdas) said, âOkay, you phone and tell him (Sommerfield).â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Then I said, âYou also have to speak to himâ, which I believe he did subsequently.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p215" class="para" id="p215">215.</a>  This is consistent with Sommerfieldâs memo at page 511 of the trial bundle which recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âPhone call : Ratnam â TRS â 10:00 p.m. Thurs.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">R called to inform TRS that he had contacted G in Bombay, and G had agreed to sell the property.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Phone call : Gurdas â TRS</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">G phoned from Bombay and, amongst all the b.s., consented to sale of the property âif the bank thought that was in the best interestsof the company.â  TRS replied that it was the directors who would decide.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">G requested TRS to do what was best for the company.  TRS replied that his overriding interest was our shareholdersâ cash but thathe also wished to give G long-term peace of mind.  The conversation ended amicably.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p216" class="para" id="p216">216.</a>  Sommerfield said in his evidence that he had no independent recollection of that conversation.  Nor what he had regarded as âb.s.âin Gurdasâ conversation with him.</p>    <p><a name="p217" class="para" id="p217">217.</a>  The judge accepted Gurdasâ evidence that it was âan unpleasant callâ (para. 184).  It is not clear from Gurdasâ evidenceexactly what he said Sommerfield said to him which led the judge to conclude that âthe capitulation was totalâ.</p>    <p><a name="p218" class="para" id="p218">218.</a>  But given that Gurdas had earlier told Ratnam he was willing to sell and had asked Ratnam to tell Sommerfield, although Gurdas alsocalled Sommerfield to tell him he was willing to sell, one might think there would not have been much of an effort, if at all, onGurdasâ part, in that telephone conversation, to resist selling.</p>    <p><a name="p219" class="para" id="p219">219.</a>  The judge based his decision on his assessment of the witnesses.  I will only add, to the Vice Presidentâs comments on the judgeâsapproach, this observation.  The judgeâs assessment of the Bankâs witnesses was undermined by the highly critical but unjustifiedviews that he had taken of their conduct when he concluded that there were breaches of fiduciary duties in the sale of the property. Although he did not mention Sommerfield by name, having regard Sommerfieldâs role in the sale, the judgeâs views, expressedso forcefully, would have influenced his assessment of Sommerfield as a witness generally.</p>    <p><a name="p220" class="para" id="p220">220.</a>  In any event, with respect, the judge had not properly evaluated the evidence.  In particular, the judge has overlooked reliablecontemporaneous documents.</p>    <p><a name="p221" class="para" id="p221">221.</a>  I refer to the note of the meeting held on Monday 16 March 1987.  That meeting was attended by Oliner, Ratnam and Khan for Esquire. The note opened with the following remarks:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âWe commenced meeting with concession in principle of forgiveness in return for sale of property.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">MO (Oliner) replied with a restatement of certain basic principles:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">a) the company wanted a clear balance sheet</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">b) release of guarantees</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">c) flexibility in lines</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">d) support from HSBC</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">e) fixed repayment schedule.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p222" class="para" id="p222">222.</a>  In Ratnamâs notes of that meeting, he recorded:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â1. TRS said G has agreed in principle to sell property and HSBC is considering relief / forgiveness in some form.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">2. MO said G is agreeable in principle provided it will leave G with a strong trading company and a good balance sheet.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then more details on what Esquire wanted.</p>    <p><a name="p223" class="para" id="p223">223.</a>  These notes do not support a case of total capitulation at all.  The judge ought to have assessed Gurdasâ evidence against thecontemporaneous record.</p>    <p><a name="p224" class="para" id="p224">224.</a>  Unfortunately, the judge seemed to have concentrated on the events of 12 March 1987, the pressures which were supposedly appliedon that day and came to a conclusion on the matter principally on the imperfect recollection of Gurdas.</p>    <p><a name="p225" class="para" id="p225">225.</a>  It is clear that the sale of the property and the power of attorney were part of an ongoing discussion between the Bank and Esquirewhich led to the Esquire Agreement of 26 April 1987, which the Vice President has referred to in para. 89 of his judgment.</p>    <p><a name="p226" class="para" id="p226">226.</a>  Sommerfieldâs note of 16 March 1987 recorded Oliner proposing a repayment of $9 million per annum for all the banks.  $9 millionwas based on net profits of $750,000 per month, but that Esquire would keep 40% of the profits.  Then the note continued with thiscomment:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âAfter we noted that $750,000 was low in relation to Jan-Feb profits of $1.5 million per month, MO offered $9 million year 1, $11million year 2, $13 million year 3.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Then in a postscript:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âS Khan let slip in a later conversation that G expects the other banks to take a hit of $35 million on hardcore of $45.6 million. $10.6 million over 3 years is $290,000 per month and presupposes net profit of at least $730,000 per month.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p227" class="para" id="p227">227.</a>  This and further negotiations between the parties showed quite clearly that Esquire was able to and did negotiate with the Bankon a commercial basis.</p>    <p><a name="p228" class="para" id="p228">228.</a>  The Vice President has analysed the demand which was said to have been made by Sommerfield in meetings on 12 March 1987.  The analysisshowed that the demand which Sommerfield threatened did not include a demand of payment for the so-called $30 million overcharge.</p>    <p><a name="p229" class="para" id="p229">229.</a>  Nor do I accept that it was the â$30 million overchargeâ which was a significant cause of Esquire Agreement to the sale of theproperty.</p>    <p><a name="p230" class="para" id="p230">230.</a>  So far as the interest overcharge of $15.6 million was concerned, it may be helpful to note how the Bank and Esquire had decidedto deal with it in the facility letter dated 16 October 1986.</p>    <p><a name="p231" class="para" id="p231">231.</a>  In the facility letter, the Bank and Esquire agreed that Esquire should reserve its position regarding the actual amount due, pendingresolution of Esquireâs query in relation to the $30 million.</p>    <p><a name="p232" class="para" id="p232">232.</a>  Mr McGhee submitted that the Bank had devised a strategy to persuade Esquire to sell by threatening to make a demand for paymentfrom Esquire and liquidate or finish off Esquire as a result and that the strategy was illegitimate since the Bank knowingly demandedfor too much.  Alternatively, under the restructuring arrangements the Bank had no right to serve a demand at all.</p>    <p><a name="p233" class="para" id="p233">233.</a>  I have nothing to add to what my Lords have said on the excessive demand.</p>    <p><a name="p234" class="para" id="p234">234.</a>  Mr McGhee submitted that under the restructuring agreement of 22 February 1984 as extended by the supplemental agreement dated 30October 1986, the Bankâs right as mortgagee had been suspended.  Hence the Bank had no right to make any demand at all.</p>    <p><a name="p235" class="para" id="p235">235.</a>  Under the restructuring agreement, the Lenders had agreed âthat until the Termination Date the indebtedness will be paid onlyout of the Net Profits â¦ â (clause 6.01).  And that âthe Lenders shall not, and shall not be entitled to, demand â¦ any repaymentâ(clause 10), in the absence of an event of default.</p>    <p><a name="p236" class="para" id="p236">236.</a>  However, the following clauses make it quite clear that the moratorium did not apply to the Bank as mortgagee in respect of theproperty:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â8.01    â¦ HSBC shall itself have the power as mortgagee to sell, transfer, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of, or to directthe sale, transfer, mortgage, pledge or other disposition of, any of the Properties on such terms and subject to such conditionsas it shall in its absolute discretion determine.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â¦â¦</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">8.04     Without in any way fettering the right of HSBC in the exercise of its discretion in relation to any Disposals, HSBC agreeswith the other Lenders that in reaching a decision between the Commencement Date and the Termination Date with regard to any Disposalit will have due regard to the continuing business of the Companies and the objectives of this Agreement and the views of the otherLenders.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">8.05     It is hereby expressly agreed and declared that in the event that the proceeds of a Disposal of a Property exceed the balanceof HSBCâs Property Portion then outstanding, then the excess shall be applied by HSBC first in reduction of HSBCâs Non PropertyPortion up to the amount secured by any charge over that Property in favour of HSBC, and secondly shall be paid into the WorkingAccount to be applied as described in Clauses 6.03(a) and 6.05.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p237" class="para" id="p237">237.</a>  The reference to payment of any relevant excess âinto the Working Account to be applied as described in Clauses 6.03(a) and 6.05â,showed that it was contemplated that the sale of the property would not necessarily have to take place after the termination of therestructuring agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p238" class="para" id="p238">238.</a>  Indeed clause 8.01 read together with clause 8.04 show quite clearly that the restructuring agreement would not materially affectthe Bankâs right as mortgagee to enforce its security.</p>    <p><a name="p239" class="para" id="p239">239.</a>  Lastly, the language of clause 10 itself supports the same view:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIn consideration of the foregoing the Lenders shall not, and shall not be entitled to, demand or require or institute proceedingsof any kind for or take any other steps whatsoever for or with a view to obtaining from any of the Companies or the Shareholdersany repayment or prepayment of principal or interest or other monies payable in respect of the Indebtedness or the Guarantees except,in the case of HSBC, by the exercise of any power (whether of enforcement of security or otherwise) over any interest in a Propertyas provided in this Agreement.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading">Undue Influence</p>    <p><a name="p240" class="para" id="p240">240.</a>  The judgeâs decision on undue influence is principally based on his earlier findings on breach of fiduciary duty, and economicduress.</p>    <p><a name="p241" class="para" id="p241">241.</a>  In para. 229 he said:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â229.    For me one of the most convincing manifestation of actual undue influence was how the Bank could impose upon Esquire tosign the Power of Attorney and gave to the Bank carte blanche to enable the Bank to dictate the sale absolutely and in such a waythat enabled the Bank to keep Esquire ignorant afterwards that the sale effected in Esquireâs name by the Bank was a sale to theBankâs partner and in undue haste.  I hold therefore that Influence was used by the Bank on Esquire.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p242" class="para" id="p242">242.</a>  Since I am of the view that the judgeâs conclusions on breach of fiduciary duty and economic duress are wrong, it follows thatthere is no foundation for his conclusion on undue influence.</p>    <p><a name="p243" class="para" id="p243">243.</a>  Indeed, on the evidence, I can see no undue influence.  The evidence show that Esquire was able to negotiate the Esquire Agreementunder which if Esquire had been able to trade sufficiently profitably for 5 years, it would have emerged with a clear balance sheet. That was a sound and commercial arrangement and the sale of the property was part of this arrangement.</p>    <p>Hon Rogers VP:</p>    <p><a name="p244" class="para" id="p244">244.</a>  The appeal will therefore be allowed.
