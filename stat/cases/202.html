Limited, appealed from the judgment of DeputyJudge To (as he then was) dated 24 October 2008, whereby the learned judge allowed the appeal of the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by counterclaim, and formally set aside service of a concurrent writ of summons which had been issued out of the jurisdictionagainst these three defendants.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On 10 December 2008 the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by counterclaim filed Respondentsâ Notices, and on 18 December 2008 a Respondentâs Notice was filed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant by counterclaim.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  At first blush this appeal presents as an argument involving application of the principles of leave to serve out of the jurisdictionunder Order 11, RHC; in reality, however, the case before the court bears greater resemblance to a construction summons, in thisinstance the meaning of a provision (or provisions), and the arguable implication of contractual terms, within a Debt RestructuringAgreement (âDRAâ) signed on 22 December 2000 in, amongst other places, Hong Kong.</p>    <p class="heading">The factual background</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In factual terms this case is larded in detail, but at bottom the issue is tolerably straightforward, and involved the restructuringof a debt which was owed by a French subsidiary of Guangdong Enterprise (Holdings) Ltd. (âGDEâ) â the investment vehicle ofthe Guangdong Provincial Government â named GD Invest SARL (âGDIâ).</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In his judgment below, the learned judge has provided a detailed explanation of the factual situation, and in the following briefoutline of events I gratefully take advantage of his exposition.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  In 1992 GDI had entered into an agreement, termed a âCredit Bail Immobilierâ (âthe Immobilierâ), with the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by counterclaim (hereinafter âthe French banksâ) in order to finance the acquisition of a Parisian hotel.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Effectively this took the form of a âlease and purchase agreementâ under which the French banks acquired the hotel and leasedit to GDI with an option to purchase; this agreement was governed by French law, and, as the judge below crisply observes in hisjudgment, this âwas an entirely French transaction entered into in France among French parties.â</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The primary liability of GDI under the Immobilier was guaranteed by GDE under a First Demand Guarantee dated 21 July 1992 (âtheGuaranteeâ).</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  However, in 1998 the financial viability of GDE and its many subsidiary companies (âthe GDE Groupâ) began to collapse; in fact,there was a cumulative debt default of in the order of US$4.9 billion.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  This debt default included GDEâs contingent liability to the French banks under the GDI Guarantee. The judge records that it iscommon ground that financial impropriety led to the collapse of the GDE Group, and the Guangdong Provincial Government feared thatfailure to restructure the Group would impact adversely upon foreign lending in China and on the Hong Kong banking sector; the Governmentalso was keen to avoid any investigation into the circumstances which had led to the collapse of the GDE Group.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Against this backdrop, the Guangdong Government, the GD Group and their creditors entered into debt restructuring arrangements.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Integral to such arrangements was the contribution by the Guangdong Government, via its wholly owned vehicle, GDH Limited (âGDHâ),to a significant asset pool which was to be made available for distribution to creditors of those members of the GDE Group whichwere being restructured.</p><br clear="all" />    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  This injection of funds was termed the âRestructuring Considerationâ, and the judge records that at the time of the negotiationsleading to the debt restructuring it was envisaged that the creditors would be entitled to share <i>pari passu</i> in these funds. He also records that failure by any creditor to agree to the restructuring arrangement <i>and to</i> the ensuing claim procedure would mean that it would be unable to benefit from this fund pool as thus made available by the GuangdongGovernment.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  It is this anticipated method of sharing <i>pari passu</i>, together with the manner of participation (or, more precisely, non-participation) in the relevant claim procedure, which effectivelyforms the thrust of the present appeal.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The DRA was finalized in haste (âat breakneck paceâ as the judge records), and on 22 December 2000 the document was signed;among the signatories were the defendant by original action, Creditor Co Ltd, the French banks, and GDH.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The DRA, which I understand was worked upon by teams of lawyers and financial experts, is a considerable document of detail andcomplexity. It runs to 84 pages, 27 Schedules, and has 41 pages of signatories.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The âRestructuring Considerationâ, that is, funds contributed by the Guangdong Government, together with certain other categoriesof assets of creditor companies, were transferred to and held by Creditor Co Ltd <i>qua</i> custodian, and claims to any part of these monies as thus deposited were to be vetted by the appointed Claims Assessor, the accountantsPricewaterhouse Coopers (âPwCâ).</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Given the time constraints within which the arrangement had been put together, it then had not proved possible accurately to assessthe amount of unadmitted unsecured claims which at the date of the signing of the DRA either constituted contingent or unascertainedliabilities which might be levied against the pool of funds so accumulated; hence the assessment of the size of such liabilitieswas made by PwC and GDH.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Pressure of time also meant that the liability represented by the claims of the French banks â who were treated as unadmittedunsecured claimants for the purpose of the restructuring, the pool of funds for this category of creditors being held in âGeneralReserve Dâ â was assessed on a âworst case scenarioâ basis, including a default penalty for early termination of the Immobilier,and thus the sum of US$15.5 million notionally was set aside from the pool of funds for the purpose of meeting the French banksâclaim of about US$23 million, albeit the maximum loan amount outstanding at that time in favour of these banks, excluding defaultpenalties, was in the order of US$13 million.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  There is no dispute that for the purpose of making claims the French banks were to be treated as unsecured contingent creditors,and that any claims which were to be put forward by them were to be classified under the DRA as âUnrelated Guarantee Claimsâbecause the claims were based on a guarantee where the guarantor (GDE) was a company involved in the restructuring, but the primaryobligor (GDI) was not.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  What occurred next forms the gravamen of the current dispute.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On 5 March 2002, GDH approached the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant bank, Finamur, and by a strictly private and confidential letter sought to discuss a possible and immediate settlementof the obligations of GDI; in this context GDH insisted that the French banks should not submit a proof of claim as required by thecontractual claims procedure provided for in the DRA.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  To cut a long story short, the upshot of this initial approach was that on 27 March 2002 the French banks reached agreement (âtheFrench banksâ agreementâ) with GDI and GDH under which GDI was to bring forward its purchase of the hotel from the French banksunder the Immobilier, and in turn GDH would pay a revised purchase price on behalf of GDI; <i>inter alia</i>, this involved an immediate payment of Euro 3.5 million to the French banks, and in return the banks agreed <i>not</i> to submit any proof of claim under the DRA.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  As the learned judge observes (at paragraph 12 of his judgment), in so agreeing the French banks disentitled themselves from receivingany Restructuring Consideration under the DRA in respect of their entitlement under the guarantee which had been executed in theirfavour. Effectively, therefore, the French banks had entered a private and confidential compromise with the primary obligor, GDIâ which entity was not the subject of restructuring â that GDI was to arrange for an early discharge of its obligations via theoffices of GDH.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It followed that, having thus compromised their claim with and in respect of GDI, the French banks had no reason to claim underthe DRA; accordingly they filed no Proof of Claim pursuant to the DRA.</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In purely monetary terms, the advantage of this arrangement to the Guangdong Provincial Government was that it was able to âclawbackâ some US$15.5 million from the Restructuring Consideration hitherto set aside for the claims of the French banks, therebymaking a saving of about US$10 million.</p>    <p class="heading">The commencement of this litigation: the âshapeâ of the case</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  This private collateral compromise with the French banks stimulated fervent complaint.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Creditor Co took the view that the French banks had entered into an illegitimate âside dealâ with GDH, and therefore refusedto return to GDH the sum of US$15.5 million which in the Restructuring Consideration pool had been set aside to cater for the anticipatedclaims of the French banks.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Consequent upon this refusal, on 11 July 2006 GDH commenced the original action in HCA 1462 of 2006 against Creditor Co for breachof the DRA, the Statement of Claim following on 11 September 2006.</p><br clear="all" />    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In this original action GDH sought an order that the defendant, Creditor Co Ltd., do transfer to GDH the relevant sums from theRestructuring Consideration, alternatively damages, and a consequential order for payment of all sums found due to the plaintifftogether with interest and costs.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  For its part, Creditor Co Ltd, the defendant by original action, denied it was in breach of the DRA, and counterclaimed againstboth GDH and the three French banks, which are named as the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants to the counterclaim, the cause of action against the banks being pleaded both in contract and tort. For convenience, Ishall hereinafter refer to Creditor Co Ltd, the plaintiff by counterclaim, simply as âthe plaintiffâ.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The contractual cause of action was premised on the fact that, as parties to the DRA, by settling their claims with GDH the Frenchbanks were in breach of express or implied terms of the DRA by failing to comply with the claims procedure and to submit a âNilProofâ of Claim to PwC; had the âNil Proofâ procedure been adopted, it would have enabled the US$15.5 million hitherto in âGeneralReserve Dâ, which had been set aside for the French banksâ claim, to be distributed by the plaintiff to other creditors on the<i>pari passu</i> basis identical to that employed in a true liquidation scenario.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  As to the cause of action in tort, the plaintiff alleged that by entering into this private collateral agreement and by not submittingany Proof of Claim under the DRA, the French banks were in breach of the DRA and thus had conspired with GDH to use unlawful meansto injure the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Hence, the relief sought by the plaintiff in terms of its ReâAmended Defence and Counterclaim against GDH and the French banks,dated 16 April 2007, was a claim for damages for breach of contract and/or interference with contractual relations and/or the tortof conspiracy in the current value of the Restructuring Consideration, alternatively in a sum to be assessed, together with interestand costs, and in addition a declaration that the plaintiff âis not obliged to transfer the Restructuring Consideration assetstogether with all its accretions thereto to the plaintiffâ.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In addition, rectification of another agreement, the âCreditor Accession Agreementâ, was sought, but this element of the counterclaimis not relevant to the present appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">The Order 11 proceedings</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  On 11 June 2007, Master Wong granted leave to the plaintiff by counterclaim to serve out of the jurisdiction under Order 11, subrules1(1<i>)(c)</i> [ânecessary or proper partyâ], <i>(d)(i)</i> [relief in respect of a contract made within the jurisdiction] and <i>(f)</i> [tort committed within and damage sustained in the jurisdiction].</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  It was the application by the French banks, that is, the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, to set aside this Order of the Master which precipitated the appeal to the judge at first instance.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In the course of his wide-ranging judgment Deputy Judge To rehearsed the well-known principles relating to leave to serve out underthese heads, and for an application to set aside such leave, and noted (at paragraph 22) that he considered that an alternative applicationby the French banks for a â<i>Spiliada</i> stayâ in the event of failure to set aside the leave as granted effectively had been abandoned.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In the event, upon the issue of âgood arguable caseâ, the learned judge took the view (at paragraph 29) that he was âwellsatisfiedâ that the plaintiff by counterclaim had shown that Order 11, rule 1(1)(c) was engaged, as was his like conclusion regarding(1)(d)(i) and (1)(f): (at paragraphs 32 and 36 respectively).</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  However, as to the concomitant issue of whether there was a âserious issue to be triedâ between these parties, given that hewas satisfied that the case otherwise fell within the appropriate Order 11 sub-heads, the judge took a different view; his judgmentthen condescended to the real issue between the parties (at paragraphs 38-41), and he concluded, in my view correctly, as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â41.  Thus, the issue is what is the true and proper construction of the DRA, in particular clause 10.1(c), or more precisely, whetherthe French Banks have shown that the construction as contended by Creditor Co is so unarguable that its counterclaim ought to bestruck out.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  In evaluating this issue the judge considered the relevant provisions of the DRA, and thereafter moved to its âtrue and properconstructionâ (at paragraphs 44-69), in the course of which he outlined the arguments of respective leading counsel, Mr Chua SCfor the plaintiff, and Mr Manzoni for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendant banks â leading counsel whom this court also has had the advantage of hearing on this appeal â together with Mr AlfredChan, who also represented the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant bank both here and below.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  In the event, Deputy Judge To came to the considered conclusion (at paragraph 70) that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âthe construction of the DRA and the terms sought to be implied by Creditor Co is simply unarguable.

it followed that as the result of this stratagem the French banks would be paid âin fullâ,unlike all other Accepting Creditors who had submitted proofs of claim under the contractual âClaims Procedureâ set out in theDRA.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  The unfortunate result of the judgment below, Mr Chua submitted, was that the learned Judge in effect had âsought to try the counterclaimâ,and that his correct conclusion that there was a âgood arguable caseâ under the Order 11 subheads was a proposition which couldnot stand with his equal and opposite (and incorrect) conclusion that there was no serious issue to be tried, given his view theplaintiffâs counterclaim was âwholly unarguableâ.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Mr Chua firmly asserted that the Deputy Judgeâs consideration of the DRA contained fundamental flaws of interpretation, and thatin rejecting the construction of the plaintiff, which construction obliged parties to file Proofs of Claim, the judge thereby wasâcondoning unprincipled and unlawful behaviour by a shareholder and the French banks which secretly prejudiced the rights of othercreditors who signed the DRAâ.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Thus, leading counsel continued, in his whole approach to this case the learned judge had fallen into serious error in that he hadfailed to discern that a plaintiff will have established a serious question to be tried if, as was the position, its affidavits (inthis instance in particular the affidavits of Mr Williams, a director of the plaintiff) âdisclose a case which appears to meritconsideration at trialâ, to employ the language used in <i>Seaconsar Ltd v Bank Markazi</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20AC%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 AC 438</a> [HL].</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Properly construed and understood, said Mr Chua, the DRA <i>obliged</i> all Acceding Creditors to refrain from taking steps which would prejudice other creditors, all of whom required to be treated equally,and to act in good faith, and that <i>deliberately</i> to omit to file Proofs of Claim under the Claims Procedure was a breach of the obligations held by the banks to the other creditors;on a fair and proper reading of the DRA, he argued, it was not possible for the French banks simply to avoid their obligation tofile Proofs of Claim, whether such proofs claimed sums specific or, simply, were in the form of âNil claimâ proofs.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Moreover, he continued, the judge not only had failed to appreciate the dominance of the <i>pari passu</i> principle in insolvency situations, but also had failed to appreciate the necessity of an implied term within the DRA which mustbe taken to have required the necessary coâoperation between the parties thereto, the better to preserve the nature of the DRAas a âcommercial compromiseâ.</p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  Mr Chua buttressed his extensive argument with reference to established and well-known insolvency principles enshrined in the caseâlaw,and stressed that in insolvency situations there could be no doubt but that specific norms were to apply, and that, in effect, the<i>pari passu</i> principle was sacrosanct and should be applied âover the boardâ.</p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  On the opposite side of the fence, Mr Manzoni, appearing for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> bank defendants by counterclaim, mounted a strong argument, the essential gist of which was that the plaintiff unashamedly was attemptingto reformulate the clear contractual provisions of the DRA, so that the provisions of this document effectively were to be rewrittento fit the plaintiffâs wishes and to conform to established (and fundamentally uncontentious) insolvency principles, notwithstandingthat in the particular circumstance of this case such principles manifestly had no application. The key, he said, lay in the trueconstruction of the DRA, in particular clause 10(c); quite simply, counsel contended, the plaintiff had to get around the effectof this clause, but it could not do so in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  Mr Manzoni further submitted that the plaintiff properly could not imply into this most detailed and complex of contractual documentsthe terms which it now wished to be implied, given that the DRA provided in the clearest of language (namely, in clause 10(c)) specificallywhat was to happen if a party did not file a Proof of Claim, namely, that the money notionally arrogated to that partyâs claimwithin the âasset poolâ which made up the Restructuring Consideration was to go back to GDH (which had provided it), and notto the general body of creditors, and that there was nothing within the language of the DRA which required that situation to be avoided;to the contrary, all parties <i>expressly</i> had agreed that it could and should happen. Thus, it followed, he said, that the DRA, as a purely contractual document, expresslyexcluded the <i>pari passu</i> principle of distribution upon which Mr Chua so heavily had relied for the success of his argument.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  In this case, said Mr Manzoni, there could be no doubt as to what had happened, and it could not be asserted that there was a lackof factual transparency: pursuant to the âFrench banksâ agreementâ of 27 March 2002 the Banks, GDI and GDH simply had agreedto bring forward the purchase under the Immobilier, GDH would make payment for the hotel on behalf of GDI, with GDH making earlypayment to the French banks of Euro 3.5 million as security for early termination of the lease, with such payment to be creditedto GDI on final payment of the purchase price. As part of the consideration for this agreement, the French banks had agreed withGDH that they would not submit a Proof of Claim under the DRA, and in so agreeing disentitled themselves from receipt of any partof the Restructuring Consideration under the DRA. Thus, he said, it was difficult to comprehend how or why the French banks couldbe said to be guilty of any conspiracy to use unlawful means to cause damage in such circumstances, and that, as with the contractualclaim, the pleaded claim in conspiracy also was wholly unarguable.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  As to the issue of loss, which formed the subject of the Respondentsâ Notice, Mr Manzoni submitted that no loss was caused tothe appellant, Creditor Co, and that if and in so far as any loss had been suffered, it could only be a loss to the other creditorsbecause the appellant, Creditor Co, was obliged to pay out the money, and would <i>either</i> pay out to GDH (were the banksâ construction of the DRA to be upheld), <i>or</i> it would pay to the other creditors (according to the appellantâs view of the proper meaning and construction of the DRA).</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  Mr Manzoniâs stance on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by counterclaim was followed and adopted by Mr Alfred Chan, counsel for the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant by counterclaim, Oseo Financement, who in his helpful skeleton argument, outlined the factual role of his client, as deposedin the affidavit evidence of Mr Hunsworth, and how it came to be involved in signing up to the DRA.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  For his part Mr Chan also adopted the position that the plaintiffâs claim against his client was âunarguableâ, and took theopportunity to re-emphasise that the arrangement to which all parties came under the DRA neither was a winding-up nor a court-sanctionedScheme of Arrangement, so that the DRA remained a contractual document, and hence the principles of <i>pari passu</i> distribution and good faith obligation(s) applicable in those situations only could apply in so far as the parties to the DRA didin fact so agree, so that ultimately the case inevitably returned to the appropriate and correct construction of the DRA againstwhat was a largely uncontentious factual matrix.</p>    <p class="heading">Decision</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Perhaps unavoidably this case contains a profusion of detail, which in turn has given rise to vigorous and contentious argument,but at the end of the day the fundamental issue seems to me to be straightforward: as earlier observed, this case bears greater resemblanceto a construction summons than to an extended debate over circumstances which may, or may not, provide grounds for leave to serveout of the jurisdiction.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The learned judge below realized this, and kept his eye firmly upon that part of the DRA which was central to the argument. Thisis <i>Clause 10(c)</i>, which appears under the subhead of âClaims Procedureâ, and reads thus:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âIf a holder of an Unadmitted Unsecured Restructuring Claim has not submitted a Proof of Claim (as defined in the Claims Procedure)in respect of such a claim in accordance with the Claims Procedure on or prior to 31<sup>st</sup></i><i>March,</i> <i>2002, the Restructuring Consideration transferred to Creditor Co in respect of such Unadmitted Unsecured Restructuring Claim and allaccretions thereon shall be transferred to GDH and, save as otherwise agreed between GDE and GDH, may be distributed at the discretionof GDH to the Accepting Creditor with the Unadmitted Unsecured Restructuring Claim or otherwise applied by GDH for its own use andbenefit.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  In my view the essential question for decision is whether the DRA permits a contracting party thereto <i>not</i> to file a Proof of Claim thereunder? Or, to put the issue another way, is there a contractual obligation so to file?</p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  If there is no such contractual obligation, express or implied, then that must be an end of it, because, as Mr Manzoni has pointedout, each and every cause of action as is pleaded against the French banks is reliant on the proposition that a Proof of Claim <i>must</i> be filed, and that the DRA simply does not permit a contracting party not to file a Proof of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  However, the assertion as to a pre-existing obligation so to file a Proof seems to me to be a difficult argument to mount because,as can be seen from its terms, clause 10(c) of the DRA legislates in terms for what is to happen <i>if</i> a contracting party does <i>not</i> put in such a Proof of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Accordingly, as Mr Manzoni submitted, in order to get home on the fundamental âobligation to fileâ issue, the plaintiff hasto reformulate the provisions of the DRA to provide that non-filing of a Proof of Claim must not be the result of a deliberate decisionbut solely to cover instances of inadvertent failure to file, so that on the plaintiffâs case the vital issue of construction therebybecomes not:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âDoes the DRA permit a party not to put in a proof of claim?â</p>        <p class="quote">but, to the contrary:</p>        <p class="quote">Does the DRA permit a party not to put in a Proof of Claim <u>other than by inadvertence</u>?</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  With due respect to Mr Chuaâs strenuous efforts to convince otherwise, in my judgment such contrary formulation simply will notwash. Clause 10(c) is clear on its face: it identifies what is to happen if a contracting party does not put in a Proof of Claim,which is that the money which contingently has been set aside for an unadmitted unsecured partyâs potential claim is remitted backto the company which provided those funds (in this instance, the shareholder, GDH), rather than remaining in the pool for distributionamong the other creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  Nor is there anything in the DRA requiring any party to avoid this occurrence; to the contrary, it is clear that all parties theretoexpressly have agreed that this could happen, since Clause 10(c) says so in terms. In fact, as we now know, the French banks settledwith the primary obligor, which was GDI, and as a result had no claim to make under the DRA; there is no provision for submissionof a âNil claimâ in this document, and thus once no claim was filed, under the contract GDH became entitled to avail itself ofClause 10(c).</p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  In support of his argument as to the positive contractual obligation of the French banks to file a Proof of Claim by 31 March 2002,Mr Chua also drew attention of the court to the provisions of Schedule 14, in particular paragraphs 1 and 2 thereof.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  Schedule 14 is concerned with the Claims Procedure, and deals with how claims are to be filed, processed, and if possible, agreed.Whilst counsel made considerable play out of the word âshallâ where it appears on two occasions in paragraph 2 of Schedule 14,in my view this refers to (and indeed emphasizes) the form and manner in which a claim is to be proved <i>if</i> a party decides to submit a Proof, and does not and cannot impose a duty/obligation on a party to file a Proof of Claim. In fact,this proposed interpretation of Schedule 14 itself is inconsistent with the terms of Clause 10(c) of the DRA, which, as has beennoted, not only provides for the very possibility that a claimant may not file a Proof, but goes on to elucidate how the reserveis to be dealt with in precisely such a case.</p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  In any event, it strikes me that there could be entirely legitimate reasons why a putative claimant may not wish to file a Proof;for example, as the court was reminded by Mr Chan, the claim in question may have been satisfied between the signing of the DRA inDecember 2000 and the deadline for the filing of a Proof of Claim by end March 2002; alternatively a claimant may have been contentwith the prospect of a Non-Restructuring Company debtorâs ability ultimately to repay the debt in question, and thus may not wishto become involved with this contractual restructured debt procedure.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  For my part, therefore, I am wholly unconvinced by the proposition that the express wording of Clause 10(c) may be interpreted tomean that it should cover an instance wherein a claimant <i>inadvertently</i> (as opposed to advertently) has failed to file a Proof. With respect, if such an interpretation were to be adopted, I fail to seewhy inadvertence per se should form a dividing line. For example, the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of this argument would also produce the result that in a situation where any claimant chose (for whatever reason) not to prove itsclaim and thus did not file a Proof, then on the basis of the plaintiffâs current argument as to an obligation so to do, the partywhich does not thus file would be in contractual breach and, following strictly upon the argument of Creditor Co, would be liablein damages therefor.</p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  In my view, the argument that the contract in its present form can be interpreted so as to provide for an âobligationâ on anyclaimant to file a Proof of Debt, alternatively that Clause 10(c) relates only to inadvertent failure, does not, with respect, attractany enthusiasm. In fact, I go so far as to say that it does not get off the ground.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  This conclusion may be something which irks the plaintiff, but the short point is that this contract says what it means and meanswhat it says, no more and no less, and there is no claim or plea for rectification, which is unsurprising given that the DRA evidentlyrepresents the product of thousands of hours of intensive professional legal effort. Thus, when it comes to interpretation, at theend of the day the short (and conclusive) point is that the contract cannot be rewritten at the behest of the plaintiff to âfitâa situation the consequences of which the plaintiff may not have envisaged and clearly does not like.</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  As a factual postscript, it seems that in any event the interpretation as urged upon the court on behalf of the plaintiff is notone which necessarily is shared by the Claims Assessor, PwC. In this connection, in the course of his submission Mr Manzoni drewattention to the terms of a letter dated 7 March 2002 sent by PwC to the French banks, whereby PwC requested that a âNil claimâform be submitted, but then went on to observe that âshould you not complete any form by 31 March 2002 the restructuring considerationpreviously reserved for you will be paid to the Guangdong Government.â This prompted leading counsel to observe, with some justification,that the effect of this letter was to represent to the French banks that the submission of any claim form was optional, and thatit was only subsequent to that letter (and that representation) that there had been entry into the âFrench banksâ agreementâof 27 March 2002. Thus, he concluded, this provided another reason underpinning the assertion that any contractual claim or claimin conspiracy to cause damage by unlawful means simply did not get off the ground.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  I am constrained to agree.</p>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  The foregoing has focused on the plaintiffâs argument as to the proper interpretation of the contract on its face, and I havenot yet touched upon the correlative submission by Mr Chua that, if and in so far as the primary arguments do not get the plaintiffhome, then in the event terms may be <i>implied</i> into the DRA which will ensure success.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Once again I am unsympathetic with Mr Chuaâs strong submission that in the circumstances of the present case â in which thereis no real doubt as to the prevailing factual matrix â lends itself to the implication of contractual terms.</p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  The pleaded formulation (at paragraph 6(3) of the ReâAmended Defence and Counterclaim) of the terms now sought to be implied,and upon which the plaintiffâs present claim appears premised, is in the following terms:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">6.1  That each party shall do all such things as are necessary on its part to enable the other parties to have the benefit of rightsunder the DRA.</p>        <p class="quote">6.2  That each party shall refrain from conduct prejudicing the other partiesâ benefit to rights under the DRA.</p>        <p class="quote">and, most saliently in light of the present argument:</p>        <p class="quote">6.3  That each Accepting Creditor who holds an Unadmitted Unsecured Restructuring Claim agrees to: (a) to use all reasonable endeavoursto file a Proof of Claim on or prior to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2002, and/or (b) act in good faith at all times in respect of such Unadmitted Unsecured Restructuring Claim.â</p>    </blockquote><br clear="all" />    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  As to the implication of contractual terms generally, the courtâs attention has been drawn to the sage observations of WallerLJ in <i>Ultraframe (UK) Ltd v Tailored Roofing Systems</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2004%5d%20BLR%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] BLR 341</a>, wherein the learned judge, after noting that the bases on which terms may be implied into commercial contracts are well-known, andadopting and quoting the summary of the position by Lord Bingham MR in <i>Philips Electronique Grand Public SA &amp; Anr v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd</i>, stated as follows (at 345):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe courtâs usual role in contractual interpretation is, by resolving ambiguities or reconciling apparent inconsistencies, toattribute the true meaning to the language in which the parties themselves have expressed their contract.  The implication of contractterms involves a different and altogether more ambitious undertaking: the interpolation of terms to deal with matters for which,<i>ex hypothesi</i>, the parties themselves have made no provision.  It is because the implication of terms is so potential intrusive that the law imposesstrict constraints on the exercise of this extraordinary power.</p>        <p class="quote">There are of course contracts into which terms are routinely and unquestioningly implied.  If a surgeon undertakes to operate on apatient the term will be implied into the contract that he exercises reasonable care and skill in doing soâ¦But the difficultiesincrease the further one moves away from these paradigm examplesâ¦.It is much more difficult to infer with confidence what the partiesmust have intended when they have entered into a lengthy and carefully-drafted contract that has omitted to make provision for thematter in issue.  Given the rules which restrict the evidence of the partiesâ intention when negotiating a contract, it may wellbe doubtful whether the omission was the result of the partiesâ oversight or of their deliberate decision; if the parties appreciatethat they are unlikely to agree on what is to happen in a certain not impossible eventuality, they may well choose to leave the matteruncovered in their contract in the hope that the eventuality will not occur.</p><br clear="all" />        <p class="quote">The question of whether a term should be implied, and if so what, almost inevitably arises after a crisis has been reached in theperformance of the contract.  So the court comes to the task of implication with the benefit of hindsight, and it is tempting forthe court then to fashion a term which will reflect the merits of the situation as they then appear.  Tempting, but wrongâ¦â¦â(emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  It is with this broad cautionary statement firmly in mind that any argument relating to the implication of terms must be evaluated.The rules regarding the circumstances in which contractual terms may be implied are well-known and fall within the ambit of thattime-honoured epithet âtrite lawâ: to quote from the time-honoured formulation of Lord Simon in the Privy Council (cited by SirThomas Bingham in <i>Ultraframe, op cit</i>.) in <i>BP Refinery (Westenport) Pty</i> <i>Ltd v President, Councillors and Ratepayers of Shire of Hastings</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2052%20ALJR%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 52 ALJR 20</a>, at 26:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âTheir Lordships do not think it necessary to review exhaustively the authorities on the implication of a term in a contract whichthe parties have not thought fit to express.  In their view, for the term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap)must be satisfied: (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, sothat no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that âit goes without sayingâ;(4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term on the contract.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  With respect, it is difficult to see how these criteria are satisfied in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  The DRA works as well without the proposed terms as with it, and it is difficult to appreciate how it makes any difference to theoperation of the DRA whether an Accepting Creditor uses all reasonable endeavours to submit a Proof of Claim or not. As Mr Manzonihas pointed out, the DRA is unconcerned with anything that happens <i>up to</i> submission of a claim, and is concerned solely with the consequences of the submission, or non-submission of a claim. Thus âbusinessefficacyâ does not require the use of all reasonable endeavours by, or the good faith of, an Accepting Creditor; all that occursin the event of the non-submission of a Proof of Claim is that the relevant part of the Restructuring Consideration is paid to aparty different to the one to which it would have been paid had a Proof been filed. Thus the DRA provides for one consequence inone event (payment to a proving creditor in the event of a claim) and a different consequence in another (in the present instancepayment to GDH, pursuant to Clause 10(c), in the event of no proving creditor).</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Moreover, given that the evidence is that the DRA took two years to negotiate and compile, and wherein all parties were representedby financial and legal advisers, one cannot conceive of there being room for the implication of terms, given that the document mustrepresent (and be taken as representing) the common intention of the parties. And if it be said that the express terms do not representthe common intention, and that such intention is different to that which has been expressed, then it bears repeating that there isno claim for rectification, and that the terms as are expressed in the DRA specifically run counter to the proposed âreasonableendeavoursâ implied term, whilst if there was an âobligation of good faithâ (whatever that may mean in the context of a contractas detailed as the DRA ) then such no doubt would have been set out in detail.</p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Notwithstanding such conceptual difficulties in his path, however, Mr Chua, with his usual forensic skill, seeks to infuse the issuesboth of interpretation <i>and</i> that of the implication of contractual terms by placing very substantial reliance upon the <i>âpari passuâ</i> principle as applied in liquidations, and it is this element of the argument that also should briefly be addressed.</p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  In essence, Mr Chuaâs thesis, which emerged very early in his submission, is that a party âcannot contract out of fundamentalinsolvency principlesâ, of which, of course, the <i>pari passu</i> principle is one such guiding element.</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  In support of his argument he cited the CFA case of <i>Tradepower (Holdings) Ltd v Tradepower (HK) Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2010%5d%201%20HKLRD%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] 1 HKLRD 674</a>, a case involving proceedings brought by the liquidators of the respondent company pursuant to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/219" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing and Property Ordinance</a> to set aside a disposition made with intent to defraud creditors, wherein there appeared to have been no proper regard for insolvencyprinciples, including that of <i>pari passu</i> distribution on insolvency. By the same token Mr Chua also laid considerable emphasis on dicta in <i>Cadbury Schweppes v Somji</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%201%20WLR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 1 WLR 615</a> wherein the English Court of Appeal held that basic historical principles of equality and good faith between creditors had not beenabandoned under the new Insolvency Act 1986, and that a debtorâs proposal for a voluntary arrangement with his creditors had tobe characterized by complete transparency and good faith.</p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  With due respect, I do not consider that <i>Tradepower</i> or <i>Cadbury</i> <i>Schweppes op cit</i>., assists him in any way in the context of the current debate. I certainly have no difficulty with recognition of appropriate andwell-established principle in liquidation regimes; my difficulty lies in the submission that such principles are to be regarded asapplicable âacross the boardâ, and can override what otherwise would be the clear effect of specific contractual provisions,and irrespective of whether or not the factual matrix justifies their application. In any event the facts of <i>Tradepower</i> and <i>Cadbury Schweppes</i> are far from the pure <i>contractual</i> composition that represents the situation in the present case.</p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>   <i>Cadbury Schweppes</i>, for example, involved facts wherein majority approval of an individual voluntary arrangement (âIVAâ) as proposed by the debtorhad been obtained by secret collateral payments made with the debtorâs knowledge to two other dissentient creditors, and perhapsunsurprisingly the petitioner, another dissentient creditor, was dissatisfied that the negotiation of the IVA thus was tainted, andduly applied under the 1986 Act for approval of the arrangement to be revoked â hence the Court of Appeal, in upholding the judgeat first instance to the effect that the secretly negotiated deal had influenced the vote approving the arrangement, went out ofits way to emphasise that the 1986 statute had left standing time-honoured equality and good faith principles; in particular RobertWalker LJ (at para 19 of his judgment) approved the citation by the first instance judge of Malins V-C in <i>McKewan v Sanderson</i> (18750  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=LR%2020%20Eq%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">LR 20 EQ 65</a>, at 72, of the observation that equality was an essential principle and that if one creditor, unknown to the general body of creditorsenters into an arrangement by which he gets for himself from the debtor a collateral advantage over and above the other creditors,then that is a fraud upon the other creditors.</p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  This of course is correct, and to its proposition there could be no valid demur, but with respect it is miles away from the situationwith which the learned judge below was dealing in the present case, when, after lengthy negotiation accompanied by extensive legaland financial advice, the extensive and complex contractual document entitled the âDebt Restructuring Agreementâ emerged blinkinginto the light, and when Clause 10(c) thereof in express terms permitted to happen what in fact happened â hence the propositionthat the argument in this case is one of construction of a contract, and not an example of the application of otherwise wholly unexceptionalliquidation/equitable principles.</p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  True it is in the present instance that the monies thus âclawed backâ by GDH consequent upon the non-submission of a claim bythe French banks were not distributed on a <i>pari passu</i> basis to the general body of creditors, but the short and ineluctable point is that this is because the specific contractual provisionwithin the DRA, namely Clause 10(c), expressly permitted such money to return to GDH in the absence of the filing by the French banksof a Proof of Claim. In other words the <i>pari passu</i> principle cannot simply be asserted as a form of conceptual âbandâaidâ in a situation which is <i>not</i> a liquidation (and cannot be construed as such) but represents a contractual debt restructuring pursuant to the terms of the DRA,which is a contractual document to the terms of which all contracting parties have signed up. The alternative in the present casewould be to restrict the applicability of clause 10(c) only to situations involving inadvertence â a conclusion that, for reasonsoutlined above, is both wrong and commercially nonsensical.</p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  This, with respect, seems to me to be the short answer to the substantive point, whether it be employed as an aid to the implicationof contractual terms or as an aid to contractual interpretation.</p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  It is also worth mentioning at this stage that there is persuasive authority to the effect that the <i>pari passu</i> principle âis not in itself a canon of construction or means of altering the true construction of a contract in insolvencyâ,to quote the words of Mance J (as he then was) who was the first instance judge in <i>Charter Reinsurance Co Ltd v Fagan</i>, his judgment being reported at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 313</a>, at 351.</p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  It follows from the foregoing, therefore, that for my part I have little hesitation in rejecting that which I perceived as the tripartitecontention on behalf of the appellant that (a) there was a fundamental obligation under the DRA to file a Proof of Claim; (b) thata term can and should be implied into the DRA as per the pleaded formulation, thereby impressing upon the DRA the terms which theplaintiff now desires to âfitâ the current situation ; and (c) that the <i>pari passu</i> principle of distribution of assets in liquidation situations informs either of the foregoing issues in the plaintiffâs favour.</p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  It must also follow that in my judgment there is and can be no âserious issue to be triedâ in terms either of breach of contractor in the tort of conspiracy to cause loss by unlawful means, which latter cause of action must fall with the contractual claim,and rejection of the alleged implied term. Indeed, at the outset of the argument on this appeal Mr Chua SC fairly accepted that ifthe judge below was correct in his conclusion as to the lack of a âserious issue to be triedâ, this would be the end of thisappeal, and the end of his clientâs efforts to persuade the Hong Kong courts, in their discretion, to exercise jurisdiction overthe French banks.</p>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  Accordingly, I take the view that the conclusion of the learned judge below as to the construction of the DRA was correct, and thatin all the circumstances it was entirely appropriate for him to have decided the matter at this stage and to hold that there wasno serious issue to be tried either in contract or in tort, as opposed to leaving the matter for determination at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  On the basis of the appellantâs arguments alone I would dismiss this appeal.</p>    <p class="heading">Respondentsâ Notices</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99">99.</a>  In light of the conclusion to which I have come solely upon the basis of the appellantâs arguments, there is no necessity formallyto rule (and I do not so do) upon the merits of the argument in the Respondentsâ Notices as have been filed on this appeal by the2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by counterclaim on 10 December 2008 and by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant by counterclaim on 18 December 2008.</p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  There are several additional issues raised by the Respondentsâ Notices, albeit all defendants by counterclaim take the point regardingthe absence of loss on the part of the plaintiff, Creditor Co Ltd, in the circumstances of this case.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  On this point I am inclined to the view is that this submission is well-founded, and that in effect the plaintiff is in effect impermissiblybringing this action for and on behalf of those parties to the DRA which otherwise, pursuant to the provisions of Clause 10(c), wouldhave been in receipt of the monies had the French banks filed a Proof of Claim.</p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  In other words, if any loss has been suffered, it would have been a loss to the other creditors, because <i>in any event</i> the appellant was obliged to pay out the money, and whether GDH was paid (as it was) or whether the other creditors had been paid(which they were not), in each instance the money in question would not have remained in the hands of the appellant. Thus, were theclaim otherwise to be well-founded (which in my view it is not) all that could be awarded to the plaintiff would be nominal damages,which presently I am minded to think would not give rise to a âserious question to be triedâ for the purpose of exercising thiscourtâs long-arm jurisdiction over the defendants by counterclaim by virtue of the provisions of Order 11, RHC.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  For present purposes, however, I wish to leave to another occasion any decision upon whether, as Mr Chua persuasively suggestedin reply that his clientâs pursuit of declaratory relief and/or whether the costs of resisting potential claims by other AcceptingCreditors and/or whether the loss of management time and costs incurred by reason, for example, of Creditor Coâs <i>bona</i> <i>fide</i> (if mistaken) refusal to accede to the claim of GDH, would suffice individually or cumulatively to constitute such âlossâ.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  As to costs, I would make an order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of this appeal should follow the event, such costs to be taxed if not agreed, and a further order <i>nisi</i> that the costs of the action by counterclaim be to the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by counterclaim, such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><b>Hon Ma CJHC:</b></p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  I have read in draft and agree with the judgment of Stone J.</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. There will also be an order <i>nisi</i> as to costs in the terms proposed by Stone J.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(Geoffrey TL Ma)(Geoffrey TL Ma)</td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">(William Stone)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Chief Judge, High Court</td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center" valign="top">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p>Mr Chua Guan-Hock SC &amp; Mr Hew Yang-Wahn, instructed by Messrs Allen &amp; Overy, for the plaintiff by counterclaim</p>        <p>Mr Charles Manzoni, instructed by Messrs Deacons, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by counterclaim</p>        <p>Mr Alfred H H Chan, instructed by Messrs Mayer Brown JSM, for the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant by counterclaim</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2010/160.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
