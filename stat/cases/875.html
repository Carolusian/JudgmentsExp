align="justify"><a name="p1" class="pseudopara" id="p1">1.</a> At the end of the hearing of the Plaintiffs' O.14 and O.14A applications, final judgment with interest thereon and costs was enteredagainst the same Defendant in both actions. I indicated that reasons for the decision would be handed down later. These are the reasons.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> The facts giving rise to these two actions were the same. HCA No. 7145/99 was commenced by 10 Plaintiffs (4 of whom are joint Plaintiffs)while HCA 7702/99 was commenced by 2 other joint Plaintiffs. Both are brought against the same Defendant and arise from exactly thesame facts.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> All the Plaintiffs were previously purchasers of real properties in the mainland. The Defendant (a Hong Kong Company) and 3 othermainland companies were joint developers and vendors who entered into respectively sale and purchase agreements with the Plaintiffs.The Plaintiffs considered that the vendors were in breach of their agreements while the developers maintained that they were not.In accordance with the provisions of the agreements the parties submitted the dispute to arbitration by the Shenzhen sub-board ofthe China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Board. Awards were made in the Plaintiffs' favour by the Board and the Plaintiffscommenced these two actions to seek enforcement of the Awards against the Defendant.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Further, the Plaintiffs took out O.14 &amp; O.14A applications against the Defendant contending that the Defendant has no defenceto their claim herein.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The Defendant argues on the other hand that there is a triable issue because the arbitration awards relied upon were defective inthat there was:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"nothing said or fallen from the Awards [which] goes near to ... suggesting that the Defendant (to the exclusion of all other Respondentsnamed in the Awards) should be solely responsible for payment of the Awards or ... should be shared equally with other Respondents... or that the Defendant alone should pay a specific sum ...": see para.11 of the Defendant's written submissions.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">For this reason, the Defendant contends that it is triable as to whether the Awards were certain and therefore valid.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Further, since the Awards were made in the mainland, and the applicable law in the arbitration was Chinese law, the issue of uncertainty(and resultant invalidity) of the Awards is to be decided according to Chinese law. This is a question of fact. The Defendant's Chineselaw experts have given the following opinion in Chinese:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"ä¸. å°±ä»²è£è£æ±ºå§å®¹èè¨ï¼è£æ±ºé¨åå­å¨ä»¥ä¸åé¡ï¼</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p align="justify" class="quote">1. ææçè£æ±ºåæªæç¢ºåè¢«ç³è«äººå¨æ¿æéæ¬¾è²¬ä»»ä¸­çè²¬ä»»å¤§å°ã</p>            <p align="justify" class="quote">2. è£æ±ºæªæ¸æ°æç½æåºåè¢«ç³è«äººæ¿æçæ¯ä¸è¬æ¸åè²¬ä»»æææ¯é£å¸¶è²¬ä»»ï¼æªæç¢ºè©²åé¡ï¼ç´æ¥å½±ååè¢«ç³è«äººè²¬ä»»åææ¯å¦å¬å¹³åçã</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">ä»¥ä¸åé¡ï¼ä»²è£åº­æäºä»¥è§£éæ¸æ¥ã</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">äº. å°±ä»²è£è£æ±ºçå·è¡èè¨ï¼è²´å¬å¸å¯è½å ä»¥ä¸åå èé¿åè¢«é¦åå¼·å¶å·è¡ï¼é¤è²´å¬å¸ä»¥å¤ï¼å¶é¤ç³è«äººåæ¯åå§è¨»åçå¬å¸ï¼ç¾å¯¦ä¸ï¼éäºå¬å¸æè¢«ä½çºåªåèæ®å·è¡çå°åã"</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">This was translated in the certified translation provided by defence solicitors as:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"1.

As regards the enforcement of the arbitration awards, it is likely that your company may avoid being mandatorily enforced firston the grounds that save for your company, other respondents are companies incorporated in mainland China. Realistically speaking,those companies would be considered the primary target of any enforcement action."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> As a matter of fact, the Defendant's experts were clearly wrong in relation to the Awards regarding P1 and P5. These two awards expresslystated that each Respondent (including the Defendant) was to bear "é£å¸¶è²¬ä»»" for the respective sums awarded to P1 and P5.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> I considered the term "é£å¸¶è²¬ä»»" to be a term of ordinary Chinese language which means "joint liability". Ms Tong for the Defendant,however, disagreed and argued that it was a technical term in Chinese law the meaning of which can only be ascertained through properevidence. The 2 actions ought to be tried for this reason alone. I do not accept her argument because:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) her solicitors have drafted a translation of that term for certification by the Court Interpreter. Both the solicitors and theCourt Interpreter have no apparent difficulty in translating the term as "joint liability" in English;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(b) in "The English-Chinese Dictionary", Vol. 1 published in August, 1989 by "ä¸æµ·è­¯æåºçç¤¾" (The Shanghai Translation Publisher),the English word "joint" was given the following meaning in Chinese: " 'joint' ... IIIa. ... 4. é£å¸¶ç ~ liability (æresponsibility)é£å¸¶è²¬ä»»..." Further, "jointly" was defined as " 'jointly' ... ad.è¯åå°ãå±åå°ãé£å¸¶å° ..." in the same dictionary;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(c) in "A Chinese-English Dictionary of Law" published in 1995 by the Foreign Languages Press Beijing (at p.476) "é£å¸¶è²¬ä»»" wasgiven the meaning "joint liability; joint and several liability ...".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">In coming to this conclusion, I have taken into consideration that "joint" or "jointly" was more commonly translated in Hong Kongas "å±å": see, for example, "Lin Yu Tong's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage" published in 1972 by the Chinese Universityof Hong Kong (see p.243, Column B, line 53).</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> The concept of "joint liability" in Hong Kong law is similar to that in English law: see, for example, the discussion of this aspectin contract law in 9(1) Halsbury's Laws of England (1998) 4th Ed. Reissue, para. 1079 the relevant parts of which stated:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"1079. ....</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Joint liability arises where two or more persons jointly promise to do the same thing; for instance, B and C jointly promise to payï¿¡100 to A. In the case of a joint promise, there is only one obligation, namely a single payment of ï¿¡100. Each of B and C isliable for the performance of the whole promise but payment of ï¿¡100 by one discharges the other. Joint liability is subject toa number of strict and technical rules of law which are discussed below. ...</p>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Joint and several liability arises where two or more persons join in the same instrument in making a promise to the same person, andat the same time each of them individually makes the same promise to that same promisee; for instance B and C jointly promise topay ï¿¡100 to A, but both B and C also separately promise A that ï¿¡100 will be paid to him by either B or C. Joint and several liabilityis similar to joint liability in that the co-promisors are not cumulatively liable, so that payment of ï¿¡100 by B to A dischargesC; but it is free of most of the technical rules governing joint liability.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">Where two or more persons are liable in contract or tort in respect of the same damage (whether jointly or otherwise), any personliable may obtain a contribution from any of those others."</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> The position of persons jointly liable under a judgment or order made in Hong Kong is summarised in 17 Halsbury (1976) 4th Ed., para.419:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"Where a judgment or order is against persons jointly, execution may issue against their joint property or the property of any oneor more of them" (text to n.9).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> If Hong Kong law was applicable to the Awards in question, I do not consider that the Awards were uncertain whether they expresslystated that the liabilities of the Respondents were joint or not. Even if none of the Awards expressly stated this, I consider thatthe way in which the Respondents' liabilities (including those of P1 and P5) were set out therein should be understood to mean thatthe Respondents are jointly and severally liable for the sums awarded in the Plaintiffs' favour.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> However, as stated earlier, the Awards regarding P1 and P5 in fact expressly stated the Respondents' liabilities were "joint". Itwill be explained in later paragraphs herein that the only proper inference is that the same conclusion was reached in the otherAwards. In light of the Plaintiffs' right to seek enforcement against any of the 4 Respondents (under Hong Kong law), I do not considerMs Tong's argument (at para. 11 of her written submission) to be a valid defence.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Despite Ms Tong's contention, I do not consider the Defendant's Chinese lawyers have given any legal opinion which supports Ms Tong'sargument that the Awards were uncertain (and therefore invalid) under Chinese law. This is because:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) para. 1.1 therein only stated a fact (which is incorrect in relation to P1 and P5) and did not deal with its legal effect (ifany) on the Awards under Chinese law;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) para. 1.2 therein contains 2 points. The first point amounted to the stating of a fact only. The second point was only a complaintthat there had not been any indication to enable a fair apportionment of the liabilities among the Respondents; but it does not state(directly or indirectly) that the Plaintiffs' rights to enforce the Awards are thereby affected.</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> In these circumstances, I regard that the Defendant has not adduced any proper expert evidence on Chinese law regarding the certainty(or validity) or otherwise of the Awards.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> Dicey &amp; Morris: The Conflict of Laws (2000) 13th Ed., Vol. 1 para. 9-025 stated that:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify" class="quote">"(4) Burden of proof. The burden of proving foreign law lies on the party who bases his claim or defence on it. If that party adducesno evidence, or insufficient evidence, of the foreign law, the court applies English law. This principle is sometimes expressed inthe form that foreign law is presumed to be the same as English law until the contrary is proved. ...".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">A similar observation was also made in 8(1) Halsbury (1996) 4th Ed. Reissue, para. 1093, text to n.6.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> Thus, even if Chinese law is applicable to the enforcement of the Awards (in the absence of evidence to the contrary), the Plaintiffsare not barred from enforcing the Awards against the Defendant alone: see the propositions in 9(1) Halsbury para. 1079 and 17 Halsburypara. 419 referred to above relating to joint liability.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> The same conclusion (under Chinese law) can be reached in an alternative way. When one examines the contents of the Awards and thereasons given therein, the following are clear:-</p>    <blockquote>        <p align="justify">(a) the relevant facts in each Award were the same;</p>        <p align="justify">(b) the issues raised by the parties to the arbitration were the same;</p>        <p align="justify">(c) the reasoning adopted by the individual arbitrators in arriving at their conclusion for each award was very similar (if not thesame).</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="justify">In these circumstances, although the other Awards did not expressly deal with the nature/extent of the Defendant's liability, I findit an irresistible inference that the same finding that there was a joint liability to pay (similar to the Awards made regardingP1 &amp; P5) must have been made in these Awards.</p>    <p align="justify"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> For the above reasons, I find that the Defendant has not been able to show that there are triable issues of fact or law in thesetwo actions or that they ought otherwise be tried.</p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <div align="left">        <table border="0" width="100%">            <tr>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Andrew Chung)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"></td>                <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">Judge of the Court of First Instance</td>            </tr>        </table>    </div>    <p align="justify"> </p>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p align="justify">Representation:</p>        <p align="justify">Ms Diana Cheung, instructed by Messrs William Siu &amp; So, for the Plaintiffs</p>        <p align="justify">Ms Judy Tong, instructed by Messrs Richards Butler, for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text --><appeal><p>Application by the plaintiffs for security for their costs of appeal granted.
