There were delays. But who was responsible for them is very much in contention. The 3rd defendants have saidthat their failure to keep to schedule was largely the fault of the architects and/or the consulting engineers and, therefore, farfrom being liable to the plaintiffs, they should have been allowed extensions of time with the result that they would have a claimagainst the plaintiffs. Similarly, the 4th defendants say that the fact that they failed to complete the work by 22nd October 1980as provided in the contract was due to their being given late and fragmented access to the site. They contend, therefore, that thedelayed completion is not to be blamed on them or their sub contractors. On the contrary, they too say that they should have beengranted extensions of time which would result in their recovering substantial additional payments.</p>    <p>                </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> In September 1979, the 3rd defendants agreed with the plaintiffs to vacate the site notwithstanding that their part of the contracthad not been fully performed, thereby leaving the site preparation to be finished off by the main contractors, the 4th defendants.It is said on behalf of the 3rd defendants that an agreement made at that time compromised any claim the plaintiffs may have hadagainst the 3rd defendants with regard to delay; but that is not conceded by the plaintiffs. Throughout the 4th defendants have maintainedtheir claims for extensions of time both in their own behalf and in behalf of the sub-contractors. In January 1983, they submittedto the plaintiffs the case for extensions in relation to themselves and in March 1983, they put forward the case on behalf of someof the sub-contractors. In each case, the claims were fully set out and supported by documents. On 14th April 1983, the 4th defendantsasked the architects to reach their decision by 14th May, otherwise, they would resort to the procedures contained in the arbitrationclause. The architects were not able to comply and by letter of 16th May 1983, the 4th defendants invoked the provisions of the arbitrationclause giving the architects until 14th August 1983 to reach their decision. In June 1983, unbeknown to any of the defendants, theplaintiffs engaged other consultants to investigate the performance of the architects and the consulting engineers, and also to lookinto the standard of workmanship achieved by the contractors. On 2nd August 1983, the plaintiffs requested the 4th defendants toallow the architects a further 90 days in which to reach their decision. They said that they thought that there might be more claimsforthcoming from the sub-contractors, that they needed more time to study the claims already submitted and that, in any event, itwas their intention to deal with all the claims on a friendly basis, which must have been intended to mean, I think, that they werenot at that time contemplating litigation. The 4th defendants were persuaded, and in the event did allow the architects a further90 days. They refrained from giving Notice of Arbitration as they would have been otherwise entitled to do on or after 14th August.So, the deadline for the architects' decision became 16th November. On 4th November, the plaintiffs issued the writ. So far, it hasbeen served on the 1st to 4th defendants, of whom the 2nd and 3rd are the applicants. Of the other two, the 2nd defendants have noarbitration clause and the 1st defendants, who have an arbitration clause with the plaintiffs at a very early stage, acquiesced inthe High Court proceedings. The 14 sub-contractors who have been made defendants but up to now who have not been served with thewrit are those of the sub-contractors who have intimated that they wish to make claims against the plaintiffs. Curiously, or perhapsonly coincidentally, the 10 nominated sub-contractors who have not put forward any claim are not made parties to the action. TheStatement of Claim, which runs to 489 pages, was filed on 18th January 1984.</p>    <p>                </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> That is the barest outline of the history of this matter.

It provides:-</p>    <p> </p>    <table width="92%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="11%"></td>            <td valign="top" width="9%" class="quote">"6(1)</td>            <td width="80%" valign="top" class="quote">If any party to an arbitration agreement, or any person claiming through or under him, commences any legal proceedings in any courtagainst any other party to the agreement, or any person claiming through or under him, in respect of any matter agreed to be referred,any party to those legal proceedings may at any time after appearance, and before delivering any pleadings or taking any other stepsin the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings, and that court or a judge thereof, if satisfied that there is nosufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the agreement, and that the applicant was, at the timewhen the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of thearbitration, may make an order staying the proceedings."</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p>The Court's discretion to grant a stay will only arise if the conditions set out in the section have been fulfilled. This distinctionbetween "jurisdiction" and "discretion" is one noted by the learned authors of Mustill and Boyd on Commercial Arbitration but itis not one which seems to have been in the forefront of the minds of those judges to whose decisions I have been referred. In thiscase, it is not contested that the applicants are able to satisfy all the conditions necessary to the exercise of the Court's discretionsave as to one. That question is whether or not I should be "satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should notbe referred in accordance with the agreement". The wording has been described as "somewhat peculiar" <sup>(1)</sup> and indeed, it is. At face value, it seems to cast the burden of establishing a negative proposition upon the applicant for a stayand not just in relation to a particular circumstance but at large. But that is not how the judges have interpreted the section.It is true that Lord Atkinson in <u>Bristol Corporation</u> v. <u>John Aird</u>, <sup>(2)</sup> seemed to place the burden on the applicant in stating that the Court is entitled to say in answer to an application under section4 "we are not satisfied that there is not some reason for not submitting this question to the arbitrator" but in the same case, LordMoulton put it that "a Court may well take the view that there is good reason why this matter should not be referred to arbitrationas provided by the contract", so abandoning the double, negative of the section and placing the burden upon the party opposing astay, as did Lord Parker of Waddington <sup>(3)</sup> in saying "it will certainly not be enough to allege that the arbitrator is not an independent person". In so expressing themselves,Lord Mouton and Lord Parker of Waddington impliedly adopted the view of the Court of Appeal in <u>Hodgson</u> v. <u>Railway Passengers Assurance Company.</u><sup>(4)</sup> In that case, the Master of the Rolls treated the plaintiff as being in the position of applicant which, were it right to do so,would amply support his rule of thumb that when a party applying cannot adduce a reason in support of his application, the judgemay be satisfied that no such reason exists. Whatever may be thought of the premiss upon which the Court of Appeal proceeded in thatcase, the conclusion that it is for the party opposing the stay to adduce some sufficient reason why the application should not begranted seems to have been followed consistently ever since whenever the Courts have addressed their minds to the question of burdenof proof. So in <u>Metropolitan Tunnel and Public Works</u> v. <u>London Electric Railway Company</u>, <sup>(5)</sup> Lord Hanworth felt able to say quite categorically that the onus of showing that an agreement which has provided in clear terms thatany question in connection with the contract shall be referred to arbitration ought not to be carried out lies upon the plaintiff,<sup>(6)</sup> with which proposition, Lord Justice Scrutton found himself in agreement. So too Brandon J., as he then was in the <u>Eleftheria</u><sup>(7)</sup> does not distinguish between the question of jurisdiction and the exercise of discretion but says that the discretion should be exercisedby granting a stay unless strong cause for not doing so is shown. In the <u>Pine Hill</u><sup>(8)</sup> McNair J. regarded the burden as being on the party opposing the stay and more recently still, in the Bulk Oil case, <sup>(9)</sup> Mr. Justice Kerr, as he then was, said:</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"It is clear, and accepted by the defendants, that the burden is on the party seeking to litigate in defiance of an arbitration clauseto satisfy the Court that there is sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration. If one reproduces thedouble negative in the section, if the Court is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not proceed toarbitration, then a stay will be granted".</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>Against this weight of authority, the one dissentient voice might be said to be that of Pearson L.J. in <u>Taunton-Collins</u> v. <u>Cromie</u>, <sup>(10)</sup> where he appears to treat the burden as resting upon the applicant. For my part, and with the greatest possible humility in the lightof such high authority, I have not found it easy to understand the process by which the words of the section can be said to imposea burden of establishing a good reason upon the plaintiff, unless that is, recognising that put the other way about the burden isalmost impossible to discharge, one adopts the fiction employed by Sir George Jessel in the Hodgson case. Alternatively and perhapspreferably, the logic of it might be that the existence of the arbitration clause together with the fulfilment of all the other conditionsof the section raises a presumption, rebuttable of course, that there is no reason why the matter in dispute should not be referred.It would then be for the party opposing the stay to displace the presumption. That approach has some support, I think, in the waysometimes put that the applicant is "prima facie" entitled to a stay. (per Somervell L.J. in <u>W. Bruce Limited</u> v. <u>J. Strong,</u><sup>(11)</sup> Lawrence L.J. in <u>Green Star Shipping</u> v. <u>London Assurance and others</u>, <sup>(12)</sup> and Brandon J. in the Eschersheim). <sup>(13)</sup> But whatever the basis, the question would seem to be well settled by authority so as to have the practical result that I shall havediscretion to act on the application unless the plaintiff shows some sufficient reason why I should not. The question of what isa sufficient reason is also concluded by authority. It is to be a very strong reason to adopt the words of Scrutton L.J. in the MetropolitanTunnel and Public Works case or a "very good reason" to follow Cons J.A. in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal,<sup>(14)</sup> and I must carry in mind throughout the injunction of Lord Moulton<sup>(2)</sup> to consider all the circumstances of the case but to consider them with a strong bias in favour of maintaining the special bargainbetween the parties, at the same time being vigilant to see that I am not driving either of the parties to a tribunal where it willnot get substantial justice. Neither must I overlook the fact that the parties must be presumed to have had due regard to the overridingjurisdiction of the Court at the time when they agreed to refer any dispute to arbitration.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> So what reason might there be for refusing a stay in either case with which I am concerned? By their Statement of Claim, the plaintiffshave a direct claim against the architects, clearly severable, for not making as much of the site as they should have done, but inaddition, they seek to throw off against the architects and the consulting engineers, the 3rd defendants claim for extensions oftime, and against the first three defendants, the claim of the 4th defendants. The way it is done is by setting up the previouslyintimated claims of both 3rd and 4th defendants in the Statement of Claim in anticipation, so to speak, of their being made and thento seek indemnity. It is then said that because there is no enforceable arbitration agreement between the plaintiffs and the 1stdefendants or between the plaintiffs and the 2nd defendants, the claims for indemnity relief would have to be decided in separateproceedings. Next, it is said, that separate proceedings might become necessary against the sub-contractors either because they havea claim for general damages for delay against the sub-contractors which goes beyond any sum recoverable from the main contractor,or because the main contractor, at the end of the day, might not be in a position to satisfy the award. Also, it is contended thatthe plaintiffs have direct claims against sub-contractors either under the side agreements or in tort and that it is no answer tosay that those disputes could all be resolved in arbitration because not all of the sub-contractors are party to an agreement toarbitrate.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Lastly, the reason is put forward that as alleged in the Statement of Claim, there are claims in the alternative for bad workmanshipand that the respective liabilities of the parties can only be thrashed out satisfactorily in the same action. These arguments, ofwhich I have only attempted a summary, are fully developed in the affidavit of Mr. Brunner and accurately anticipate the excellentsubmissions made by Mr. Butcher. In short, it is said that the grant of a stay in either case will result in a multiplicity of proceedingswhich could have undesirable consequences, not the least of which might be inconsistent findings of fact and I have been referredto a number of cases in which that has been held in itself to be a sufficient reason for refusing a stay.</p>    <p>                </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> I can see that there might be very good reasons for the plaintiffs wanting to continue the action but that is not the same thingas saying that there are good reasons for granting a stay. No doubt, the plaintiffs had in mind the advantages to them of proceedingin the High Court when they made their pre-emptive strike 11 days before the architects" decision was due; and whilst one might deprecatethe means by which they achieved it, one must applaud the strategy. If it succeeds, it will mean that they are in the driving seat;they will have set the defendants at each other throats and, if I may be permitted yet another metaphor, they are in a position inprotracted and expensive proceedings to pick off the sub-contractors one by one. On the other hand, if they are forced to arbitrate,they may be obliged to undertake separate proceedings against their architects and consulting engineers and possibly also againstsome of the sub-contractors. In the latter event, I acknowledge the possibility of there being inconsistent findings of fact. Butthe hardship, if it arises, is not such in my judgment as to amount to any injustice to the plaintiffs. They entered into their bargainwith the 3rd defendants and the 4th defendants on what were at least equal terms, and whereas the parties are presumed to have inmind the overriding jurisdiction of the Court so too must they have had within their con-templation the very kind of dispute whichhas now arisen. It is a common place in major building contracts that disputes over time and workmanship are to be expected and almostas inevitably that such disputes will involve more than one party. It is to the end, in part at any rate, of avoiding this kind ofmonster action with its attendant, costs and delays, that building owners and contractors agree to arbitrate. I do not doubt thatmany contractors and, perhaps, the applicants in this case would never commit themselves to an undertaking of this kind if they thoughtthat there was even a risk of being involved in the kind of action now lodged by the plaintiffs. The contractors are entitled tolook to the plaintiffs to compensate them for the shortcomings of the architects and consulting engineers and it is not a sufficientanswer to their claim to be entitled to do so to say that the plaintiffs own right of redress will be deferred. Nor am I impressedby the argument that there are separate sustainable claims against the subcontractors. The side agreements were entered into withoutthe knowledge or concurrence of the main contractor and any claim in tort has only a doubtful basis in law. In any event, the sameconsiderations arise as regards any claim against the sub-contractors as arises with regard to the right of redress against the 1stand 2nd defendants. The plaintiffs must have recognised the possibility of their separate claim, indeed, the side agreements themselvesbear witness to the fact that they did. The dilemma or difficulty is entirely of their own making and, in my judgment, the fact that,in the light of events which should have been within their contemplation at the time those agreements were entered into, the plaintiffsnow repent of their agreements to arbitrate cannot be a sufficient or strong enough reason for refusing a stay.</p>    <p>                </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> The matter might have stood differently if parties other than the plaintiffs were to suffer hardship as a result of a stay beinggranted and that might have been something going both to the question of jurisdiction and the exercise of discretion. But the sub-contractorsstand behind the 4th defendants in their application for a stay and I cannot see how either the 1st or 2nd defendants would be prejudicedif a stay were to be granted. The 1st defendants have not contended as much and it was only at the eleventh hour that Mr. Walkerfor the 2nd defendants lent his support to the plaintiffs' case. For my part, I should think that it is greatly to the advantageof the 2nd defendants to have the issues between the plaintiffs and the 3rd and 4th defendants arbitrated before having to exposethemselves to the risks of litigation. From their point of view, the position can only get better. And so obvious did that seem tome that I did at one time entertain the suspicion that there has been collaboration between the plaintiffs and the 2nd defendants.</p>    <p>                </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I am satisfied that there is no sufficient reason for not granting a stay in the case of each applicant and that establishes whathas been called the jurisdiction to exercise discretion. Without more, I am prepared to exercise my discretion in favour of the applicantsas I think that must almost always result from a finding that there is no reason not to do so. But there are two further matterswhich point to the exercise of discretion in the applicants' favour which propel me in the same direction. If this action were toproceed in its present form, it could not possibly come on for trial within 12 months and the hearing itself might last as long again.There are 19 parties and counsel involved might number twice as many, the pleadings have already reached epic proportions and allin all, if not untriable, the action would impose great hardship upon a number of parties and, in particular, upon some of the smallersub-contractors. The second matter to affect my mind is one to which I have made reference already. I do not criticize the plaintiffsfor their tactics but it is clear to me that in asking the 4th defendants to allow the architects further time, they were makingthemselves the opportunity to be first in the field. At the same time, they gave the 4th defendants to believe that they were goingalong with the agreed procedures. Moreover, I am not entirely convinced, partly because none of the sub-contractors without claimshas been made a defendant that the action itself has not been mounted for tactical reasons. Those, as I say, would have been matterswhich I would have thought it right to take into consideration had it been necessary to do so but I am, in the event, able to exercisemy discretion to grant a stay in each case without paying regard to them. I have not taken into account at any stage what are saidto be the procedural advantages of arbitration over action as to which I remain unconvinced. Nor have I had any regard to what Idescribed as "the whiff of collusion" as to which, of course, I accept Mr. Walker's repudiation.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" valign="top">                <p style="text-align:center">(C.B.K.
