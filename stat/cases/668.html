He works as a driver of tourist buses owned by the1st defendant, Yuen Hing-kwan. On 8th November 1975 the 2nd defendant had finished his assigments by 9.00 a.m. and was required todrive some hikers in a bus at that time from Tuen Mun Estate. However, he had received a message then that his sister was ill athome and as he wished to see whether she required hospitalization he declined the assignment so that he could return home. He wasgiven the use of a Nissan Cedric Diesel car with the registration no. AZ1390 for the latter purpose. This was the first time thathe had used the said vehicle.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> To go home from Tuen Mun Estate to Yuen Long Estate, the 2nd defendant had to go by way of Castle Peak Road. In order to go out toCastle Peak Road he had to stop at the junction of the road near Cheung Chun Wai. In his evidence, he says that he had to stop forabout 6 to 7 minutes at the junction. During the whole of that time, he had his foot on the brake pedal of the car and up to then,nothing in the braking system had caused him to be apprehensive. He was able to stop at the junction without any difficulty.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Seeing that the way was clear on the main road, he pulled out of the junction into Castle Peak Road and travelled forward in thedirection of Yuen Long. After having gone for a distance of about two miles at a speed of about 30 m.p.h. and having travelled inall for a period of about 15 minutes from the commencement of the journey, he had to apply his brakes hard in order to avoid a collisionwith another car which had suddenly made a U-turn into his side of the road from the opposite direction. Castle Peak Road is dividedinto two carriageways, one going to Kowloon and the other going towards Yuen Long. The road is separated in the centre by a centralreservation of 7 to 8 inches high all along the length of the road at that point, that is, at the 22 milestone. At certain intervalsof the central reservation are gaps through which vehicles could turn into the opposite carriageway in either direction and it wasat one of such gaps that the 2nd defendant found himself faced with a collision with the other car which had turned out suddenlyfrom the opposite carriageway. There are two lanes of traffic along the carriageway going towards Yuen Long and before the indidenthe describes above, the 2nd defendant was travelling in the outer lane. He says that throughout the 2 miles that he had travelledfrom the junction to that point, he was maintaining a constant speed of 30 m.p.h. and in order to do that, he had to press lightlyon the foot-brake from time to time, in all 3 to 4 times. On the occasions he had applied light pressure on the brakes he found thatthey were operating normally.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> In order to avoid the other car, he applied heavy pressure on his foot brakes, at the same time swerving to the left. However atthat moment, he found that the brakes were not working at all and his vehicle continued to swerve to the left towards the pavement.The two lanes of traffic along Castle Peak Road are separated from the pavement by an island which is about 5" high near that point,and on the left of the island is a cycle track. The defendant testifies that the car in continuing its course towards the pavementcame into contact with the island first and this was only effective in reducing the car's speed by about 13 m.p.h. The car continuedon its journey and climbed over the island and then landed onto the cycle track. Unfortunately at that moment the 1st plaintiff whowas pushing a wooden cart along the track (the 2nd defendant says that she had just come from the pavement onto the track), was hitfrom behind by the car. She fell on the ground and became unconscious. The car continued on its way sweeping the wooden cart underit and finally came to rest about 83 metres from the point of impact.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The 1st plaintiff suffered serious injuries to her abdomen and lower limbs and was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Following the collision, the 2nd defendant was seen by PC 10754 Ho Kin-kwok of the Traffic Accident Investigation Section, Yuen Long,and when asked how the accident happened, the 2nd defendant replied that it was due to a defective foot-brake. On 10th November 1975the car was examined by the Motor Vehicle Inspector Ng Ho-cheung and he reports:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(a)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">off side track rod outer ball joint loose;</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(b)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">foot brake: brake fluid reservoir empty.

No summons was however issued for the brakes not being in good andefficient working order.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> He pleaded guilty by letter to the offence of not maintaining the steering gear in good and efficient working order on 3rd March1976 and was fined $100 for that offence. However, with regard to the summons for careless driving the subsequent events which attendedit has a chequered history. On 13th April 1976 the 2nd defendant appeared in Fanling Magistracy, pleaded guilty to the offence ofcareless driving, and also admitted the brief facts constituting the said offence. Upon his submitting in mitigation of the offencethat the 'Brake pipe suddenly failed', a plea of not guilty was recorded and his case was adjourned to 26th June 1976 for re-hearing.On the appointed date he appeared at the Fanling Magistracy again and pleaded guilty to the same offence with the reservation "guiltybut I had a brake failure". Another plea of not guilty was recorded and the defendant was then asked to attend at the same Courton 20th September 1976. On the latter date, he pleaded guilty to the offence once again, admitted the brief facts of the offenceand saying at the end that he agreed that the incident arose as a result of his careless driving and that he no longer suggestedthat he had a brake failure. He was therefore convicted and fined $380 for the offence. The facts which he admitted on that occasionare as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="88%" class="quote">"At 09.40 hours on 8.11.75, the defendant was driving a private car AZ1390 along the inside lane of Castle Peak Road in the directionof Yuen Long, At a point outside Hing Tak School, 22 milestone Castle Peak Road, Lam Tei, defendant's vehicle ran over the islandon the left and landed on the nearside cycle track where the front part of the defendant's vehicle hit a stationary hand cart. Thecarter loading the cart was seriously injured. Defendant's vehicle ran for a further distance of 83 metres and came to a halt.

It appears from the facts which headmitted above that there is no indication as to how the accident occurred nor the manner of his driving which caused the accident,and was only explainable by the evidence of the Motor Vehicle Inspector that the brake fluid reservoir was empty when he examinedthe vehicle and that the emptying of that reservoir was due to a leak from a loose bleeding valve. This explanation is consistentwith the defendant's reply almost immediately after the accident that the brakes had suddenly failed. On the other hand, the Inspector'sevidence regarding the steering gear was that the defect was due to normal wear and tear and that such defect would not cause anydanger to the driving of the vehicle and that normally the driver would not know of that defect.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Moreover the Inspector agreed that the leakage from the brake fluid reservoir could have occurred just before the accident dependingon the number of times and the degree of the pressure on the foot brake pedal during the course of the journey of 2 miles. His furtheropinion is that it would take 4 to 5 downward pressure strokes on the brake pedal to empty the brake fluid reservoir so that therewould be a complete loss of braking effect. He tested the brakes after refilling the reservoir but a test which was not carried outwas to ascertain before tightening or replacing the loose bleeding valve how fast or how slow the fluid leaked out from the brakefluid reservoir in the course of the short journey such as the one which the 2nd defendant made before the accident, nor was anytest made to ascertain how long it would take under the conditions described by the 2nd defendant for the brake fluid reservoir toempty completely so as to render the brakes ineffective.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> The Motor Vehicle Inspector states further that the motor vehicle in question had not been serviced for half a year although thenormal servicing period for brakes of that type of vehicle would be once every 3 months. There are no indications in the evidenceas to what level the brake fluid in the reservoir was immediately after the accident and this could have been ascertained when the2nd defendant himself said at the scene that the brakes had failed. This would have indicated whether at the time the 2nd defendanttook over the car, which he says was the first time he had ever driven that particular car, the brakes were already less than efficientto stop the car in an emergency such as the one the 2nd defendant says he was faced with on 8th November 1975.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> On the evidence of the motor vehicle inspector and the 2nd defendant, I come to the conclusion that the principal cause of the accidentwas the failure of the brakes just before the accident and the 2nd defendant could not, his evidence not being capable of being challenged,have known the condition of the braking system of the vehicle when he started his journey from Tuen Mun Estate that day.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> The 2nd defendant says that in a panic he had driven his car against the island separating the traffic lanes on the Yuen Long boundcarriageway and the cycle track, instead of swerving towards his right, that is, towards the central reservation, which was higher.He says that he could not do so as there was a huge lorry carrying timber ahead of him so that in fact the only course open to himwas to swerve to his left. It has been submitted that the 2nd defendant should have slowed down at each intersection of the centralreservation because the gaps were provided for vehicles to change from one carriageway to the other. The question is whether it wouldhave been reasonable to do so in view of the fact that there is no law requiring this and moreover the Highway Code provides thatthe person making the U-turn should keep a look-out to see that traffic was clear before the turn is made. In the result, it wouldappear that the pleas made by the 2nd defendant to the summons for careless driving and of driving a motor vehicle without good andefficient steering gear were to my mind ill-conceived and that the explanation given by the defendant that he had so pleaded in orderto save time, money and inconvenience must be accepted.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p15" class="pseudopara" id="p15">15.</a> The plaintiffs base their case on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. I think the evidence so far of the brake failure and the emergenceof the private car in his path when he was driving along Castle Peak Road and the manner in which he drove since the failure of thebraking system of the car he was driving, rebut the application of that doctrine so far as the 2nd defendant is concerned. In theabsence of any proof even on a balance of probabilities that the 2nd defendant was so negligent in his driving skill as to be theprimary cause of the collision, I would hold that he is not liable for the accident which was caused to the 1st plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p16" class="pseudopara" id="p16">16.</a> On the other hand, the position of the 1st defendant is in my view quite different. The car in question is owned by the 1st defendant.He has not given any evidence regarding its condition prior to the accident and at the time when it was handed to the 2nd defendantto drive. Instead, his wife states in evidence that the car was usually driven by her and that she was in a better position to givean account of its condition. The car was purchased in January 1975, but it could not have been very satisfactory so far as its operationwas concerned since in March 1975, just about two months after it passed into the hands of the 1st defendant, the starter of thecar had to be repaired, albeit a minor repair. On l4th May 1975 the diesel fuel pump had to be repaired and adjusted, the carburettorjet had to be replaced, the clutch plate, oil filters and diesel filters had to be replaced as well. On 13th June 1975, the oil andair filters were replaced and on 21st July 1975, the fuel pump handle had to be repaired. All these repairs emerged from the invoicessubmitted by the 1st defendant but such repairs and replacements only refer to the defects in the engine and transmission systemof the car. There is no reference in any of the invoices to the braking system nor was any evidence given that the car itself hadbeen serviced and maintained except that the 1st defendant's wife said in evidence that the car was serviced once a month withoutany details or other evidence to support that statement, having regard to what was stated in evidence by the motor vehicle inspectorwhen he examined the car after the accident. The latter states that the fault in the braking system which caused the brakes to failas they did on the day of the collision could have been easily discovered if the car had been properly and regularly maintained inaccordance with the maintenance schedules provided for that particular car. He has given as his opinion based on the discovery ofdust and dirt which had accumulated on the engine surfaces that the vehicle had not been serviced for at least six months prior tothe accident and his further opinion is that the braking system should have been maintained once every three months. Moreover, theposition in which the brake fluid reservoir was placed beneath the bonnet of the car would easily have led the 1st defendant, hiswife, or any person servicing the vehicle, to have noticed on visual inspection, if the vehicle had been regularly maintained, thatthere was a leakage somewhere in the braking system. In my view, the onus is on the 1st defendant to rebut the doctrine by evidencethat he has not acted negligently.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p17" class="pseudopara" id="p17">17.</a> In Henderson v. Henry E. Jenkins (H.L.E.)(1970) A.C. 301, the appellant, who was the widow of a van driver killed by a lorry ownedby the respondents, in claiming damages, alleged inter alia that the respondents had been negligent in failing to keep the brakingsystem of the lorry in efficient repair. The accident had been due to a sudden escape of brake fluid from a hole in the hydraulicbraking system resulting from corrosion of the pipe, which was fitted under the lorry's chassis. Only 60% of the pipe could be seenon visual inspection with the pipe in situ and only the unseen part of the pipe had been affected by corrosion. The respondents pleadedthat the accident was caused by a latent defect which had occurred without any fault on their part and the existence of which wasnot discoverable by the exercise of reasonable care. At first instance, it was held by Nield, J., that as proper care had been takento maintain the vehicle; that the inspection of the pipes in situ was all that was required; and that, as the corrosion was at theback of the pipe, the respondents were not to blame for not seeing it; and that negligence had not been established. The Court ofAppeal, by a majority, upheld his decision. On appeal to the House of Lords, it was held (Lord Guest and Viscount Dilhorne dissenting)that the respondents could not rely on the defence of a latent defect not discoverable by the exercise of reasonable care unlessthey had taken all reasonable care in the circumstances, and to do so they had to show that there were no special circumstances inthe past use of the vehicle to indicate that the lorry might have been subjected to a corrosive agent resulting in the corrosionof the pipe. Accordingly, since the respondents had not adduced evidence of the past history of the vehicle, they could not relyon the defence of a latent defect and therefore, they had not discharged the inference that they had been negligent.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> In his judgment, Lord Pearson said: "My Lords, in my opinion, the decision in this appeal turns on what is sometimes called "theevidential burden of proof" which is to be distinguished from the formal (or legal or technical) burden of proof. Passages whichbear upon this distinction will be found in Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Southport Corporation  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%20AC%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) A.C. 218</a>, 230-1 per Devlin, J., and at pp. 242-3 per Lord Radcliffe, and in Barkway v.

For the purposes of the present case the distinction can be simply statedthis way. In an action for negligence the plaintiff must allege, and has the burden of proving, that the accident was caused by thenegligence on the part of the defendants. That is the issue throughout the trial, and in giving judgment at the end of the trialthe judge has to decide whether he is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accident was caused by negligence on the partof the defendants, and if he is not so satisfied the plaintiff's action fails. The formal burden of proof does not shift. But ifin the course of the trial there is proved a set of facts which raises a prima facie inference that the accident was caused by negligenceon the part of the defendants, the issue will be decided in the plaintiff's favour unless the defendants by their evidence providesome answer which is adequate to displace the prima facie inference. In this situation there is said to be an evidential burden ofproof resting on the defendants".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Unlike the pipe of the braking system in the cited case, the loose bleeding valve of the braking system in the instant case couldhave been easily discovered upon visual inspection (and, in this respect, the motor vehicle inspector's evidence must be accepted),if adequate maintenance or servicing of the braking system of the car in particular, and of the car itself in general, had been regularlycarried out by persons qualified to perform that task. Adopting with respect the principles set out in the above quoted judgmentof Lord Pearson, it is for the 1st defendant to provide some answer which is adequate to displace the prima facie inference of hisnegligence brought out by the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiffs. This neither he nor his witnesses have done, and in thecircumstances, I hold that he is liable to the plaintiffs for damages claimed as a result of the accident caused to the 1st plaintiff.</p>    <p align="left"><u>1st Plaintiff (Wong Ting)</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> Madam Wong Ting was admitted to the Neurosurgical Unit of Queen Elizabeth Hospital after the accident on 8th November 1975, and themedical report on her condition shows that although she was conscious at the time of admission, she was in shock and there were injuriesto:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(a)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">the tibia and fibula bones of the left leg;</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(b)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">fracture of the right thigh bone;</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(c)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">fracture of the left wrist;</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(d)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">fracture of the right elbow;</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(e)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">bruising of the forehead, left cheek, both thighs and the right knee; and</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(f)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="84%">multiple lacerations over the forehead, right thumb, both legs and left ankle.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> She later complained of a pain in the abdomen and after referral to the Surgical Unit "A" of the same hospital, an emergency operationwas carried out.

When she came out of hospital after the abovementioned period she had to use crutchesfor support for a period of at least 2 months. On 25th July 1977 she was examined further by Dr. Wedderburn and his findings are:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(a)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="12%">Left wrist:</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="74%">This wrist can only be bent 30 degrees and extended 50 degrees as against 90 degrees for both movements.

He states as his opinion that the 1st plaintiffwould feel discomfort in the affected area whenever there is a change in the degree of humidity and she would have aches and painsin those areas. Moreover the injuries to her legs would affect her walking ability, so far as distance and speed were involved andthere would be difficulty in going up and downstairs, especially downstairs. However, the most significant of his findings is thatshe would be incapable of performing any kind of manual labour and even though she would be able to do some work like making plasticflowers, or trimming garments or assembling watch straps, at home, she would not be able to do any of these things effiiciently becauseof a loss of manual dexterity due to the accident and that her work output would be one half of that of a normal person. Taking thesum total of her injuries and the results of the treatment she had undergone, Dr. Wedderburn is of the opinion that her total impairmentis 31%.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Dealing first of all with general damages, I have been referred to the cases of: (1) Ng Cheung-wai v. Lau Che-ming (OJA No. 2117of 1974) reported in HKLJ (1977) 149, where an award of $25,000 was made for pain and suffering and loss of amenities; (2) Fuk Nuiv. Lai Man-wai and anr. (OJA No. 2661 of 1977) reported in 8 HKLJ (1978) 256, where the sum of $40,000 for the same claims wouldhave been awarded; (3) Kwok Mei-tai v. Tang Yu-hand and anr. (HCA No. 3707 of 1977) reported in 9 HKLJ (1979) 100, where an awardof $15,000 was made; (4) Cho Suk-chun v. Chung Kai-yan and anr. (OJA No. 493 of 1976) 7 HKLJ (1977) 282, where an award of $75,000was made for pain and suffering and loss of amenities.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> It has been submitted on behalf of the defendants that the injuries suffered by the 1st plaintiff are less severe than those in theFuk Nui case, and consequently a lesser amount should be awarded to the 1st plaintiff. I disagree not only on the ground that theextent of the injuries sustained by the 1st plaintiff and the permanent results thereof are substantially more serious than thosein the Fuk Nui case but also the assessment of 31% impairment of the whole person is substantially more than that indicated for FukNui, whose impairment was assessed as at 15% so far as employment was concerned. However account has also to be taken of the injuryto her abdomen which Dr. Wedderburn has described as the most serious one of all and one which necessitated an operation. In ChoSuk-chun's case, the final impairment assessment was considered to be 30%, and the amount awarded was $75,000. There is no reasonwhy this latter amount should not be similarly awarded to the 1st plaintiff in respect of pain and suffering and loss of amenities.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The 1st plaintiff is primarily a housewife, and although she is stated to be 53 years of age, and there is some dispute over this,she does appear a little older. Prior to the accident, besides being a housewife, she was engaged in growing vegetables for the marketand assisting her husband in making noodles, which is his main occupation, and in raising chickens for market. The vegetables shecultivated were cut and brought to the Lam Tei Market every morning together with some noodles, and she would hawk these goods theretill they were all sold before returning home. It was on one of the return journeys from the market that she met with the presentaccident. She says she could earn some $40 per day, every day of the week, from the sale of such vegetables, and because of the injuriesshe received which caused her present impairment, she is no longer able to cultivate any more vegetables, with a consequent lossof all that income. She has however admitted that she had hawked without a licence in the Lam Tei Market and Mr. Faulkner on behalfof the defendants, has submitted that on the authority of Tam Choi v. Ho Wai-hing (1974) C.A. No. 19/74, that no award ought to bemade for loss of income, whether past or future on the ground that an unlicensed hawker is a person carrying on an illegal tradeand that it was against public policy for such a person to benefit from such unlawful activity.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> There is no evidence that she would have altered her mode of marketing the vegetables she cultivated except hawking them in the LamTei Market without a licence and there is no evidence that she would have applied for a licence either. Even if she wants to, theimpairment which she now suffers from as a result of the injuries she received in the accident would preclude her from carrying onfurther with cultivating vegetables, as she says, and there is therefore no likelihood that she would be engaging in another occupationin the near future as a substitute for her erstwhile occupation of hawking vegetables without a licence. Mr. Yeung seeks to distinguishthe Tam Choi case from that of the 1st plaintiff on the ground that, as paragraph 4(2)(a) of the Hawker (New Territories) Regulations,<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/132">Cap. 132</a> states;</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">"4(1)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="82%" class="quote">Subject to paragraph (2) no person shall hawk in the New Territories except under and in accordance with a licence.</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="6%" class="quote">(2)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="82%" class="quote">Notwithstanding paragraph (1):</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%" class="quote"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="12%" class="quote"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%" class="quote">(a)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="78%" class="quote">a person may hawk without a licence if he hawks in a place or area, whether a hawker bazaar or otherwise, set aside by the Directorby notice in the Gazette as being a place or area where a person may hawk without a licence during the period, the place or areais so set aside".</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left">the onus is on the defendants to prove that Lam Tei Market was not within the excepted areas set aside by the Director of Urban Servicesso as to enable the 1st plaintiff to hawk her vegetables without a licence. This argument is in my view untenable: the claim is madeby the 1st plaintiff against the defendants on the ground that she is entitled to a loss of income arising out of an occupation whichshe herself admits (by stating that she had been hawking vegetables without a licence), is contrary to paragraph 4(1) of the saidRegulations, and therefore illegal. In asserting this claim, having regard to Tam Choi's case, the onus, in my view, is on her toprove a fact essential to her claim, that is, that she comes under the exception provided in paragraph 4(2)(a) of the said Regulations,and that Lam Tei Market, which she says was where she plied her trade, was a place set aside under the said Regulations where a personmay hawk without a licence.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> It has also been submitted by Mr. Yeung that the income which the 1st plaintiff received from the sale of vegetables cultivated byher is not entirely as a result of hawking and that the income arises out of her labour in cultivating the vegetables for market.In my opinion, there were other outlets which she could have exploited to sell her vegetables other than hawking without a licence- one of which would have been to obtain a licence under the said Regulations, or to sell her vegetables to the wholesale market,without resorting to the illegal activity of the type condemmed in Tam Choi's case. If I am correct in my understanding of the argumentput forward on her behalf that the income which she obtained was the direct result of the labour expended in the cultivation of vegetablesfor the market, such an argument still lacks the connecting factor which is that without a market for the vegetables through sale,no income could be derived from such labour. In my view Tam Choi's case applies to the present claim for loss of income arising fromfarming business in paragraph (2) of the particulars of special damages of the statement of claim, and accordingly no award is madein respect of this item.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> It has been submitted by the defendants that the claim of $500 for the damage to the wooden cart, beam balance and stock carriedin the wooden cart, is too high as on the evidence of the 1st plaintiff herself, the wooden cart was valued at $120, the beam balancecost $40, the basket $20, and the stock carried in the basket was 2 cartons of noodles of 20 catties each, one type costing $4 percatty and the other costing $3. 50 per catty. The total amount for all these articles is $330, and an award of this amount is accordinglymade in respect of item (1) of special damages.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> The 1st plaintiff, as noted previously, spent a total of 8 months and 5 days in hospital and the maintenance charge therefor is $3per day. The defendants contend that the amount to be awarded under this head should only be $531.50 since this is the amount coveredby receipts produced in evidence. The amount claimed in respect of this item is $762 representing only the maintenance charge of$3 per day for the whole of the period the 1st plaintiff was in hospital, without taking into account the cost of two crutches whichshe was supplied with when she left hospital. There is no evidence to indicate that there was any remission of any of the medicalfees nor is there any evidence that she did not spend all of that time in hospital. Accordingly in respect of item (3) of specialdamage I award the sum of 247 x $3 + $5.5 for cost of crutches and this totals $747.50.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> Following her discharge from hospital the 1st plaintiff was required to undergo follow-up treatment and in the condition which shewas, having to go in and out of Lee Ka Yuen to Kowloon Hospital, she had to have the assistance of her husband. The travelling expensesincurred for the purpose of having her transported to and from the hospital is estimated to be $16 per visit and the claim of $192for this item is in my view reasonable and it is allowed.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> The cost of special foods, for which receipts have been submitted in respect of only $2,535.40, is claimed in the sum of $4500. Ithas been submitted that no award should be made with regard to this item since no evidence has been given as to the use to whichthese special foods had been put nor was there any medical evidence to support the healing effects of such foods. Dr. Wedderburn'sevidence on the value of special foods in this case is: "As long as she had adequate diet, special food is not necessary. Most Chineseof her class think special food is necessary, and if they do not do it it is tantamount that they are not looking after themselves.I do not think special food has any real value aside from pyschological effect".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> In the Fuk Nui case, Cons, J. referred to the criteria laid down by the Full Court in Mui Ling Kwan v. Wong Yin Wan  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20HKLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) H.K.L.R. 465</a> and said that he preferred the wide view of the Chief Justice as opposed to the narrow view of McMullin, J. in that decision. TheChief Justice's view in that case is expressed as follows: "At least, since Shearman v. Folland it has been customary to claim asspecial damages a sum for extra nourishment. And the Courts have almost invariably allowed a reasonable sum for such a claim, whethersuch a sum is reasonable must depend on the circumstances of each case. If the figure is challenged it must be proved that therewas expenditure on nourishment suitable to assist the recovery of the injured person. And it must be a reasonable sum. Obviouslyif a special diet is ordered by the physician or herbalist in charge of the case it should be allowed as an item of special damages,provided the amount is not unreasonable. What is not allowed is to saddle the defendant with the expenses of articles of luxury foodand drink which cannot be said to be appropriate and necessary (in the widest sense) in assisting in the cure of the injured person".In the same case, McMullin, J. said: "I had relied upon certain observations which appear in the 4th edition of Munkman at page 77when citing the case of Shearman v. Folland, the author subscribes to the view that extra nourishment may be made a subject of aclaim provided it is money spent on recognised invalid food such as chicken broth, Bovril etc. I do not think there is any open collisionbetween these decisions, although each approaches the problem from a somewhat different direction. I think however there should alwaysbe evidence to show that a special diet was adopted not wholly as a self-prescription of favourite delicacies but on the advice ofsome qualified person on whose judgment the Court can rely, it being left to the Court to decide in each given case, having regardto the nature of the advice and the efficacy of the prescription whether it was in all the circumstances justifiable. When no suchevidence is adduced the claim should be very narrowly regarded especially if it is substantial although no doubt even then it wouldbe open to a judge to make a nominal or small award provided he was satisfied that the diet included food stuffs of noted nutritionalworth". Further on in his judgment he says "What is important in every case is that there should be some evidence put before theCourt where a special food is the subject of a claim to support the advisability of that form of treatment".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> So far as the requirement of evidence showing the reasonableness, use, need and suitablity of a special food on the healing processis concerned, there seems to be no conflict between these 2 judgments.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> No evidence has been given by either of the plaintiffs that special foods, the cost of which is claimed at the rate of $300 per month,had been prescribed by any physician or bone-setter nor is there any evidence that such foods had been efficacious in the healingof the 1st plaintiff's injuries or that such foods had ameliorated the subsequent condition which was the result of such injuries,after her discharge from hospital, although the 2nd plaintiff did say that while the 1st plaintiff was still in hospital he did bringsome food to her everyday which he states was good for getting rid of bruises. In connection with claims for extra nourishment whilea plaintiff is a patient in hospital, I would refer to the following paragraph from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice inO.J. Action No. 1582 of 1972 (unreported):</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"He claims $700 for travelling expenses and extra nourishment. There is no evidence as to how that sum should be divided. A claimfor extra nourishment whilst in hospital unless it was ordered by the doctor cannot succeed. It is wrong that the defendant shouldhave to pay for the plaintiff's luxurious foods unless it is so ordered".</p>    </blockquote>    <p align="left"><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> In the absence of any evidence from a qualified person that the special foods mentioned in the receipts submitted in evidence bythe 2nd plaintiff have any nutritional or healing value so far as the 1st plaintiff is concerned, I would disallow this item in theclaim for special damages.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Two items of special damage were added with leave to the statement of claim on the first day of the trial, namely, (6) Home helpfor 2 years at $500 per month - $12,000; and (7) Dental expenses - $1,000.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Prior to the accident, the 1st plaintiff did the bulk of the household work for her family, laundry, marketing, cooking and generalcleaning, assisted by her mother, mother-in-law, and some of her children after school hours. When she returned home from the hospital,she says, and this is accepted, that she was unable to dress herself or do her own toilet, much less carry out any of the abovementionedtasks. She says that she had to employ a servant at a salary of $500 solely to look after her own needs as well as cooking and washingfor her alone. According to her own evidence and that of the person she had engaged to help her, a madam Tang Ng, the services ofthe latter were not secured until two months after she had returned home from hospital. Besides her husband, the 1st plaintiff livedin the house with her mother, mother-in-law and three children, and with the mother and mother-in-law staying at home most of thetime, and her husband as well, since he manufactures noodles in the same premises, there seems little reason for her to employ TangNg solely for the purposes she states. Surely it would have been more appropriate, if at that time she did not receive any assistancefrom her own family, to have employed someone as soon as she returned home, to look after her own needs. The evidence of Tang Ngas to the purpose and period for which she was employed by the 1st plaintiff is not altogether clear or straightforward and it hasbeen conceded by counsel for the plaintiffs that the period should be 18 months. This latter period is based on the evidence of Dr.Wedderburn regarding the final period in which no further or very little improvement can be expected in the 1st plaintiff's condition,that is, 2 to 2Â½ years after the date of the accident. One of the reasons which the 1st plaintiff has advanced for employing TangNg is that the 2nd plaintiff was busily occupied in making and marketing noodles and that he had therefore very little time to lookafter her minor needs. On the other hand, she states that whenever she went to Kowloon Hospital for follow-up treatment during the1Â½ year period after her discharge from hospital, she was invariably accompanied by her husband, the 2nd plaintiff. If she had employedTang Ng solely to look after her for 8 hours a day, it would have been more appropriate and convenient, in my view, granted thatthe 2nd plaintiff was so busy that he could not even spare a few minutes at certain times of the day to do the minor chores for her,for Tang Ng to have accompanied her to the hospital for follow-up treatment instead. Dr. Wedderburn has suggested that the 1st plaintiffwould have been able to dress and look after herself about 13 months after the accident, that is, about 5 months after her dischargefrom hospital. In the result I find that Tang Ng was employed not solely for the purpose of looking after the 1st plaintiff but alsoto work for the rest of the household and it is not unreasonable in my opinion having regard to Dr. Wedderburn's evidence statedabove and her having to attend for follow-up treatment for a period of 1Â½ years after her discharge from hospital for the claimon this item to be based on a period of 18 months. It is also not unreasonable for a salary of $500 per month to be paid to TangNg in view of the nature of the work involved and the general level of salaries for domestic help in Hong Kong during the years 1976and 1977. I would therefore award the sum of $9,000 in respect of this item.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> The 1st plaintiff seems to have been rather confused about her claim for $1,000 in respect of the cost of replacing some of the teethwhich she says were lost as a result of the accident. The loss of 3 of her teeth is mentioned in Dr. Wedderburn's report as follows:"She also lost 3 teeth in the lower jaw but she only has 3 on the left side so she only had 6 teeth in the lower jaw at the timeof the accident". In giving oral evidence on this matter in Court, Dr. Wedderburn added that he could not tell from looking at herteeth the disappearance of the 3 teeth, that is, whether there was such a loss as a result of the accident or through other causes.The 1st plaintiff has produced in evidence a receipt from a dentist, Dr. Tao Sun Man, for the sum of $1,000 being the cost of 7 unitsof K-gold teeth and tooth supports for the lower 11 units. In answer to a question asked of her in cross-examination, she statesthat all the 7 units of K-gold teeth were for the upper jaw and her claim referred only to 3 teeth which she had lost from the lowerjaw. The confusion she says was caused by the dentist including in the same receipt other dental work unconnected with the accident,although she had asked him specifically to make out separate receipts. According to the said receipt, the dental work was carriedout on 23rd May 1978 approximately 2Â½ years after the accident, and the explanations given by her for the long delay in attendingto her teeth were that she had no will-power to go out of her house at all before then and there was no urgency so far as her teethwere concerned. Yet she had all along been able to go to Kowloon Hospital for follow-up treatment. These so-called explanations arenot acceptable because if there had been a loss of 3 teeth out of a total of 6 teeth in the lower jaw, such loss would have causedher great difficulty in eating, and particularly because of some loss of food absorption in the small intestine due to a resectionof that organ brought about by injuries sustained by her in the accident. Moreover, from the receipt itself, there were more than6 teeth in the lower jaw in May 1978 because of the reference therein to "11 units of the lower jaw". In my view the receipt submittedin evidence is for dental work entirely unconnected with the accident and the claim for $1,000 on this item is therefore disallowed.</p>    <p align="left"><u>The 2nd Plaintiff (Chow Kam Pui)</u></p>    <p align="left"><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> The 2nd plaintiff, Chow Kam Pui, manufactures noodles at home for sale in shops and restaurants, and through his wife's hawking inLam Tei Market. He estimates his pre-accident income from this source at $2,000 per month. Besides this, he was also engaged in rearingchickens for the market and he estimates his income from this source at $200 to $300 per month on average. No claim has been madeby him in the statement of claim with regard to this latter income and in any event, the extent of the assistance provided by the1st plaintiff in the latter exterprise appears to be rather insignificant. No further consideration will be given to the allegedloss of this income as a result of the accident.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> In the 2nd plaintiff's noodle manufacturing business, three persons, including himself, were engaged. He himself performed the moreimportant task of preparing the dough and placing it in the various machines, four in all, used in manufacturing noodles. In thefinal machine process, the noodles are extruded in the form of strands and these latter are collected in pans or baskets by theirson who then cut the strands into uniform lengths. These lengths of noodles were then formed into cakes by the 1st plaintiff, whichare then placed in a steamer. After the noodle cakes are steamed, they are then taken out and dried in the open. From the descriptionsgiven by the 1st plaintiff and from a demonstration given by her in Court, it would appear that a certain amount of manual dexterityis required in forming the cakes from the noodle strands. The 2nd plaintiff states that egg noodles and noodles flavoured with shrimproe are formed into cakes and these comprised the bulk of the products which he manufactured and sold in the market. He says thatsince his wife's accident, he has not been able to carry on with the production of these types of noodles having lost the assistanceof his wife, and he estimates the reduction of his income from the business at $700 per month, down from $1,200 per month which hehad claimed at para. 4(1) of the statement of claim. Even if I accept his estimate of loss of $700 per month, it cannot be said thatsuch a loss can be entirely attributable to the non-availability of the 1st plaintiff's services to his business. Part of the losscould also have been due to their son's emigration from Hong Kong, albeit his reason for leaving Hong Kong was that there was insufficientbusiness for the family after the 1st plaintiff met with the accident. It has been suggested that the loss of income should be borneproportionately among the 3 members of the family engaged in the manufacture of noodles. This is a simplistic method to adopt andis one which commends itself because no records were kept of the business and it is difficult to say which of the 3 had the mostimportant function in the business although the 2nd plaintiff did say that he did the most important work of all of them. It hasbeen urged on behalf of the plaintiffs that the 1st plaintiff's services went far beyond that of an ordinary housewife and that thereforea multiplier, based on the age of the 1st plaintiff as being 53, should be adopted in calculating the amount of the award under thishead. No authority has however been cited for this proposition.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> On the other hand, this claim is challenged by the defendants on the ground that it is bad in law and no liability arises for purelyan economic loss unless it follows upon a physical loss of property in which the plaintiff has an interest.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p44" class="pseudopara" id="p44">44.</a> In support of the 2nd plaintiff's claim, the case of Behrens v. Bertram Mills Circus Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%202%20QB%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 2 Q.B. 29</a> was cited. In that case, the plaintiffs were midgets, and were husband and wife, exhibited together at a fun fair run in conjunctionwith a circus. Both sustained personal injury by a frightened elephant. The husband was fit for work in a week but the wife was unfitfor 8 months. The parties were exceptionally dependent on each other because they were dwarfs. The husband was particularly dependenton his wife, increased by the fact that they lived in a caravan near their place of work and in which they had to spend most of theirtime, as he was the main attraction as the supposedly smallest man on earth and could not mingle with the public when he was beingexhibited or was appearing in shows. He claimed loss of earnings for the whole of the 8 months his wife was unfit.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p45" class="pseudopara" id="p45">45.</a> It was held that it would not be reasonable to expect the husband to go touring or to go round fair grounds and exhibitions by himselfand without the company of his wife. The plaintiffs lived in a strange world and the bond between them must be stronger even thanthe ordinary tie of matrimony. It was a most exceptional case turning on the exceptional need which the husband had for the supportof his wife as a wife. He was entitled to recover his loss of earnings as damages.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p46" class="pseudopara" id="p46">46.</a> The ratio decidendi of that case was examined in Kirkham v. Boughey  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%203%20All%20ER%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 3 All E.R. 153</a>, where the plaintiff claimed loss of earnings in respect of injuries sustained by his wife and himself in a traffic accident. Hisclaim was not based on a loss of consortium, but on a contention that if he had acted reasonably he was entitled to any money lossas if the wrong had not been done to him, and he relied on the judgment of Devlin, J. in the abovementioned case. It was held thatthe plaintiff was not entitled to damages for loss of earnings, because the loss did not flow from the injuries that he sustainedand his right to recover damages in respect of the injuries that his wife sustained was limited to damages for loss of consortium,together with the cost of her medical treatment, etc., and damages for loss of consortium did not extend (as was admitted) to theplaintiff's loss of earnings; his loss of earnings was, therefore, damnum absque injuria. In the course of his judgment, Diplock,J. said of the Behrens case: "It is not quite clear to me that the ratio decidendi is not based on loss of consortium. The sum claimedwas a small one and it may well have been that if the husband had gone out on tour the cost of paying domestic assistance, plus thedamages for loss of consortium, would have exceeded his loss of earnings by staying at home. If so, it was a proper step to takein mitigation of damages and the loss of earnings would be recoverable. Counsel for the plaintiffs argues that the ratio decidendiis to be found at (1957) 1 All E.R. p. 597, where Devlin, J. says: "In fact, however, he did not go on tour. He preferred to stayat home and accept the loss of earnings; and in the very peculiar circumstances of this case I have held that his choice was a reasonableone. Can he then recover his loss of earnings as damages? To hold that he can may be breaking new ground in this type of action,but I can see no reason in principle why he should not be thus compensated". Then come the words on which counsel for the plaintiffsparticularly relies: "The assessment of damages must be governed by those principles which apply generally in the law of tort and,provided he acts reasonably, he must be put in as good a position, so far as money can do it, as if the wrong had not been done tohim. I repeat that on the facts this is a most exceptional case, turning on the exceptional need which the husband had for the supportof his wife as a wife. Because of that I think that he is entitled to recover". I, of course, accept the principle that "the assessmentof damages must be governed by those principles which apply generally in the law of tort and, provided he acts reasonably, he mustbe put in as good a position, so far as money can do it, as if the wrong had not been done to him." It depends, however, on whichis the "wrong done". I have already given reasons for holding that the only wrong done is the injury to the husband's quasi-proprietaryrights in the consortium, and if this judgment is to be read as extending the rights of the husband of an injured wife, it is, Ithink, out of harmony with the speeches of their Lordships in Best v. Samuel Fox &amp; Co. Ltd. I therefore hold, as a matter oflaw, that the wages are not recoverable."</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p47" class="pseudopara" id="p47">47.</a> The Behrens case came up for discussion again in McNeil and anor. v. Johnstone  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%203%20All%20ER%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 3 All E.R. 16</a>, where in an action for damages against the defendant for negligent driving, the husband claimed as special damage (among other items)the month's salary which he had lost and some expenses of going to and from between Swindon and Margate, hotel bills and travellingexpenses in connection with the wife's treatment or final visits to the hospital. In his judgment, Devlin, J. said: "If one investigatesthe law on the subject and seeks to relate the recovery of this sum to some legal principle, it can only be that it is recoverableas damages for loss of consortium.... The real ground of recovery would have to be loss of consortium. It would have to be said thatthe husband was entitled to have the consortium of his wife - taking the consortium in the very widest sense of the companionshipof his wife. He could, therefore, very easily because of the loss of companionship of his wife have had her treated in some hospitalnearby in Margate. It could not have been objected, if he had done that, that he could have taken the cheapest possible way of treatinghis wife and sent her to Swindon - that he ought to have left her alone for months and not gone near her. The answer to that as amatter of law must, I think, be that his visits were necessary for her health or that he was entitled to have her companionship,or that if he had sent her to Swindon he would possibly have had a claim for general damages, but a claim nevertheless for loss ofconsortium during that period of one month. If he had a claim for that loss of consortium, it appears to me that he must have a claimfor the alternative. Thus, if the husband could claim damages of Â£100 for loss of consortium during a month - I take Â£100 as anotional figure - and if, in order to preserve his consortium and therefore save the defendant paying him Â£100 the husband gaveup his earnings during that month so as to be free to see his wife, he must be entitled to the earnings as an alternative. That isin substance what I was trying to say (though I cannot have said it very clearly) in a passage which Diplock, J. quoted in Kirkhamv. Boughey  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%202%20All%20ER%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 2 All E.R. 153</a> at p. 157), which in turn has been cited to me in this case. Perhaps I would be wiser not to say anything more about it because itmay be that, speaking extemporare, I may make matters worse; but that, as I say, is what I was seeking to say and I do not thinkthat there is anything in what, in fact, Diplock, J. decided which is inconsistent with that. Diplock, J. decided the case beforehim on the basis he refers to expressly (id., at p. 156), that the claim for damages in that case was not based on loss of consortium.On that basis I should, if I may say so respectfully, have reached the same conclusion as Diplock, J. reached on the facts of Kirkhamv. Boughey. Whether consortium can extend to companionship in the broadest sense of the word is, of course, a difficult point todecide. I considered in Behrens v. Bertram Mills Circus, Ltd that in the very exceptional circumstances of that case it did. WhetherI should have considered it in this case to be equally applicable, I do not know".</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p48" class="pseudopara" id="p48">48.</a> The stress in the Behrens case has been on the "very exceptional circumstances" of the case itself and the decision was based ona loss of consortium which was extended to a loss of companionship. Similarly, in McNeil and anor. v. Johnstone, the decision wasbased also on a loss of consortium and on the special circumstances of the case itself. So far as para. 4(1) of the statement ofclaim is concerned, I am of the opinion that no support can be gained from these two cases and I would prefer to follow the reasoningin the judgment in Kirkham v. Boughey, and hold that the claim for loss of profits is damnum absque injuria and make no award underthat head. Similarly, I would apply the same reasoning to the claim made under para. 4(2) of the statement of claim, and also makeno award under that head. I would add with regard to this claim that the 2nd plaintiff could have kept up contacts with his customers,who were mostly in Kowloon, at those times when he was not visiting his wife in hospital and thus minimise the loss which he sayshe sustained as a result.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p49" class="pseudopara" id="p49">49.</a> The 2nd plaintiff's claim for travelling expenses at $2,000 is challenged on the ground that they are excessive and that $6.30 fora round trip from Yuen Long to Kowloon would be reasonable, this figure having been provided by the plaintiff himself in evidence.I think this figure reasonable and accordingly an award is made based on the period of 247 days which the 1st plaintiff spent inhospital, the total sum coming to $1,556.10.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p50" class="pseudopara" id="p50">50.</a> With regard to the 2nd plaintiff's claim for loss of consortium I would refer to the case of Lawrence v. Biddle  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%201%20All%20ER%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 1 All E.R. 575</a> where it was held that damages for loss of consortium are based in the main on loss of servitium - the fact that the wife cannotor will not or does not perform the usual household services. It is not necessary, for such a claim to succeed that there shouldbe a period of total loss of consortium. Although the household work was shared among the various members of the family, neverthelessthe 1st plaintiff did a large share of it, and I agree that prior to the accident that her services to the 2nd plaintiff extendedfar beyond those of an ordinary housewife. She was in fact a vital economic unit of the family whilst there has not been a totalloss of consortium, the partial loss so far as servitium is concerned is not insubstantial from her evidence and that of the husband.In Cutts v. Chumley  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%201%20WLR%20742" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 1 W.L.R. 742</a> it has been held that a claim could lie both for loss of services (which was total) and loss of society, and following Lawrence v.Biddle it was not necessary that the loss of society should be total. A substantial award was made for loss of services in that casealthough in Hare v. British Transport Commission it was said by Lord Goddard, C.J. that "loss of consortium still survives as a causeof action, but it is not one, I think, for which the Courts should give generous compensation in addition to such legitimate expensesas a husband has had to incur on account of his wife's absence". In the circumstances, I would depart from the suggested ceilingof $1,500 usually awarded in Hong Kong for loss of consortium, and award the sum of $2,000 in respect of this claim. In doing so,I take into account the sum of $9,000 awarded to the 1st plaintiff for home help in respect of her claim.</p>    <p align="left"><a name="p51" class="pseudopara" id="p51">51.</a> There will therefore be judgment for the 1st plaintiff against the 1st defendant as follows:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="54%">General damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="20%">$75,000.00</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p align="left"><a name="p52" class="pseudopara" id="p52">52.</a> Special damages:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(1)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%">Damage to wooden cart, beam balance and stock carried in the wooden cart</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="20%">$330.00</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(3)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%">Medical fees from 8th November 1975 to 28th February 1977</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="20%">$747.50</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(4)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%">Travelling expenses to and from hospital for the period from 12th July 1976 to 28th February 1977 at HK$16 per visit</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:right" width="20%">$192.00</td>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="20%"></td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td valign="top" style="text-align:center" width="6%"></td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="4%">(6)</td>            <td valign="top" align="left" width="50%">Home help -
