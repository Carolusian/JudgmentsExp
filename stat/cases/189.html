The email was headed âsubject: cnnâ (âthe CNN Emailâ), and it compriseda schedule containing the names and details of the remuneration packages of 16 of the Groupâs senior CMTS employees (includingthe Defendant) then based in the Groupâs Hong Kong or Singapore branches, all of whom were colleagues of the Defendant who wereworking closely with him in the same âteamâ.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Of the said 16 employees, 9 of them (including the Defendant) tendered their notices of resignation in the period from 29 July to15 August 2011 and joined the same Plaintiffâs competitor after the expiry of the non-competition clauses in their respective employmentcontracts with the Plaintiff (if there was such term in the contract of the relevant employee).</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In view of the above, the Defendant was directed to attend an investigation meeting with the Plaintiffâs senior personnel on 10August 2011 to explain the purposes of the CNN Email.  According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant attended the meeting but failedto provide a satisfactory or credible explanation for his conduct.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 16 August 2011, the Defendant immediately terminated his employment with the Plaintiff by making a substantial payment in lieuof notice rather than to attend the disciplinary hearing originally scheduled on 17 August 2011 for the investigation of the Defendantâssuspected misconduct.  Further, the Defendant originally agreed to permit the Plaintiff to have access to his personal computer andpersonal email account to facilitate the investigation.  However, the Defendant, through a letter from his solicitors, withdrew suchconsent on 16 August 2011.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  It is the Plaintiffâs âfirm beliefâ that the Defendant had disclosed information contained in the CNN Email to the Plaintiffâscompetitor for the purpose of assisting that competitor in recruiting the individuals concerned as a team of new employees to joinits competing division in the same region including Hong Kong.  Further, it is the Plaintiffâs case that the Defendant had actedin breach of his duties of good faith and fidelity by encouraging his colleagues to leave the Plaintiff and to join a competitor.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  By reason of the said alleged wrongful acts, the Plaintiff claims against the Defendant for, <i>inter alia</i>, damages and a declaration that the Defendant is still bound by the non-competition and non-solicitation of employees clauses inhis employment contract with the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Jurisdictional issues</i></p><p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In determining whether the Statement of Claim should be struck out, the first question I have to consider is whether the Plaintiffâsclaim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.  If the answer is in the affirmative, this court has no optionbut to strike out the claim.</p><p class="heading"><i>(i) Statutory provision</i></p><p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">S. 7</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25" class="autolink_findacts">Labour Tribunal Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/25">Cap. 25</a> (âLTOâ) provides that the Tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the claims specified in the Scheduleof the LTO (âthe Scheduleâ).  The Schedule reads as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>â1. A claim for a sum of money which arises from â</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>(a)</i> <i>The breach of a term, whether express or implied, of a contract of employment, whether for performance in Hong Kong or under a contractto which the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts for Employment Outside Hong Kong Ordinance</a> (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/78">Cap. 78</a>) applies;</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>â¦ â¦. â¦</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the tribunal shall not have jurisdiction to hear and determine a claim for a sum of money,or otherwise in respect of a cause of action, founded in tort whether arising from a breach of contract or a breach of a duty imposedby a rule of common law or by any enactment.</i></p>        <p class="quote"><i>â¦ â¦ â¦â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Obviously, the establishment of the Labour Tribunal was intended to provide an informal forum for employees to pursue their claimsfor unpaid wages and other statutory payments in a speedy manner. However, the Schedule also covers claims by the employers.  Inmany cases, the employers are claiming damages or other relief against their existing or previous employees for breach of restrictivecovenants, breach of fiduciary duties and breach of confidence.  The proper forum for the adjudication of these kinds of claims isa question that has haunted the courts for many years.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In the following, I would go through the authorities and deal with some of the legal principles which are relevant in determiningwhether the Labour Tribunal does have exclusive jurisdiction over the Plaintiffâs claim in the present case.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(ii) Liquidated and unliquidated claims</i></p><p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The Plaintiffâs claim is for unliquidated damages arising from the alleged wrongful acts of the Defendant.  However, despite theuse of the words âa sum of moneyâ in the Schedule, it is trite law that a claim for unliquidated damages for breach of an employmentcontract is still one within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal (see: <i>Panalpine (Hong Kong) Ltd v Ulrich Haldemann</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20HKLR%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] HKLR 275</a>, <i>Citipost (Asia) v Julian Robert Holliday</i>, unreported, CACV No. 111 of 2004, [2005] HKEC 200 and <i>Gain Hill (Hong Kong) Ltd v Li Lin Yip</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%204%20HKLRD%20186" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 4 HKLRD 186).</a></p>    <p class="heading"><i>(iii) Type of relief claimed by the claimant</i></p><p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Since Â§1 of the Schedule covers only a claim for âa sum of moneyâ, whether the Labour Tribunal does have jurisdiction overa particular claim depends on the type of relief claimed by the claimant.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In many of the claims by the employer against employee for breach of restrictive covenant and breach of fiduciary duties, the employeris often seeking for an injunction to restrain the employee to continue the alleged wrongful conduct.  If the employer is claimingfor relief other than monetary relief, the Labour Tribunal would no jurisdiction to entertain the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Conceptually, I have some difficulty with such criterion. Labour Tribunal provides a quite different mode of operation as comparedwith other civil courts.  The procedures in the Tribunal are more informal in nature. Further, as the presiding officer in the Tribunalhas a general duty to investigate the claim, the proceedings are much more inquisitorial in the Tribunal.  In such circumstances,it is very difficult to see why a same claim can be subject to two possible regimes simply because of the difference in the typeof relief claimed by the claimant.  Conceptually, it would make much more sense that the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal woulddepend on the nature of the claim rather than the type of relief claimed by the parties.  Nevertheless, this is the law as it nowstands.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  In order to avoid abuses, the court would examine whether a claim for non-monetary relief is âwindow dressingâ.  If the answeris in the affirmative, the court would disregard the claim for non-monetary relief and hold that the claim is one simply for âasum of moneyâ thereby falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal (see: <i>Gain Hill (Hong Kong) Ltd v Li Lin Yip, supra.,</i> and <i>Ngan Yu Chiu v New World First Bus Services Ltd</i>, unreported, DCCJ No. 824 of 2009, [2010] HKCU 836).</p>    <p class="heading"><i>(iv) Claim for damages arising from breach of a term of the contract of employment or breach of employeeâs fiduciary duty</i></p><p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Provided that the claimant is not claiming for other non-monetary relief, <i>Citipost (Asia) v Julian Robert Holliday</i>, unreported, CACV No. 111 of 2004 (decision of the Court of Appeal on 8 February 2005) is the clear authority for the propositionthat a claim by the employer against employee or former employee for loss and damages arising from breach of an express or impliedterm of the contract of employment or breach of fiduciary duties is one falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal(see also: <i>Glock (HK) Ltd v Brauner</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%204%20HKC%20186" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2007] 4 HKC 186).</a>  <i>Citipost</i> is a Court of Appeal decision which is clearly binding on this court.</p><p class="heading"><i>(v) Claim founded in both contract and tort</i></p><p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  The Court of Appealâs decision in <i>Citipost</i> is certainly based on the wording in Â§1 of the Schedule, which is a jurisdiction-conferring provision.  However, there is oftenoverlap between claims in Â§Â§1 and 3 of the Schedule.  Since Â§3 is a jurisdiction-exclusion provision, there is always some tensionbetween the operation of these two paragraphs.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Â§3 of the Schedule states that â[notwithstanding] paragraphs 1 and 2, the tribunal shall not have jurisdiction to hear and determinea claim for a sum of money, or otherwise in respect of a cause of action, founded in tort whether arising from a breach of contractor a breach of a duty imposed by a rule of common law or by any enactmentâ.  Obviously, one of the main objects of this paragraphis to exclude personal injuries claims from the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  In <i>Gain Hill (Hong Kong) Ltd v Li Lin Yip</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%204%20HKLRD%20186" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] 4 HKLRD 186</a>, the plaintiff dismissed its employee, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, for allegedly misusing confidential information, setting up the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in direct competition with it, and using the confidential information to solicit the plaintiffâs customers and to placeorders with the plaintiffâs supplier.  The plaintiff brought proceedings in the Court of First Instance claiming for injunctiverelief and damages for breach of confidence and/or breach of employment contract and/or breach of employeeâs fiduciary duties. The defendants sought to stay the proceedings on the basis that the Labour Tribunal did have exclusive jurisdiction over the claim. Sakhrani J held that the claim for injunctive relief was not âwindow dressingâ.  Further, the claim for breach of confidencewas founded in both contract and tort and so it fell within both Â§Â§ 1 and 3 of the Schedule, but by Â§3, the Tribunalâs jurisdictionwas excluded.  Hence, the Court of First Instance did have jurisdiction to entertain the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  In his judgment, Sakhrani J referred to <i>Citipost (Asia) v Julian Robert Holliday, supra,</i> in which there was, <i>inter alia</i>, also a claim for breach of confidence.  However, since the counsel in <i>Citipost</i> conceded that the plaintiffâs pleading did not contain the necessary allegations to support a breach of confidence action, theCourt of Appeal did not need to deal with the application of Â§3 of the Schedule in that case.  But in the case before Sakhrani J,the plaintiffâs breach of confidence claim could be founded both in contract and tort, and so by Â§3, the Labour Tribunal had nojurisdiction over the claim.  In reaching his decision about the effect of Â§3, Sakhrani J also referred to the similar <i>dicta</i> of Kwan J, as she then was,  in <i>Estinah v Golden Hand Indonesian Employment Agency</i>, unreported, HCSA No. 6 of 2001, [2001] HKEC 985 in support of his reasoning.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Although both <i>Gain Hill</i> and <i>Estinah</i> are not strictly binding on this court, I myself agree with the <i>dicta</i> of both Sakhrani and Kwan JJ in the said two respective decisions because their interpretation of Â§3 of the Schedule is in accordancewith the plain wording of the provision. </p>    <p class="heading"><i>(vi) Application of the said legal principles to the present case</i></p><p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Has there been no claim for breach of confidence, based on the authorities mentioned above, I agree that the Labour Tribunal doeshave exclusive jurisdiction over the Plaintiffâs claim.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Firstly, although the Plaintiffâs claim is for unliquidated damages as opposed to liquidated damages, it is clear that the LabourTribunal does have jurisdiction to entertain unliquidated claims.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Secondly, although the Plaintiff also claims for a declaration that the Defendant is still bound by the non-competition and non-solicitationof employees clauses in the contract of employment, I am of the view that such claim is purely âwindow dressingâ.  In fact, inthe letters of the Defendantâs solicitors dated 1 September and 3 October 2011, the Defendant had already confirmed that he wasbound by the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses in the employment agreement.  Although there was a dispute between theparties about the effect of such confirmation (as the Defendant demanded for the monthly payments in return for the confirmation),the declaration serves no particular purpose as the effect of the clauses would have expired fairly soon.  Furthermore, even if theDefendant were in breach of these non-competition and non-solicitation clauses, an award of damages would be a sufficient remedyfor the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Despite these observations, the Court of First Instance does have jurisdiction over the Plaintiffâs claim because it is, in substance,a claim for breach of confidence which can be founded both in contract and tort.  I agree that the Plaintiff has not expressly pleadedbreach of confidence as a cause of action in the Statement of Claim.  However, the facts pleaded by the Plaintiff certainly supportsuch cause of action.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had passed the confidential information relating to the remuneration packages of the 16employees to the Plaintiffâs competitor in order to assist the latter to recruit the said employees.  The information was certainlyconfidential in nature and the Defendant had allegedly misused the confidential information. In fact, this is the only wrongful conductknown to the Plaintiff at this stage.   As breach of confidence claim can be founded both in contract and tort, by operation of Â§3of the Schedule, the Labour Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claim.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  Mr. Carolan, counsel for the Plaintiff, confirms that the Plaintiff is relying on breach of confidence as a cause of action againstthe Defendant.  If the pleading does not disclose the cause of action relied on, an opportunity to amend may be given even thoughthe formulation of the amendment is not before the court (see: <i>CBS Songs Ltd v Amstrad</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20RPC%20417" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] RPC 417</a> and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20RPC%20429" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] RPC 429</a> and Â§18/19/4 <i>of Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2012</i>).  As the Court of First Instance clearly has jurisdiction over the Plaintiffâs claim, instead of striking out the claim, generalleave should be granted to the Plaintiff to amend the Statement of Claim to include the breach of confidence claim against the Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  In the existing pleading, the Plaintiff has also claimed against the Defendant for breach of his duties of good faith and fidelityby encouraging his colleagues to leave the Plaintiff and to join a competitor. At this stage, I am not going to comment whether thereis sufficient evidence to support such cause of action.  But if the Plaintiff still wants to include such cause of action in theamended pleading, it is arguable that the Court of First Instance does have jurisdiction over the entire claim of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Â§Â§1 and 3 of the Schedule refer to âa claim for a sum of moneyâ, and not âa cause of actionâ.  As the Plaintiffâs damagesfor breach of confidence would, in substance, be more or less the same as the damages for breach of fiduciary duty caused by thealleged act of the Defendant in encouraging his colleagues to leave the Plaintiff, it is actually one single claim of the Plaintiffâfor a sum of moneyâ which is based on two separate causes of action.  Hence, the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction overthe entire claim of the Plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>Other defects in the pleading</i></p><p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  There are also other complaints about the pleading.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  According to Ms. Ismail, counsel for the Defendant, the material facts in support of the claim have not been included in the pleading,as the Plaintiff only expresses a âbeliefâ, and alleges an âinferenceâ, in the pleading that the Defendant had disclosedinformation to a competitor.</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  This is certainly a legitimate complaint.  At this stage, the Plaintiff may not know the details of the alleged communication, ifany, between the Defendant and the Plaintiffâs competitor.  Despite that, at the trial, the Plaintiff may rely on circumstantialevidence to ask the court to draw an inference that the Defendant had indeed passed the confidential information to the Plaintiffâscompetitor.  Although the Plaintiff may not be able to supply the full particulars of the alleged communication at this stage, thepositive fact that the Defendant had passed the confidential information to the Plaintiffâs competitor, which is a material facton which the Plaintiff relies to establish the necessary element of his cause of action, needs to be expressly pleaded.  In the absenceof such material fact, the pleading is defective.  Mr. Carolan does not seek to argue otherwise and agrees that there is room forimprovement of the pleading.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  At this stage, I do not think that I need to deal with the other complaints of the Defendant about the pleading.  The Statementof Claim will have to be substantially amended to include the breach of confidence claim.  If the amended pleading is still defective,the Defendant can then make another application to strike out the pleading.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  However, I must add that, unlike the case of <i>Total Lubricants Hong Kong Ltd v Christophe de la Cropte de Chanterac</i>, unreported, HCA No. 1694 of 2008, [2009] HKCU 2031 in which Poon J struck out, <i>inter alia</i>, a claim for breach of confidence, the confidential information has been properly identified in the present case, ie. the remunerationpackages of the 16 employees.  Hence, provided proper amendments are made to the pleading, there is basis to support the breach ofconfidence claim.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  I therefore make the following order:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(i) general leave be granted to the Plaintiff to amend the Statement of Claim;</p>        <p>(ii) the Plaintiff do file and serve the Amended Statement of Claim within 21 days; and</p>        <p>(iii) the Defendantâs summons dated 3 October 2011 be dismissed with liberty to the Defendant to make a fresh striking out applicationafter the filing of the Amended Statement of Claim.</p>        <p>I also make an order <i>nisi t</i>hat the costs of the said summons, including the costs of the amendments, if any, be paid by the Plaintiff to be taxed if not agreed.The order <i>nisi</i> shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this Decision.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>Revision of the Schedule</i></p><p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In my view, the existing state of law relating to the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal is unsatisfactory.  Apart from the conceptualdifficulty mentioned in Â§18 above, the courts would, from time to time, be asked to consider whether a particular claim for non-monetaryrelief is âwindow dressingâ.  Such kind of argument is quite unnecessary.  Instead of wasting time on these peripheral issues,the court should focus more on the merits of the claims.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  As I see it, the Labour Tribunal was intended as an informal forum for employees to pursue their claims for wages and other statutorypayments in a speedy manner.  I doubt whether it was the intention of the legislature that the Tribunal should be asked to adjudicatecomplex claims by employer against employee for breach of fiduciary duties.  In my view, it can avoid a lot of unnecessary argumentsif such kind of claim is excluded all together from the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal.  In such case, the Tribunal can focuson and has more resources to deal with the more pressing claims by employees for unpaid wages and other statutory payments.</p>    <p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">      <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(David Lok)<br />        Deputy High Court Judge <br /></td>        </tr>    </table><!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p> </p>	<p>Mr. Paul Carolan, instructed by Messrs.
