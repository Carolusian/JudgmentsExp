(9) and subparagraphs (11) - (13) of the Statement of Claim falls outside the ambit of Ss. 5(1), 15(1) and 16 of Food BusinessRegulations, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/132X">Cap. 132X</a>, in that <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/132X">Cap.132X</a> were regulations relating to food and drug hygiene connected with sale of food for humanconsumption or drugs for use by man, and the manufacture, preparation, transport, storage, packaging, marking, exposure for sale,service or delivery of food intended for sale or sold for human consumption and drugs for use by man, and ice, or otherwise for protectionof the public health in connection with any such matters, and was not legislation which was in any way related to the Plaintiffâscause in this action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  The Defendant pointed out unnecessary repetitions of the particulars of breach of employment contract and/or breach of employerâscommon duty of care and/or negligence under subparagraphs (1) â (35) of the Statement of Claim. Subparagraph (3) was repeated insubparagraph (13); subparagraph (4) was repeated in subparagraph (9) and essentially covered in subparagraph (30); subparagraph (5)was repeated in subparagraph (21) and also covered in subparagraph (6); subparagraph (7) was covered by subparagraph (8); subparagraph(12) was essentially the same as subparagraph (17); subparagraph (18) &amp; (19) were covered by subparagraph (20); subparagraph(28) was essentially the same as subparagraph (27); and subparagraph (35) was repeated in paragraph 18 and paragraph (35) was noteven a particular of breach. The Defence asked for these repetitive parts be struck out for reason of being irrelevant or unnecessaryrepetitions and/or tend to embarrass or prejudice or delay the fair trial of the action. It is also prolix and tends to embarrassthe Defendant, and it is so obvious on the view of the pleadings that it ought to be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Defendant further submitted that besides Order 18 Rule 19 of the Rules of the District Court, this court under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sec. 48</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/336">Cap. 336</a>, has the same ancillary power as the inherent jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance to strike out and not to condonesuch pleadings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Plaintiff opposed the Defendantâs application. The Plaintiff says that negligence and breach of statutory duties are interrelated and must be read and considered as a whole when the trial judge comes to consider whether the Defendant has fallen belowthe reasonable duty of care as imposed on an employer. Their argument was that although the statute did not allow a breach of statutoryduty to be actionable in a civil proceeding, it does not preclude the plaintiff in a civil claim for negligence to plead the breachof statutory duty and bring that out in the trial. There is no rule or case law to show that it is not permissible to plead a breachof statutory duty and to prove it as a fact in the trial. The Plaintiff says that breach of statutory duty in industrial safety legislationhave often resulted in common law action based on both negligence and breach of statutory duties, and in striking out the breachesof statutory duties, the trial judge would be precluded from hearing evidence in this area and take these into his/her consideration.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Plaintiff also says that superfluous parts or unnecessary repetitions in the pleadings were not a sufficient ground to allowan application to be struck out. The court should only do so when it was plain and obvious that the matter pleaded could not possiblybe relevant and unarguable, and if there is doubt, the matter should be left to the trial judge.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In <i>So Pak Hung   v.  Cheung Chow  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%203%20HKC%20694" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 3 HKC 694</a></i> at 694H, 699C-F, the English case of <i>Mayor and Councillors of City of London  v  Horner (1914)</i> was referred to:  â<i>For the purposes of the present case I  take âembarrassingâ to mean that the allegations are so irrelevant that to allow themto stand would involve useless expense, and would also prejudice the fair trial of the action by involving the parties in a disputethat is wholly apart from the issues. In order that the allegations should be struck out from a defence upon that ground, it seemsto me that their irrelevancy must be quite clear and so to speak, apparent at the fist glance. It is not enough that on considerableargument it may appear that they do not afford a defenceâ¦â¦â¦ But the point rather is, and I think is the only point, whetherit is so manifest on the view of the pleadings, merely reading through the pleadings, that it is one which does not admit of plausibleargument and that on that ground it ought to be struck out as embarrassing to the trial of the real issue.â</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The Plaintiff says the Defendantâs application to strike out parts of the Plaintiffâs pleadings should be dismissed with costsof the application to the Plaintiff together with certificate for counsel, and also ask for costs of the Plaintiff summons to askfor time extension to file the Defence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In addition to common law negligence pleaded in the statement of Claim (par. 18 therein), the Plaintiff had also alleged breachesof statutory duties, and, negligence and breaches of statutory duties were pleaded under different headings, each as a separate causeof action. It clearly appears that the Plaintiffâs claim is founded on distinct and separate causes of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=14%20Sec%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">14.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sec 19(a)</a></a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59" class="autolink_findacts">Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap. 59</a> expressly provides that âThis Ordinance does not confer a right of action in civil proceedings in respect of a failureto comply with Section 6A, â¦..â. Section 6A and section 19(a) of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/59">Cap. 59</a> were the equivalent of Ss. 2(1)-(2) and 47(1) of theHealth and Safety at work Act 1974 which also provides ââ¦For breaches of such general health and safety duties, no civil actionlayâ¦â (see. Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts (19<sup>th</sup> edition) at 13-28. The right to plead this as a cause of action in a civil claim is plainly precluded by statute. In the circumstances,the Plaintiff was clearly wrong to plead what had been precluded by statute as a cause of action. Therefore this part of their pleadingshould be struck out for want of cause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=15%20Sec%2032" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">15.</a>  <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sec. 32(1)(a)</a></a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A" class="autolink_findacts">Factories and Industrial Undertakings Regulations</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A">Cap. 59A</a> provides that â<i>accumulations of dirt and refuse shall be removed daily by suitable method from the floor</i>â¦.â, and the Plaintiff in subparagraph (7) alleged a cause of action arising from a failure to â<i>prevent the accumulation of water and/or fish scales on the ground floor of the kitchen immediately before the happening of the accident,contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 32(1)(a)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A">Cap. 59A</a></i>â.  This is clearly wrong and misleading to be used as a viable cause of action. This part is clearly unarguable and should alsobe struck out for want of cause of action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Likewise in subparagraph (9) of the Statement of Claim, it was alleged that the Defendant was being negligent in failing to maintainthe floor of the kitchen in a good state of repair and free from spalls, contrary to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 39(1)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A">Cap. 59A</a>. From what were pleaded in the Statement of Claim, there were no assertion which amounted to any breach of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 39(1)</a> of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/59A">Cap. 59A</a>. It is hard to understand why subparagraph (9) had been put into the Statement of Claim. It appears to be irrelevant,unarguable and should also be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The Statement of Claim in paragraph (9) and subparagraphs (11) to (13) (pages 21-22) also alleged breaches of Ss. 5, (15(1) and16 of the Food Business Regulations, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/132X">Cap. 132X</a>. and alleged causes of action from breaches of these sections. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/132X">Cap. 132X</a> are regulationsmade pursuant to Sec. 56 of the Public Health and Municipal Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/132">Cap. 132</a>, which empowered the Authority to make regulationsas to food and drug hygiene, and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/132">Cap 132</a> basically made provisions for public health and municipal services. The Plaintiff actionwas based on a kitchen accident where he slipped on a wet floor that had newly scrapped fish scales and entrails on the floor. Toframe a cause of action that alleged breaches of these statutory duties, the Plaintiff must show that â<i>the damage he suffered falls within the ambit of the statute, viz. that it was of the type that the legislation was intended to preventand that the Plaintiff belonged to the category of persons that the statute was intended to protect</i>â (Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts at 9-04). It is hard to see how the Plaintiff could have a cause of action based on alleged breachesof statutory duties that were not relevant to the circumstances of his case. <a href="/eng/hk/legis/reg/132X">Cap132X</a> is to make provisions that regulate the foodbusiness and the hygiene of food and food premises for the protection of the public as consumers of food or at food premises. Theseparts are misconceived and should also rightly be struck out.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The Plaintiffâs Statement of Claim looks to be a blanket one that had not taken relevancy into account. It is out of focus thatrenders the contested parts of the Statement of Claim in this hearing to be unarguable.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It is also obvious from reading the particulars of alleged breach of employment contract and/or employerâs common duty of careand/or negligence in the Statement of Claim that there are far too numerous unnecessary repetitions rendering many parts of the pleadingsuperfluous and the pleading prolix as a whole.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  To allow the Defendant to strike out the offending parts, I must be satisfied that on the view of the Plaintiffâs Statement ofClaim, it is manifest that the parts involved are prolix and embarrassing. âEmbarrassingâ was taken to mean that the allegationsare so irrelevant that to allow them to stand would involve useless expense, and would also prejudice the fair trial of the actionby involving the parties in a dispute that is wholly apart from the issues. The irrelevancy must be clear and obvious from firstglance.

Ng on 12<sup>th</sup> September 2006 that the time for filing the Defence be extended until the final disposal of this summons for striking out parts ofthe Plaintiffâs Statement of Claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Defendant has written to the Plaintiff asking them to rectify the statement of Claim on 5<sup>th</sup>  and 8<sup>th</sup>  September 2006 and had the Plaintiffâs  reply dated 7th September 2006 indicating disagreement to amend.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  I therefore make order in terms of Paragraph 1, save that Paragraph 1(2) is amended to read âsubparagraphs (6), (7) and (9) onpages 19, 20 and 21â instead, and Paragraph 2 of the Defendantâs summons herein dated 8<sup>th</sup> September 2006. I also order that the costs of and incidental to this application be to the Defendant, to be taxed if not agreed,with certificate for counsel. This is a cost order nisi to be made absolute in 14 days.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">ã</td>            <td width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center">( W.C.
