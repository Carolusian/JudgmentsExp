The plaintiffdrafted his own pleadings and is appearing in person. The wording of the Statement of Claim makes it clear that it was not draftedby a native English speaker. Despite a careful perusal thereof I am left in some doubt as to the exact nature of the plaintiff'scauses of action. He appears to be suing the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 5th defendants for damages for conspiracy to maliciously prosecutehim. The plaintiff alleges that the Attorney General "instituted a false accusation against" him in the Tsuen Wan Magistracy whichaccusation was supported by false witnesses placed before the Court by the 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants at the direction of the 6thdefendant who "instituted all intrigues personally." It appears that the false accusation was a charge of assault and that the plaintiffwas found guilty of that charge and conditionally discharged.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="pseudopara" id="p2">2.</a> He appears to be suing the Queen, as a representative defendant, for damages for abuse of jurisdiction by three judicial officers:Mr. Pritchard, who was acting as a Magistrate in the Truer Wan Magistracy in 1980 and Mr.T.Lee and Mr. C.K. Tung who were presidingofficers in the Labour Tribunal in that year. He alleges that each has been guilty of an abuse of jurisdiction causing him damage.As can be seen from the entitlement to the action, he has not named any of the judicial officers as defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Mr. Pritchard is alleged to have convicted the plaintiff knowing that he "was entirely innocent" and to have ordered that the plaintiffbe psychiatrically examined mowing that he "then mentally was normal". Mr. C.K. Tung is alleged to have deleted important evidencein favour of the plaintiff from the record of certain proceedings in the Labour Tribunal. Mr. T. Lee is alleged to have promptedwitness to give false evidence and to have altered the records of proceedings in other proceedings in the Labour Tribunal.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> All of the defendants applied by way of Inter-Partes Summonses to the Master asking that the Statement of Claim be struck out onthe grounds that -</p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">(a)</td>            <td width="79%" valign="top">                it disclosed no reasonable cause of action;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">(b)</td>            <td width="79%" valign="top">                it was frivolous and vexatious; and                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="13%"></td>            <td width="8%" valign="top">(c)</td>            <td width="79%" valign="top">it was an abuse of the process of the Court.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> The learned master struck out the Statement of Claim as against each of the defendants. The matter comes before me by way of appealfrom those decisions.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> Mr. Wong Hin Lee, who appeared for the 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants, submitted, as to the allegation of conspiracy to maliciouslyprosecute, that the decision of the learned master was correct and that the Statement of Claim was properly struck out. He reliedupon <u>Marrinan</u> v. <u>Vibart</u> <sup>(1)</sup> and referred particularly to the judgment of Lord Justice Salmon, at 238, where he said:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The immunity that witnesses enjoy in respect of evidence given in a court of justice extends to statements made in preparing a prooffor trial and, in my view, also to statements made in a report to the Director of Public Prosecution and to evidence given in anyjudicial proceedings recognised by the law."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>His Lordship went on to say, later in his judgment, and this seems to me to be very pertinent to the facts in the present matter:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"The main contention on behalf of the plaintiff is that the gist of this action is not the defamatory statements made to the Directorof Public Prosecutions, nor their repetition in evidence, but the antecedent combination or agreement to defame. It is argued thatthere is no authority for extending any immunity to such an agreement or combination. If, contrary to my judgment, the contentionwere correct that the gist of the tort of conspiracy is the conspiratorial agreement alone, it may be that the plaintiff would beentitled to succeed on this preliminary issue. In my view, however, this contention is plainly wrong; the gist of the tort of conspiracyis not the conspiratorial agreement alone, but that agreement plus the overt act causing damage. It is true that the crime of conspiracyis the very agreement of two or more persons to effect an unlawful purpose, and any overt acts done in pursuance of the agreementare merely evidence to prove the fact of the agreement. The tort of conspiracy, however, is complete only if the agreement is carriedinto effect so as to damage the plaintiff. Accordingly, the acts done in pursuance of the agreement are an integral part of the tort."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> In the present case the conspiracy alleged is a conspiracy to maliciously prosecute. As in <u>Marrinan's</u> case the tort is only complete if the agreement is carried into effect by the giving of evidence in the prosecution. The plaintiffmust, in the present case, as in the <u>Marrinan's</u> case, rely for part of his cause of action upon the evidence which was given in the prosecution. Such matters cannot be properlymade part of any cause of action because of the immunity that witnesses enjoy in respect of evidence given in a court of justice.That being so the learned master was right in striking out the Statement of Claim as against 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th defendants.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> The action against the Queen as a representative defendant is clearly misconceived.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> It is true that by virtue of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Ordinance</a> <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300">Cap. 300</a>, the Crown can be made liable for certain torts committed by its servants or agents. However, as provided by <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13(1)</a> of the Ordinance, where such proceedings lie they must be "instituted by or against the Attorney General". It is never proper toimplead the Queen by name and the action must be struck out. The action being struck out against the Queen, as it must be, can theplaintiff ask that the Attorney General, who is presently involved as a defendant to a different cause of action, be, nevertheless,called upon to defend on behalf of the three judicial officers. If, because of the alleged behavious of the three judicial officers,an action properly lay against the Crown the Court would be sympathetic to an application to amend which would have the effect ofproperly involving the Attorney General as a defendant in a representative capacity. However by virtue of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4(5)</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/300" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Ordinance</a> there is no action at all open against the Crown by reason of the alleged action of the judicial officers. This section reads asfollows:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"No proceedings shall lie against the Crown by virtue of this section in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by any personwhile discharging or purporting to discharge any responsibilities of a judicial nature vested in him, or any responsibilities whichhe has in connexion with the execution of judicial process."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p>This section makes it clear that no proceedings lie against the Crown for torts of the kind alleged against the three judicial officers.Clearly then action, in this regard, not only does not lie against the Queen but also does not lie against the Attorney General.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> I feel it not inappropriate to point out that, even had the plaintiff named the three judicial officers as defendants, he might stillhave found difficulty in pursuing his action against them. Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts in the Fourteenth Edition at paragraph 1975states:-</p>    <p> </p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">"It is well settled that no action lies in respect of any mere abuse of jurisdiction of a court of record. The reason for this appearsto be that it is less evil that corrupt or malicious judges should be protected, than that honest judges should be exposed to therisk of frivolous and vexatious proceedings. With respect to courts not of record, it is assumed in a great many cases that an actionon the case will lie in respect of the damage caused by a wrong and malicious judicial decision, and the Justices' Protection Act1848 is framed on the supposition that such is the state of the law. But for a bona fide though negligent decision a justice is notliable."</p>    </blockquote>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> It seems to me arguable that both the Magistracy Court (See <u>Regina</u> v. <u>The District</u> <u>Judge of Hong Kong ex-parte The Attorney General</u>) <sup>(2)</sup> and the Labour Tribunal are courts of record and that no action of the nature contemplated by the plaintiff would, therefore, lieagainst the judicial officers of either body. I make this observation to alert the plaintiff to the difficulty which he may faceshould he wish to pursue his action further against these three officers.</p>    <p> </p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> I wish to make it clear, when so doing, that I have not fully canvassed the somewhat confused authorities as to what constitutesa court of record nor have I come to any concluded decision in this regard.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(N.P.
