The essence of suchfraudulent schemes has been described in various judgments in the UK.  The most frequently cited reference is probably the judgmentof Blackburne J in <i>Regalway Care Ltd v Shillingford</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/$(division)/$(year)/$(decno).html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] EWHC 261</a> at Â§Â§3-7, which for ease of reference is cited here in full :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âMTIC fraud</p>        <p class="quote">3. To set the scene for what follows it is appropriate to say something about a particular species of VAT fraud. I begin with therelevant regulatory backdrop.</p>        <p class="quote">4. Under the rules concerned with the charging and collection of VAT, supplies of goods between registered traders in different memberstates of the European Union are zero-rated provided the seller in one member state obtains the VAT registration number of the customerin another member state and can show that the goods in question were removed from the seller's member state to the other member state.The result of those rules is that where an entity registered for VAT in the United Kingdom imports goods from another member state,it need not make any payment in respect of VAT to the vendor. In due course it will be obliged to account in the United Kingdom foroutput tax on its sales to customers in the United Kingdom. If the goods are purchased by an entity registered for VAT in the UnitedKingdom which the entity then sells abroad, that entity will not be entitled to charge output tax on the sale but, conversely, havingincurred and paid input tax on its purchase of the goods (assuming the purchase was from somebody registered for VAT in the UnitedKingdom) will be entitled to recover that input tax from HM Commissioners of Customs and Excise (âHMCEâ for short).</p>        <p class="quote">5. It is the opportunities for fraud provided by these rules that have given rise to the kinds of dishonest scheme summarised in thefollowing passage of the judgment of Jacob L.J. in <i>R (on the application of Federation of Technological Industries) v Customs &amp; Excise Commissioners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2004] EWCA Civ.1020</a> (at paras 17-21):</p>        <blockquote>          <p class="quote">â17. The simplest form of abuse is what [HMCE] call âacquisition fraudâ. A business in the UK acquires goods from an EU supplierVAT free and sells them on into the United Kingdom market directly or indirectly. When it sells these goods to its U.K. customersit charges VAT but it fails to account to [HMCE] for the VAT it collects. Before [HMCE] catch up with it the trader simply disappears.</p>          <p class="quote">18. This kind of abuse is somewhat limited in that the importer who intends to defraud is actually selling the goods into the UnitedKingdom market. He has to find real customers or his customers do.</p>          <p class="quote">19. Much more significant is the second type of abuse which [HMCE] call âcarousel fraudâ. Again, there is a UK importer buyingfrom a supplier in another EU state. Again, he pays no VAT on his purchase. He then sells to a âcustomerâ in the U.K., chargingVAT. That âcustomerâ sells on to another âcustomerâ, himself charging VAT (output tax) and setting that against the tax hepaid to his supplier (input tax). This may go through several traders (whom [HMCE] call âbuffersâ). The last buffer in the chaindoes not, however, sell on to ultimate UK customers. He sells back into the EU very often to the original seller. He will have paidinput tax on his purchase. This he claims âbackâ from [HMCE]. None of this would matter if the original importer, who has chargedoutput tax to the first of the buffers, were around to account to [HMCE] for that tax. But by now he has disappeared.</p>          <p class="quote">20. So on each circuit of the âcarouselâ 17.5% of the value of the goods is extracted from [HMCE]. The scheme requires high value,low physical size goods - a container full of mobile phones or computer chips is just right for this. A pallet-load arrives at Heathrow,the transactions all take place quickly (perhaps in the same day) and the pallet moves out again.</p>          <p class="quote">21. [HMCE] estimate ... that the annual cost to the UK in 2002-3 was between Â£1.65 and Â£2.64 billion. The problem is, whatever theprecise figure, vast. It is not confined to the UK but is EU wide...â</p>        </blockquote>        <p class="quote">One of the features of carousel fraud is that there is no need to find real end-customers for the goods in the United Kingdom. Theoverseas customer to whom the goods are exported may or may not be a genuine purchaser of them. It is because the goods may end upwith the original supplier that the designation âcarouselâ is used. Dishonest schemes of this nature have become known as missingtrader intra-community fraud, or âMTIC fraudâ for short.</p>        <p class="quote">6. The value to those participating in MTIC fraud is the sharing of the VAT extracted from HMCE (effectively the amount of the outputtax which the missing importer has charged to his purchaser but failed to pay to HMCE). It is only if the exporter fails to recoverthe input tax he has paid on his acquisition of the goods that the VAT position is neutral. Since the transactions - certainly thosethat the evidence before me has explored - can take place (or are said by the parties to them to have taken place) in the space ofa single day (with completion of the transactions occurring over, at the most, a few days) and it may be some time before the importerdefaults on his obligation to account for the output tax he has charged and been paid, it requires vigilance on the part of HMCEto realise, when a payment claim is made, that it is part of a carousel fraud.</p>        <p class="quote">7. It can happen that one or more of the âbuffersâ is innocent of any involvement in the fraud: he just happens to have purchasedthe goods and sold them on. But if the goods end up with an exporter who is involved in the fraud (because, for example, it can beshown that he is the recipient of a commission or the like which has been paid to him by a purchaser/vendor higher up the chain orcoincidence cannot satisfactorily account for the number of chains in which that exporter and the same importer are involved) thebuffer may find it difficult to resist the inference that he too is involved, particularly if he has sold direct to that exporteror there are other features of his involvement indicating that his purchase and on-sale are other than what one would expect in thecase of a genuine arms-length transaction.â</p>    </blockquote><p>See also <i>Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Total Network SL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2008%5d%201%20AC%201174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] 1 AC 1174</a>, at 1179-1180 (the Court of Appealâs judgment Â§Â§2-3) and at 1122-1123 (Â§Â§4-8 of the judgment of Lord Hope of Craighead).</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  In the current case, the relevant frauds are described in some detail in the affidavit of Ms Susan Ogburn, an officer of HMRC, filedin support of the OS and the <i>ex parte</i> application.  I need not burden this judgment with lengthy extracts from that affidavit, save to mention one aspect of such fraudswhich is particularly relevant to the present case, that is, the involvement of âThird Party Recipientsâ :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âFurther Typical Features of MTIC fraud</p>        <p class="quote">17 A typical feature of MTIC fraud â and one of the âfootprintsâ of this form of fraud â is what is known as âthird partypaymentsâ.</p>        <p class="quote">18 The on-sale of the goods by the defaulter to the first line buffer creates a book debt due from the first line buffer to the defaultingtrader of the amount of the purchase price (with VAT). In legitimate trading, the would-be defaulter would have an asset (the receivablefrom the first line buffer trader) from which it could discharge its VAT liability.</p>        <p class="quote">19 In MTIC trading and in order to avoid it being placed in funds to discharge its VAT, the defaulter will on the sale of the goodsto the first line buffer, give instructions that payment of all or nearly all of the price (including the VAT) should not be paidby its customer to it, but to a third party â usually out of the jurisdiction. The third party recipient will usually not evenbe the EU supplier (nor indeed any supplier) to the defaulter. Significantly, the amount which the defaulter will require its purchaserto pay away [sic] the 3<sup>rd</sup> parties (in this instance, principally to Sunico) is almost the entirety of the VAT inclusive price at which the defaulter sold thegoods. The effect of this is that the defaulter will cause an artificial overpayment to be made.</p>        <p class="quote">20 This may be illustrated by a hypothetical, but typical example. Suppose that a defaulter acquires 1,000 mobile phones at Â£99 eachfrom an EU supplier. There being no VAT payable on its intra community supply, the total price payable by the defaulter to its supplieris Â£99,000. If the defaulter sells the phones to a UK purchaser at a profit of Â£1 each (i.e. Â£100), the total sum payable by thepurchaser is Â£100,000 plus VAT. At the rate prevailing at the time of the transactions relevant to these proceedings (17.5%), theamount that the defaulter ought to receive is Â£117,500. Of that sum the defaulter would be liable to pay Â£99,000 to its EU supplier;Â£17,500 would be the net VAT payable by the defaulter to HMRC; Â£1,000 would be the defaulterâs profit. Typically however thedefaulter will give instructions for only Â£1,175 to be paid to it (i.e. its profit plus the VAT thereon). The entire balance of(Â£116,325) will be directed to be paid to 3<sup>rd</sup> parties. No sums will be paid to HMRC in respect of the defaulterâs VAT liability. The total sum paid to 3<sup>rd</sup> parties of Â£116,325 will exceed the Â£90,000 which the defaulter was liable to pay. The extent of the overpayment is substantiallythe unpaid VAT. It equated to the entirety of the VAT payable by the Defaulter (excluding the VAT on the Defaulterâs own profit).Indeed the amount directed to be paid away could be calculated as the price at which the EU supplier sold plus 17.5%.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  HMRC claims that the respondents were co-conspirators with the other defendants named in the English Action.  It is said that aDanish company, Sunico, acted as a substantial âThird Party Recipientâ in 712 fraudulent transaction chains forming the subjectmatter of HMRCâs claim in the English Action.  In turn, Sunico allegedly entered into a sham commission agreement with an Indonesianentity P.T. Naina.  The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, who resides in Singapore, was one of the people behind P.T. Naina.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent is the 1<sup>st</sup> respondentâs brother and resides in Hong Kong.  He is said to have received the proceeds of fraud, or at least a substantial partof it, purportedly as commission payable to P.T. Naina, through a bank account maintained by him in Hong Kong.  In short, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents are said to be co-conspirators with the other defendants in the English Action in the MTIC fraud and were parties toan arrangement to launder the proceeds of the fraud and to share such proceeds amongst the conspirators.</p>    <p class="heading">The application and summary of partiesâ contentions</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  As stated above, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent contends that the OS disclosed no reasonable cause of action.  His case, in essence, is that HMRCâs claim in the EnglishAction is not capable of â<i>giving rise to a judgment which may be enforced in Hong Kong under any Ordinance or at common law</i>â under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21M.</a> This is because, in substance if not in form, the English Action seeks to recover loss of VAT and such an action, if commenced inHong Kong, would amount to enforcement either directly or indirectly of revenue law of the UK and would not be entertained by theHong Kong courts, hence a judgment obtained in the English Action would not be enforced in Hong Kong.  Accordingly, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent contends that the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant the <i>Mareva</i> injunction and the OS must be struck out.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In support of that contention, Mr Hectar Pun, appearing with Mr Newman Lam, relied on the well established proposition stated in<i>Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins, The Conflict of Laws</i> (14<sup>th</sup>ed. 2006) <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 3</a> that the Hong Kong courts :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ have no jurisdiction to entertain an action: (1) for the enforcement, either directly or indirectly, of a penal, revenue orother public law of a foreign State â¦â<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Mr Pun refers to a number of well-known authorities, including <i>Government of India, Ministry of Finance (Revenue Division) v Taylor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%20AC%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] AC 491</a>, which in turn approved and applied <i>Peter Buchanan Ltd v McVey (Note)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%20AC%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] AC 516</a>, in support of his submission that in substance, the English Action is one whereby HMRC seeks to recover loss â<i>being the VAT that it has paid to the Brokers in respect of those chains, having received no VAT payment from the Defaulter</i>â : Amended Particulars of Claim Â§14. Reference was also made to various parts of the Amended Particulars of Claim to support hissubmission that HMRCâs case is for the recovery of VAT which the Defaulters have failed to pay.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  Mr Pun also relies on what he submits is a âconcessionâ on the part of Mr Johnny Ma, counsel for HMRC, in his Skeleton Submissionsto the effect that the Brokers involved in the carousel fraud are not necessarily parties to the conspiracy, including some who maybe wholly innocent.  Mr Pun submits that because some of the Brokers (recipients of refund from HMRC) may be innocent, the only viableclaim can only be for loss resulting from failure by the Defaulters to pay the VAT.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In response, Mr Ma contends that HMRCâs claim in the English Action is for damages based on the tort of unlawful means conspiracyto injure HMRC. The 719 fraudulent transaction chains in question are not genuine transactions but are <i>âcontrived and inconsistent with bona fide commercial tradingâ</i>; that the transaction entered into by Sunico <i>âhad no bona fide commercial legitimacy and were little more than devices to enable Sunico to benefit from receipt of the proceedsof MTIC fraudâ</i>, etc. : see Amended Particulars of Claim Â§Â§103, 109, 124 and 126.  The English Action is therefore not one which seeks, whetherdirectly or indirectly, to enforce the UKâs revenue laws.  There is thus no basis to suggest that any judgment which HMRC may obtainin the English Action would not be enforceable in Hong Kong.</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  As to the âconcessionâ, Mr Ma contends that the fact that some of the Brokers may have been innocent does not in any way affectthe true nature of HMRCâs claim, which is to recover the losses suffered by HMRC as a result of the unlawful conspiracy.  The refundto the Brokers was the means by way of which money was extracted from HMRC, which was then used to fund the âcarouselâ.  In anycase, HMRC does not accept that the Brokers were innocent; its case is only that it does not rule out the possibility that some ofthe Brokers might have been innocent : see <i>Regalway</i>, Â§7 cited above.</p>    <p class="heading">Discussion</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  Central to HMRCâs case is the House of Lords decision in <i>Total</i>.  In that case, one of the two preliminary issues for determination was whether an action by the Revenue and Customs Commissionersagainst</p>    <p>Total (the Spanish supplier/buyer in that case) for damages at common law for conspiracy to defraud the commissioners in sums theyclaimed to have lost as a result of MTIC frauds contravened Article 4 of the Bills of Rights 1689 :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThat levying money for or to the use of the Crown, by pretence of prerogative without grant of Parliament for longer time, or inother manner then the same is or shall be granted, is illegal.â<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The argument of Total in that case, which found favour with Lord Hope of Craighead, was that albeit advanced as one for damagesfor conspiracy by unlawful means, in substance the claim was to recover VAT from Total, being a person who was not for the purposesof the VAT legislation a taxpayer : see Â§Â§21, 29 and 32.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The majority of the House, however, held that the claim was not in substance a claim for unpaid tax or the levying of tax but aclaim for loss caused by the conspiracy.  Lord Scott of Foscote emphasised that the carousel fraud did not constitute genuine commercialtransactions on which VAT would be payable : it was a charade, a fraudulent scheme designed to extract by deception money from therevenue : see Â§Â§49-55 and 58-59.  Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, in Â§Â§168-171, came to the same conclusion on essentially thesame ground, i.e. the claim was not one for enforcement of the revenue law but for damages for the tort of conspiracy practised onit.  Lord Mance agreed with Lord Scott and Lord Neuberger on this point : see Â§127.  Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe considered thatthe MTIC fraud amounted to <i>âfraudulent extraction of money from the Exchequerâ</i> which in his Lordshipâs view was no different from armed robbery of cash belonging to the revenue : Â§Â§108-109.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Mr Pun seeks to distinguish the <i>Total</i> case on the basis that the majorityâs view in that case was said in the context of the Bills of Right argument.  That may havebeen so, but I fail to see why the majorityâs analysis of the nature of the claim in <i>Total</i> (which is no different from that advanced in this case) does not apply in this case.  Indeed, as Mr Ma points out, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondentâs arguments on the nature of the claim are no different from those advanced on behalf of Total and firmly rejected bythe majority of the House : see <i>Total</i> at 1211D-E, 1213H and 1214B-1215C.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  In my view, HMRC is not seeking to recover any tax properly payable or seeking to enforce the UKâs VAT legislation, but to seekrecovery by way of damages the out of pocket losses which it has suffered as a result of the alleged fraud perpetuated by the conspirators. Mr Pun, in focusing his case on the failure on the part of the Defaulters to pay VAT, is only looking at half the story â and,for that matter, perhaps not the important half. I agree with Mr Ma that the whole fraudulent chain must be considered and the inevitableview one comes to when taking into account the entire âcarouselâ is that the scheme was a fraudulent one engineered to deceiveHMRC by exploiting a loophole in the VAT legislation.  The conspirators, in HMRCâs case, set out to obtain a pecuniary advantageto themselves at the expense of HMRC by means of a fraudulent scheme.  It would be to mis-characterise HMRCâs claim to suggestthat it is one for the recovery of VAT or enforcing the VAT legislation.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Accordingly, I reject the submissions advanced on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent that the claim is in substance one that seeks to enforce the UKâs revenue laws.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Having come to the view expressed above, it is unnecessary for me to say very much about the other authorities relied on by Mr Pun. <i>Peter Buchanan Ld v McVey (Note)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%20AC%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] AC 516</a> was what one may call a tax evasion case.  In that case a Scottish company, beneficially owned by the defendant, failed to pay excessprofits tax and income tax.  The defendant procured the company to pay over to him all the assets of the company purportedly througha number of transactions, which the trial judge found to have been dishonestly designed to defeat the revenueâs claim.  The companywas put into liquidation and the liquidator, appointed by the revenue which was the only creditor, sought to recover from the defendant(then decamped to Eire) by advancing a claim on behalf of the company to recover its assets. In those circumstances Kingsmill MooreJ in the High Court of Eire held (upheld on appeal) that in substance the claim was an attempt indirectly to enforce a claim fortax by the Scottish tax authorities.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Similarly, <i>QRS 1 Aps v Frandsen</i> [1999] STC 616 was a claim by the Danish tax authorities to enforce paying of unpaid tax.  In that case an English domiciliary ownedseveral Danish companies.  He disposed of the assets of the companies for cash, which was then used to purchase his shares.  TheDanish tax authorities claimed that the companies owed outstanding corporate taxes.  The tax authorities, being the only creditorsof the companies, appointed a liquidator and funded an action in the name of the companies against the defendant for restitutionof the companiesâ assets.  The Court of Appeal held that the case was indistinguishable from <i>Buchanan</i> and dismissed the action. </p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Properly analysed, these cases are plainly distinguishable from the instant case.  In both <i>Buchanan</i> and <i>QRS</i>, there were genuine outstanding tax liabilities on the part of the defunct companies which the defendants by dishonest means soughtto evade, and the actions were rightly held to be indirect attempts by the foreign tax authorities, acting through their nominees,to enforce the foreign countryâs tax laws.  In contrast, in this case, as in <i>Total</i>, there was no genuine commercial transaction underlying the carousel frauds.  The fact that potentially innocent brokers might havebeen involved, presumably to give the scheme some resemblance of legitimacy, does not convert a fraudulent scheme into a legal one,even partially.  The plain fact as raised by HMRC in its pleaded case is that it has suffered monetary loss by having paid out onVAT refund claims which are not genuine and which are presented to it fraudulently pursuant to the conspiracy.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It is unnecessary to consider other submissions made by counsel on other issues which in my view do not really arise in this case.</p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In my judgment, the requirements of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21M</a> are satisfied and the application must be dismissed with costs.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I thank counsel for their valuable assistance.</p>	<p> </p>	<p> </p>    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%" valign="top"></td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Jat Sew Tong, SC)<br />            Recorder of the Court of First Instance<br />            High Court<br /></td>        </tr>    </table><!--sino section representation --><representation>    <p> </p>	<p>Mr Johnny Ma, instructed by Messrs Mallesons Stephen Jaques,  for the Applicant</p><p>Mr Hector Pun and Mr Newman Lam, instructed by Messrs Fairbairn Catley Low &amp; Kong, for the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent</p></representation><!--sino section text -->    <div>      <br clear="all" />        <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />        <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="" id="_ftn1">[1]</a> There is no dispute that irrespective of whether the true jurisprudential basis of the Rule is that the court has <i>no jurisdiction</i> or will decline <i>to exercise its jurisdiction</i> (as to which see <i>Dicey</i> Â§5-021), in practical terms the effect of the Rule is that the court will not entertain such an action.</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="" id="_ftn2">[2]</a> As Lord Neuberger puts it in <i>Total</i> Â§170, in modern day language : âthe effect of the article is that the executive cannot impose or claim a tax or other impositionwithout the authority of the legislature.â</p>        <p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="" id="_ftn3">[3]</a> Mr Pun relies on an observation of Lord Walker in Â§107 that the claim was one â<i>to recover tax (not to âlevyâ it)</i>â.
