He was a sales agent for China Honour. The remuneration that he got from China Honour was basic salaryplus commission. In respect of his entitlement of commission, it was based upon 50% share of the profit or loss. The Plaintiff wasintroduced by the 1st Defendant to China Honour. The 1st Defendant left China Honour in about March 1996 and started to do businessin the name of the 2nd Defendant with the Plaintiff. At the time he left China Honour, the 1st Defendant was aware that China Honourhad not yet paid certain invoices to the Plaintiff. In early 1997, the 1st Defendant was asked to join in the negotiation of settlementbetween the Plaintiff and China Honour. The 1st Defendant was informed by Mr Lau of China Honour that the Plaintiff wanted to askfor interest on the outstandings and that the reason why China Honour delayed in paying the outstanding invoices was due to marketprice depreciation of goods sold to China Honour by the Plaintiff. There was negotiation between the Plaintiff and China Honour thatthe Plaintiff would make compensation to China Honour for the price depreciation for about HK$1.5 million.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="55"><p><a class="para" id="p8" name="p8">8.</a> The 1st Defendant's evidence went on to say that in about April 1997, Mr Lau of China Honour informed the 1st Defendant that ChinaHonour agreed to pay the Plaintiff HK$100,000.00 as interest accrued on the outstandings between the Plaintiff and China Honour andasked him to issue a cheque in the amount of HK$50,000.00 to share the <brs_term brs_term_id="26" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term>. The 1st Defendant drew a cheque no.164687 dated 26 April 1997 on the 2nd Defendant's account payable to the Plaintiff as Mr Lausaid it would be more convenient. Soon subsequently the 1st Defendant discovered that the amount of compensation from the Plaintiffto China Honour had been increased to about HK$1.6 million. As such, the extra <brs_term brs_term_id="27" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> suffered by China Honour of HK$100,000.00 was off-set by the increase in compensation. In the premises, the 1st Defendant consideredthat he should not be responsible for sharing the interest agreed by China Honour with the Plaintiff. There had been <brs_term brs_term_id="62" brs_term_type="9">misrepresentation</brs_term> from Mr Lau of China Honour and/or the Plaintiff. He therefore stopped the cheque for payment to the Plaintiff.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="56"><p><a class="para" id="p9" name="p9">9.</a> Despite what the 1st Defendant stated, it is immediately apparent from his own <brs_term brs_term_id="65" brs_term_type="9">evidence</brs_term> that no one of the Plaintiff made any <brs_term brs_term_id="63" brs_term_type="9">representation</brs_term> to him to induce the drawing of the cheque for $50,000.

There is no doubt that he accepted liability for his share of the interest at $50,000. Whatever set-off or share of additional compensationthe 1st Defendant may be entitled is a matter between he and China Honour. In drawing up the cheque on the 2nd Defendant's bankingaccount and delivering it to the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant clearly represented that the cheque would be honoured.

class="para" id="p16" name="p16">16.</a> None of the parties or witnesses can recall when exactly the post-dated cheques were delivered to the Plaintiff. According to the1st Defendant, staff of the Plaintiff would go to see the 1st Defendant every month with invoices for goods sold and delivered tothe 2nd Defendant. On the basis of the invoices, the 1st Defendant would draw and deliver post-dated cheques. There is thereforeno doubt that the post-dated cheques were delivered to staff of the Plaintiff as soon as they were drawn. I also believe that thoseof the post-dated cheques bearing consecutive serial numbers were basically drawn and delivered at the same time. Going through therelevant monthly statements issued by the bank to the 2nd Defendant, one can see the dates on which cheques bearing serial numberbefore or after the post-dated cheques were banked. By reference to such dates, it is reasonable to find that the approximate dateeach of the post-dated cheques was delivered to the Plaintiff is as noted in the table above.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="187"><p><a class="para" id="p17" name="p17">17.</a> That the 2nd Defendant is liable for $7,115,980 is not disputed by either Defendants. The 1st Defendant admitted that he drew allthe post-dated cheques and he gave instructions to the bank to stop payment of all the post-dated cheques. The 1st Defendant alsoadmitted that at all material times he was the only person authorized and able to draw and stop cheques for the 2nd Defendant.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="188"><p><a class="para" id="p18" name="p18">18.</a> It is the Plaintiff's case that when the 1st Defendant drew the post-dated cheques he did not intend them to be honoured unless thePlaintiff agreed to grant the 2nd Defendant sole agency for the China market of the Plaintiff's products. At about the time the post-datedcheques were drawn and delivered, the parties were negotiating on the sole agency. Near the end of April 1997, the 1st Defendantissued stop payment instructions to the bank for 8 of the post-dated cheques. It is important to note that some of those 8 chequeswere post-dated to the end of May and beginning of June 1997. Thereafter, the 1st Defendant continued in mid-May 1997 to issue 10more cheques post-dated to between the middle of May and middle of June  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1997%20se%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1997.

Moreover, the 1st Defendant denies any dishonesty or falsehood on his own part during dealings with the Plaintiff. Inhis evidence, the 1st Defendant explained that the 2nd Defendant was unable to meet payment obligations because the 2nd Defendantwas facing cash flow problems at the material time. The cash flow problems were brought about by the Plaintiff cutting the creditlimit of the 2nd Defendant. The 1st Defendant stated that he had told staff of the Plaintiff, and the management of the Plaintiffwas aware, that the 2nd Defendant was having cash flow problems before the last 10 of the post-dated cheques were drawn and yet thePlaintiff insisted on having those 10 cheques.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="190"><p><a class="para" id="p20" name="p20">20.</a> The evidence as to what transpired during negotiations between the parties on sole agency for the 2nd Defendant cannot be disputed.Both parties rely on more or less contemporaneous records of those negotiations:-</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="191"><p class="heading">Fax message from 1st Defendant to Managing Director<br />    of the Plaintiff dated 30 April 1997</p></brs_paragraph>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="192"><p class="quote">&quot;First at all, I want to tell you that I still want to work with &quot;BMB&quot; wholeheartedly,</p></brs_paragraph>        <brs_paragraph id="193"><p class="quote">For my new arrange of my loan, I would like to hold on a meeting with you and head office representative in HONG KONG or TOKYO.

At first he complainedthat the Plaintiff reduced the credit limit of the 2nd Defendant. He said that previously there was no limit and no written recordof credit line given to the 2nd Defendant. Miss Lau for the Plaintiff <brs_term brs_term_id="28" brs_term_type="9">cross-examined</brs_term> the 1st Defendant on a computer printed account statement (Trial Bundle page 784) issued by the Plaintiff to the 2nd Defendant dated6 January 1997 showing &quot;Credit Limit: 4,000,000.00&quot;. So there was written record of the credit limit. Before the 1st Defendantcould begin to attempt to explain, I warned him not to again try to confuse issues by giving some irrelevant rambling. Right afterthat, the 1st Defendant burst out with an answer that the computer printed account statement was never given to the Defendants. But,as counsel for the Plaintiff pointed out, the computer printed account statement was one of the documents disclosed by the Defendantsat the discovery process for the <brs_term brs_term_id="74" brs_term_type="9">proceedings</brs_term> herein.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="231"><p><a class="para" id="p22" name="p22">22.</a> As to the inability of the 2nd Defendant to meet payment for the post-dated cheques, the Defendants' own <brs_term brs_term_id="75" brs_term_type="9">evidence</brs_term> confirmed that of the Plaintiff that there was no actual cut in credit limit for the 2nd Defendant. The financial problem said bythe 1st Defendant to be affecting the 2nd Defendant is I <brs_term brs_term_id="29" brs_term_type="9">find</brs_term> non-existent. One just has to look at the fax message dated 30 April 1997 by the 1st Defendant wherein he offered <em>security deposit</em> between $4 to 4.6 million. Furthermore, despite what the 1st Defendant has repeatedly said in his fax messages and in evidence thatthe question of outstanding payment was not related to the sole agency plea, he stated in the 30 May 1997 fax message that &quot;thebeginning of the first month payment is depends on the dealer system of Nikkodo policy, because of new investor will join to TeckEase. On the other hand, Teck Ease will shrink and correct the investment for the payment&quot; and &quot;if Teck Ease can be theagent to do the BMB business, the payment must be on schedule, otherwise, cannot have the business with Nikkodo&quot;.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="232"><p><a class="para" id="p23" name="p23">23.</a> The monthly statements from the bank show that the account of the 2nd Defendant on which the post-dated cheques were drawn was maintainedby a low credit balance or over-drawn at the material time. The frequent repeat orders placed by the 2nd Defendant for the Plaintiff'sgoods show, and the 1st Defendant confirmed in evidence, that the 2nd Defendant had no difficulty selling the goods although theprofits were not as much as desired. Thus, one must wonder what happened to the proceeds of sale which must be of the order of millionsof dollars. The Defendants do not offer any explanation.

In that case, the appellant ran a stationery business which he carried on through a private limited company whichowed money to a creditor. The company's bank account was heavily overdrawn and there was no prospect of the bank extending the company'soverdraft facilities or of any money being paid into the account in the immediate future. The appellant gave the creditor a postdatedcheque which he signed on behalf of the limited company. He also obtained stationery from suppliers by giving them cheques whichwere similarly postdated and signed on behalf of the company. No money was paid into the account thereafter and the cheques weredishonoured on presentation. The appellant was charged with (i) dishonestly obtaining goods from the suppliers by <brs_term brs_term_id="30" brs_term_type="9">deception</brs_term>, contrary to S 15a of the Theft Act 1968, and (ii) dishonestly obtaining the deferment of a debt due to the creditor by deception,contrary to S 16b of the 1968 Act. The charge in each case alleged that the relevant 'deception' by the appellant consisted of afalse '<brs_term brs_term_id="78" brs_term_type="9">representation</brs_term>' that the cheque in question was a good and valid order for the payment of the sum specified in the cheque. The appellant <brs_term brs_term_id="83" brs_term_type="9">submitted</brs_term> that no such representation could be inferred from the mere act of giving a postdated cheque and that the only <brs_term brs_term_id="191" brs_term_type="9">representation</brs_term> about the present state of affairs which could properly be implied from such an act was that the drawer of the cheque (or the companyon whose behalf it was drawn) was a customer of the bank on which it was drawn. The English Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) heldthat by simply giving a cheque, whether postdated or not, the drawer impliedly represented that the state of facts existing at thedate of <brs_term brs_term_id="190" brs_term_type="9">delivery</brs_term> was such that in the ordinary course of events it would, on presentation for payment on or after the date specified in the cheque,be met.

In the premises, I take theprinciple propounded in <strong>Gilmartin</strong> as sound. Thus the signatory of corporate cheques having control of the corporate vehicle represents that the cheques will be metunconditionally upon due presentment for payment. I also hold that, on the facts, the 1st Defendant as the <em><brs_term brs_term_id="12" brs_term_type="2">alter ego</brs_term></em> of the 2nd Defendant did deceive the Plaintiff by drawing and delivering the post-dated cheques without intending to meet them unconditionally.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="237"><p class="heading">Procurement of <brs_term brs_term_id="85" brs_term_type="9">Breach</brs_term></p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="238"><p><a class="para" id="p27" name="p27">27.</a> This is an even greater hurdle for the Plaintiff although the corporate veil for the 1st Defendant is already somewhat lifted bythe <strong>Gilmartin</strong> case.

The first is where a <brs_term brs_term_id="169" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> is committed by the company through one of its servants or officers and the question is whether a director, although not the officerin question, is <brs_term brs_term_id="168" brs_term_type="9">liable</brs_term> for the <brs_term brs_term_id="170" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> committed by the company. The second is where the director is the person whose acts have caused the company to be liable in <brs_term brs_term_id="171" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> and the question is whether the plaintiff can sue the director personally in <brs_term brs_term_id="172" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="248"><p class="quote">Where the <brs_term brs_term_id="111" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> is committed by the company, a director does not make himself <brs_term brs_term_id="192" brs_term_type="9">liable</brs_term> merely because of the fact of his directorship. Nevertheless, a director who, whilst not committing a <brs_term brs_term_id="112" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> himself, has authorised, <brs_term brs_term_id="117" brs_term_type="9">directed</brs_term> and procured the commission of a <brs_term brs_term_id="174" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> by his company may be personally liable to the victim of the <brs_term brs_term_id="175" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> even though he was not aware that the acts so authorised were tortious or did not care whether the acts were tortious or not. Whethera director has authorised a <brs_term brs_term_id="115" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> will depend on the facts of each case, but &quot;in every case where it is sought to make a director liable for his company's <brs_term brs_term_id="116" brs_term_type="9">torts</brs_term>, it is necessary to examine with care what part he played personally in regard to the act or acts complained of&quot;. If more thanone person is concerned in the commission of a wrong, the person wronged has his remedy against all, or any one or more of them,at his choice; for every wrongdoer is jointly and severally liable for the whole damage, and it does not matter whether they actedas between themselves as equals, or one of them as agent or servant of another.</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="249"><p class="quote">Equally a director is not to be held responsible for the fraud of his co-directors, unless he has expressly or impliedly authorisedit. &quot;A director&quot;, as Lord Hatherley said, &quot;cannot be held <brs_term brs_term_id="176" brs_term_type="9">liable</brs_term> for being defrauded. To do so would make his position intolerable.&quot;</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="250"><p class="quote">Where the question concerns the <brs_term brs_term_id="119" brs_term_type="9">personal liability</brs_term> of a director whose acts or omissions have given rise to <brs_term brs_term_id="120" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> on the part of the company in <brs_term brs_term_id="179" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term>, the rule from the law of agency that an agent is personally <brs_term brs_term_id="194" brs_term_type="9">liable</brs_term> for his own <brs_term brs_term_id="193" brs_term_type="9">tortious act</brs_term>s, even if the company is also vicariously liable, cannot be applied straightforwardly to the case of the director. On the contrary,it was said by Hardie Boys J. in the New Zealand Court of Appeal that in appropriate cases directors are to be identified with thecompany itself, so that their acts are the acts of the company. He continued: &quot;Indeed, I consider that the nature of <brs_term brs_term_id="19" brs_term_type="3">corporate personality</brs_term> requires that this identification normally be the basic premise and that clear evidence be needed to displace it with a <brs_term brs_term_id="125" brs_term_type="9">finding</brs_term> that a director is acting not as the company but as the company's agent or servant in a way that renders him personally liable.&quot;This consideration is particularly important in the case of one-man companies, where too free an imposition of personal liabilityin tort could destroy the advantages of limited <brs_term brs_term_id="178" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term>.</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="251"><p class="quote">The test for personal <brs_term brs_term_id="127" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> is whether the director in question has assumed responsibility on either an actual or an imputed basis. Although the test is of generalapplication, it arises for particular application where the director of a one-man company gives advice on behalf of the company tothird parties which turns out to have been negligent. In T<em>revor Ivory Ltd v. Anderson the New Zealand</em> Court of Appeal held that the director of a one-man company is not automatically to be taken as accepting <brs_term brs_term_id="128" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> for negligent mis-<brs_term brs_term_id="37" brs_term_type="9">statement</brs_term> for advice given on behalf of the company. On the facts of the case, no assumption of responsibility on behalf of the director couldbe established. In <em>Williams v. Natural Life Health Foods</em> the <brs_term brs_term_id="126" brs_term_type="9">House of Lords</brs_term> came to a similar result, though it based itself more on general principles of the law of <brs_term brs_term_id="129" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> than on the specific requirements of company law. In the case of negligently performed services the general test for liability in<brs_term brs_term_id="130" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> was whether the defendant had assumed responsibility for the delivery of the service promised. In the case of a director of a company(as with any agent acting for a principal) the question was thus whether, objectively assessed, the acts and speech of the defendantwere such as to lead the plaintiff to believe that the director (agent) was assuming responsibility towards the plaintiff insteadof (or, more likely, in addition to) the responsibility of the company (principal). Part of the objective assessment of the factswould involve an assessment of whether the reliance on the director (agent) was reasonable on the part of the plaintiff. It is here,perhaps, that the company law aspects of the decision emerge. Referring to two Canadian cases, their Lordships held that the questionin a company context would be whether the plaintiff could be acting reasonably in seeking to rely on the director's resources forthe satisfaction of his or her claim in addition to the company's resources. As was said in one of the Canadian cases, for the plaintiffto succeed &quot;it would have to show that it was relying on the particular expertise of an individual [director] without regardto the corporate character of the engineering first.&quot; The whole tenor of their Lordships' <brs_term brs_term_id="36" brs_term_type="9">judgment</brs_term> was that this was a task in which plaintiffs will not easily succeed.</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="252"><p class="quote">Moreover, there is in this area of economic loss a preliminary <brs_term brs_term_id="139" brs_term_type="9">issue</brs_term> of considerable difficulty which concerns the willingness of the law to recognise that the acts of the directors attract <brs_term brs_term_id="131" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> in <brs_term brs_term_id="136" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> at all, an issue that arises logically prior to the question of whether that <brs_term brs_term_id="132" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term>, if recognised, is to be attributed to the company alone or to both the company and the director. In the present state of the lawrelating to <brs_term brs_term_id="133" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> for negligently caused economic harm, it is unlikely that the courts will be quick to hold that directors owe a duty of care to creditorsin general so to conduct the affairs of the company as not to cause economic loss to those creditors. In order to found <brs_term brs_term_id="181" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> in <brs_term brs_term_id="183" brs_term_type="9">tort</brs_term> it is necessary to show that the director by agreement or <brs_term brs_term_id="182" brs_term_type="9">representation</brs_term> assumed a special duty to a particular creditor or creditors of the company to exercise care. The directors' direct <brs_term brs_term_id="135" brs_term_type="9">liability</brs_term> in negligence to creditors must be distinguished from the question of whether the directors' <brs_term brs_term_id="20" brs_term_type="2">fiduciary duties</brs_term> to the company embrace at any stage an obligation to take account of the <brs_term brs_term_id="138" brs_term_type="9">interests</brs_term> of the creditors. In this latter area the courts have developed the law considerably in recent years.</p></brs_paragraph>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <brs_paragraph id="253"><p class="quote">There is one further particular situation which needs to be noted. Although, we have seen, the general principle that agents are personallyliable for their own torts, even if the principal is also vicariously liable, is applied only in a modified way to directors andcompanies, that modified principle does recognise that the director will be personally liable when he has assumed responsibilityfor the acts in question.

The <strong>Royal Brunei Airlines</strong> <brs_term brs_term_id="196" brs_term_type="9">decision</brs_term> is an instance of, as much as it is on trust and equity, the highest judicial authority of the English <brs_term brs_term_id="151" brs_term_type="9">common law</brs_term> system piercing the corporate veil for dishonesty or fraud inducing <brs_term brs_term_id="154" brs_term_type="9">breach</brs_term> of legal obligations by the corporate entity under the control of the defendant. The <strong>Kepic</strong> case is another such instance by one Canadian appellate jurisdiction. It does not matter whether the legal obligations are undercontract, trust or otherwise. I <brs_term brs_term_id="197" brs_term_type="9">hold</brs_term> that where one or more directors are in control of a corporate vehicle and have dishonestly or fraudulently caused the corporatevehicle to default on its legal obligations, such directors are personally <brs_term brs_term_id="185" brs_term_type="9">liable</brs_term> to parties who <brs_term brs_term_id="152" brs_term_type="9">suffer</brs_term> <brs_term brs_term_id="39" brs_term_type="9">loss</brs_term> and damage as a result of such default.</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="259"><p><a class="para" id="p35" name="p35">35.</a> It is, of course, rarely possible to find direct evidence as to dishonest intention or since when such intention came into being.Dishonesty in relation to the last 10 of the post-dated cheques is almost a foregone conclusion. So far as the first 8 of the post-datedcheques are concerned, two circumstances are highly telling of the design of the 1st Defendant. First, according to the evidenceof the 1st Defendant, the 2nd Defendant had in late 1996 and very early 1997 set up connections with three local dealers scatteredfar and wide in China to sell the products of the Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant used the investments he put into setting up theseconnections as one of the reasons for the cash flow problem. In fact the connections were not direct investments, only sub-agencyarrangements with local shop proprietors. The point is that the 1st Defendant was preparing to get sole agency from the Plaintiffin very early 1997. The obtaining of goods on credit from the Plaintiff was part of the set up to hold the Plaintiff at ransom. Theissuing of cheques was to string the Plaintiff along and to show that payment could have been made had the 1st Defendant desiredto do so..</p></brs_paragraph>    <brs_paragraph id="260"><p><a class="para" id="p36" name="p36">36.</a> Secondly, in relation to the $50,000 contribution, the 1st Defendant agreed in early 1997 to pay that sum forthwith. As noted earlier,he had a <brs_term brs_term_id="156" brs_term_type="9">debit note</brs_term> from the Plaintiff in February 1997. He delayed issuing the cheque until 26 April 1997 and almost immediately he stopped paymentof the cheque.
