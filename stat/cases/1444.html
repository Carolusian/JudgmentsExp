The Summons originally came before Deputy JudgeL. Chan, who adjourned the application, as it was obvious that hearing of the matter could not be completed within the time available(the Summons was initially marked for â15 minutesâ only).  The Summons was subsequently set down for a 3-day hearing before me. The time, however, turned out to be grossly insufficient to complete the oral arguments, and the application was further adjournedpart-heard for another hearing, which lasted another 3 days. </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  It is not surprising that the original time estimated for the application was insufficient.  There were quite a number of trademarks to be considered.  Seventeen bundles of documents were put before the court.  I was referred to a large number of authorities,and counselâs submissions, together with the authorities cited, occupied another 6 bundles.  Ms Winnie Tam SC represented the plaintiffand Mr Colin Shipp represented the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants.  The submissions of counsel were wide-ranging and insightful, for which I am grateful. </p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Before the Summons came before me, the application against the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants had already been disposed of.  I was thus only concerned with the application against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  In this Decision, I shall only deal with those matters that are directly relevant or material to my decision.  As pointed out above,the submissions made by counsel were wide-ranging and covered many points, including some peripheral matters which are not directlymaterial to my decision.  I have considered counselâs submissions fully and I do not intend any disrespect to counsel by not dealingwith these peripheral points.  </p>    <p class="heading">THE PLAINTIFF</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  About 88 years ago Mr Guccio Gucci started a small luggage store in Florence, Italy.  After World War II, Mr Guccio Gucci startedoperating his business in the name of a limited company called Guccio Gucci S.r.l.  This became, in due course (1982), Guccio GucciS.p.A., the plaintiff in the present action. </p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  From that humble beginning, the House of Gucci, more often simply referred to as âGucciâ, has grown over the decades into aworld-renowned brand in the fashion and luxury goods business and as a designer label.  According to the evidence before me, Intraband,a leading branding consultancy, has continuously listed âGucciâ as one of the top 100 brands of all industries in the world since2001, when it first started its brand evaluation.  In a survey commissioned and published by AC Nielsen in 2006, âGucciâ waslisted as one of the worldâs âSuperbrandsâ.  According to a global report on âConsumers and Designer Brandsâ dated April2008, AC Nielsen reported that they âhave seen a consistent upwards trend in Gucciâs brand perception which is congruent withtheir adspend figures.  Thanks to strong, well-targeted campaigns and media strategy, Gucci is enjoying unparalleled brand healthâ¦â.  One quarter of global consumers would prefer, according to AC Nielsenâs report, to buy âGucciâ products. </p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In a press release dated 27<sup>th</sup> February 2008, the Nielsen Company (holding company of AC Nielsen) described âGucciâ as âthe worldâs most coveted luxurybrand according to a global luxury brands survey by the Nielsen Company.â  Milward Brown Optimor, another brand consulting agency,also listed âGucciâ as one of the worldâs top 100 brands in its 2008 branding report.  Amongst various rankings, âGucciâwas ranked number 4 out of the âTop 10 with Highest Brand Contributionâ. </p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  Put before me by the plaintiff was a publication entitled âGUCCI BY GUCCIâ, which was first published in 2006 on the 85<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the âbirthâ of the House of Gucci.  Apart from documenting the 85 years of history of the Gucci brand, the bookhas a good collection of pictures showing dignitaries and celebrities wearing Gucci products and goods all over the world.  AlthoughMr Shipp has sought to undermine the relevance of the publication by describing it as a piece of âself-glorificationâ, I thinkthe images and pictures contained in the book are in many ways self-explanatory.  I have no doubt in my mind that the evidence beforeme shows that âGucciâ is a world-renowned, prestigious and highly recognizable brand in the fashion and luxury goods business. In 2007, Intraband has estimated the Gucci brand as having a brand value of over HK$60 billion. </p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  By the end of 2007, there were 233 directly operated âGucciâ stores in 60 countries, employing more than 6,500 employees.  Inthat year, world wide sale of Gucci products exceeded 2 billion Euros (about HK$25 billion). </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  As far as Hong Kong is concerned, the first Gucci shop was opened in the Peninsula Hotel in 1974.  Presently, there are 9 Guccistores in Hong Kong, with its flagship store in the Landmark, Central.  I have mentioned above that in 2007, worldwide revenue derivedfrom the sale of Gucci products was in the region of HK$60 billion.  In that year, sales in Hong Kong contributed about HK$1.7 billion. The plaintiff also spent substantially in advertising its products in Hong Kong.  Advertising expenses in 2007 alone were estimatedas HK$25 million.  Another HK$12.3 million was spent in 2007 on PR expenses. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Despite its present success, the business of Gucci has had its ups and downs.  There is no need for me to detail in this Decisionthe history of these ups and downs.  Suffice to say this: until the 1980s, the Gucci business was run by the Gucci family.  AfterWorld War II, there was a period of very rapid expansion of the Gucci business between the 1950s and the 1980s.  However, followinga spate of unfortunate events (which included some infamous incidents of murder, tax evasion, and criminal convictions that plaguedcertain members of the Gucci family), and intense family squabbles, by the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Gucci operation was indisarray.  In 1988, 50% of the shares of the plaintiff was sold to a Bahrain-based investment company called InvestCorp.  In September1993, InvestCorp acquired the remaining shares of the plaintiff and members of the Gucci family ceased to have any interest in theGucci business.  InvestCorp set about to successfully rebuild the Gucci brand and business significantly improved in the course ofthe 1990s.  InvestCorp subsequently sold its shares in the plaintiff.   The present owner of the plaintiff is a French conglomerate,Pinault-Printemps-Reduoute (â<b>PPR</b>â).  </p>    <p class="heading">THE DEFENDANTS</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is one of the great grandsons of Mr Guccio Gucci.  He is the son of Mr Roberto Gucci, whose father was Mr Aldo Gucci, oneof the 3 sons of Mr Guccio Gucci.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had been involved in the Gucci business, when it was still run by the Gucci family.  He was a member of the plaintiffâsboard in 1987-88, and he left the plaintiff in 1989, leaving his last position as the plaintiffâs vice-president. </p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  After InvestCorp had acquired the shares of the plaintiff from the Gucci family, Mr Roberto Gucci set up his business called theâHouse of Florenceâ, which designed and sold leather goods under the âHouse of Florenceâ brand.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant became a partner of his fatherâs business, and was a member of the board of the company which marketed the âHouse ofFlorenceâ brand.  According to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, his ârole in the House of Florence has been to develop and modify the designs in collaboration with the pattern makersand thus realize prototypes using high quality materials and craftsmanshipâ. </p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant claims that during the time when he was involved in the Gucci business, he had personally designed many products for theâGucciâ Accessory Collection.  The plaintiff disputed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs alleged experience as a designer while working with it, but for the purpose of this Decision, it is not necessary forme to make any finding in that regard.  Indeed, in an application for interlocutory injunction, it is not appropriate for the courtto resolve factual disputes based on affidavit evidence.  I note that the evidence produced by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to support his claim as a designer is sparseâhe has produced a few drawings which he claims were made by him during thetime when he was working for the plaintiff, and he claims that he had helped refine the Gucci crest which is still used by the plaintifftoday.  Other than this, there is little evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs experience, let alone reputation, as a designer.  More importantly, there is no evidence, and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant does not claim, to have any reputation in Hong Kong as a designer.  Accordingly, whatever might have been his designingexperience while working with the plaintiff, there is no evidence before me of his having any reputation as a designer in Hong Kong. This is a matter of some importance when I consider the allegations of infringement of trade marks and passing off later in thisDecision. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is a company incorporated in Hong Kong and carries on a brand licensing business.  According to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, its associated company, one World Pride Industries Limited, used to be an exclusive distributor of GUCCI leather goodsin China in the years between 1992 to 1995.  Another associated company called ForonTimes International Ltd was alleged to be anexclusive distributor of Gucci timepieces in China until August 1997.  The plaintiff however disputes this. </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant operates a website at <a>www.foronltd.com</a>.  In its website, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant claims that it is a consulting company in licensing, franchising, brand management, image building and animation production.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  I would also mention briefly the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants as they are involved in some of the alleged acts of infringement and passing off.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant is a Hong Kong company and carries on business in Hong Kong as a wholesaler and manufacturer of optical products includingeyewear.  The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant is also a Hong Kong company and its business is in the manufacture and sale of optical products including spectacle frames,reading glasses and sunglasses.  The registered office address of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant is the same as that of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. </p>    <p class="heading">REGISTERED TRADE MARKS OF THE PLAINTIFF</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The plaintiff markets a great variety of products and its product range includes fashion, bags, luggage, eyewear, footwear, timepiecesand jewellery.  As may be expected of a world-renowned brand like Gucci, the plaintiff has used a number of marks, signs and logosto distinguish its products and has registered many of such marks, signs and logos in many countries in respect of various kindsof goods and products.  The evidence shows that the plaintiff has trade mark registrations in 177 jurisdictions, with over 6,500trade mark registrations worldwide.  A list of the plaintiffâs worldwide trade mark applications and registrations has been includedin the plaintiffâs affidavit in support of the Summons, which I have read. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I am, however, only concerned in this case with the trade marks that are registered in Hong Kong.  Ms Tam in her submissions hasnot relied on any trade mark that is registered overseas and I shall say no more about the trade marks that are registered by theplaintiff outside Hong Kong.  As far as the trade marks registered in Hong Kong are concerned, the Statement of Claim and the Summonsrefer to more than 230 of them but it is clear that some of the trade marks referred to are not relevant (at least at this stage)in that they bear little resemblance, let alone being identical or confusingly similar, to the signs or marks which the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants (collectively as the â<b>defendants</b>â) have allegedly used.  Many of the trade marks are registered in respect of goods which are clearly different from, and bear nosimilarity to, the goods or products allegedly marketed by the defendants (see Annex A to the Statement of Claim and also the Summons). Mr Shipp in his submission criticised the plaintiff for failing to identify as to what sign used by the defendants has allegedlyinfringed which registered trade mark(s) of the plaintiff.  He lamented what he described as the âunenviable task of trying todig out what registered trade mark the plaintiff is relying on in respect of each alleged infringing act.â  He submitted that sucha task should not be placed on the shoulder of the court or the defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  There is some justification to Mr Shippâs criticism.  But one must not take the same too far.  In my view, although the Statementof Claim could have been more precise and specific, and care could and should have been taken to avoid overloading the same by includingreferences to marks which are not relevant, it cannot be said that the Statement of Claim has not sufficiently pleaded the plaintiffâscase.  Paragraph 27 of the Statement of Claim has set out in table form the marks used or adopted by the defendants which are allegedto be identical and/or confusingly similar to the marks of the plaintiff, which are juxtaposed for comparison in the table.  Whenthe table in paragraph 27 is read with paragraphs 63 to 70 of the Statement of Claim, and the alleged wrongdoings of the defendantspleaded in paragraphs 28 to 45, it should be quite clear to the defendants what the case of the plaintiff is in relation to trademark infringement. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Moreover, in the course of her reply submission at the adjourned hearing, Ms Tam offered to provide the court and Mr Shipp witha further âTrade Mark Tableâ that would summarise the alleged infringing signs or marks of the defendant against the correspondingmarks of the plaintiff said to be infringed, at the same time identifying the particular acts of infringement and the goods in relationto which the signs or marks complained of were used by the defendant.  The Trade Mark Table was subsequently provided by the plaintiffâssolicitors and Mr Shipp has had the opportunity, and did, respond to the same by written submissions. </p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  The Trade Mark Table submitted by the plaintiffâs solicitors refers to about 50 registered trade marks only.  This representsa drastic reduction of the number of trade marks set out in paragraph 1(a) and Annex A of the Summons.  Ms Tam in her written submissionstated that âin order to find a serious issue to be tried on trade mark infringement â¦ [the plaintiff] recognizes that the Courtshould not be troubled with examining each and every registration, so the nearest ones are now picked for expedienceâ.  I takethis to mean that the trade marks referred to in the said Trade Mark Table are the closest that the plaintiff can get on the evidencein support of its case of trade mark infringement, and if the court is not satisfied that the same are sufficient to give rise toa serious issue to be tried, the other trade marks referred to in Annex A of the Summons would not be sufficient either.  Accordingly,on the issue of trade mark infringement, I shall proceed on the basis of the trade marks referred to in the Trade Mark Table. </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Annexed to this Decision is a table (the â<b>Annexed Table</b>â) which sets out the registered trade marks relied upon by the plaintiff (â<b>plaintiffâs Trade Marks</b>â), the relevant registration numbers, the signs or marks used by the defendants which are alleged to be infringing, and the goodscovered by the relevant trade mark registrations that have been identified by the plaintiff as relevant to its claim. </p>    <p class="heading">SIGNS AND MARKS USED BY THE defendants</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant himself is the registered proprietor of the mark âCOGUâ, which is registered in Hong Kong under Trade Mark registrationNos. 300535248 and 300994564 for Class 9 and Classes 18 and 25 respectively.  He is also the applicant of Hong Kong Trade Mark ApplicationNo. 301040390 for an âinterlockingâ mark in Classes 18 and 25.  For a sample of this âinterlockingâ markâsee the mark designatedas âD1âs Interlocking CG Markâ at p. 4 of the Annexed Table.  </p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  âCOGUâ is an amalgamation of the first syllables of âCosimoâ and âGucciâ, being the first and last name of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  I have mentioned before that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is a partner of his fatherâs business, which marketed goods under the âHouse of Florenceâ brand.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has also started his own business in Japan selling watches, fashion accessories and pet products under the brand name âCOGUâ. In or about mid-2008, the defendant decided to launch the COGU brand in Hong Kong.  He did so by teaming up with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, and licensed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the head-licensor the use of the âCOGUâ mark.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was a head-licensor as it was free to sub-license the use of the mark to other licensees.  For example, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was a sub-licensee of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in respect of eyewear products (copy of a Merchandise License Agreement dated 24 October 2007 made between the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the âMaster Licenseeâ and the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant as the âLicenseeâ has been produced in evidence, which I have studied).  According to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, it had also appointed another licensee for bag products.  Apart from using the âCOGUâ mark, other signs and markswere also used by the defendants in the marketing of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs products.  The plaintiff complains that the signs and marks used by the defendants were identical or otherwise confusinglysimilar to various trade marks that have been registered by the plaintiff in Hong Kong.  I have set out in the first column of theAnnexed Table the signs and marks used by the defendants complained of by the plaintiff (collectively as the â<b>alleged Infringing Marks</b>â). </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  The circumstances in which the alleged Infringing Marks were used are briefly summarized in the paragraphs below. </p>    <p class="heading">ADVERTISEMENTS</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Two advertisements appeared in two local variety magazines, namely, the âSudden Weeklyâ and âOriental Dailyâ in early June2008.

On the arm of the spectacle, a pattern inthe form of what I call âD1âs CG Monogram-1â (see p. 7 of the Annexed Table) was used.  At the bottom of the advertisementappeared the word âCOGUâ in big capital letters.  Below the word âCOGUâ is the word âITALYâ (in smaller fonts), and furtherunderneath were the words âdesigned by COSIMO GUCCIâ. </p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The advertisement in Sudden Weekly featured a woman wearing a pair of spectacles.

In these bus-stop advertisements, the âCOGUâmark was shown prominently, and a photograph of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was displayed either next to or below the âCOGUâ mark, with the name âCosimo Gucciâ shown underneath the photograph.</p>    <p class="heading">2<sup>nd</sup> DEFENDANTâs WEBSITE</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  I have referred to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs website <a>www.foronltd.com</a> (â<b>D2âs Website</b>â) above.

The press conference was jointlyorganised by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants.  I note that the email (I have seen a sample which was sent to one Christy Ng of Hong Kong Tatler) sent to the pressmedia by one Karley Communications Ltd (a company said to be responsible for carrying out the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendantâs promotional activities for âCOGUâ products) announcing the press conference merely described the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the great grandson of âCuccio Gucciâ [<i>sic</i>], creator of the world-renowned brand Gucci.  The covering email did not even mention COGU at all.  What was highlighted was theconnection between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and Gucciâemphasis was given to the fact that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was the great grandson of the creator of the Gucci brand.  In noting this, I have not overlooked that the press releaseattached to the email did mention COGU and the fact that the family business of Gucci had been acquired by âoutsidersâ.  However,anyone reading the email without reading the attachment would necessarily form the impression that the press conference was connectedwith Gucci.  One would have to read the contents of the mail attachment to find out that COGU was involved. </p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  I have seen certain photographs taken at the press conference.  There was a catwalk show with models wearing and carrying variousCOGU products (eyewear and bags) against a backdrop which displayed (apart from D1âs Interlocking CG Mark, placed to the âCOGUâmark) the following words in a very prominent manner :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">â   COSIMO GUCCI</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ASIA TOUR â HONG KONG 2008-7-21â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The press conference and catwalk show had generated a certain amount of press report.  I have seen the newspaper clippings coveringthe event.  From the newspaper clippings that I have seen, it would appear that the products worn or carried by models on that occasioncarried various signs or marks.  It was pleaded by the plaintiff that these signs or marks included âCOSIMO GUCCIâ, âCOGUâ,âCOGU ITALYâ, and D1âs Interlocking CG Mark.  The pictures that I have seen, including those contained in the newspaper clippings,are not very clear in showing up the signs and marks used on the eyewear and the bags.  I am therefore unable to see clearly whatexactly were the marks used on the products displayed in the catwalk show.  I do note that a lot of the media coverage that followedthe press conference did make reference to the âGucci connectionâ, and the fact that the COGU products were being marketed orpromoted by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was a member of the Gucci family and a descendant of the founder of the Gucci brand.  </p>    <p class="heading">Other promotional activities</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In or around mid-July 2008, one Shirley Ngan, the marketing manager of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, provided to an investigator engaged by the plaintiff a product leaflet.  In the product leaflet, various timepieces andgarment products were shown.  However, the pictures are not very clear and I have some difficulties in seeing what exactly are themarks or signs used in the products shown.  However, what is clear is that the product leaflet displayed the D1âs InterlockingCG Mark, the âCOGUâ mark, and the words âdesigned by Cosimo Gucciâ in various places.  A family tree of the Gucci familywas included in the product leaflet, again showing Guccio Gucci as the head of the family tree, and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and his father are featured prominently in family tree.  The âCOGUâ mark and D1âs Interlocking CG Mark was shownbelow the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs name in the family tree. </p>    <p class="heading">Style Guide</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Although not pleaded by the plaintiff in the Statement of Claim, the evidence filed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants in these proceedings disclosed the existence of a Style Guideâa kind of manual which contained detailed specificationsof various marks and signs to be used on COGU products and provided by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to its licensees, including the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, to follow.  There are 2 versions of the Style Guide in the evidenceâone version was produced by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant and a âmore recentâ version was produced by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  There are some differences between the 2 versions, but for the purpose of my decision in this application, the differencesdo not matter.  It is not entirely clear how the Style Guide was prepared.  All that was said by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in this regard was that âthe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant instructed the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant with regard to the type of brand image and design concept that was required for âCOGUâ products.  In turn, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant then presented the concept in material form, including a manual known as the Style Guideâ. </p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  The Style Guide contains the specification of various signs or marks to be adopted by the licensees for use on the COGU products. This included, <i>inter alia</i>, the sign or mark âCOGUâ, âdesigned by Cosimo Gucciâ, the D1âs Interlocking CG Mark, the D1âs horse-bit Pattern Mark,and the D1âs CG Monogram-2 (see, p. 7 of the Annexed Table).  It is alleged by the defendants that the horse-bit Mark had subsequentlybeen removed from the Style Guide, although it is not clear when that was done. </p>    <p class="heading">Trap orders</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  On or about 24 June 2008, a pair of sunglasses was sold by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to an investigator engaged by the plaintiff.  The sunglasses sold to the investigator bears the pattern (in the form ofD1âs CG Monogram-1) and the mark âCOGUâ on the temple of the sunglasses.  There was a card accompanying the sunglasses soldto the investigator.  The pattern mark, namely, D1âs CG Monogram-1, was printed on the card, together with the âCOGUâ markand the words âdesigned by COSIMO GUCCIâ. </p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  It was alleged by the plaintiff that a Mr Benjamin Chan had orally represented to the investigator that the brand âCOGUâ wasin fact âGUCCIâ and that the âCOGUâ sunglasses sold to him was the same as âGUCCIâ products.  It was alleged that MrChan referred to the âCOGUâ brand as âGUCCI COGUâ.  This allegation was however denied by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.  Indeed the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant claimed that it had never authorised the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to sell âCOGUâ eyewear and alleged that the pair of sunglasses sold to the investigator was a brand of eyewear calledâNagasakiâ.  This does not appear to me to be a credible story.  The evidence shows that a day later, in an email sent by MrChan to the investigator, Mr Chan confirmed to the investigator that âCOGUâ was a brand of âGUCCIâ.  Faced with such documentaryevidence, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant obviously had difficulty in explaining the email of Mr Chan.  In an affirmation filed on behalf of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, one Mr Cheng Kin Kwok could only say that he âdid not understandâ why Mr Chan would say such things in the said emailto the investigator. </p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In these circumstances, the plaintiff claims that the defendants have wrongfully infringed its right as the proprietor of the plaintiffâsTrade Marks .  Relying on essentially the same facts, the plaintiff further claims that the defendants have wrongfully passed offthe COGU products as that of the plaintiff.  The present action was accordingly commenced on 25 August 2008, followed by the issuanceof the Summons for interlocutory injunctions as mentioned above. </p>    <p class="heading">THE TEST OF AMERICAN CYANAMID</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  It is now well-settled that the <i>American Cyanamid</i> principles apply equally to applications for interim relief in trade mark and passing off cases (see, e.g. <i>County Sound v Ocean Sound</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20FSR%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] F.S.R. 367).</a>  However, in cases where it is clear that the outcome of an application for interim relief will in effect dispose of the entire action,or where it is clear that the consequence of the grant of an injunction is such that the defendant will have to abandon the allegedInfringing Marks permanently and there is no or little possibility of the action going to trial, the American Cyanamid principlesmay not be appropriate.  In such cases, the court âmay have to do the best it can to assess the merits and grant or refuse an injunctionbased on its conclusionâ (see, <i>NWL Ltd v Woods</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%201294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 W.L.R. 1294</a>, <i>Kerlyâs Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</i> (14<sup>th</sup> ed.), 19-087 and the cases cited in footnote 37 therein). </p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  In the present case, Mr Shipp has, in his 1<sup>st</sup> written submission filed before the hearing, sought to argue that the grant of an injunction would really mean an end of the defendantâsalleged Infringing Marks and argued that the plaintiff has to do better than merely showing a serious question to be tried.  Thisargument was not pursued by Mr Shipp in his oral submissions made at the hearing.  In my view, Mr Shipp was clearly right in notpursuing this argument.  There is no evidence before the court to show that the present case is one whereby the grant of an injunctionwould in effect decide the whole action, or that it would effectively spell the end of the case for the defendant, so that thereis no real possibility of a trial.  In my view, the present case is one to which I should apply the ordinary <i>American Cyanamid</i> principles. </p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  It follows that I should first consider whether there is a serious issue to be tried.  If there is, I should proceed to considerwhether the plaintiff would be adequately compensated by an award of damages if it should succeed at trial.  If damages are adequatecompensation and recoverable from the defendants, no interlocutory injunction should normally be granted.  If its loss is irreparableand would not be sufficiently compensatable by an award of damages, I should consider the balance of convenience between the partiesbefore deciding whether the grant of an interlocutory injunction is appropriate in this case. </p>    <p class="heading">TRADE MARK INFRINGEMENT</p>    <p class="heading">Trade Mark Ordinance (<a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/559">Cap. 559</a>)</p>    <p><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a>  Section 14 of the Trade Mark Ordinance (â<b>TMO</b>â) provides that the owner of a registered trade mark has exclusive rights in the trade mark which are infringed by use of the trademark in Hong Kong without his consent.

The 1994 Act implemented the FirstCouncil Directive 89/104/EEC (the â<b>1989 Directive</b>â) adopted by the Council of the European Economic Communities on 21<sup>st</sup> December 1988 âto approximate the laws of the Member States [of the European Union] relating to trade marksâ.  The 1994 Act effectedsome significant legislative changes to the previous law based on the Trade Marks Act 1938 (which was repealed on 31<sup>st</sup> October 1994).  As the TMO is modelled upon the 1994 Act, which in turn follows the 1989 Directive, decisions of the European Courtof Justice (â<b>ECJ</b>â) on the interpretation of the 1989 Directive, made upon references by the courts of the Member States, are relevant and of assistanceto the interpretation of the TMO. </p>    <p class="heading">Infringement under section 18(1)</p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  Section 18 provides for the conditions whereby the use of a âsignâ may be considered as infringing a registered trade mark. There is no statutory definition of the word âsignâ, but section 3 of TMO defines a âtrade markâ by reference to a âsignâ,namely, any sign which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings andwhich is capable of being represented graphically.  In <i>Philips v Remington</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20RPC%20283" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] R.P.C. 283</a> at 298, Jacob J (as he then was) held that a wide meaning should be given to the word âsignâ.  A âsignâ is anything whichcan convey information.  I do not understand counsel in this case to disagree on this. </p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  The alleged Infringing Marks are clearly capable of conveying information.

The criterion of identity of the sign and the trade mark must be interpreted strictly.  The very definition of identity impliesthat the two elements compared should be the same in all respects.  Indeed, the absolute protection in the case of a sign which isidentical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the trade mark is registered,which is guaranteed by Art.5(1) (a) of the Directive, cannot be extended beyond the situations for which it was envisaged, in particular,to those situations which are more specifically protected by Art.5(1)(b) of the Directive.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">51.

However, the perception of identity between the sign and the trade mark must be assessed globally with respect to an average consumerwho is deemed to be reasonably well informed, reasonably observant and circumspect.  The sign produces an overall impression on sucha consumer.  That consumer only rarely has the chance to make a direct comparison between signs and trade marks and must place histrust in the imperfect picture of them that he has kept in his mind.  Moreover, his level of attention is likely to vary accordingto the category of goods or services in question (see, to that effect, Case C-342/97 <i>Lloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20ECR%20I%2d3819" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] E.C.R.

This latter is a concept more aptlyrelated to the question of whether there is a likelihood of confusion between an accused sign and the registered mark, namely theArt. 5.1(b) question.â (see, <i>Reed</i>, [25], <i>per</i> Jacob LJ). </p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Be that as it may, it is tolerably clear from the judgment of the ECJ that a strict interpretation should be adopted in consideringthe question whether an alleged infringing sign is identical to a registered mark.  Although the court is to allow for the âimperfectpictureâ of the average consumer (whenever I use the term âaverage customerâ in this Decision, I am referring to one who isreasonably well-informed, reasonably observant and circumspect), it is only where the differences are truly minute and insignificantthat they may be ignored (see, [50] of the Advocate Generalâs opinion at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%20FSR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] F.S.R. 1</a>, cited in [29] of Jacob LJâs judgment in the <i>Reed</i> case).  As observed by Jacob LJ, â[a]s a matter of policy there is no reason to suppose that the [ECJ] meant to soften the edgesof âstrict identityâ very far.  For even if a sign and mark are not identical for the purposes of Art. 5.1(a) if there is a likelihoodof confusion it will be caught by Art. 5.1(b) â¦  It would make no sense if, once such a mark were registered, a visually differentbut identical word device mark were treated as identical.â (see, <i>Reed</i>, at [27] and [30]). </p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  I respectfully agree with Jacob LJ.  In my view, what is required by section 18(1) of TMO is âstrict identityâ.  There is clearlya difference between marks which are similar (or confusingly similar), and those which are identical.  To construe section 18(1)flexibly so that it applies to signs and marks which are not âstrictly identicalâ is to blur the distinction between section18(1) and section 18(3).  The distinction is important.  Unlike the case of section 18(3), where section 18(1) is engaged, no proofof likelihood of confusion is required.  In my view, it is only where the difference between the sign and the mark is so minute andso trivial as to be âwholly insignificantâ that they are to be considered âidenticalâ for the purpose of section 18(1). </p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  I therefore look for strict identity between the alleged Infringing Marks and the plaintiffâs Trade Marks.

June Perfect Ltd. and FW Woolworth Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1941%5d%2058%20RPC%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1941] 58 R.P.C. 147</a> at 161, Sir Wilfred Greene MR put the principle as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the statutory protection is absolute in the sense that once a mark is shown to offend, the user of it cannot escape by showingthat by something <u>outside the actual mark</u> itself he has distinguished his goods from those of the registered proprietorâ <u>[my emphasis</u>].</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  After the 1994 Act had come into effect, the English courts continued to apply the principle in applying the 1994 Act.  Thus, JacobJ (as he then was) in the case of <i>Origins Natural Resources Inc. v Origin Clothing Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20FSR%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] F.S.R. 280</a> at 284 held that section 10 of the 1994 Act (the U.K. counterpart of section 18 of TMO) ârequires the court to assume the markof the plaintiff is used in a normal and fair manner in relation to goods for which it is registered and then to assess a likelihoodof confusion in relation to the way the defendant uses its mark, discounting added matter or circumstancesâ.  It should be notedthat this case was actually a section 10(2) case as the sign complained of was not identical with the registered trade mark. </p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  In <i>British Sugar PLC v.

There the plaintiff was the registered proprietor of the mark âTREATâ for dessertsauces and syrups.  The defendant launched a sweet spread labelled âRobertsonâs Toffee Treatâ.  Applying the added matter principlethe learned judge held that the first two words in âRobertsonâs Toffee Treatâ were added matter and should be discounted, sothat the defendantâs sign was to be treated as identical to the plaintiffâs mark (at p. 294). </p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  In <i>Decon Laboratories Ltd v Fred Baker Scientific Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%20RPC%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] R.P.C. 17</a>, the claimant was the proprietor of a range of trade marks all of which included the mark âDeconâ.  The defendants sold productsunder a range of marks which also included the mark âDeconâ.  However, save for the inclusion of the word âDeconâ, none ofthe defendantâs composite marks were identical with any of the composite marks used by the claimant.  The defendantâs principalproduct was âDecon-Aholâ while the claimantâs principal product was âDecon 90â.  Relying on <i>Saville Perfumery</i> and <i>British Sugar</i>, Pumfrey J held that the claimantâs marks and the defendantsâ signs were identical and there was infringement under section 10(1)of the 1994 Act.  The learned judge explained his view as follows (see [9] of the judgment) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThere seems to me to be no serious doubt that the signs used by the defendants have two parts, a prefix consisting of the wordâDeconâ accompanied by a part somewhat more descriptive of the particular product â¦ The suffixes (-ahol, -clean, -phene and-phase) do not change the nature of the principal sign: they are all âDecon plus a suffixâ marks, and not different signs differingessentially from each other.  The suffixes cannot distinguish the goods from those of the registered proprietor, since their principalfunction is to refer to the nature and quality of the goods themselves.  It seems to me to be very clear that this is an exampleof the use of an identical sign upon goods in respect of which the claimantâs mark is registered and that there is accordinglyinfringement under section 10(1).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  It will be seen from the passage cited above that Pumfrey Jâs conclusion is based on his view that the suffixes to the word âDeconâas used in the defendantsâ signs were of no trade mark significance at allâthe suffixes merely referred to the nature and qualityof the goods and could not distinguish the goods from those of the registered proprietor.  For that reason, the suffixes should beignored and the defendantsâ signs were identical with the claimantsâ marks. </p>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  In <i>Aktiebolaget Volvo v. Heritage (Leicester) Limited</i>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2000%5d%20FSR%20253" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] F.S.R. 253</a>, the claimants owned various registered trade marks including the word âVolvoâ registered in respect of the maintenance and repairof vehicles.  The defendant put up signs at the entrance of his garage and also on its letterhead which read âIndependent VolvoSpecialistâ, with the words âindependentâ and âspecialistâ in much smaller lettering than the word âVolvoâ.  It washeld by Rattee J. that the words âindependentâ and âspecialistâ should be ignored, and the defendantâs sign is identicalwith the plaintiffâs registered trade marks.  At p. 259 of his judgment, the learned judge held :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ in the case of a word trade mark such as that in the present case, all that is necessary to constitute prima facie infringementunder section 10(1) is use of the identical word in the course of trade as a distinct word, whether with or without other words ormaterial added to it â¦â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  With respect to Rattee J., I am of the view that so formulated, the principle has been stated too widely.  It seems to me that ina case where it is alleged that the defendantâs sign is identical with the plaintiffâs mark, it is necessary firstly to identifywhat precisely is the sign of the defendant to be compared with the plaintiffâs mark (see, <i>Reed</i>, [33]).  Section 18(1) requires the alleged infringing sign to be compared with the registered mark and no such comparison couldbe made without first identifying what exactly is the defendantâs sign.  In a case where additional words or materials are usedby the defendant together with the word mark of the plaintiff, it is necessary to determine whether the additional words or materialsform part of the sign of the defendant.  Using the same word identical to the plaintiffâs word mark, in my view, does not <i>per se</i> constitute infringement, <i>prima facie</i> or otherwise.  One must look at the whole context in which the words are used before deciding what constitutes the defendantâssign.  Once the defendantâs sign has been identified, it can then be compared with the plaintiffâs mark to see if the two areidentical (section 18(1)) or confusingly similar (section 18(3)).  And it is at this stage that the added matter principle comesin.  If the defendantâs sign that has been identified is found to be identical to the plaintiffâs mark, the defendant cannotrely on matters outside the offending sign to escape liability for trade mark infringement (matters outside the offending sign may,however, be sufficient to enable the defendant to escape liability for passing off : see, for example, <i>Julius Samaan Ltd v Tetrosyl Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%20FSR%2042" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] F.S.R. 42).</a> </p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  In many cases what is the defendantâs sign should be obvious and the elements that constitute the sign can be discerned easily. There may however be more difficult cases.  If, for example, the defendant uses a word that is identical to a word mark of the plaintiff,but adds additional words or materials to it, it would be necessary to see if the additional words or materials form an integralpart of the sign.  Whether the additional words or materials form an integral part of the sign would depend on the contextâe.g.if they are presented in such a way that they are not in the same field of vision as the word or words that are identical to theplaintiffâs marks, or in such small print that makes them difficult to discern, or in such form or context that makes the additionalwords or materials totally devoid of any trade mark significance, the additional words or materials may not form part of the signand can be ignored.  A good example is the Volvo case before Rattee J., where the words âindependentâ and âspecialistâ onthe two sides were in much smaller lettering than the word mark âVolvoâ in the middle.  Moreover, in the context in which thesign was used, the words âindependentâ and âspecialistâ are clearly of no trade mark significance at allâthey are not wordsthat serve to qualify the word âVolvoâ, nor are they words that purport to perform the function of distinguishing the goods orservice concerned, in the way a trade mark is.  They are words that are purely descriptive in nature, and are of no trade mark significanceat all.  Rattee J. was thus clearly correct in ignoring the additional words, although the way he formulated the principle at p.259 of his judgment was, in my view, too broad.  In taking that view, I am aware that in the case of <i>O2 Holdings Ltd v. Hutchison 3G Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/$(division)/$(year)/$(decno).html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] EWHC 534</a> and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2006%5d%20RPC%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] R.P.C. 29</a>, eminent U.K. counsel conceded at first instance that the formulation of Rattee J was correct (see, [111] of the judgment of LewisonJ). </p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  A similar example may be found in the case of <i>Bayerische Motorenwerke AG v. Deenik</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20ECR%20I%2d905" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] E.C.R. I-905</a>, where the words complained of were âBMW specialistâ, âSpecialised in BMWsâ and âRepairs and maintenance of BMWsâ.  TheECJ proceeded on the basis that the defendantâs sign was just BMW.  As Jacob LJ explained in the <i>Reed</i> case, the ECJ proceeded on the basis that the other words in context were wholly devoid of trade mark significance (see, <i>Reed</i>, [34]). </p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  The case of <i>BP Amoco Plc v John Kelly Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%20FSR%205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] F.S.R. 5</a>, cited to me by Ms Tam is, in my view, consistent with what I set out above.  There the plaintiff sued for, <i>inter alia</i>, infringement of trade mark, relying on their trade mark registrations that gave it the exclusive right to use the colour green asthe brand identifier of service stations in U.K.  The defendant also operated roadside filling stations, which featured the samecolour green as that of the plaintiff.  However, while the plaintiffâs stations bore the logo âBPâ, the defendantâs stationsbore the logo âTOPâ.  However, as found by the court, a motorist driving at speed would not be able to see the defendantâslogo, and might be attracted by the green coloring to pull over to buy petrol.  By the time he had slowed down, and realised thatit was not a BP station, he would be inclined to continue his manoeuvre and buy petrol from the defendant.  The Court of Appeal ofNorthern Ireland, relying on a chain of cases that affirmed the âadded matter principleâ, held the plaintiff to succeed in itsclaim for infringement.  In my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland is perfectly consistent with what Isaid above.  On the facts, the logo of the defendant was not part of the sign in that it could not be seen by motorists driving atspeed, and they would be misled by the defendantâs sign (i.e. the use of the colour green on its canopy, signage etc.) into thinkingthat it was a BP station.  The added material, namely, the logo âTOPâ was not part of the sign and was thus rightly ignored forthe purpose of trade mark infringement.  </p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Similarly, the judgment of Kitchin J in <i>Julius Samaan</i> (<i>supra</i>), also cited by Ms Tam, is fully consistent with what I said above.  In that case, the learned judge when considering trade markinfringement ignored the additional materials contained in the packaging of the allegedly infringing product.  He, however, did notignore the additional trade mark materials on the product itself (including in particular a âroundelâ on the tub of a tree-shapedsign).  I think the reason was clear: the learned judge clearly took the view that the additional materials on the product formedpart of the defendantâs sign to be compared with the plaintiffâs mark.  The additional materials on the packaging did not formpart of the sign as the packaging could only be seen at the point of sale and did not distinguish the product itselfâthus lackingany trade mark significance.  As the learned judge observed, an average consumer seeing one of the defendantâs products hangingin a vehicle without the distinguishing material on the packaging was likely to be confused by what he saw (see, [57] of the judgmentof Kitchin J).</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  On the other hand, there certainly are cases where the additional words and materials, when looked at in context, do form an integralpart of the defendantâs sign, and cannot be discounted as having no trade mark significance at all.  The ECJ envisaged this inthe <i>LJT Diffusion</i> case.   Referring to the ECJ decision, Jacob LJ remarked in <i>Reed</i> (see, [26]) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âOf importance here is the recognition that an addition in the defendantâs sign to a registered mark may take the case outsideone of âidentityâ ([51]).  This is obviously sensible â one word can qualify another so as to change its impact, âHarryâqualifies âPotterâ and vice versa, for instance.  It is particularly in the recognition that additions can change identity thatthe ECJ has moved on from the rather rigid view taken under the old UK law.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>I respectfully agree. </p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Applying the above to the word marks used by the defendant in the present case, I cannot accept Ms Tamâs submissions that theadded matter principle requires me to treat the word marks of the defendant as identical to the âGUCCIâ mark of the plaintiff. Take, for example, the expression âCOGU by COSIMO GUCCIâ.  The word âCOGUâ and âCOSIMOâ in this expression are wordsthat have no ordinary meaning in English.  They are not descriptive words.  An average consumer understanding English seeing suchan expression used on a product would see that âCOGUâ is some kind of a nameâalthough it might be a name totally unknown tohim.  He would also see that the word âCosimoâ is a part of the name âCosimo Gucciâ.  In my judgment, just as âHarryâqualifies âPotterâ (see <i>Reed</i>, at [26], cited above),  âCosimoâ qualifies âGucciâ in the context of the expression in question.  That is so notwithstandingthat Harry Potter is a famous name, and Cosimo Gucci might be totally unknown in Hong Kong.  The fact that âCosimo Gucciâ asa name has no acquired distinctiveness in Hong Kong may be highly relevant when one comes to consider likelihood of confusion undersection 18(3) (dealt with below).  That, however, is a different question altogether. </p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  In the <i>Reed</i> case, Jacob LJ had the occasion of considering whether the defendantâs sign âREED BUSINESS INFORMATIONâ is identical to theplaintiffâs registered mark âREEDâ.  At [37]â[40] of his lordshipâs judgment, Jacob LJ pertinently said :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âIt was over âReed Business Informationâ that battle was joined.  The composite is not the same as, for instance, use of theword âReedâ in the sentence: âGet business information from Reedâ.  In the latter case the only âtrade-markyâ bit wouldbe âReedâ.  In the former, the name as a whole is âReed Business Informationâ.  The use of capital letters is of some visualsignificance â it conveys to the average user that âBusiness Informationâ is part of the name.  If the added words had beenwholly and specifically descriptive â really adding nothing at all (e.g. âPalmolive Soapâ compared with âPalmoliveâ) theposition might have been different.  But âBusiness Informationâ is not so descriptive â it is too general for that.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">So is âReed Business Informationâ identical to âReedâ?  I think not.  âReedâ is a common surname.  The average consumerwould recognise the additional words as serving to differentiate the defendant from Reeds in general â this one calls itself âReedBusiness Informationâ because it supplies information to businesses in some unspecified way or ways.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">Putting it another way, I do not think the additional words âBusiness Informationâ would âgo unnoticed by the average consumer.â In all uses of the phrase complained of they are as prominent as the word âReedâ.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">In so holding I am not saying that in some circumstances the average consumer could not assume that âReed Business Informationâis connected with Reed Employment or an organisation called âReedâ.  But these would be cases of similarity of mark and sign,not identity.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  Similar consideration applies to the expression âdesigned by COSIMO GUCCIâ.  Even assuming that it is permissible to ignorethe words âdesigned byâ as being purely descriptive, in my view it is not permissible to ignore the word âCOSIMOâ.  Visuallythe words âCOSIMO GUCCIâ are displayed in the same uppercase form and typescripts.  Conceptually the words are presented as onename.  The word âCOSIMOâ cannot go unnoticed by the average consumer as being part of a name.  It is unrealistic and wholly artificialto ignore one part of the name, and take the remaining part only as the sign of the defendant.  The name âCOSIMO GUCCIâ as awhole must be taken as constituting the defendantâs sign.  Such a sign is not identical to the plaintiffâs mark âGUCCIâ.</p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In these circumstances, in my judgment none of the defendantâs word signs or word marks are identical to the plaintiffâs âGUCCIâmark.  I do not consider that there is any serious issue to be tried for infringement under section 18(1). </p>    <p class="heading">Infringement under section 18(3)</p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  As I am of the view that none of the alleged Infringing Marks are identical to the plaintiffâs Trade Marks, there can be no infringementunder section 18(2). </p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  I turn now to consider section 18(3).  As there is no doubt that the alleged Infringing Marks are used by the defendants in thecourse of trade or business, what requires to be considered is whether there is a serious issue to be tried on the following :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  whether the alleged Infringing Marks (or any of them) are similar to the plaintiffâs Trade Marks;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) whether the goods in relation to which the alleged Infringing Marks were used are identical or similar to those for which theplaintiffâs Trade Marks are registered;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c) whether the use of the alleged Infringing Marks in relation to the goods is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  At this stage, all I need to be satisfied (before proceeding further to consider the exercise of my discretion) is that there isa serious question to be tried. </p>    <p class="heading">Principles to be applied</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  The question of similarity between the alleged offending signs and the registered trade marks is closely related to the questionof likelihood of confusion.  In this regard, I would gratefully adopt the summary of basic principles set out by Kitchin J in hisjudgment in the case of <i>Julius Samaan</i> (at [51]) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  the likelihood of confusion must be appreciated globally, taking account of all the relevant factors : Case C-251/95 <i>Sabel BV v.

A lesser degree of similaritybetween the marks may be offset by a greater degree of similarity between the goods, and vice versa: Case C-39/97 <i>Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v. Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20RPC%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] R.P.C. 117</a> at [17] to [28];</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)  mere association, in the sense that the later mark brings the earlier mark to mind, is not sufficient for the purpose of theassessment : <i>Sabel</i> at [26];</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(j)  but the risk that the public might believe that the goods come from the same or economically linked undertakings does constitutea likelihood of confusion within the meaning of the section : <i>Canon</i> at [29] to [30]. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Principles (i) and (j) above may need some explanation.  The ECJ in <i>Sabel</i> (at [10]) alluded to 3 types of association as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ The likelihood of association may arise in three sets of circumstances :  (1) where the public confuses the sign and the markin question (likelihood of direct confusion); (2) where the public makes a connection between the proprietors of the sign and thoseof the mark and confuses them (likelihood of indirect confusion and association); (3) where the public considers the sign to be similarto the mark and perception of the sign calls to mind the memory of the mark, although the two are not confused (likelihood of associationin the strict sense).â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a>  It is only the first 2 types of association, i.e. those which give rise to a likelihood of either direct or indirect confusion,that are sufficient for the purpose of infringement.  Mere association which the public might make between 2 trade marks as a resultof their analogous semantic content is not in itself a sufficient ground for concluding that there is a likelihood of confusion (see,<i>Sabel</i> at [26]).  </p>    <p><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a>  As Lewison J explained in the <i>O2</i> case mentioned above (at [125]) :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe first kind of confusion takes place where the public considers that the sign and the mark denote a common origin of the goodsand services in question.  The second kind of confusion arises where the public considers that there is an economic link or associationbetween the proprietor of the mark and the proprietor of the sign.  The third kind of association is where the [sign] merely callsthe mark to mind, without making any linkage between the goods or services offered under the mark and the sign respectively; or withoutmaking any economic linkage between the proprietor of the mark and the sign respectively.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  With these principles in mind, I will now examine the alleged Infringing Marks and the goods in relation to which they were used,and consider whether there is a likelihood of confusion in the sense mentioned above, always bearing in mind that at this stage Iam only concerned with a serious question to be tried.  Hence the views that I express below on liability of infringement are expressedin the context of my consideration of the requirement of a serious question to be tried.  These views are necessarily based onlyon the affidavit evidence presently before me. </p>    <p class="heading">âCOGUâ</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  As pointed out above, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is the proprietor of the âCOGUâ trade mark.  Section 19(2) of TMO expressly provides that a registered trade mark isnot infringed by the use of another registered trade mark in relation to goods for which the latter is registered.  This is subjectto section 53(9) of TMO, which provides that where the registration of a trade mark is declared invalid under section 53 to any extent,the registration shall to that extent be deemed never to have been made.  There is no evidence before me that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs registrations have been declared invalid. </p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  Hence use of the âCOGUâ mark <i>alone</i> by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in relation to goods for which it was registered is not an infringement.  The âCOGUâ mark is registered under Classes9, 18 and 25, which cover, <i>inter alia</i>, eyeglasses, leather goods, trunks and travelling bags, and clothing. </p>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  In any event I cannot see any similarity, whether visual, aural or conceptual, between the âCOGUâ mark and the âGUCCIâ mark. Visually and aurally, the two marks are vastly different.  Ms Tam submits that the typescripts and fonts used for the âCOGUâmark are confusingly similar and the shape of the letter C is âremarkably closeâ to the letter G in the âGUCCIâ mark.  Icannot agree.  Whatever typescripts are used for the âCOGUâ mark, the overall visual impression of the mark is very differentfrom the âGUCCIâ mark.  Nor can I see any conceptual similarity between the two marks that could be noticed by an average consumer. Given that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and his name has no reputation in Hong Kong, there is no reason to think that an average consumer seeing the âCOGUâmark will imagine that it is a combination of the first two letters of the first and last name of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, and somehow infer from that combination an association with âGUCCIâ.  That seems to me to be very far-fetched. </p>    <p><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a>  What I said above, however, only applies to cases where the âCOGUâ mark is used alone.  Where that mark is used together withother words (e.g. âCOGU designed by COSIMO GUCCIâ, or âCOGU by COSIMO GUCCIâ), the position may be very different. </p>    <p class="heading">âCOSIMO GUCCIâ and âdesigned by COSIMO GUCCIâ</p>    <p><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a>  âCosimo Gucciâ is, of course, a name.  It is in fact the name of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  But it is a name that has no reputation in Hong Kong, whether as the name of a brand, the name of a person, or as thename of a designer.  I think it is fair to say that until the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant started to launch his business in Hong Kong in mid-2008, his name was wholly unknown in Hong Kong.  As a name, âCosimoGucciâ has no reputation to an average consumer in Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a>  âGucciâ, on the other hand, is widely known in Hong Kong as the brand name.  When the word is used as a mark on the plaintiffâsproducts, including the goods in relation to which the plaintiff has trade mark registrations, the mark is distinctive as a markof originâit distinguishes the goods as originating from the plaintiff.  It is not necessary that the average consumer knows thename of the plaintiff, that it is an Italian company, or that it is presently owned and controlled by PPR etc.  The average consumermay not know any of theseâand none of these is unnecessary for the âGUCCIâ mark to be a mark of origin.  When the average consumersees the mark used on the goods, he would recognise it as a mark that indicates the goods as originating from an undertaking responsiblefor the quality and design of the goods, which makes them distinguishable from goods originating from other undertakings.  Put simply,the average consumer would recognise the âGUCCIâ mark as a mark identifying a Gucci product. </p>    <p><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a>  âGUCCIâ as a mark is, in my view, a very strong mark.  The word âGucciâ has no ordinary meaning in English.  The word doesnot describe the nature or function of the goods.  The markâs unique visual and aural effect no doubt gives the mark its âinherentâdistinctiveness, and the long and extensive use of the mark in association with a great variety of products marketed by the plaintiffhas given the mark an âacquiredâ distinctiveness which is exceptionally strong.  As the brand name âGucciâ became more andmore famous over the decades, the acquired distinctiveness of the âGUCCIâ mark became stronger and stronger.  The Gucci brandis now almost a household name in the luxury goods market, and on the evidence before me, it is extremely well-known both internationallyand in Hong Kong.  In these circumstances I have no hesitation in holding that there is at least a serious question to be tried thatâGUCCIâ as a brand name and as a trade mark is strongly distinctive of the plaintiffâs products. </p>    <p><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a>  In this regard, I agree with the following remarks made by Sir Nicholas Browne Wilkinson VC (as he then was) in his decision <i>Guccio Gucci SpA v. Paolo Gucci</i> ([1991] F.S.R. 89), where the learned judge said this in relation to the âGUCCIâ mark :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the exact nature of what is conveyed to the public by the mark may be of importance.  It conveys an impression of luxury goods,of good design and well made.  It also conveys the impression that the goods are expensive.  There is a Gucci housestyle.  Such isthe strength of the name and the overtones attached to it that a very substantial element in the value of the name is that it hasbecome, and is, a designer label.  By that I understand it to be meant that one of the features of some, possibly the majority of,Gucci customers is that they buy Gucci products not only because of their quality or their design but because of the cachet whichthey think they will enjoy by owning, for example, a Gucci handbag or Gucci shoes.  For those interested in status symbols arisingfrom conspicuous expenditure it is important to them not only that the product is a good product but that it should be seen to bea Gucci product; hence the importance of the get-up which by distinctive marks, demonstrate to the outside world the status which,rightly or wrongly, the purchasers think will be conferred on the wearer by ownership of a Gucci product.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Although these words were spoken by the Vice Chancellor on the evidence then before him, what he said is equally applicable to thecase before me and what I have seen from the evidence also supports this observation. </p>    <p><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a>  The fact that the âGUCCIâ mark is not descriptive of the nature or function of particular goods enables its distinctivenessto be applied to a broad range of products of very different nature.  The mark is capable of being applied not only to goods whichit is originally associated with, but also to completely new products and products of new design.  So strong is the mark of âGUCCIâthat when the same is used in a new product, or a product with a wholly new design, customers will naturally assume that the newproduct or new design to which the mark is applied originates from Gucci.  Such an âextensionâ of the branding effect may takeplace both horizontally and verticallyâhorizontally when the mark is applied to other products of a different nature from thoseto which the mark originally applies, or vertically when the mark is applied to another line of goods of the same nature but intendedto appeal to a different market, for example, a younger line, or a second male or female line.  On the evidence before me, such verticalextension is quite common with famous brandsâsome examples are âRL by RALPH LAURENâ, âPOLO by RALPH LAURENâ, âSEE byCHLOEâ and âMARC by MARC JACOBSâ. </p>    <p><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a>  That use of a well-known and highly distinctive mark may lead customers to assume that a new product or a new design originatesfrom the same owner or proprietor of the mark, does not cease to apply merely because another word or name also appears in the newproduct or the new design.  The significance of the other word or name depends on the circumstances.  Where the other word or nameis otherwise unknown as a mark of origin, customers will naturally associate the same with the mark that is well known to them, andwill be led to believe that the other name or word is used merely to indicate that the product belongs to a secondary or extensionline of the same brand.  On the other hand, where the other name or word is itself famous or highly distinctive, customers may assumethat the product is related both to that name and the markâas in the cases of co-branding.  So the âAmerican Express Cathay PacificCredit Cardâ will naturally be taken by the public as a credit card jointly promoted and marketed by âAmerican Expressâ andâCathay Pacificâ, both of which are well-known brand names.  Similarly, âADIDAS by STELLA McCARTNEYâ will be understood asa product of co-branding when Adidas and Stella McCartney are each established names in themselves. </p>    <p><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a>  This brings me to the marks âCOSIMO GUCCIâ and âdesigned by COSIMO GUCCIâ.  I have held that when an average customer seesthese marks, the word âCosimoâ will not be unnoticed and to someone who understands English, it will be seen as part of a name. However, this does not mean that âCosimoâ has as much distinctive character as the word âGucciâ in the marks concerned. Indeed, as I pointed out above, âCosimo Gucciâ as a name is unknown in Hong Kong.  What is well-known in Hong Kong is the nameâGucciâ.  When the word âCosimoâ is used together with âGucciâ in a word sign on goods (particularly on goods of thetypes which are also marketed by the plaintiff), to an average customer who sees such a word sign, the dominant element of the signis clearly the word âGucciâ.  In my view, it is likely that the average customer seeing such a sign would come away thinkingthat the goods are related to Gucci.  When âCosimoâ is unknown and âGucciâ is so widely known, the overall impression ofthe average customer is likely to be dominated by the leading element of the mark, namely, âGucciâ.  Visually, aurally and conceptually,âGucciâ is the dominant element of the sign. </p>    <p><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a>  When the words âCOSIMO GUCCIâ are used, either alone or following the words âdesigned byâ, it is likely that the publicwould take the goods on which the words are used as goods originating from Gucci.  Mr Shipp argues that the words âdesigned byCOSIMO GUCCIâ is merely a descriptive statement informing customers that the goods upon which the words are used are designed bythe 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  I do not agree.  Mr Shippâs argument may have some force if the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has a reputation as a designer in Hong Kong.  That is however not the case here.  An average customer would not have heardof the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at all as a designer (whatever designing experience he might have when he worked with the plaintiff).  In my view, giventhe anonymity of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as a designer, and the strong distinctiveness of the Gucci mark, it is most unlikely that the average customer will comeaway thinking that the goods are the products of an independent designer having nothing to do with Gucci.  On the contrary, he islikely to think that Gucci is behind the design of the goods (and the designer is related to it), and that the goods are connectedwith, or originated from, or otherwise endorsed by Gucci. </p>    <p><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a>  I am fortified in my view above by the decision of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)(â<b>OHIM</b>â) in a contested European Community Trade Mark application relating to the mark âJENNIFER DESIGNED BY JENNIFER GUCCIâ (withthe words âDESIGNED BY JENNIFER GUCCIâ in smaller print appearing immediately underneath the word âJENNIFERâ, and enclosedwithin a rectangular frame).  In that application (see, OHIM Decision no. 208/2005 dated 28<sup>th</sup> January 2005 on Opposition no. B520025) the OHIM decided that the word âGUCCIâ was the dominant element of the mark, and giventhe exceptional distinctiveness of the Gucci mark, the incorporation of the word âGUCCIâ as part of the mark to be registeredwould lead to a likelihood of confusion.  This is because the presence of the dominant element âGUCCIâ would lead :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">ââ¦ the public to give more importance to the element âGUCCIâ because it will interpret the same reference as being a labelof quality endorsed by the guarantee for the specific collection of goods identified by the mark âJENNIFERâ.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a>  The above applies even if the words are used together with an innocuous mark such as âCOGUâ.   The presence of the mark âCOGUâwill not remove the likelihood of confusion that I mentioned above.  Although âCOGUâ as a sign or mark is not infringing in itself,it does not have such acquired distinctiveness as a mark to have the effect of eliminating the confusion generated by the other offendingwords.  âCOGUâ as a brand and as a mark has no or little reputation in Hong Kong.  When the word âCOGUâ is present with theother words, as in the composite mark âCOGU by COSIMO GUCCIâ, or âCOGU designed by COSIMO GUCCIâ, in my judgment the likelihoodof confusion remains.  Indeed it is not unlikely that the presence of such an otherwise unknown mark would reinforce the confusionof the average customer, who might be led to believe that Gucci is introducing a second or extension line named âCOGUâ. </p>    <p><a name="p98" class="para" id="p98">98.</a>  As mentioned above, the sign âCOSIMO GUCCIâ was used by the defendants in the bus-stop advertisements.  It was also used inrelation to handbags and eyewear.  The sign âdesigned by COSIMO GUCCIâ has been used on luggage shown on D2âs Website, andalso on advertisements in relation to eyewear and spectacles.  The composite mark âCOGU by COSIMO GUCCIâ has been used on D2âsWebsite in relation to timepieces, bags and luggage.  âCOGU designed by COSIMO GUCCIâ has appeared in the defendantsâ advertisementson eyewear, in the Style Guide, on the print card accompanying the eyewear products, and also the guarantee card of such products. These are products which are the same as the goods in respect of which the plaintiff has registered the word marks âGUCCIâ.</p>    <p><a name="p99" class="para" id="p99"> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">99.</a>  For completenessâ</a> sake, I would mention that Mr Shipp also relies on the own name defence under section 19(3) of TMO, although he has not pursued thesame at the hearing with much vigor.  The defence, if established, could only avail the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, and not the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.  Section 19(3) provides that a registered trade mark is not infringed by the use by a person of his own name providedthat the use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.  What constitutes âhonest practicesâhas recently been explained by the ECJ in the case of <i>Gillette Co. v. LA-Laboratories OY</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2005%5d%20FSR%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] F.S.R. 37.</a>  According to the ECJ, the condition of honest practices constitutes in substance the expression of a duty to act fairly in relationto the legitimate interests of the trade mark owner (at [41] and [49]).  âUse of a trade mark will not be in accordance with honestpractices in industrial and commercial matters if, for example, it is done in such a manner as to give the impression that thereis a commercial connection between the third party and the trade mark owner, or it affects the value of the trade mark by takingunfair advantage of its distinctive character or reputeâ (at [49], see also the <i>Julius Samaan</i> case at [87] to [88]). </p>    <p><a name="p100" class="para" id="p100">100.</a>  As pointed out above, in my judgment the use of the word signs complained of would indeed give the impression that there is a commercialconnection between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the plaintiff.  There is also, in my view, a serious question to be tried that the use of the word signs by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is a use which takes unfair advantage of the distinctive character or repute of the Gucci mark and affects the value ofit.  In this connection, in considering the question of unfairness, I take into account the fact that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has no reputation as a designer in Hong Kong and there is no apparent commercial reason why he would want to use the wordsâdesigned by COSIMO GUCCIâ to describe his goods if the intention was not to take unfair advantage of the distinctive characteror repute of the Gucci mark.  There is no evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant actually designed any of the goods involved in the present case.  The only evidence put before me by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in this regard only shows that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had been involved in giving approval to the designs made by the sub-licensees. </p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  I would add this.  A defendant who has used his own name which is confusingly similar to the plaintiffâs registered trade markcannot escape liability for infringement by simply pointing to some steps that he might have taken to avoid confusion by the public,if the steps that are taken are either unlikely to be successful or are otherwise insufficient to prevent confusion.  He has a dutyto eliminate such confusion by taking effective steps which make it perfectly clear to the public that there is no connection betweenhim and the proprietor of the mark (see, <i>Boswell-Wilkie Circus v. Brian Boswell Circus</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%20FSR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] F.S.R. 479).</a>  In the present case, it might be said that the defendants have taken some steps to explain to the public that the Gucci family isno longer associated with the plaintiff, and that the COGU brand is not a brand related to Gucci.  For example, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant might point to his speech made at the press conference, or the article in D2âs Website that explained the history ofGucci family and the acquisition of Gucci by outsiders.  References may also be made to the contents of the guarantee card, or eventhe press release mentioned above.  These materials, if they had been read carefully, might have gone some way to explaining to thereader that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and his family are no longer associated with the plaintiff and that the COGU brand marketed by the defendants is not connectedwith Gucci.  There is however no evidence to show that the contents of these materials are made available to the general public,or are widely known to them and to the average consumer, or that they have been, or would have been, successful in eliminating theconfusion that is likely to be caused by the confusingly similar signs used by the defendants. </p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  In these circumstances, I hold that, in relation to the word signs mentioned above, there is a serious issue to be tried for infringementunder section 18(3). </p>    <p class="heading">D1âs horse-bit Mark and D1âs horse-bit Pattern Mark</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  The horse-bit mark is one of the leading insignia of the plaintiff and has been used by the plaintiff for many years and on a varietyof products.  I note, for example, that in a book written by Sara Gay Forden, â<i>The House of Gucci</i>â, the horse-bit mark was featured on the book cover.  As can be seen from the Annexed Tables, the horse-bit marks registered bythe plaintiff in Hong Kong are of different shapes and designs, but for marks of this type, it is the idea of the marks, namely theconcept of a horse-bit that is of particular importance.  An average customer may not have a perfect memory of the precise shapeof the horse-bit marks used by the plaintiff, but he would remember the horse-bit concept that characterises the marks and whichdistinguishes the Gucci products. </p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  I have looked at D1âs horse-bit mark and D1âs horse-bit Pattern Mark carefully, and note how they were used on the luggagesand bags as shown on D2âs Website.  While there may be some visual differences between them and the plaintiffâs devices (sufficientto make them not identical), the conceptual similarity between the marks is great, and when the horse-bits are used as a patternmark, the visual similarity becomes much more striking (see, p. 3 of the Annexed Table).  In my view, it is likely that an averagecustomer may be misled by the horse-bit marks used by the defendants into thinking that the goods on which the marks are appliedoriginate from the plaintiff.  I also reject the suggestion of Mr Shipp that the horse-bit marks were not used by the defendantsas trade marks.  They clearly were. </p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  In his affidavit evidence, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant claimed that the horse-bit patterns used on the luggage products as shown on D2âs Website were not authorised by him,and that the luggage products bearing the horse-bit pattern were never sold or intended to be sold in Hong Kong.  I have found thisallegation unconvincing.  I note that the D1âs horse-bit Pattern Mark was in fact one of the standard pattern marks stipulatedin the Style Guide.  According to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the Style Guide was prepared by it based on the instructions of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  It is difficult to see how the Style Guide could have come to be prepared without the instructions, approval and closeinvolvement of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, as the Style Guide is in effect a manual stipulating the detailed specifications of the marks and signs of the COGU products. If the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant never intended to use the horse-bit patterns on goods sold in Hong Kong, it is difficult to see why he would include theD1âs horse-bit Pattern Mark in the Style Guide.  By including the same in the Style Guide, the horse-bit pattern device was certainlynot intended to be used merely decoratively on the products.  </p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  The goods on which the defendants used the horse-bit marks are the same as those covered by the plaintiffâs registrations.  Withregard to these horse-bit marks, I hold that there is a serious question to be tried on infringement under section 18(3). </p>    <p class="heading">D1âs Interlocking CG Mark</p>    <p><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a>  As can be seen from the Annexed Table, that plaintiff has registered a number of interlocking marks that are constituted by twoletter G interlocking with each other in various manner. </p>    <p><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a>  What however is clear to me is that the D1âs Interlocking CG Mark is completely different from the plaintiffâs interlockingmarks both visually in form and shape and conceptually in the way in which the interlocking is constituted.  D1âs InterlockingCG Mark consists of two letters C and G, interlocked in a special way and in a slanting manner which is wholly different from theplaintiffâs interlocking marks.  Even allowing for imperfect memory and the fact that the average customer would not be comparingthe marks side by side âin the arid atmosphere of a court in which everything is gone over <i>ad nauseum</i>â (borrowing the words of Sir Nicholas Browne Wilkinson VC in the <i>Paolo Gucci</i> case), I still do not think that there is any possibility that a reasonably observant and circumspect customer could be confusedby the interlocking mark used by the defendants to think that goods bearing such a mark comes from Gucci. </p>    <p><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a>  It might be said that there is a conceptual similarity between the marks as both involve the interlocking of two English alphabets. I think there is a danger in defining the concept behind a mark so broadly.  Merely because the plaintiffâs registered marks employ2 interlocking letters does not mean that it has a monopoly over the concept of 2 interlocking letters.  The concept of interlockingletters is too broad for monopoly of this type.  Much, I think, would depend on how the interlocking is done in the plaintiffâsmarks and it is the overall impression that an average customer would have that is determinative.  In this case, I do not think thatthe impression of the interlocking letters constituting the mark used by the defendants in any way resembles the impression thatan average customer has over the plaintiffâs interlocking marks.  They are very different in shape, form and in the way the lettersinterlock.  There is no likelihood of confusion. </p>    <p><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a>  I hold that there is no serious question to be tried on this interlocking mark. </p>    <p class="heading">D1âs 3 stripes Mark</p>    <p><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a>  The plaintiffâs three stripes mark is constituted by a stripe of red between 2 stripes of green.  As has been pointed out by MsTam, there is no evidence of any other party having registered any three stripes marks in Hong Kong.  Evidence has been put beforeme showing the three stripes webbing marks having been used by the plaintiff on products of many different kinds.  On the evidence,I am satisfied that the 3 stripes marks are distinctive of the plaintiffâs goods. </p>    <p><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a>  D1âs 3 stripes Mark employs different colours (red-white-green) but is nonetheless visually similar and conceptually identicalto the plaintiffâs registered mark. Both webbing marks are constituted by 3 stripes of contrasting colours with no space in between. Two of the colours (i.e. red and green) used in D1âs 3 stripes Mark are also used in the plaintiffâs registered mark. An averagecustomer with an imperfect memory of colour combinations (as many of us are) would have difficulty distinguishing the webbing markused by the defendants from that used by the plaintiff unless the two are put side by side for comparison. </p>    <p><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a>  The defendants have put in evidence to show that there are products in the market which employ webbing devices of similar designand argue that there is no exclusivity in the plaintiffâs use of its three stripes mark.  I do not find this an attractive argument. Firstly, the plaintiff does not need to prove exclusive use for the purpose of showing a serious issue to be tried on trade markinfringementâregistration gives the owner the right to exclusive use.  Secondly, I find the quality of the evidence put forwardby the defendants in this regard to be poor.  As Ms Tam aptly puts it, the evidence relied on consists of âpages of photographsof unknown sources and taken from unknown places by unknown peopleâ.  It is also not clear whether the webbings which appear onthe other goods have any trade mark significance.  Webbings used as mere decorations and not as marks of origin are, of course, verydifferent.  Only the latter use can give rise to claims of infringement. </p>    <p><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a>  What has caused me to pause is the fact that on the evidence the defendants have only used the D1âs 3 stripes Mark on pet productsâbagsand dogs carriers etc.  From the pictures that I have seen, some of the bags and dogs carriers appear to be made of leather, butit is not entirely clear.  The plaintiff has registered its three stripes mark under Classes 18 (leather goods, trunks, travellingbags, handbags, and shoulder bags) and 25 (clothing).  Pet products are not specifically mentioned in the specification of goodsfor these classes.  I have hesitated whether the goods in relation to which the defendants used the D1âs 3 stripes Mark are goodsidentical or similar to the goods in relation to which the plaintiffâs mark is registered. </p>    <p><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a>  In the end I accept Ms Tamâs submission that the goods specified under Class 18 includes trunks and bags.  I am persuaded by hersubmission that âwhether the bags [or trunks, if I may add] are used for carrying pets, tennis racquets, golf clubs or computers,they do not cease to be bags [or trunks] to be used by fashion conscious people who care how they look when toting the bag [or carryingthe trunk]â.  I agree with her that looking at the matter objectively, the bags or trunks are of the type âmade to look goodon the type of people who would buy designer bags for carrying things in their hands so that they would look stylish and fashionableâ. In my view, it is certainly very arguable that these bags or carriers used to carry pets are bags or trunks within the meaning ofthe specifications under Class 18, or are similar goods. </p>    <p><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a>  I hold that for this mark as well, there is a serious issue to be tried under section 18(3). </p>    <p class="heading">D1âs CG Monogram-1 and D1âs CG Monogram-2</p>    <p><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a>  I am satisfied on the evidence that the pattern marks of the plaintiff, shown on p. 7 of the Annexed Table, are distinctive of theplaintiffâs products.  The evidence shows that the monograms are very commonly used in the plaintiffâs products, including inparticular sunglasses, spectacles and eyewear. </p>    <p><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a>  In my judgment, there clearly is a serious issue to be tried for infringement based on the use of the monograms by the defendants. The monograms have been used on the spectacle frames (as used on the advertisements and also on the actual goods in the trap orders). They are included in the Style Guide.  They are also used in the print card accompanying the spectacles, and also in the interiorof the packaging and cases in relation to spectacles and sunglasses (I have looked at the real exhibits myself). </p>    <p><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a>  In the Style Guide, the pattern mark takes the form of D1âs CG Monogram-2.  The actual sample eyewear sold by the defendants,however, bears a monogram which omits the little âoâ and âuâ in D1âs CG Monogram-2 and takes the form of D1âs CG Monogram-1. For the latter, the pattern is constituted by the use of the letters C and G facing each other, with the letter G upside down. The plaintiffâs monograms are constituted by the use of two letter G facing each other, with one of the letter G also upside down. If the monograms are magnified and compared side by side, it could be seen that the letters used in the plaintiffâs monogram aremore rounded, while the letters used in the defendantâs monogram are more square-shaped.  But the average customer would not lookat these monograms magnified many times and make comparisons side by side.  When looked at in their natural scale on the actual products,the visual differences are small and the similarities are striking.  In my view, there is clearly a serious issue to be tried onthe likelihood of confusion caused by the defendantâs use of D1âs CG Monogram-1 and D1âs CG Monogram-2.  </p>    <p class="heading">D1âs G Mark</p>    <p><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a>  On the evidence, the plaintiffâs âG Marksâ (as shown on p. 8 of the Annexed Table), which are registered in Hong Kong underClass 18 and 25, have been used extensively on its bag products and leather goods but not any pet products.  I am satisfied on theevidence that the plaintiffâs G Marks are distinctive of the plaintiffâs products on which the same are used.  </p>    <p><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a>  On the other hand, the evidence shows that the defendants have only used the D1âs G Mark on pet products such as dog carriersand pet bags.  I have mentioned above that I have had some hesitation on whether the goods are identical or similar to the goodsspecified under Class 18 and 25 for which the plaintiffâs marks are registered. </p>    <p><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a>  For reasons mentioned above in relation to the three stripes marks, I have come to the view that it is arguable that the goods areidentical or similar goods. </p>    <p><a name="p123" class="para" id="p123">123.</a>  D1âs G Mark clearly bears a conceptual similarity to that of the plaintiffâs marks, in that both are based on the alphabet G. The defendantsâ mark is visually different from the plaintiffâs mark when examined side by side, but such visual differencesmay not be noted by the average customer who does not have an opportunity of conducting such a close comparison. </p>    <p><a name="p124" class="para" id="p124">124.</a>  It is not clear why the defendants would want to use a mark based on the letter G (instead of say, the letter C).  Unlike the caseof Gucci, the letter G has no obvious relation to COGU.  No explanation has been given by the defendants in their evidence as towhy they sought to use a âGâ mark on COGU products.  In the absence of an explanation, the court may legitimately draw the inferencethat D1âs G Mark was deliberately adopted by the defendants with a view to causing confusion as to association with Gucci, particularlywhen the same is used with other marks or signs that are confusing in themselves. </p>    <p><a name="p125" class="para" id="p125">125.</a>  As the pictures on D2âs Website shows, D1âs G Mark is used in conjunction with the three stripes webbing device.  I have alreadyheld that there is a serious question to be tried that D1âs 3 stripes Mark is likely to confuse.  When D1âs G Mark is used inconjunction with D1âs 3 stripes Mark, it only adds to the likelihood of confusion. </p>    <p><a name="p126" class="para" id="p126">126.</a>  I therefore hold that, in respect of D1âs G Mark, there is a serious issue to be tried for infringement under section 18(3). </p>    <p class="heading">PASSING OFF</p>    <p class="heading">Principles to be applied</p>    <p><a name="p127" class="para" id="p127">127.</a>  The principles are well known.  They are well summarised by Lord Oliver in the case of <i>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20RPC%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] R.P.C. 341</a> at 406, as follows :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">âThe law of passing off can be summarised in one short general proposition â no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number.  First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he suppliesin the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying âget-upâ (whether it consists simply of a brand nameor a trade description, or the individual features of labeling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offeredto the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiffâs goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likelyto lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff.  Whether the publicis aware of the plaintiffâs identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial, so long as they areidentified with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff.  For example, if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particularbrand name in purchasing goods of a particular description, it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness ofthe identity of the proprietor of the brand name.  Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers, or, in a <i>quia timet</i> action that he is likely to suffer, damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendantâs misrepresentation thatthe source of the defendantâs goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p128" class="para" id="p128">128.</a>  To establish the tort of passing off, it is not necessary to prove an actual intent to deceive.  However, if intent to deceive isproved, it is a short step to proving that the intent has been successful.  The court will not say that the defendant will not succeedin deceiving when he is straining every nerve to do so:  see, <i>Slazenger v. Feltham</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1889%5d%206%20RPC%20531" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1889] 6 R.P.C 531</a> at 538. </p>    <p><a name="p129" class="para" id="p129">129.</a>  While a true statement of pedigree, or of past business connection, is not a misrepresentation; equivocal or excessively conspicuoususe of the claimantâs name or indicia may be held to be calculated to deceive.  Such excessive use of the claimantâs name orindicia may amount to a deceptive suggestion that a connection continues to exist between the claimantâs goods or business andthose of the defendant, and may be restrained by the court (see, <i>Wadlow on the law of Passing Off</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> edition, 5-34, <i>Henderson v. Monroe</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%207%20SC%20636" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] 7 SC 636</a>, and <i>Asprey &amp; Garrard v.

I havementioned above the sales volume of the plaintiff, the advertising and PR expenses spent by the plaintiff in promoting and advertisingits products, the scale of operations of the plaintiff both worldwide and in Hong Kong, the listings of independent branding consultancies,survey findings of AC Neilson and the Neilson Company, and also other materials that I have read which show quite clearly that theGucci name is exceptionally well known, and the marks (including in particular the plaintiffâs Trade Marks ) used by the plaintiffon its range of products are distinctive of the goods as originating  from the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p131" class="para" id="p131">131.</a>  Mr Shipp has complained that there is no breakdown of the sales figures in respect of the use of each mark.  That is so, but I donot consider it realistic for the plaintiff to provide evidence of such breakdown.  The products sold by the plaintiff often carry2 or more marks and it is not realistic to expect breakdown sales figures specific to each mark.  In any event, I have no doubt thatquite apart from the sales figures, the evidence before me establishes, at the very least, a serious issue to be tried that the plaintiffhas a strong reputation and/or goodwill in respect of the name âGucciâ and the plaintiffâs Trade Marks, which are distinctiveof the plaintiffâs goods. </p>    <p><a name="p132" class="para" id="p132">132.</a>  Apart from the âGucciâ name and the plaintiffâs Trade Marks  (which are registered), the plaintiff has also relied on itsâbamboo designâ for the purpose of passing off.  The âbamboo designâ is not a registered mark but it appears from the evidencethat for many decades the plaintiff has been using the bamboo material on its productsâsome examples that I have seen includingwatch bangles, shoe buckles, handbag straps and handles, and even bamboo patterns on bags.  What is however clear to me is that itis not possible to say that there is a particular bamboo âget-upâ or design to which reputation or goodwill is attached.  Whilebamboo materials are commonly used in the plaintiffâs products, there is no particular form of design, device, mark or get-up thatthe plaintiff can point to other than the material used which is bamboo.  In these circumstances, I am quite unable to find thatthere is a serious question to be tried for a passing off claim based on the so-called âbamboo designâ.  I think the term âbamboodesignâ can only be used loosely to refer to anything that is made of bamboo and used in the plaintiffâs products.  That obviouslyis not sufficient to give the plaintiff a monopoly over the use of the bamboo material and Ms Tam has not contended for such a monopoly. Indeed in one of her written submissions filed after the oral hearing, she indicates that the plaintiff âis content not to pursuean interlocutory injunction to cover this element [referring to the âbamboo designâ]â.  I consider that this concession iswise, and I will say no more on the bamboo design. </p>    <p class="heading">Misrepresentation</p>    <p><a name="p133" class="para" id="p133">133.</a>  In the light of my conclusion above (in relation to trade mark infringement) on the question of likelihood of confusion caused bysome (but not all) of the alleged Infringing Marks used by the defendant, I do not need to deal with this question again <i>in extenso</i> in relation to passing off.  For those signs or marks the use of which would give rise a likelihood of confusion (more precisely,give rise to a serious question to be tried of such likelihood of confusion), my conclusion applies equally to the passing off claim. For easy reference, I shall refer to those signs or marks (i.e. those I have held above as likely to result in confusion) as âtheoffending marksâ. </p>    <p><a name="p134" class="para" id="p134">134.</a>  There are other matters which may add to the likelihood of confusion and relevant to the claim for passing offâe.g. the way inwhich the press conference was conducted (I have, for example, referred to the backdrop of the stage which featured the words âCosimoGucciâ prominently), the extensive references to the Gucci family tree in the ways I described above, the way the covering mailwas presented to the press when they were invited to the press conference etc.  Ms Tam submits that these matters show that the defendantshave made excessive references to the Gucciâs name and the plaintiffâs marks and indicia, which were calculated to deceive. I see the force of her submissions.  However, there is no need for me to deal with these matters in detail (and prolong an alreadylengthy decision), as I am satisfied, even without these additional matters, that there is a serious question to be tried for passingoff arising from the use of the offending marks. </p>    <p><a name="p135" class="para" id="p135">135.</a>  I would also mention that the plaintiff has put before me evidence of actual confusion.  There is evidence of some bloggers expressingconfusion (on whether COGU was another line of Gucci) in an internet discussion forum.  I have not put much weight on such evidence. The quality of the evidence is less than cogentâit is not known, for example, who these bloggers were other than their usernames,nor is it known what exactly were the circumstances which led to the alleged confusion of the bloggers.  The defendants have drawnmy attention to another blogger who was apparently not confusedâagain I place little weight on that.  Neither do I find the evidenceconcerning the alleged confusion by one Christy Ng, the senior editor of Hong Kong Tatler, helpful in proving actual confusion. Of all the journalists who had received the mail invitation to the press conference, she was apparently the only one who was confused. Why that is so is not clear to me. </p>    <p><a name="p136" class="para" id="p136">136.</a>  It is well-settled that evidence of actual confusion is not a precondition of a finding of misrepresentation.  If the court is otherwisesatisfied of the probability of deception, actual deception need not be proved: see, <i>Kerlyâs Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</i> (14<sup>th</sup> ed.), 15-204, <i>Iron-Ox v. Co-operative Wholesale Society</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1907%5d%2024%20RPC%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1907] 24 R.P.C. 425</a> at 430, <i>Delavelle v.

In the present case, even without the evidence of actual confusion, I am satisfied that there is a likelihood of confusionin respect of the use of the offending marks. </p>    <p><a name="p137" class="para" id="p137">137.</a>  It is also not necessary, for the reasons above, for me to decide whether there is actual intent to deceive (more precisely, whetherthere is a serious issue to be tried of such intent).  Proof of such intent is not necessary for passing off.  My conclusion on thelikelihood of confusion makes it unnecessary for me to deal with that matter. </p>    <p class="heading">Own name defence in passing off</p>    <p><a name="p138" class="para" id="p138">138.</a>  I have already dealt with the own name defence in the context of trade mark infringement.  As regards the availability of the defencein passing off, I need only refer to what Romer J. said in the case of <i>Joseph Rodgers &amp; Sons Ltd v. W.N.

The second proposition is, thatno man is entitled so to describe or mark his goods as to represent that the goods are the goods of another.  To the first propositionthere is, I myself think, an exception: a man, in my opinion, is entitled to carry on his business in his own name so long as hedoes not do anything more than that to cause confusion with the business of another, and so long as he does it honestly.  It is anexception to the rule which has of necessity been established.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">To the second rule, to which I have referred, I think there is no exception at all; that is, that a man is not entitled so to describehis goods as to lend to the belief that they are the goods of somebody else.

It is perfectly legitimate for a man in the cutlery business to carry on business under his own name whatever that namemay be, but I can see no necessity for his marking his cutlery with a name (although it be his own name) which may have the effectof passing off those goods as the goods of the plaintiffs.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p139" class="para" id="p139">139.</a>  This part of Romer J.âs judgment was approved by the House of Lords in <i>Parker-Knoll Ltd v.

It is also settled that there is only a very limited own name defence â¦  Thus the English law of passing off aboundswith cases where people have been prevented from using their own names.  This particularly happens when a scion of some well-knownfamily business has sought to cash in on his name at the expense of that businessâ, citing the <i>Paolo Gucci</i> case, the <i>Asprey</i> case and <i>Alfred Dunhill Ltd v.

I also hold that there is a serious question to be tried for passing off arising from the defendantâs useof the Gucci name.

The damage caused by trade mark infringement consists in the erosion of the exclusivity and distinctiveness ofthe marks, which I am sure is very valuable to the plaintiff but damages for such erosion is difficult to assess.  Damage to goodwillis the most important loss suffered by a victim of passing off and it is rare that damages would be an adequate remedy for such damage,which is difficult to quantify (see <i>Marlborough Motors v. Marlborough Motor Co.</i>, unreported, 19 May 1986, Falconer J and <i>Sodastream Ltd v. Thorn Cascade Co.

Again, damages for such loss is notoriouslydifficult to quantify, particularly when goods are sold in retail outlets, and it is hard to prove what amount of the loss of customor drop in sales is caused by the defendantsâ acts of infringement or passing off. </p>    <p><a name="p144" class="para" id="p144">144.</a>  In these circumstances, I have no hesitation in concluding that damages will not be an adequate remedy to the plaintiff if no injunctionis granted and it succeeds at trial. </p>    <p class="heading">BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE</p>    <p><a name="p145" class="para" id="p145">145.</a>  It seems to me that the balance of convenience is strongly in favour of the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p146" class="para" id="p146">146.</a>  As pointed out above, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs mode of doing business in Hong Kong is not to sell goods directly, but to appoint a licensee (the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant) who in turn would appoint sub-licensees to manufacture and market products under the brand name âCOGUâ and using themarks and signs authorised by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  There is no evidence at all on how an injunction may affect the business of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has not put in any evidence on how, for example, his collection of royalty income from his licensee or sub-licensees wouldbe affected by an injunction.  All I have in terms of evidence from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in this regard is a bare allegation in his affidavit that he would be âdeprived of an incalculable amount of royaltyincome from the Hong Kong licenseesâ.  Neither has the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant submitted any evidence on how his business may be affected by an injunction. </p>    <p><a name="p147" class="para" id="p147">147.</a>  I would have thought that any loss that may be suffered by the defendants if an injunction is granted would be small compared withthe loss that may be suffered by the plaintiff if an injunction is refused.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has only come to the Hong Kong market recently.  The harm that may be suffered by the defendants in holding off marketingof their products in a manner which may offend the injunction is likely to be limited.  In any event, the defendants would be freeto continue to use the âCOGUâ mark and D1âs Interlocking CG Mark, and to continue to license them, without offending the termsof the injunction.  As regards the horse-bit mark, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has filed evidence to the effect that he had never authorised the use of the horse-bit mark, and that the luggage productsbearing the horse-bit mark appearing on D2âs Website were not sold or intended to be sold in Hong Kong. </p>    <p><a name="p148" class="para" id="p148">148.</a>  I also take into account the fact that the plaintiff is a very substantial company (as evidenced by its very substantial sales turnoverand the estimated value of its brand name alone is enormous), and there is little risk of its not being able to meet any award ofdamages that may be made against it.  On the other hand there is no evidence of the defendantsâ financial position and their abilityto honor a substantial award of damages.</p>    <p><a name="p149" class="para" id="p149">149.</a>  In all the circumstances of the case, I am of the view that the balance of convenience weighs heavily in favour of the plaintiff.</p>    <p class="heading">ORDER TO BE MADE</p>    <p><a name="p150" class="para" id="p150">150.</a>  I am therefore minded to grant an interlocutory injunction.  Ms Tam and Mr Shipp have both indicated that they would like to makefurther submissions on the terms of the order in the event that I am minded to grant an injunction.  Accordingly, I would give libertyto the parties to file written submissions on the terms of the injunction order.  They may also make submissions on costs, if theyso wish.  The further submissions should be made within 14 days from today. </p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">(Horace Wong, SC)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="33%" style="text-align:center">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>Ms Winnie Tam SC, instructed by Messrs Deacons, for the Plaintiff</p>        <p>Mr Colin Shipp, instructed by Messrs Anthony Evans &amp; Co., for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants</p>        <p> </p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p style="text-align:center"><b><u><a href="http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/doc/judg/html/vetted/other/en/2008/HCA001582_2008_files/HCA1582_2008.pdf">The Annexed Table</a></u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:center" class="quote"> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2009/642.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
