In so far as the dismissal of the summons dated 20 September 2006is concerned, that is clearly a decision on an interlocutory application.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  As to the decision on an application to strike out the Statement of Claim and dismiss the action, it is also not a final judgmentfor the purpose of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(a)</a> of the Ordinance: see <i>B+B Construction Ltd v.

Don Xia</i> (2004) 7HKCFAR 260.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  It is evident from the Statement of Claim filed by the plaintiff as summarised in paragraph 3 of this Courtâs Judgment handeddown on 19 March 2008 that the plaintiffâs claim is for unliquidated damages. The plaintiff had also stated in her written submissionfor this application that the losses claimed by her are estimates (at paragraph 28) and as such, are unliquidated.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Accordingly, the present application does not come within <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(a).</a>  The intended appeal to the Court of Final Appeal does not lie as of right.</p>    <p class="heading"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22(1)(b)</a> of the Ordinance</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  We turn to consider the discretion under <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(b)</a> of the Ordinance. In order for leave to be granted under the sub-section, an applicant has to show that the intended appeal involvesa question which, by reason of its great general and public importance, or otherwise, ought to be submitted to the Court of FinalAppeal for decision.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In the present application, the plaintiff had not set out the grounds of her intended appeal in the Notice of Motion. She had alsonot formulated any question for determination by the Court of Final Appeal. In any case, having considered her submissions and thematerials before the court, we cannot see any question of great general and public importance in her claim or intended appeal.  Theargument of âvicarious liability in tort of conjugal invasionâ, on which the plaintiff relies heavily, is plainly unsustainablein law.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  There is also nothing in the plaintiffâs claim or intended appeal for us to grant leave on âthe otherwiseâ limb of <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(1)(b).</a></p>    <p class="heading"><a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 31</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">32</a> of the Ordinance</p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The plaintiff also refers to <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 31</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">32</a> of the Ordinance. The two sections deal with appeals and leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal in criminal cases.  High CourtAction No. 1819 of 2006, on which the intended appeal is based, is a civil claim. She submitted that she wished to convert her claiminto a criminal matter. But that is not possible. There is no proper basis for us to consider <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 31</a> and <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">32</a> of the Ordinance.  </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  For the above reasons, the plaintiffâs application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal has to be dismissed.</p>    <p class="heading">Costs</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The normal rule is for costs to follow event. The plaintiff argues that the rule should not be followed and that she should notbe made liable for the costs of this application. She says she is a victim and it is unfair to make her bear the costs. She asksthat the costs be met by the public fund because this is a criminal matter.  We cannot agree there are good reasons for departingfrom the normal rule.  The 1<sup>st</sup> defendantâs costs of this application should be paid by the plaintiff. </p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Having regard to the nature of this application and the documents involved, it would be appropriate to make a gross sum costs orderunder Order 62 <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/484/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 9(4)(b)</a> of Rules of the High Court rather than incurring additional time and costs in having the costs taxed.  We are of the view that, ona party-and-party basis, $30,000 would be an appropriate amount. </p>    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Accordingly, we dismiss the plaintiffâs application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal. We further order that theplaintiff pays the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant the costs of the application assessed in the amount of $30,000.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Robert Tang)<br />            Vice President</td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Carlye Chu)<br />            Judge of Court of First Instance</td>        </tr>    </table>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p> </p>        <p>The plaintiff, unrepresented, appeared in person.</p>        <p>Mr Anthony Chan instructed by Messrs JSM for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <p> </p>  <!--sino noindex-->  <!--make_database footer start-->  <p class="make-database"></p>  <hr class="make-database">  <small class="make-database">    <p class="make-database">    <b class="make-database">HKLII:    </b>    <a href="/hklii/copyright.html" class="make-database">Copyright Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/disclaimers.html" class="make-database">Disclaimers</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/privacy.html" class="make-database">Privacy Policy</a>    <b class="make-database">|</b>    <a href="/hklii/feedback.html" class="make-database">Feedback</a><br>    URL: <i class="make-database">http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2008/224.html</i><br></p>  </small></body></html>
