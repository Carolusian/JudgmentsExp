In 1979 he obtained a lease of the premises from the HousingAuthority and opened the Wah Hing Restaurant there. Later he got a firm to operate the restaurant for him under a management agreement.The arrangement was not a success and he closed down the restaurant about 2 years later and got rid of the staff with a view, hesays, to replacing them and starting again. He adds that word got around and a Mr. Ng Chi Quan ("Mr. Ng") telephoned him. Mr. Ngwas a very wealthy and successful restaurateur, so he went to see him. Mr. Ng, he says, suggested that a management company handlethe business and that the plaintiff and his friends could profit from shares in the company. They arrived at a tentative agreementto form a management firm. After a few days they had a second meeting and then a third at which Mr. Ng introduced him to Cheung ToSang ("Mr. Cheung") as a businessman and restauranteur and full of drive.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="pseudopara" id="p3">3.</a> Mr. Cheung went to inspect the Wah Hing Restaurant along with Mr. Ng and a Madam Ho, the plaintiff's sister-in-law, who was alsoa former employee of Mr. Ng's. Mr. Cheung thought the premises had potential and Mr. Ng that the remaining 5 year lease of the premisesof which the plaintiff was assured would suffice to make a profit or a loss. There were further discussions embracing the sharesin a proposed management company to be formed to operate the restaurant. The plaintiff adds that since he had spent some $1.6 milliondecorating and furnishing the restaurant, it was agreed that he should be paid for the use of the furniture, fittings and installationsfor the 5 years that remained of his lease, an amount of $550,000 that would be a non-refundable deposit. Ultimately, he says itwas decided to go a solicitor, Mr. Edmund Chow to draw up the agreement. The plaintiff, Mr. Cheung, Madam Ho and Mr. Ng's son, NgWing Po who represented the latter went. The plaintiff says Mr. Chow listened to them and explained how he proposed to provide whatwas required and had the agreement drawn up and typed. While they were waiting he says, Mr. Cheung became concerned that he, theplaintiff, might not procure the renewal of the lease and that the matter was resolved by Mr. Chow drawing up a guarantee for thepurpose. Then another member of Mr. Chow's staff explained the agreement and the guarantee and took them to another solicitor inMr. Chow's firm before whom they signed the agreement. The plaintiff unequivocally maintained throughout that the agreement was amanagement agreement. The $550,000 was recompense for depreciation of the furniture, fittings and installations over the 5-year periodand he would in addition snare in the profits of the management company via his 1/6th share in the company for which he paid $200,000.The other shares went 1 each to Mr. Cheung, to a brother of his, Cheung Chi Sang, to Madam He and the remaining 2 to Mr. Ng. It isnot in dispute that the plaintiff was to remain the Housing Authority lessee since transfer or parting with possession was prohibitedby the lease, and that likewise he was to continue to hold the liquor licence.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="pseudopara" id="p4">4.</a> Following the signing of the management agreement and guarantee, the restaurant was renamed the Ho Ho Restaurant, extensively refurbishedand has since been operated by the defendant management company. The plaintiff was named as the managing director and appointed tobe one of the three managers. He says that notwithstanding his impressive designation, he was but a minor employee and that it waseffectively Mr. Cheung who was in command. He received a salary of $12,000. However, he says, he became in time increasingly concernedabout breaches of the lease and of statutory regulations which could endanger the renewal of the lease and expose him as licenceeto prosecution. His complaints were ignored. His requests that the management agreement (which he claims expired in 1989) be replacedin terms more appropriate, were fobbed off by Mr. Cheung. So he caused his solicitor to demand vacant possession. The result washis dismissal as managing director and manager and loss of the salary he was paid.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="pseudopara" id="p5">5.</a> His claim so far as now pursued is first, for vacant possession of the premises, and second for an injunction restraining the defendantand its servants and agents from entering the premises.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="pseudopara" id="p6">6.</a> The defendant's defence in substance is that what was negotiated and agreed between the plaintiff and Mr. Ng and more particularlyMr. Cheung was the takeover i.e. the outright sale of the restaurant. It contends that in the presence of Mr. Edmund Chow the solicitor,a verbal agreement was reached between the plaintiff and the takeover parties whereby the latter would pay $550,000 for the purchaseof the restaurant, furniture, equipment and fittings and, inter alia, the plaintiff would hold the tenancy of the premises for thebenefit of the managing company, and renew the tenancy for another 3 years from 15th January 1984 until 15th January 1987 and thereafteras long as the landlord was prepared to do so. It avers that the written agreement did not "set out fully the true nature of theagreement". It asks for the agreement to be rectified:</p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(1)</td>            <td width="94%">                to delete all the provisions entitling the plaintiff to terminate the agreement for whatever reason or under anycircumstance;                <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(2)</td>            <td width="94%">                to delete any provision for determination of the agreement at any fixed time and to substitute therefor a provisionthat it should continue to be enforced for as long as the Housing Authority is willing to renew the tenancy; and               <p> </p>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td width="6%" valign="top">(3)</td>            <td width="94%">to expressly provide in the written agreement that from the time of execution the plaintiff constituted himself trustee for the defendantin respect of any interest he had in the tenancy and from then on held such interest for the defendant's benefit and was obligedto renew the same or otherwise act in accordance with and pursuant to the defendant's directions.</td>        </tr>    </table>    <p>I shall return to the other defences which it is not necessary to adumbrate at this point.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="pseudopara" id="p7">7.</a> Mr. Ng died in 1987 or 1988, and the evidence for the defendant has been provided almost entirely by Mr. Cheung. Mr. Cheung is, ashe himself says, more or less illiterate. He is now 48 years of age and entered the restaurant trade at the age of 14 as an on-the-jobworker. He went to work for Mr. Ng when he was 22 years old and in time became a "master roasted meat cook'', and very experiencedgenerally in the restaurant trade. In time he began to go into joint ventures with Mr. Ng and even started to own restaurants ofhis own. He now has an interest in no less than 13 restaurants, not to mention other companies and businesses. His success is a measureof his ability which was also apparent from his forceful personality. He readily asserted himself when in the witness box.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="pseudopara" id="p8">8.</a> Mr. Cheung testified that he was brought into the matter by Mr. Ng, and that he inspected the premises and that there were discussionsbetween him and Mr. Ng on the one side and the plaintiff on the other. It was agreed, he says, that the restaurant would be renamedthe Ho Ho Restaurant and $1.4 million would be injected. Of this $550,000 ass to be the premium to the plaintiff for the transferof all the fittings and the furniture, his licence and tenancy lease all of them. $150,000 was to be the Housing Authority deposit,and the balance was for renovation. A limited company was to be formed to take over the entire business including the licences. ThenMr. Ng had 2 solicitors look at the lease and both advised that it did not permit a transfer and that the scheme was not workable.Eventually Madam Ho suggested Mr. Edmund Chow. Mr. Cheung went along with Madam Ho and the plaintiff; Ng Wing Po came later. Mr.Cheung says that in Mr. Chow' s office the plaintiff was told his business was going to be bought out. However, the lease stipulatedthat the tenancy must be a proprietorship and so he asked Mr. Chow to tackle the matter. The solution Mr. Chow worked out was toprepare an agreement that the plaintiff would only be responsible for ensuring the availability of the lease for 5 years, that isrenewing the 3-year option on the expiry of the 2-year period then remaining. Also the idea of a managing company he said came fromMr. Chow.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="pseudopara" id="p9">9.</a> Mr. Chow prepared the agreement and it was typed while they waited. They then signed it before another solicitor. The idea of theguarantee to ensure that the plaintiff did take up the option to renew the lease came from his side; either Mr. Ng at one of theearlier meetings or he himself, he could not remember.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="pseudopara" id="p10">10.</a> With that brief outline, which I think is sufficient to enable me to proceed to the issues, I turn to the main question i.e. whichof the 2 versions is true.</p>    <p><a name="p11" class="pseudopara" id="p11">11.</a> Turning then to the plaintiff, I will say at once that I was impressed by his evidence, which was given in a restrained and convincingmanner. In that regard it was apparent from the very outset that the action was likely to be determined by the credibility of theevidence of the main witnesses, and I accordingly paid particular attention to their demeanour. The plaintiff's account of the matter,which matter was rather more involved and protracted than might appear in the brief outline I have provided, was significantly consistent.He did not exaggerate, was not evasive and was prepared to concede points that did not appear to favour him. Above all, he was notshaken in his very lengthy and close cross-examination.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="pseudopara" id="p12">12.</a> On the other hand, Mr. Cheung was vague and evasive about many matters and particularly details. His response to some important questionswas not of what he knew, but discursive with insistence upon what should or must have been. His obvious strength of feeling aboutthe plaintiff's action cast considerable doubt as to whether his evidence could be relied upon both in terms of veracity and objectivity.His reluctance to concede matters of obvious truth did not redound to his credit.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="pseudopara" id="p13">13.</a> Also of assistance in assessing his credibility is his account of the visit to Mr. Edmund Chow's office on the occasion the managementagreement and the guarantee were drawn up and executed. It is incredible, indeed little short of inconceivable, that having had theoutright sale explained to him, as Mr. Cheung says he did, Mr. Chow would have drafted the management agreement to its manifest effect.Likewise having clearly endorsed and signed the management agreement to the effect that it was interpreted to the parties and itwas highly improbable in the circumstances that the articled clerk failed to do so.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="pseudopara" id="p14">14.</a> It is convenient at this point to turn to the management agreement and the guarantee. The management agreement, dated the 10th February1982, recites the desire of the employer (the plaintiff) to change the name of the restaurant, the fact that he is the grantee ofa tenancy by the Housing Authority of the premises to operate a restaurant for a period of five years from 16th January 1979 to 15thJanuary 1984 with the option to renew for a further three years, and that it has been arranged for the manager (the defendant) tomanage the restaurant for the employer on the terms provided in the agreement, but that all the restaurant licences would remainin the name of the employer.

The tenor of both the management agreement and of the guarantee are inconsistentwith Mr. Cheung's evidence in that regard. Even if Mr. Cheung left the matter of the subletting restriction in the Housing Authoritylease to be overcome by Mr. Chow in his own legal way, the defendant's side, if not Mr. Cheung himself (as I find) having becomeconcerned to provide against the possibility of the plaintiff not renewing the lease for the benefit of the defendant, should certainlyhave been equally concerned not to have that safeguard limited to only the first five years.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="pseudopara" id="p18">18.</a> Mr. Cheung's initial attempt to meet this general point by claiming that the agreement was not explained to him was another indicationof his unreliability and lack of veracity; I am satisfied that both were explained to him before he signed them.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="pseudopara" id="p19">19.</a> Mr. Cheung's evidence that the plaintiff did not say anything to Mr. Chow is inconsistent with the defendant's averment in its defencethat an agreement was reached in Mr. Chow's presence.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="pseudopara" id="p20">20.</a> I accept the plaintiff's evidence that he initially expended some $1.6 million on the furniture and fittings and find his claim thathe would not in all the circumstances have disposed of his restaurant including furniture, fittings and premises for only $550,000.00entirely credible.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="pseudopara" id="p21">21.</a> Having regard to the foregoing and to all the material before me, and not least to the demeanour of the two witnesses, the evidenceof the plaintiff is clearly to be preferred; that of Mr. Cheung is suspect. I believe and accept the evidence of the plaintiff inmaterial respects and reject that of Mr. Cheung. I find, as a fact, that there was an agreement between the parties for the defendantto manage the restaurant for the five-year period, i.e. the initial lease of 5 years or what remained of it, and the three-year renewal.I digress to say that even if I had not taken the favourable view I have of the plaintiff's evidence, the inherent weakness and indeedthe lack of credibility of Mr. Cheung's evidence, would in any event have left undischarged the onus upon the defendant to show thatthe clear terms in question, of the agreement did not reflect the common intention of the parties.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="pseudopara" id="p22">22.</a> I turn then to address Mr. Horace Wong's first submission founded upon the terms of the management agreement. He submits that thewords "further extension or duration or renewal thereof" in clause 11 imports automatic renewal and extends the life of the agreementbeyond 15th January 1987. Clause 11 is not only far from clearly expressed, but ambiguous if it can be read in that way. Accordingly,having regard to its matrix, and in particular to the restricted scope of the guarantee, the provision in the agreement itself forthe deposit of $550,000.00 to be worked off in five years, and the evidence of the plaintiff which I accept, denying any intentionto provide for automatic renewal or extended life, it seems to me that on its true and proper construction, clause 11 does not extendthe life of the agreement for as long as the Housing Authority is prepared to renew the tenancy as contended by Mr. Wong; nor doesit constitute the plaintiff trustee for the defendant in the manner also contended for. I pause here to observe that in any case,as will be seen, the Housing Authority has since the 15th January 1990 refused to renew the plaintiff's lease and instead allowedhim to continue on the same terms on a "licence".</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="pseudopara" id="p23">23.</a> It follows that the defendant's counterclaim for rectification of the agreement must fail and is dismissed.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="pseudopara" id="p24">24.</a> Returning then to the plaintiff's claim for possession, it is necessary to further describe the relevant background. The plaintiff'sfirst tenancy ran from 16th January 1979 to 15th January 1984; it was renewed for three years from 16th January 1984 to 15th January1987; and then again for a further three years to 15th January 1990. With effect from 16th January 1990, the Housing Authority grantedthe plaintiff the licence I have already mentioned, to continue occupation of the premises pending disposal of the present legalproceedings.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="pseudopara" id="p25">25.</a> Mr. Wong submits that upon these facts, the plaintiff is a bare licensee and in law, therefore, does not have the necessary locusstandi to claim possession. He relies upon the following passages in paragraph 23-08 of the 16th Edn. of Clerk &amp; Lindsell onTort:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"Trespass is actionable at the suit of the person in possession of the land, who can claim damages or injunction, or both. A tenantin occupation can sue, but not a landlord except in cases of injury to the reversion... Possession means generally the occupationor physical control of land."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p>And in paragraph 23-35:</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"A licensee has no interest in the land, and accordingly has no remedy against a third party who disturbs him in the exercise of hislicence."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p26" class="pseudopara" id="p26">26.</a> However, paragraph 23-15 is in the following terms:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"<u>Servants</u>. In the absence of an intention on the part of the owner to treat the occupier as a tenant, mere occupation of premises by 'a servantor bailiff, or any person occupying land or buildings in a merely ministerial character', with the consent of the owner, althoughsuch occupation be exclusive, does not amount to possession.</p>            <p class="quote">This general presumption against exclusive possession by a servant may be compared with bailee at will or servant using his employer'smovable property, but it is only a presumption of law and expression of intention or even circumstances of the case may displacethe presumption."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p27" class="pseudopara" id="p27">27.</a> The defendant, it seems to me, in managing the restaurant business, was acting in a ministerial character. Furthermore, the plaintiffwas a tenant at the time the action was commenced and even after 15th January 1990, when the "licence" gave him exclusive possession,$125,000.00 was paid monthly in advance on his behalf by the defendant. In addition the Housing Authority had, by the express termsof its letter comprising the licence, to give him a month's notice to determine it. Clearly, therefore, he was more than a bare licencee,and in my judgment, had a sufficient interest in the premises to maintain an action for trespass against the defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="pseudopara" id="p28">28.</a> Mr. Wong made several submissions as to what followed the expiration of the management agreement on 15th January 1987. The plaintiff'spleaded case is that pending a better management agreement he granted a revocable licence to the defendant on the terms and obligationsin the management agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="pseudopara" id="p29">29.</a> As I have indicated, Mr. Cheung denies any such licence. There are facts and considerations that point both ways. I do not proposeto adumbrate them. As I have said, I prefer the plaintiff's evidence. Moreover, it is most unlikely that there would not have beena licence, implied, or as I find oral as averred and testified to by the plaintiff. In my finding on the probabilities, there wasan oral licence as claimed by the plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="pseudopara" id="p30">30.</a> Mr. Wong submits that if there was such a licence, the plaintiff was not entitled to revoke it. As I have said, the plaintiff's caseand evidence is that upon the expiration of the management agreement on 15th January 1987, he granted the defendant a revocable licenceon the same terms and conditions as the management agreement, and that on the 9th February 1989, he revoked the licence by a letterto the defendant written by his solicitors, Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master, giving the defendant 30 days to leave the premises. Mr.Wong submits that the plaintiff was not entitled to revoke the licence for two reasons, the first concerned with what the law permits,and the second with whether revocation was permitted by clause 8 of the management agreement.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="pseudopara" id="p31">31.</a> In making the first submission, Mr. Wong relies on paragraph 802 of the 26th Edn. of Chitty oh Contract, in particular the following:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"In recent years, the courts have therefore curtailed the right of discharge which follows from the classification of a term as acondition by the creation of a new category of terms, adopting a more flexible approach to the consequences of breach and tendingto encourage, rather than discourage, performance of the contract. In Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd.,the Court of Appeal refused to ascribe to the shipowner's obligation to deliver a seaworthy vessel the character of condition, andDiplock, L.J. said: 'There are, however, many contractual undertakings of a more complex character which cannot be categorised asbeing 'conditions' or 'warranties' ... Of such undertakings all that can be predicated is that some breaches will and others willnot give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whale benefit which it was intended heshould obtain from the contract; and the legal consequences of a breach of such undertaking, unless provided for expressly in thecontract, depend upon the nature of the event to which the breach gives rise and do not follow automatically from a prior classificationof the undertaking, as a 'condition' or as a 'warranty' The description that has been applied to such terms is that of 'intermediate'or 'innominate' terms. Breach of such a term entitles a party not in default to treat the contract as repudiated only if the otherparty has thereby renounced his obligations under the contract or rendered them impossible of performance, or if the consequencesof the breach are so serious as to deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he shouldobtain from the contract."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p32" class="pseudopara" id="p32">32.</a> For his latter ground, Mr. Wong relies upon clause 8, which I have already read. By clause 2 of the management agreement which Ihave also read, the defendant undertook to observe regulations issued by the licencing authorities and also to so manage the restaurantthat nothing would be permitted or omitted contrary to any statutory provision or regulation.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="pseudopara" id="p33">33.</a> It is not in dispute that there were warnings issued to the plaintiff as licencee, and three prosecutions against him over a periodof 2 1/2 years, but on the evidence, these were unlikely to have a serious effect on the plaintiff's licence to occupy the premises.Also in the payment of rent in respect of the premises there was chronic delay by the defendant of the order of two weeks to twomonths, which attracted a number of warning letters, two of which threatened re-entry. Notwithstanding that the Urban Council, theFire Department and the Housing Authority did not appear to take an unduly serious view of the breaches, I do not think that it followsthat they would always continue to do so, particularly the Housing Authority in the context of renewal of the Lease or licence. Inmy view there was a real possibility of the plaintiff losing his licences, particularly his licence to occupy the premises. That,of course, would entail the loss of the benefit of the management agreement, and even more the very premises themselves.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="pseudopara" id="p34">34.</a> The position under clause 8 is even clearer. I have no doubt the plaintiff feared the non-renewal of his licence, and that a reasonableman would in the circumstances conclude that non-payment of the rent on time would be likely to imperil and prejudice the continuanceor the renewal of the licences relating to the restaurant. I conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff was entitled to revoke the licenceon the foregoing grounds.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="pseudopara" id="p35">35.</a> In any case, it would only be necessary to rely upon the foregoing reasons to revoke the licence if it were coupled with an interest,e.g. corresponding to the term or duration of the management agreement. I cannot see that the grant of the licence on "the termsand conditions of the Management Agreement" would import any period, particularly as the licence was granted pending the making ofa "better" management agreement. In this context, as I have already said, I do not construe clause 11 of the management agreementas providing for automatic renewal or extended duration. Accordingly, the plaintiff could at any time revoke the licence, at leastby giving one month's notice, since the defendant paid the 'rent' monthly (though even that may not have been necessary if the rentfor February 1989 was not paid before receipt of the notice of termination dated 9th February 1989, as seems most probable).</p>    <p><a name="p36" class="pseudopara" id="p36">36.</a> I conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff was entitled to revoke the defendant's licence to occupy the premises.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="pseudopara" id="p37">37.</a> I turn then to consider the effect of the letter or notice of termination dated 9th February 1989. It was in the following terms:-</p>    <blockquote>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote">"         We are instructed that our client has appointed you to manage the above restaurant's business on his behalf under an agreementin writing dated 10th February 1982 and that the term of the said agreement has already expired on 15th January 1987.</p>            <p class="quote">        For the avoidance of doubts, we are instructed to inform you that the said agreement has already terminated and that our clienthas no intention to renew or extend the term with you and we are further instructed to give you 30 days to leave and remove all yourbelongings from the above restaurant premises.</p>            <p class="quote">        Please note that if you fail to comply with the above within the said time limits, our client shall be entitled to take whateveraction against you and/or your belongings as he may think fit."</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p38" class="pseudopara" id="p38">38.</a> Mr. Wong complains that the letter makes no mention of the licence, nor even propose to terminate it. However, in my judgment, terminationof the licence is a manifest and inescapable effect of the unequivocal requirement to leave, and accordingly that the letter constituteseffective notice of revocation of the licence.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="pseudopara" id="p39">39.</a> Finally, Mr. Wong submits that by reason of the conduct of the plaintiff, he is estopped from claiming that the defendant was oris a trespasser; moreover that by his conduct the plaintiff acquiesced in the plaintiff's occupation of the premises.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="pseudopara" id="p40">40.</a> Mr. Wong relies upon propriety estoppel as described in paras. 244 and 245 of the 26th Edn. of Chitty on Contract. In summary, itis there said that propriety estoppel operates in a variety of cases that can be divided into two categories. First, where a land-ownerhas "stood by" knowing of the mistake or actively encouraged the mistaken party to act in reliance of his mistaken belief. Second,where there is not merely "acquiescence by the land-owner, but encouragement".</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="pseudopara" id="p41">41.</a> However, on the facts before me, as I find them, the plaintiff neither "stood by", nor encouraged the defendant. On the contrary,he granted the licence pending a better management agreement and he took reasonable steps to seek the better management agreement,but was fobbed off by the defendant's directors, particularly Mr. Cheung. Accordingly, I reject the defences of estoppel and acquiescence.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="pseudopara" id="p42">42.</a> For all the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to and must be given possession of the premises.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="pseudopara" id="p43">43.</a> I will now hear counsel as to the time and any other terms of the order of possession and the injunction sought, and also as to costs.</p>    <p> </p>    <p> </p>    <table border="0" width="100%">        <tr>            <td width="50%"></td>            <td width="50%">                <p style="text-align:center">(G.P.
