But shortly before trial, they became unrepresented.  DLand then applied, unsuccessfully, for leave to be represented by a director.  Eventually, it did not appear at the trial.  OnlyMr Mak did.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a> Second, shortly before trial, the Disney Companies filed and served a hearsay notice dated 8 November 2007 for the witness statementsof Ms Belinda Lui, formerly a solicitor in the employ of B&amp;M, and Ms Whitney Foard Small, formerly the Regional Director of Marketingand Sales for the Parks and Resorts Division of the Walt Disney Asia Pacific between 1996 and 2001.  Both Ms Lui and Ms Small werenot able to attend court to give evidence because of work commitments.  Ms Lui had further made it clear that she would not cometo court anyway.  Mr Mak opposed the hearsay notice and applied to call them for cross-examination pursuant to Order 38 rule 21(1)(a),Rules of the High Court.  Having considered the matter, I refused the application.  Their witness statements are admitted, subjectto weight.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a> Third, the parties had filed witness statements purportedly from members of the public (3 for the Disney Companies and 10 for D Landand Mr Mak).<a>[4]</a>  They dealt with the question of misrepresentation and confusion.  At the end, none of them were called.  And no hearsay notice wasfiled.  Their witness statements thus do not form part of the evidence for the purpose of the trial.  But even if they were called,I do not think their evidence would have any significant bearing or made any difference to the outcome at all.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">D.

First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he suppliesin the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying âget-upâ (whether it consists simply of a brand nameor a trade description, or the individual features of labeling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offeredto the public, such that the get-up is distinctive specifically of the plaintiffâs goods or services.

Since 1995, the Disney Group consolidated use of its3 versions of âDISNEYâ in Chinese characters and only âå»¸å£«å°¼â has been used since then as the Chinese counterpart ofâDISNEYâ for consistency throughout the world.  Mr Yan further said that the products and services which have been sold, distributedand marketed under any by reference to âå»¸å£«å°¼â by the Disney Companies in Hong Kong include visual and audio entertainmentproducts and their production and distribution; television program production and broadcasting; a wide range of consumer products;internet business and services; entertainment and travel services and theme parks.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a> Ms Reed corroborated Mr Yanâs evidence and provided further details on various aspects of the Disney Groupâs business.  Of particularrelevance to the present case are the theme parks and travel services run by the Disney Group.  The Disney Group operates a numberof world famous theme parks in California and Florida in the USA, Tokyo in Japan and Paris in France.  Many of the Disney theme parksoffer accommodation at a number of Disney hotels including Disney-themed hotels.  For example, the Walt Disney World Resort includesin addition to the park attractions and rides themselves : 13 resort hotels, a complex of villas and suites, dining and entertainingcomplex and other facilities.  The Disney Group also operates a cruise line.  More specifically, the website DisneyVacations.comis a marketing and sales channel for Disney Parks and Resorts vacation packages and tickets.  Through the website, the Disney Companiesoffer customers air-ticketing, car rental, tour packaging and accommodation reservation services in respect of various Disney resort,theme parks and cruises operated by them and/or their associated companies.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a> Ms Reed also touched upon the reputation in the DISNEY Marks.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a> She referred to a survey entitled â100 Leading Licensorsâ and published in a LICENSE! Magazine in April 2002 which ranked licensorsworldwide basing on licensing sales figures in 2001.  The survey showed that the sales of the Disney consumer products business wereat some US$13 billion.  Ms Reed referred to another report entitled the Best Global Brands 2002 prepared by JP Morgan Chase &amp;Co. which named the DISNEY brand the top 7 out of the worldâs most valuable brands valued at US$32.6 billion in 2001.  She concludedthat âDISNEYâ is the single biggest and most valuable asset of the Disney Group.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a> Ms Reed then gave a brief history of various Disneyland theme parks over the world.  She emphasized that enormous outlay, planning,investment and infrastructure goes into creating the Disneyland theme parks which are second to none.  Disney theme parks are extremelyworld renowned in the travel and entertainment industries with proven popularity as travel destinations for adults and children alike. She concluded that âDISNEYLANDâ is synonymous with Disneyâs theme parks and related travel destination services.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a> Ms Small in her witness statement described how the Disneyland theme parks, Disney Cruise Line and travel related services were promotedand marketed in Hong Kong.  On the use of âå»¸å£«å°¼â for âDISNEYâ, her evidence is similar to Mr Yanâs.  She added thatin 1996, the use of âå»¸å£«å°¼â in relation to the leisure, travel and entertainment services, was already well established inthe main Chinese speaking markets in the Asia Pacific region, including Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a> The evidence of Mr Yan, Ms Reed and Ms Small clearly established that at all material times, the Disney Companies enjoyed substantialgoodwill and reputation in the DISNEY Marks in all the products and services including travel services that they offered to the publicinternationally and in Hong Kong.  The DISNEY Marks have indeed become distinctive of the Disney Companiesâ products and services.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.2.b. Mr Makâs contentions</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a> In his attempt to dispute the Disney Companiesâ goodwill and reputation, Mr Mak took a number of points.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a> First, Mr Mak contended that at the material time, any goodwill that the Disney Companies had was limited to the entertainment businessonly.  Since they had never operated as travel agents, they did not have any goodwill in the travel agency business where D Landoperated or the travel services industry generally.  While it is true that the Disney Companies have never operated as travel agents,Mr Makâs contention is utterly wrong.  For as noted, there is a wealth of undisputable evidence proving that at all material times,the Disney Companies did engage in the travel service industry and have substantial goodwill and reputation therein.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a> Second, Mr Mak contended that any goodwill that the Disney Companies had was confined to the name âWalt Disneyâ and had not beenextended to âå»¸å£«å°¼â.  This is plainly contradicted by evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a> Third, Mr Mak said that back in November 1999, the Disney Companies had yet to register any of the DISNEY Marks.  Thus they did nothave any monopoly in those Marks.  This, however, does not assist him a bit.  As I have repeatedly pointed out at the trial, thisis not a trademark infringement action and passing off does not depend on any registration of the relevant trademark or trade name. The absence of any registered trademark for any of the DISNEY Marks at the time is wholly irrelevant.  It does not even begin toshow that the Disney Companies did not have any goodwill or reputation in any of the DISNEY Marks.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a> Fourth, Mr Mak said that shortly after D Land was incorporated, it had obtained trademark registration for âå»¸å£«å°¼æéâin Class 39 in the Mainland.  It is factually wrong.  D Land had only made the application.  And as noted, it was eventually refusedin 2004.  In any event, even if D Land had obtained trademark registration for âå»¸å£«å°¼æéâ in the Mainland, it does notmean that the Disney Companies did not have any goodwill and reputation in the DISNEY Marks in Hong Kong then.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a> Fifth, Mr Mak said D Land had its own goodwill in the travel agency business under the name âè¿ªå£«åæâ<a>[5]</a> because it had been trading under such name for more than 6 years since its incorporation in 1999.  However, even assuming that DLand was trading under the name âè¿ªå£«åæâ, there is simply no evidence to show that when it was incorporated in 1999 orindeed at any time thereafter, it had such goodwill as alleged.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a> Finally, Mr Mak argued that since the Disney Companies were recently subject to certain negative publicity, they did not have a goodreputation.  He has mistakenly confused goodwill with <i>good</i> reputation.  The Disney Companies may well subject to negative publicity from time to time.  But that does not mean they did nothave sufficient goodwill or reputation in their business.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a> None of the points taken by Mr Mak is meritorious.  I reject them all.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.2.c. Conclusion</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a> In my view, the evidence is overwhelming.  The Disney Companies did have sufficient and indeed very substantial goodwill and reputationin the DISNEY Marks at all material times to found this passing off action.  And I so find.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.3. Misrepresentation</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a> I next come to the second element of misrepresentation.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.3.a. How D Landâs names came into being</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a> It is useful to first examine how D Landâs name, both English and Chinese, came into being.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a> In summary, Mr Mak said that those names were derived from his two cats, âDaisyâ and â<sup>î´</sup>ä»â.  For â<sup>î´</sup>ä»â, Mr Mak used the English transliteration âLand Chaiâ.  The initial words of âDaisyâ and âLand Chaiâ are âDâand âLandâ.  Hence D Land in its English name.  The Chinese transliteration of the name âDaisyâ is âè¿ªå£«â.  Put togetherwith the first character of â<sup>î´</sup>ä»â, it read in Chinese âå»¸å£«å°¼â.  Hence âå»¸å£«å°¼â in D Landâs Chinese name.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a> Mr Makâs story is most absurd.  It does not even bear a moment of closer scrutiny.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a> As noted, D Landâs names were a combination of the catsâ names âDaisyâ and â<sup>î´</sup>ä»â.  On âDaisyâ, Mr Mak said in paragraph 4 of his first witness statement that he named his cat âDaisyâ because it lookslike a bunch of daisy.  But âDaisyâ is a male cat.  When asked under cross-examination why he had given what obviously is a girlâsname to a male cat, Mr Mak alleged that it was not him who called the cat âDaisyâ.  Its previous owner did.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a> Mr Mak further said in his oral testimony that the English and Chinese names of D Land were decided at a board meeting of MMCL inJuly 1998.  But it could not have possibly been when, as evidenced by the receipt, Mr Mak bought the cat in December 1998.  Mr Makthen alleged that he brought the cat home a few months prior to July 1998 before buying it.  The receipt was issued later.  Thiswas only to be contradicted by the catâs vaccination card which showed that it was still in Australia as at 2 July 1998.  He madethese all up as he went along.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a> On â<sup>î´</sup>ä»â, Mr Mak said in paragraph 4 of his 1<sup>st</sup> witness statement that he called his cat âLand Chaiâ, without giving its Chinese name.  At trial, he confirmed that its namewas â<sup>î´</sup>ä»â.  The character â<sup>î´</sup>â was to justify the use of âLandâ in D Landâs English name.  But the pronunciation of the Chinese character â<sup>î´</sup>â is âLengâ and not âLandâ.  They simply do not match.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a> Further, the use of the name â<sup>î´</sup>ä»â could not possibly explain the use of âå°¼â in D Landâs Chinese name âå»¸å£«å°¼â.  The character â<sup>î´</sup>â bears no resemblance to âå°¼â in appearance or pronunciation at all.  Any allegation that â<sup>î´</sup>â is the origin of âå°¼â in D Landâs Chinese name defies common sense.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> Mr Makâs evidence is also contradicted by his own document.  In the trademark opposition proceedings in the Mainland, Mr Mak signedand submitted on behalf of D Land to the Trademark Review Board a document entitled âè³ªè¨¼æè¦æ¸â.  There, in order to justifythe use of the character âå°¼â in D Landâs Chinese name, he claimed that the Cantonese name of his cat was âå°¼ä»â.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> In my view, Mr Makâs implausible and nonsensical story of how D Landâs English and Chinese names came into being is false.  Plainly,he made it up in order to explain away the obvious : D Landâs English and Chinese names were adopted deliberately in order to tradeon the goodwill and reputation enjoyed by the Disney Companies in the DISNEY Marks.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.3.b. How D Land used its names</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> I then consider the use of D Landâs English and Chinese names in the conduct of its business.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a> Plainly, given the Disney Companiesâ substantial goodwill and reputation in the DISNEY Marks, the use by D Land of its Englishand Chinese names was calculated to deceive and mislead unsuspecting members of the public into the erroneous belief that D Landwas in some way connected or associated with or licensed by the Disney Companies.  This is particularly so when âå»¸å£«å°¼â inD Landâs Chinese name is identical to the Chinese name used by the Disney Companies in Hong Kong for years and D Land is clearlysuggestive of âDISNEYLANDâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a> The manner in which D Land had used its English and Chinese names had further increased the likelihood of confusion.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a> D Land had a trade name called âè¿ªå£«åæâ.  Mr Mak said that D Land used that name prominently in signage and brochures. But the fact is this.  In its staffâs name cards, signage, brochures, the name âè¿ªå£«åæâ was used in conjunction withthe English name âD Land Travel Limitedâ but the legend âå»¸å£«å°¼æéæéå¬å¸å¨è³éå±¬â was placed below thosenames.  This would obviously suggest to members of the public that a company named âD Land Travel Limitedâ and âè¿ªå£«åæâis a wholly owned subsidiary of âå»¸å£«å°¼æéæéå¬å¸â, giving rise to the misrepresentation that that company is a whollyowned subsidiaries of the Disney Companies or their group.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a> Mr Mak said the names were so arranged in order to satisfy <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32/s93.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 93</a> of the <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Ordinance</a>, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/32">Cap. 32</a> so that the public dealing with D Land would know that it was a limited company.  But if that were the intention, statingboth the English and Chinese names of D Land would suffice.  The inclusion of the words âå¨è³éå±¬â, which is the very basisupon which the misrepresentation that D Land was one of the subsidiaries of the Disney Companies or their group arose, would be whollyunnecessary.  Mr Mak then said the words âå¨è³éå±¬â were included in order to express the meaning âoperated byâ, thatis, âè¿ªå£«åæâ was operated by âå»¸å£«å°¼æéæéå¬å¸â.  This is singularly unconvincing.  Mr Mak, trained as anaccountant and provided secretariat services via other companies of his, should know better : âå¨è³éå±¬â (wholly owned subsidiary)simply does not mean âoperated byâ.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a> In some of D Landâs brochures, the use of âé¦æ¸¯è¾¦äºèâ and âè¿ªå£«å°¼æé(é¦æ¸¯è¾¦äºè)â were used.  That createdthe false impression that âD Land Travel Limitedâ and âè¿ªå£«åæâ is not only a wholly owned subsidiary of the DisneyCompanies but also their Hong Kong office.  This is particularly telling because D Land never had any office or branch office outsideHong Kong.  What is then the need to distinguish a Hong Kong branch office and one outside Hong Kong?  Mr Mak explained in his 3<sup>rd</sup> supplemental witness statement filed in the course of trial that D Land used âé¦æ¸¯è¾¦äºèâ as its trade practice becausecompanies cooperated with D Land in the Mainland displayed âè¿ªå£«åæ(ä¸­åè¾¦äºè)â and that the use of âè¿ªå£«å°¼æé(é¦æ¸¯è¾¦äºè)âwas an error made by the staff.  This is a recent fabrication and I reject it.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.3.c. The hyperlink</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a> The false representation that D Land was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Disney Companies and that it was their Hong Kong officewas further reinforced by the provision of the a hyperlink from D Landâs website to that part of the Disney Companiesâ websiterelating to their vacation and travel services.  At the material times, that was the only hyperlink provided by D Landâs websiteto other parks and tourist attractions.  Public browsing D Landâs website would be easily misled into thinking that D Land wassome way related to the Disney Companies.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> Mr Mak said that the link was included upon the advice of the computer consultant who installed D Landâs computer system.  I donot accept it.  In my view, he made it up in order to explain away D Landâs wrongful act.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> Mr Mak said that there were other links.  It was factually wrong.  At all material times, only one link existed, which was linkedto the Disney Companiesâ website.  It was only after D Land had received the cease and desist letter in May 2001 that the hyperlinkto the Disney Companiesâ website was severed and replaced by one to Universal Studio.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> Mr Mak also said that it was the practice of travel agents to provide links to the Disney Companiesâ website.  The short answeris : you may well provide links to their website but you cannot misrepresent to the public that you are their wholly owned subsidiaryor local branch office or some way related to them.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.3.d. Mr Makâs other contentions</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a> Mr Mak took a number of additional points.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a> First, he first argued that the field of activity of the Disney Companies is different from that of D Land.  This is misconceived.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a> It is well established that the absence of common field of activity is not a bar to a passing off action : <i>Wadlow on The Law of Passing Off</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, paragraph 5-81 at p.338.  Further, the proximity of the defendantâs field of activity to that of the plaintiff would berelevant as to whether the acts complained of in a particular case amounted to a misrepresentation : <i>Lego System Aktieselskab &amp; Another v. Lego M.</i><i> Lemelstrich Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20FSR%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] FSR 155</a>, <i>per</i> Falconer J at p.187.  Here, the evidence clearly established that the Disney Companies operated in the travel services industry. There was plainly a very close proximity to D Landâs field of activity, namely travel agency.  This is highly relevant.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a> Second, Mr Mak referred to the relative small scale of D Landâs operation and the principal type of tours it organized and contendedthat confusion is unlikely.  But as rightly submitted by Mr Yan, SC, for the Disney Companies, less sophisticated or cautious consumersmay well be misled by D Landâs conduct into believing that it was associated or related to the Disney Companies.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a> Third, Mr Mak relied on the evidence of Ms Ada Chow Yuk Yin of the investigation agent employed by the Disney Companies.  She saidwhen her agent went to D Landâs office for undercover investigation, D Landâs staff, Angus Liu, told him that of D Land was notrelated to the Disney Companies.  But she went on to say that what Liu said was in response to a direct question from the agent. Mr Yan submitted that this is important because even if someone is seeking deliberately to trade off anotherâs goodwill by adoptingnames deceptively similar to the claimant, he may not dare, in answer to a direct question, to say that his company is in fact relatedto the claimant.  I agree.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a> Fourth, Mr Mak said that the Disney Companies had not received any actual complaint of confusion.  That may or may not be the case. But that does not mean that what D Land had not caused the misrepresentation complained of.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a> Fifth, Mr Mak said he had done his best to remove any possible confusion by putting up a disclaimer at the signage that D Land isnot related to the Disney Group after D Land had received the cease and desist letter in May 2001.  The fact that Mr Mak sought toput up the disclaimer only served to reinforce the Disney Companiesâ case that there was likelihood of confusion.  Further, despitethe disclaimer, D Land continued the wrongful acts complained of, with the exception of severing the hyperlink to the Disney Companiesâwebsite.  The misrepresentation just continued.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a> Sixth, Mr Mak said D Land distributed the Disney Companiesâ brochures at their invitation to promote their theme parks.  Thereis however no evidence to prove this point.  In any event, the Disney Companies are not complaining about distribution of their brochuresby D Land at their office.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a> Finally, Mr Mak attacked the Disney Companies for not calling the public witnesses.  This is misconceived.  If anything, the samecomplaint can be said about his failure to call his own public witnesses.  In any event, the question of misrepresentation is a questionof fact for me to decide.  And I have no difficulty in determining this question on the evidence before me.  The evidence of thepublic witnesses, even if called, will not change my conclusion at all.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.3.e. Conclusion</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a> The evidence on misrepresentation is overwhelming.  I find that D Land (a) had the fraudulent intention to deceive the public intobelieving and (b) had in fact misrepresented to the public that it was either a wholly owned subsidiary or a local branch officeof the Disney Companies or some way related to them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D.4. Damage</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> I now come to the third element of damage.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> The evidence before me, which I accept, clearly shows that the DISNEY Marks are the single biggest and most value asset of the DisneyCompanies and that one very important aspect of their business is licensing the Marks.  D Landâs wrongful conduct has caused andif not stopped, would continue to cause substantial damage to them.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> D Landâs wrongful conduct would no doubt dilute the exclusivity of the DISNEY Marks.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> Further, it is Ms Smallâs evidence, which I accept, that the Disney Companies have all along been very careful in choosing travelagents for the provision of travel related services.  They are scrupulously determined, based on size, reputation, guaranteed quantity/numbersof ticket sales.  They must be well-established, well known and reputable.  They must have significantly big contracts with airlinesenabling large block bookings on airlines, particularly with the USA, have contracts for large block bookings with hotels, and havethe capacity to put together travel packages which include flights, hotels and theme park entry.  In short, only top travel agentsin the industry, which can satisfy the stringent requirements of the Disney Companies, are selected.  If D Land could free ride onthe DISNEY Marks, the Disney Companies would be prevented from controlling its activity and the reputation in those Marks to whichthe goodwill is attached.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> Mr Mak argued that because there is no common field of activity, the Disney Companies would not suffer damage.  This is a whollyunmeritorious argument, which I reject.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">D5. Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> The Disney Companies have proved all the three elements.

That, I think, is what policy requires if aproper recognition is to be given to the identity of the company as a separate legal person.  Nor, as it seems to me, will it beright to hold a controlling shareholder liable as a joint tortfeasor if he does no more than exercise his power of control throughthe constitutional organs of the company - for example by voting at general meetings and by exercising the powers to appoint directors. Aldous LJ suggested in <i>Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corp (No. 2)</i> [2000] 1 Lloydâs Rep 218 at 235âin a passage to which I have referredâthat there are good reasons to conclude that the carryingout of the duties of a director would never be sufficient to make a director liable.  For my part, I would hesitate to use the wordâneverâ in this field; but I would accept that, if all that a director is doing is carrying out the duties entrusted to him assuch by the company under its constitution, the circumstances in which it would be right to hold him liable as a joint tortfeasorwith the company would be rare indeed.  That is not to say, of course, that he might not be liable for his own separate tort, asAldous LJ recognised at paragraphs 16 and 17 of his judgment in the <i>Pakistan National Shipping</i> case. </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Second, there is no reason why a person who happens to be a director or controlling shareholder of a company should not be liablewith the company as a joint tortfeasor if he is not exercising control through the constitutional organs of the company and the circumstancesare such that he would be so liable if he were not a director or controlling shareholder.  In other words, if, in relation to thewrongful acts which are the subject of complaint, the liability of the individual as a joint tortfeasor with the company arises fromhis participation or involvement in ways which go beyond the exercise of constitutional control, then there is no reason why theindividual should escape liability because he could have procured those same acts through the exercise of constitutional control. As I have said, it seems to me that this is the point made by Aldous J (as he then was) in <i>PLG Research Ltd v. Ardon International Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20FSR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] FSR 197.</a> </td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td style="text-align:left" width="2%" valign="top" class="quote"> </td>                <td style="text-align:left" width="93%" valign="top" class="quote">Third, the question whether the individual is liable with the company as a joint tortfeasor - at least in the field of intellectualpropertyâis to be determined under principles identified in <i>CBS Songs Ltd v.

Mr Makâs involvement</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> Mr Mak was at all material times the majority shareholder and director of D Land.  The evidence clearly shows that he was the mastermindbehind D Land.  He was the person who chose D Landâs English and Chinese names.  He was the person who managed and controlled DLand.  All these came from his own evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> In his affirmation (filed in June 2005 opposing the joinder application), Mr Mak said that since its incorporation, D Land had beenunder his management and control.  He also testified that when he and his wife were D Landâs directors, she played no part in itsmanagement because she was employed full time elsewhere.  Thus he was effectively the only person controlling and managing D Landat all material times.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a> In his first witness statement (filed in September 2003), Mr Mak said that it was he who âused the initial words of [his] catsto be the English and Chinese versions of the name of [D Land].â  (It was on that basis that the Disney Companies applied to joinMr Mak in June 2005.  In his affirmation filed in opposition, Mr Mak did not dispute that it was he who selected D Landâs names.)</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a> It was Mr Mak who first responded to the cease and desist letter from B&amp;M and spoke to and correspond with them thereafter.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a> It was Mr Mak who made and signed each every important document on behalf of D Land in these and some other proceedings concerningthe DISNEY Marks which involved D Land before he was joined in June 2005.  He made the only witness statement filed on behalf ofD Land in February 2003.  He made the only Statutory Declaration filed in opposition to one of Disney Enterprisesâ trademark applicationsin Hong Kong dated 22 April 2004, declaring that all the matters depose to therein were to the best of his personal information knowledgeand belief.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a> It was Mr Mak who made and signed the âè³ªè¨¼æè¦æ¸â filed in the trademark proceedings in the Mainland in August 2005.  Therehe reiterated that it was he who coined D Landâs names although he called one of his cats a different name.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a> But Mr Mak, having been joined as a defendant, now alleged that he had practically nothing to do with the management, control andnaming of D Land.  Basically, he shifted all the blames to others, including regrettably his late mother.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p81" class="para" id="p81">81.</a> Mr Mak said it was his mother who wanted to run a travel agency company and financed the operations of D Land and indeed some ofhis other companies, including MMCL.  He held the shares in D Land for her.  These are all bare and recent allegations.  Not a scintillaof evidence has been adduced in support.  They must be rejected.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p82" class="para" id="p82">82.</a> Mr Mak further said it was his mother who coined the Chinese name of D Land.  He said the decision was made at the board meetingof MMCL (of which his mother was a shareholder) on 15 July 1998.  But the purported board minutes only said that her mother shalldecide on the name of the new company.  It was not recorded that her mother decided the Chinese name of D Land there and then.  MrMak then said that the decision was actually made at a subsequent meeting in July 1998.  But as pointed out in paragraph 41 above,that could not have been possible.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a> This new allegation that it was his mother who coined the Chinese name of D Land is in stark contradiction of his own evidence inthe 1<sup>st</sup> witness statement that it was he who used the names of the cats for D Landâs names.  Mr Mak said he only <i>used</i> the names of the cats but he did not <i>coin</i> the names of D Land.  Plainly, when his evidence in the witness statement is properly read, he did mean that it was he who derivedfrom his catsâ names D Landâs names.  This semantic game is useless.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a> Mr Mak then said he was not responsible for the management and daily operations of D Land.  All important decisions relating to DLand were made by his mother.  The staff was responsible for its daily operations.  Though a director, his role was limited to signingcheques when requested.  Again, this new allegation is flatly contradicted by his own evidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> Finally, Mr Mak said it was a Mainland investor in D Land who had decided to file the application to register the mark âå»¸å£«å°¼æéâin the Mainland in 2000.  This is yet another bare allegation he raised in the course of his oral testimony.  It does not sit wellwith the fact that he signed and submitted the âè³ªè¨¼æè¦æ¸â in August 2005.  I have no doubt that he made it up as he wentalong.  In any event, he said he approved the decision to apply for registration.  He cannot now blame some fictitious investor.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading">E.3. Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:left"><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> In my view, the evidence on Mr Makâs personal liability is again overwhelming.  He clearly intended, procured and shared a commondesign that D Land should commit the wrongful acts complained of by the Disney Companies.  He is plainly the mastermind of the entirescheme and steered D Land into committing the acts complained of.  He undoubtedly fully endorsed and supported those wrongful actsand intended that they should continue as long as possible.  As the majority shareholder and controlling director, he had the authorityto stop them but did not, not even after the Disney Companies had complained.  He knew full well that D Landâs wrongful activitieswere continuing and played his own part in trying to ensure that they could.  Plainly, he is liable as a joint tortfeasor : see <i>Kabushiki Kaisha Yakult Honsha &amp; Others v.
