In April2007, the Shenzhen Court dismissed the claim.  In the judgment dismissing the claim, it is stated that the Shenzhen Court by thenwas only dealing with the claim as an unfair competition dispute, but not a business secrets dispute.  It further stated that thebusiness secrets dispute should be resolved through other legal means.

It is important to make a distinction between those witnesses who will more likely be required to give disputed evidenceand whose testimony is not likely to cause controversy.  In the case of the latter, unless there is shown a likelihood that theirattendance at trial is required, the fact that they are resident in any particular country will not normally be of any significance. Thus, while the court is not at this stage concerned about the merits of the action, it is nevertheless incumbent on the partiesto set out their respective cases in sufficient detail so as to identify those issues likely to be in controversy at trial.

His Lordship explains at 734B-Cas follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><b>â</b>â¦Regarding the connecting factors with China and the availability of witness in China, Mr Wu has merely shown that the courts inPRC are equally appropriate as the Hong Kong courts to deal with this case.

There is no suggestion that there is a riskthat they could not attend the trial if it is to be held in Hong Kong. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p44" class="para" id="p44">44.</a> </b> In the premises, I accept the submissions of Mr Poon, SC, leading Mr Godfrey Lam SC and Ms Elizabeth Cheung for the Plaintiffs, thatthe 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants only show that it may be practically more <i>convenient</i> for the potential witnesses to attend a trial in Shenzhen.   As such, and applying the principles set out above at paragraphs 40and 41 above, this does <i>not</i> show that the Shenzhen Court is the more appropriate forum in which the case can be <i>tried</i> more suitably for the interests of the parties and for the ends of justice. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p45" class="para" id="p45">45.</a> </b> Although it is not in the evidence, Mr Pe then submits that, as a matter of common sense, it is unlikely that those former employeesof the Plaintiffs, who the Defendants intend to call as witnesses, would be willing to come to Hong Kong to give evidence, as theyhave been convicted in Shenzhen.  Therefore, if the case is to be tried in Hong Kong, serious prejudice would be caused to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants if these witnesses refuse to come to Hong Kong.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p46" class="para" id="p46">46.</a> </b> I am unable to accept Mr Peâs above submissions:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(1) </b> I accept Mr Poonâs submissions that, as a matter of common sense, it is more likely than not that these former employees will beless willing to give any evidence in Shenzhen than in Hong Kong, if the evidence they are to give is to contradict their convictions.

No injustice therefore is likely to be caused to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants as submitted.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(2)    </b> Further, I have read the witness statements of these employees, which have led to their conviction.

I note that the Plaintiffsâ averments against them in Statement of Claim are substantially based on the matters statedin their statements.   In the circumstances, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants have also failed to satisfy me how the attendance of these employees at trial is likely to be of significance.

The applicantfor a stay should further show that, for example, there is at least a risk that some of these document may not be made availableif the trial is to be conducted locally.

Ackner LJ expressed at p 94 the view that the jurisdiction in which a tort had been committed was <i>prima facie</i> the natural forum for the determination of that dispute.  Robert Goff LJ also said at p 96 as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><b>ââ¦If the substance of an alleged tort is committed within a certain jurisdiction, it is not easy to imagine what other facts coulddisplace the conclusion that the Courts of that jurisdiction are the natural forum.â</b> </p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a> </b> In <i>Esquel Enterprises</i>, supra, the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong adopted the above observations in <i>The Albaforth</i>, and confirmed at paras 13 and 28 the first instance judgeâs conclusion that the foreign jurisdiction where the publication ofthe alleged defamatory material was made, was the <i>prima facie</i> natural forum for the determination of the claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a> </b> Relying on these authorities, Mr Pe for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants submits that as the alleged wrongs complained by the Plaintiffs in this action are tortuous in nature, and were indisputablycommitted in Shenzhen, it is clear that the Shenzhen Court is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum to try the matter.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a> </b> Mr Poon for the Plaintiffs however submits the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(1) </b> The main thrust of the Plaintiffsâ claim in the present action is based on breach of confidence, which is not a specie of tortas recognized by the common law.

He submits that the need to determine the meaning and effect of Article 10, being a PRC legal code, points to the Shenzhen Courtas the more appropriate forum.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a> </b> For this, Mr Poon for the Plaintiffs confirms that the reference to Article 10 in the Statement of Claim is only for the purposeof satisfying the double actionability test under the <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> principle.  The Plaintiffs are <i>not</i> relying on Article 10 as a material part of their claims against the Defendants.  Therefore (Mr Poon further submits) no issue arisesin the present action on the interpretation and applicability of Article 10.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a> </b> Given Mr Poonâs confirmation, I am satisfied that if the trial of the action is to be conducted in Hong Kong, it is not necessaryto determine the meaning and effect of Article 10 under PRC law.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a> </b> Further, even if I were wrong above, and the issue of the meaning and effect of Article 10 under PRC law did arise in the trial,the expert evidence before me is to the effect that the interpretation and effect of Article 10 under PRC law is not controversial. As such, I am also satisfied that Hong Kong courts are still competently equipped to deal with this issue.  As said by Cheung JAin <i>Pei Zheng Middle School</i>, supra, at para 20, Hong Kong courts are generally highly competent to deal with any legal or factual issues with a Mainland element.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a> </b> For these reasons, I am not persuaded that, even with the potential relevance of PRC law in the trial of the present proceedings,the Shenzhen Court is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion under Stage I</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a> </b> For the above reasons, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants have failed to show that the Shenzhen Court is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum to try the present action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a> </b> On this basis alone, I would dismiss the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantsâ stay application.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a> </b> However, if I were wrong in the above, I will deal with the arguments under Stages II and III as follows.</p>    <p class="heading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">Stage II</span></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a> </b> The Plaintiffs say that they would be deprived of the following personal or juridical advantages if the action is to be stayed forthe Shenzhen Court:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(1) </b> A compulsory and more extensive discovery procedure and the right to administer interrogatories.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(2) </b> A higher level of recoverable damages.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(3) </b> A wider and more effective form of injunction.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(4) </b> The remedies of constructive trust and tracing.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(5) </b> The award of exemplary damages.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(6) </b> The award of costs on an indemnity basis.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Constructive trust, tracing and indemnity costs</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a> </b> As a start, Mr Pe for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants effectively and fairly accepts that under the PRC legal system and jurisprudence, the remedies of (a) constructive trustand tracing, (b) exemplary damages, and the award of costs on an indemnity basis are not available. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a> </b> Notwithstanding the concession, Mr Pe submits that, given the state of the pleading and the evidence before the Court, it is highlyunlikely that the Plaintiffs would be able to obtain these reliefs and indemnity costs even if the trial is to be conducted in HongKong.

Thus, as submitted by MrPe, there is simply no question of there being a juridical advantage in relation to the Hong Kong discovery and interrogatories procedures.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a> </b> Secondly, as a matter of evidence, Mr Pe says that the PRC civil procedures do provide a rather similar and comprehensive evidencedisclosure system.   The two procedures are therefore not significantly different.   He relies on the following evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(1) </b> According to the unchallenged expert evidence, under the various articles of the Civil Procedure Law of the Peopleâs Republic ofChina, if the Plaintiffs can show that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants are in possession of certain relevant evidence, they can apply to the court to ask the court to investigate, and collectthe evidence, and even to preserve evidence.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(2) </b> Further, as confirmed by the experts on both sides, under Article 75 of the Civil Procedure Law of the Peopleâs Republic of China,if a party refuses to provide the evidence when so asked by the court, it can be inferred as established that such evidence is notfavourable to that party possessing the evidence.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a> </b> Mr Pe therefore submits that, under the relevant PRC procedural laws, it is not the case that there is no procedure to allow thePlaintiffs to seek further evidence from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, even if they are against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantsâ case.  Quite to the contrary, the procedures set out above are comprehensive and effective, as they even provide fora detrimental presumption against a party who refuses to disclose certain evidence when asked by the court to do so.  There is thereforeagain (Mr Pe so further submits) no question of a juridical advantage vis-Ã -vis the discovery and interrogatories procedures.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p87" class="para" id="p87">87.</a> </b> I do not accept Mr Peâs submissions.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p88" class="para" id="p88">88.</a> </b> I will deal with Mr Peâs submissions on the law first.    When discussing the test in relation to the loss of legitimate personalor juridical advantage, Lord Goff in <i>Spiliada</i> made the following observations at 482B-483C:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><b>â</b>8) <i>Treatment of âa legitimate personal or juridical advantageâ</i></p>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Clearly, the mere fact that the plaintiff has such an advantage in proceedings in England cannot be decisive. As Lord Sumner saidof the parties in the <i>SociÃ©tÃ© du Gaz</i> case,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1926%20SC%20%28HL%29%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1926 SC (HL) 13</a>, 22:</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âI do not see how one can guide oneself profitably by endeavouring to conciliate and promote the interests of both these antagonists,except in that ironical sense, in which one says that it is in the interests of both that the case should be tried in the best wayand in the best tribunal, and that the best man should win.â</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">Indeed, as Oliver L.J.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20116" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 116</a>, 135, pointed out in his judgment in the present case, an advantage to the plaintiff will ordinarily give rise to a comparable disadvantageto the defendant; and simply to give the plaintiff his advantage at the expense of the defendant is not consistent with the objectiveapproach inherent in Lord Kinnear's statement of principle in <i>Sim v. Robinow</i>, 19 R, 665, 668.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">The key to the solution of this problem lies, in my judgment, in the underlying fundamental principle. We have to consider where thecase may be tried âsuitably for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice.â Let me consider the applicationof that principle in relation to advantages which the plaintiff may derive from invoking the English jurisdiction. Typical examplesare: damages awarded on a higher scale; a more complete procedure of discovery; a power to award interest; a more generous limitationperiod. Now, <i>as a general rule</i>, I do not think that the court should be deterred from granting a stay of proceedings, or from exercising its discretion againstgranting leave under R.S.C. Ord. 11, simply because the plaintiff will be deprived of such an advantage, <i>provided</i> that the court is satisfied that substantial justice will be done in the available appropriate forum. Take, for example, discovery.We know that there is a spectrum of systems of discovery applicable in various jurisdictions, ranging from the limited discoveryavailable in civil law countries on the continent of Europe to the very generous pre-trial oral discovery procedure applicable inthe United States of America. Our procedure lies somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. No doubt each of these systems has itsvirtues and vices; but, generally speaking, I cannot see that, objectively, injustice can be said to have been done if a party is,in effect, compelled to accept one of these well-recognised systems applicable in the appropriate forum overseas. In this, I recognisethat we appear to be differing from the approach presently prevailing in the United States: see, e.g., the recent opinion of JudgeKeenan in Re Union Carbide Corp.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20634%20FSupp%20842" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 634 F.Supp. 842</a> in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, where a stay of proceedings in New York, commenced on behalf of Indianplaintiffs against Union Carbide arising out of the tragic disaster in Bhopal, was stayed subject to, inter alia, the condition thatUnion Carbide was subject to discovery under the model of the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure after appropriate demandby the plaintiff. But in the <i>Trendtex</i> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 679</a>, this House thought it right that a stay of proceedings in this country should be granted where the appropriate forum was Switzerland,even though the plaintiffs were thereby deprived of the advantage of the more extensive English procedure of discovery of documentsin a case of fraud. Then take the scale on which damages are awarded. Suppose that two parties have been involved in a road accidentin a foreign country, where both were resident, and where damages are awarded on a scale substantially lower than those awarded inthis country. I do not think that an English court would, in ordinary circumstances, hesitate to stay proceedings brought by oneof them against the other in this country merely because he would be deprived of a higher award of damages here.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">But the underlying principle requires that regard must be had to the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice; <i>and these considerations may lead to a different conclusion in other cases.</i>â  (emphasis added)</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p89" class="para" id="p89">89.</a> </b> In my view, Lord Goffâs above observation deals more with the proposition as to whether the deprivation of a juridical advantagewould invariably lead to the denial of substantial justice.  His Lordship came to the view that it is not necessary the case.  Hethen cited the examples of the differences between the discovery procedures and the different levels of recoverable damages in twodifferent jurisdictions to say that, the deprivation of such âjuridical advantagesâ <i>generally</i> would not lead to the denial of substantial justice to the party who seeks to rely on a more extensive discovery procedure or higherlevel of damages available in the local jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p90" class="para" id="p90">90.</a> </b> However, I do not think Lord Goff waslaying down a generally applicable principle or proposition that, in <i>every forum non conveniens</i> case, the deprivation of a more extensive discovery procedure, or a higher level of recovery damages in the local jurisdiction, wouldnot constitute a âlegitimate personal or juridical advantageâ and would never lead to the conclusion that the plaintiff wouldnot be able to obtain substantial justice in the other forum.  Each case must be decided on its own circumstances.  That is why,after setting out his general observations, Lord Goff emphasized at 483D that <i>ââ¦these considerations may lead to a different conclusion in other cases</i>â.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p91" class="para" id="p91">91.</a> </b> I therefore do not accept that there is any established legal proposition that differences in the discovery procedures or levelsof damages in two different jurisdictions can never amount to a juridical advantages or would never constitute a valid considerationto refuse to stay the proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  Each case must be looked at individually with reference to its own nature and circumstances. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p92" class="para" id="p92">92.</a> </b> Thus, in <i>Beecham Group PLC v Norton Healthcare Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20FSR%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] FSR 81</a>, 99, a case where the plaintiffs claimed against the defendant for breach of confidence, Jacobs J in granting leave to the plaintiffto serve outside jurisdiction under O. 11, accepted that the more extensive discovery and interrogatories provided by the Englishprocedure, together with other factors, constituted legitimate juridical advantages, and militated âin favour of the United Kingdombeing a <i>forum conveniens</i> for the trial of breach of confidenceâ against the foreign corporate defendant in Slovenia.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p93" class="para" id="p93">93.</a> </b> In relation to Mr Peâs second point, with the expert evidence now placed before the Court, and for the following reasons, I amsatisfied that there are significant differences between the discovery procedures in Hong Kong and the evidence gathering proceduresin the Mainland.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p94" class="para" id="p94">94.</a> </b> As rightly pointed out by Mr Poon, in order to invoke the various articles under the PRC procedure law as suggested by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantsâ expert, it is necessary for the Plaintiffs to be able to first demonstrate to the Shenzhen Court (a) the existenceof those documents, and (b) that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants are in possession of them. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p95" class="para" id="p95">95.</a> </b> However, without the automatic and compulsory Hong Kong discovery and interrogatories to provide the initial âpaper trailâ, especiallyfor documents which are detrimental or unfavourable to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendantsâ own case, it is very difficult (if not impracticable) for the Plaintiffs to identify the existence of these furtherdocuments, so as to invoke those articles under the PRC procedure law.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p96" class="para" id="p96">96.</a> </b> This is particularly so in the present case, which is primarily premised on the Defendantsâ breach of confidence and wrongful useof the Confidential Information.  For cases like this, most of the relevant evidence concerning the breach, the wrongful use andthe extent of the said use of the Confidential Information, is likely to be only within the Defendantsâ own knowledge and possession.  Therefore, without the initial paper trails and information that would have been created by the compulsory and comprehensive discoveryand interrogatories procedures, it would be even more difficult for the Plaintiffs to satisfy the preconditions under the PRC procedurelaw to invoke the relevant articles to invite the Shenzhen Court to demand the disclosure of unfavourable evidence and documentsfrom the Defendants.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p97" class="para" id="p97">97.</a> </b> I therefore accept that there is an appreciable and significant difference between the two discovery procedures in Hong Kong andthe Mainland.

However,Mr Liu is of the opinion that given the criminal prosecution that may be commenced against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the PRC, and if the prosecution is successful, the Plaintiffs would then be entitled to commence what is described asthe âancillary civil actionâ against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to claim for further damages.  He further opines that in similar ancillary civil actions, the PRC courts have awarded damagesexceeding RMB100 million.  In light of this part of the unchallenged evidence, Mr Pe for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants submits that there could be no ârealâ deprivation of the alleged juridical advantage in damages as suggested by thePlaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a> </b> In relation to the âancillary civil actionâ, the unchallenged evidence of the Plaintiffsâ experts however shows that this procedureis entirely dependent upon the successful criminal prosecution of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, which is beyond the Plaintiffsâ own control.  The procedure is also not well suited to more complex litigation.  Further,Mr Poon submits that, without the discovery procedure and tracing remedy provided under common law, any claim for damages in suchan âancillary civilâ action is also unlikely to be fruitful due to the lack of means on the plaintiffsâ part to prove the Defendantsâillegal gains under the relevant PRC law.  As such, Mr Poon further says the Plaintiffs do stand the loss of a realistic juridicaladvantage in having a lower level of recoverable damages if the action is to be tried in the Shenzhen Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a> </b> I accept Mr Poonâs submissions.   Coupled with the absence of the compulsory and comprehensive discovery procedure and the tracingremedy under PRC law, I am satisfied that the âancillary civil actionâ available to the Plaintiffs is unlikely to be effectiveto enable them to recover substantial damages in the Shenzhen Court.   </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a> </b> In the circumstance, I am prepared accept to that the Plaintiffs would practically suffer a juridical disadvantage in the form ofa lower level of recoverable damages if this action is stayed for the Shenzhen Court.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Injunction</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a> </b> It is not disputed that under PRC law, there is no relief in the form of a mandatory injunction to require the Defendants to disclosetheir infringing use.  Mr Poon at paragraph 55 of his skeleton says the Plaintiffs have asked for such a relief in the present claim.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a> </b> At first blush, I have hesitation as to whether the Plaintiffs have asked for such an order under their pleaded prayers for injunctiverelief, which are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">âAND the Plaintiffs claim against the Defendants for:-</p>        <blockquote>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:justify">(1)           â¦ An Order restraining the Defendants and each of them whether by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwisehowsoever from using the Confidential Information of the Plaintiffs, including in particular the documents set out in Schedules 1to 7 theretoâ¦</p>            <p class="quote" style="text-align:justify">(2)           â¦delivery up of all documents and materials which are in the possession, power, custody or control of any of the Defendants,their agents or servants the use or disclosure of which would offend the order made in (1) aboveâ</p>        </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a> </b> However, on a closer reading of the pleaded prayers as a whole, I accept that they could include an order of such a nature. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p107" class="para" id="p107">107.</a> </b> In the circumstances, the existence of this form of the mandatory injunction in this jurisdiction is clearly a juridical advantagefor the Plaintiffs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p108" class="para" id="p108">108.</a> </b> In relation to the relief of restraining the Defendants from continuing and repeating the wrongful acts using the Confidential Information,the evidence shows that the Shenzhen Court can order âcessation of infringementâ, which includes the prohibition of disclosureof the Plaintiffsâ trade secrets.  However, it is pointed out by the Plaintiffsâ experts, which is not challenged by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, that the enforcement of such an order has to be achieved by the ordinary process of civil execution, and this <i>can</i> be a lengthy process.  </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p109" class="para" id="p109">109.</a> </b> As such, Mr Poon for the Plaintiff submits that, the existence of a more expedient way of enforcing a prohibitory injunction underHong Kong law<a>[3]</a> again amounts to a juridical advantage for the Plaintiffs, if the action is to be tried in Hong Kong. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p110" class="para" id="p110">110.</a> </b> I do not accept Mr Poonâs submissions.  Albeit it may have to take longer for the Plaintiffs to enforce a prohibitory form of injunctiverelief in Shenzhen or the Mainland, the fact is that they <i>can</i> obtain such a relief.  There is no evidence before me to show what is the likely length of time to enforce such an order by way ofcivil execution.  As such, the mere fact that such an execution process <i>can</i> be lengthier than that in Hong Kong does not satisfy me that this Hong Kong procedure therefore constitutes a juridical advantagefor the Plaintiffs under the purview of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.   I repeat Lord Goffâs observations in <i>Spiliada</i> quoted at paragraph 88 above.</p>    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion under Stage II</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p111" class="para" id="p111">111.</a> </b> Under stage II, I therefore conclude that the Plaintiffs would potentially be deprived of the following juridical advantages, ifthe case is to be stayed for the Shenzhen Court:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(1) </b> A more comprehensive and extensive compulsory discovery procedure and the right to administer interrogatories.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(2) </b> A likely higher level of recoverable damages.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(3) </b> The remedy and relief of (a) constructive trusteeship, (b) tracing, (c) exemplary damages, and (c) mandatory injunction requiringthe Defendants to disclose infringing use.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(4) </b> Indemnity costs to be awarded.</p>    </blockquote>    <p>Stage III</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p112" class="para" id="p112">112.</a> </b> The Plaintiffsâ claim is premised primarily on the breach of confidence, and the wrongful use of the Confidential Information bythe Defendants to their benefit, and to the detriment of the Plaintiffs.  In such a claim, as rightly submitted by Mr Poon, substantialportions the evidence which is relevant to the alleged wrongful infringing conducts on the parts of the Defendants, and the extentof the use of the Confidential Information, is likely to be only within the Defendantsâ own knowledge and possession. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p113" class="para" id="p113">113.</a> </b> In the circumstances, I accept that the deprivation of the compulsory and comprehensive discovery and the procedure for the administrationof interrogatories would constitute a prejudice to the Plaintiffs in obtaining relevant evidence to advance their claim.  I thereforefurther accept that the lack of these procedures under the PRC legal system would result in real risk that the Plaintiffs may notbe able to obtain substantial justice if the matter is to be tried in the Shenzhen Court instead of here.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p114" class="para" id="p114">114.</a> </b> Similarly, given the nature of the Plaintiffsâ claim, and given that the volume of the subject business turnovers for both partiesare substantial, it is essential to the Plaintiffs to be granted remedies that would (a) adequately compensate their loss (if found)by way of damages (including exemplary damages) or an account of profit, and (b) effectively prevent the Defendants from continuingthe breaches or wrongful use of the Confidential Information.  In the premises, I also accept that the absence of the relief andremedy in constructive trusteeship, tracing, mandatory injunction and a higher level of damages, collectively looked at, would resultin the risk that Plaintiffs would not be able to obtain substantial justice if the case is to be tried in the Shenzhen Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p115" class="para" id="p115">115.</a> </b> The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants however submit that, as observed by Lord Goff in <i>Spiliada</i> (as quoted in paragraph 88 above), the different level of damages within the two different jurisdictions should seldom lead to theconclusion that substantial justice would not be obtained in the foreign forum.  It therefore should not be a ground to refuse astay. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p116" class="para" id="p116">116.</a> </b> I do not accept this submission:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(1) </b> As I concluded at paragraphs 90 and 91 above, Lord Goffâs speech should not be read as laying down a general proposition that theabsence of a higher level of damages in the foreign forum would never amount to a good ground to refuse stay for <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  This should be decided on a case by case basis. </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(2) </b> As a matter of fact, in <i>The</i> <i>Adhiguna Meranti</i>, the Court of Appeal refused to stay the proceedings for the Indonesian courts, as it was of the view that in the circumstances ofthat case, it would be unjust to deprive the plaintiff a higher level of recoverable damages that they could obtain in Hong Kong.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(3) </b> For the reasons already set out above and with reference to the nature and the circumstances of the present claim, I am satisfiedthat the potential deprivation of a higher level of recoverable damages in Hong Kong constitutes one of the factors in the balancingexercise to suggest that substantial justice may not be obtained by the Plaintiffs if the matter is to be tried in the other forum.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p117" class="para" id="p117">117.</a> </b> The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants also submit that, in performing the balancing exercise to decide whether the Court should refuse to stay for <i>forum non conveniens</i>, the Court should take into account of (a) the various civil proceedings that had been commenced by the Plaintiffs in Shenzhen, and(b) the criminal proceedings prompted by the Plaintiffs against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in Shenzhen.   This is because (as submitted by Mr Pe) in issuing and triggering these proceedings in Shenzhen, the Plaintiffsmust have regarded that they would be able to obtain substantial justice in that jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p118" class="para" id="p118">118.</a> </b> However, even taking these various Shenzhen proceedings into account, I do not think it would in any material way affect my aboveconclusions that it would be unjust to deprive the Plaintiffsâ those Hong Kong juridical advantages if the proceedings are stayedfor the Shenzhen Court.  My reasons are as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(1) </b> As fairly accepted by Mr Pe, he is not suggesting that, by reasons of these various proceedings commenced in Shenzhen, it can besaid that the Plaintiffs are forum shopping.  As such, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants fail to discharge what was described in <i>The Adhiguna Meranti</i> as the ultimate burden of proof that the Plaintiffsâ choice of <i>this</i> forum is so inappropriate as to deserve the pejorative description of âforum shoppingâ and to be retrained accordingly.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(2) </b> As set out in paragraph 31(3) above, it is established that the mere fact that there are concurrent proceedings in the alternativeforum alone is <i>generally not</i> a relevant factor to be considered for an application to stay on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  In my view, this is particularly so in the present case since, as of now, there are no similar civil proceedings pending in theMainland or Shenzhen.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify"><b>(3) </b> Insofar as the criminal proceedings are concerned, I do not think they are relevant to the present consideration as well, since thePlaintiffs are fully entitled to make their complaints to the relevant authorities in Shenzhen if it is suspected that certain criminaloffences under the PRC criminal codes have been committed.  This can hardly be a reason to support the restraint of the Plaintiffsfrom proceeding with their civil claim in Hong Kong, which was issued as of right.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p119" class="para" id="p119">119.</a> </b> In the premises, under stage III, I conclude that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants have failed to show that, notwithstanding the deprivation of the above juridical advantages, substantial justice wouldstill be done for the interests of the parties if the case is to be tried in the Shenzhen Court.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b><u>V.      Conclusion</u></b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p120" class="para" id="p120">120.</a> </b> For the reasons set out above, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants have failed to show that the Shenzhen Court is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum than the Hong Kong Courtto try the present case more suitably for the interests of the parties and for the ends of justice.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p121" class="para" id="p121">121.</a> </b> I therefore dismiss the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants summons for a stay or dismissal of the present proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><b><a name="p122" class="para" id="p122">122.</a> </b> I further make an order <i>nisi</i> that costs of this application be to the Plaintiffs, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for two counsel.
