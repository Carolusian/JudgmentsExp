Able Force now applies for discovery by East Sun of the CCTV recording of the warehouse for thepurpose of identifying or proving the identity of the wrongdoer(s) in the suspected theft.  This is an application for discoveryagainst a non-party to an intended civil suit or what is known as a <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Background</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  Briefly, Able Force was at the material times and is a freight-forwarder.  Pursuant to a shipping instruction, Able Force has collected140 cartons of mobile phones and parts from the supplier and stored them in its warehouse at East Sun Industrial Centre in Kwun Tong,Kowloon.  As mentioned above, the industrial building was managed by East Sun.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Lam and Wu were then the 2 employees of Able Force responsible for retrieving the goods from the warehouse for onward shipment byair.  The goods were shipped.  But on 16 March 2009, Able Force received a complaint from its customer about the missing of 800 mobilephones from 4 of the cartons arrived at the destination.  Able Force was made to compensate for the loss.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Able Force reported the matter to the police in Hong Kong.  After viewing the CCTV tape recording at East Sunâs office, the officerof Able Force suspected Lam and Wu of being responsible for the missing mobile phones when they handled the goods at the warehouseon 14 March 2009.  Able Force dismissed them.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 23 March 2009, the solicitors for Able Force wrote to East Sun requesting for the CCTV tape recording to be preserved.  EastSun was also informed of the report of the matter to the police.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  On 4 May 2009, the solicitors for Able Force requested East Sun to supply a copy of the tape(s) to them.  East Sun replied thatthe tape(s) has been given to the Police for their investigation in April 2009.  Easy Sun suggested Able Force to contact the policedirectly.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On 19 October 2009, the police informed Able Force of the result of their investigation.  The police concluded that there was insufficientevidence to initiate any criminal proceedings against any person.  All evidence would be returned to the provider, i.e., Easy Sun.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 4 November 2009, the solicitors for Able Force wrote to the police and Easy Sun suggesting the police to release the CCTV tape(s)if Easy Sun did not object.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 13 November 2009, Easy Sun informed the solicitors for Able Force that Easy Sun reserved its position in respect of Able Forceâsabove request.  Easy Sun indicated its intention to consult lawyers.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Later in November 2009, the police informed the solicitors for Able Force that the tape(s) would be returned to Easy Sun upon thelatterâs request.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The solicitors for Able Force repeated their written requests to Easy Sun for the CCTV tape(s).  This was met with Easy Sunâsrefusal.  By letters dated 9 and 15 December 2009 respectively, the solicitors for Able Force reiterated that the tape(s) containmaterial evidence helpful in its civil claim against those responsible for the theft and requested copy of the tape recording.  AbleForce also undertook to pay the reasonable cost of that.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  Hearing nothing further from Easy Sun, Able Force took out the present originating proceedings seeking discovery of the CCTV tape(s)that recorded the loading of cargo between 19:00 and 21:30 on 14 March 2009 in the loading area of the car park and the alley ofas well as the nearby area outside the industrial building.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Principles</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  The principles governing a <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> discovery have been summarised in <i>A Co v B Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%203%20HKLRD%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 3 HKLRD 111</a> at paras.10-13.

Specifically:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) The recording comes within the definition of personal data under section 2 of the Ordinance.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) Being a data user, Easy Sun is required to observe the data protection principles pursuant to section 3 and Schedule 1 of theOrdinance.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(3) Data Protection Principle 3 requires Easy Sun to ensure that the personal data should not be used, without the consent of thedata subject, for any purpose other than for the purpose for which the data were to be used at the time of the collection of thedata or a purpose directly related to that purpose.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(4) Data Protection Principle 4 requires Easy Sun to take all practical steps to ensure that personal data are protected against unauthorisedor accidental access, processing, erasure or other use.</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(5) As the tape(s) may have recorded not only the movement of the third party that Able Force intends to sue but also other individualswho happened to be captured, Easy Sun is concerned that it would invade the privacy of others if it shows these images to Able Forceor allows Able Force to make copies of such images.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The solicitors for Easy Sun affirmed that subject to the above concern, Easy Sun had no objection to the production of the CCTVtape(s), if the court so orders and upon Able Forceâs payment of the expenses reasonably incurred in the copy, production and deliveryof the tape(s).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  In his submissions, Mr Chen for Easy Sun reiterated his clientâs stance that it would not oppose to an order for the productionof the CCTV tape(s) as long as Able Force undertakes to pay the necessary charges for such production.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  The real issue is whether Able Force is entitled to seek costs of these proceedings against Easy Sun in the event of an order forproduction being made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  The general rule as to costs in similar proceedings is not in dispute.  A <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> action is not ordinarily adversarial proceedings between the applying party and the party being ordered to make discovery.  Thisis because the latter is basically an innocent party being caught up in the matter out of no fault on its own.  The fact that thecourt makes an order does not render the disclosing party an unsuccessful party or a party at fault.  Normally the applying partyshall pay its costs of the proceedings and the costs of the disclosing party.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr Chen referred to <i>Totalise plc v Motley Fool Ltd and Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%203%20All%20ER%20872" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2003] 3 All ER 872</a> where the English Court of Appeal accepted that there might be cases where the circumstances would require a different costs order. But they would <i>not</i> include cases where: (a) the party required to make the disclosure had a genuine doubt that the person seeking the disclosure wasentitled to it; (b) the party was under an appropriate legal obligation not to reveal the information or where the legal positionwas unclear or the party had reasonable doubt as to the obligations; (c) the party could be subject to proceedings if disclosurewas voluntary; or (d) the party would or might suffer damage by voluntary giving the disclosure; or (e) the disclosure would or mightinfringe a legitimate interest of another.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Mr Chen submitted that his clientâs case falls within class (b), (c), (d) and/or (e) mentioned by the court in the case of <i>Totalise</i>.  This, he submitted, is just one of the normal cases where the applying party should bear the costs of the application as well asthe disclosing partyâs costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Miss Leung for Able Force disagreed.  She submitted that the concern of East Sun mentioned above is not justified because the lawin this regard has become clear since the case of <i>Lily Tse Lai Yin &amp; Ors v The Incorporated Owners of Albert House and Ors</i>, HCPI 828/1997 (10 December 1998).  After the commencement of these proceedings, Miss Leungâs firm has by letter drawn the attentionof the solicitors for Easy Sun to the <i>Lily Tse</i> case.  She submitted that that Easy Sun has been unreasonable and this takes the present case out of the norm.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  On this basis, except for the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Easy Sun in complying with the order for discovery, whichAble Force has always been ready to pay, Able Force asks for costs of these proceedings against Easy Sun.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Discussion</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  As to the concern about the production of the CCTV tape, I agree that the courtâs decision in the case of <i>Lily Tse</i> on the construction of the relevant provisions of the Ordinance provides the answer:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(1) Pursuant to section 58(2) of the Ordinance, personal data are exempted from the provisions of Data Protection Principle 3 wherethe data is used for the purposes of the prevention, preclusion or remedying (including punishment) of unlawful or seriously improperconduct, or dishonesty or malpractice, whether or not the data are held for any of those purposes (see paras.14-15).</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify">(2) Bringing of a civil claim for damages in tort amounts to the remedying of unlawful or seriously improper conduct.  Alternatively,it is for a purpose directly related to the initial purpose for which the data were originally taken (see paras.16-18).</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  Apparently, the purpose of installing the CCTV system and the collection of data in the form of the recording in the present casewas for the purposes, or directly related to the purposes, stipulated under the section 58 exemption.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Able Forceâs attempt to obtain the CCTV tape from Easy Sun with court intervention is understandable.  Having said that, I donot think that Easy Sun is therefore to blame for not acceding to Able Forceâs request without a court order.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  The starting point is that Easy Sun, being an innocent and non-party to the intended lawsuit, owes no obligation to Able Force totake the slightest risk in view of its concern and to save Able Force from having to obtain an order of the court.  It is for theapplying party to satisfy the court that the order should be made, not for the disclosing party to take a view that could be wrong:see <i>Totalise plc</i> at 878g.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The solicitors for Easy Sun came on record after the commencement of these proceedings.  By way of affirmation, Easy Sunâs solicitorsexplained why their client has refused to accede to Able Forceâs request.  At the same time, they indicated their clientâs intentionnot to oppose to the order for discovery so long as Able Force pays the costs and reasonable expenses incurred by Easy Sun to complywith the order to be made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Mr Chen explained in court that had the application proceeded on the above basis, Easy Sun would not have made any representation. But this is not how Able Force has been proceeding with the application.  By the originating summons, Able Force asks for costsof the application against Easy Sun.  Notwithstanding the stance in respect of the order for discovery explained in the above affirmationof Easy Sunâs solicitors, the solicitors for Able Force by letter dated 17 March 2010 categorised Easy Sunâs stance as one ofunreasonable objection to its clientâs request.  Therefore, if the court follows the case of <i>Lily Tse</i> and grants the order, Able Force held Easy Sun to be responsible for the costs of this application under the principle of costs followingthe event.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  In other words, due to the alleged unreasonableness of Easy Sun, Able Force would not only ask for an order that Easy Sun shouldbear its own costs but it should also bear Able Forceâs costs of these proceedings.  This, Mr Chen submitted, must be opposed.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In the case of <i>Cinepoly Records Co Ltd</i> (above), in opposition to the application for <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> order, one of the defendants also raised its concern about the data protection principles under the Ordinance.  The plaintiff criticisedthat defendant for descending into an adversarial arena in resisting the application.  It therefore refused to pay that defendantâscosts of the application.  The court however held that by asking the court to address its concern and to hear its arguments, thedefendant acted understandably and legitimately.  The defendant should not be penalised on costs.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The same court heard the case of <i>Chang Wa Shan</i> (above).  In that case, the court considered that the reasons advanced on behalf of the defendant in his solicitorsâ affidavitand counselâs submissions in opposition to the application were plainly untenable against the facts of that case.  That renderedthe defendantâs opposition at a certain stage after the commencement of proceedings unreasonable.  Therefore the defendantâscosts since that stage were disallowed and had to be borne by himself.  There was no contention that the defendant should in thosecircumstances be further ordered to bear the costs of the plaintiff since that stage of the proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  In the present case, Easy Sun is not opposed to the order for discovery as such found in the two cases cited in the preceding paragraphs. It really is opposed to the costs order sought by Able Force against it.  As discussed above, I see nothing unreasonable about EasySun in not acceding to Able Forceâs request without an order of the court.  In view of the stance of Easy Sun since the commencementof these proceedings, I am of the view that it was Able Forceâs application for the adverse costs order against Easy Sun that necessitatedthe real argument between the parties.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  I see no basis for departing from the norm that the applying party shall bear the disclosing partyâs costs of the applicationfor such an order.  Having successfully resisted Able Forceâs application for costs against it, Easy Sun shall have its costs ofthis application.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading"><b>Order</b></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  I order that Easy Sun do disclose the CCTV tape(s) as described in the schedule to the originating summons (and above).</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Able Force shall pay Easy Sunâs costs of these proceedings, including any costs reserved, with certificate for counsel.  AbleForce shall further pay Easy Sunâs costs of complying with this order and reimburse Easy Sun for the reasonable expenses for complyingwith the order.
