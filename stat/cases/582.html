Introduction</i></p>    <p><a name="p1" class="para" id="p1">1.</a>  In 2005, Mr Cheung (the Plaintiff) was employed by Sun Hing Organization Plastic Management Ltd (âSun Hingâ), the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, as the support services supervisor of its Mainland factory [å» æ¿å¾å¤ä¸»ç®¡]. </p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On 18 March 2005, Mr Cheung was kicked and punched by his colleague, one Mr Zhou (âMr Zhouâ) at his office in the factory. Mr Cheung suffered certain physical injuries as a result of the assault.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  By this action, Mr Cheung claims against Sun Hing for damages for the personal injuries he has so suffered.  The claims are premisedon the bases of (a) Sun Hingâs negligence and/or (b) its vicarious liability for Mr Zhouâs assault. The damages claimed (afterdeducting the payment received under employeesâ compensation) is HK$1,881,050.44.</p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Sun Hing disputes both liability and quantum.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>B. The background</i></p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  Unless otherwise stated, the uncontroversial background facts leading to this claim are as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  Sun Hing is a Hong Kong company carrying on the businesses of trading and manufacturing of Christmas decorations.  It maintainsan office in Hong Kong and two factories in Shenzhen, the Mainland. The Hong Kong office is mainly responsible for trading businessand the  productions lines are situated at the Shenzhen factories.  For convenience, the two factories are respectively called âtheold factoryâ and âthe new factoryâ.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  In March 2004, Mr Cheung was initially employed by Sun Hing under the title of Administrative Manager of the old factory for a probationperiod of 3 months.  The salary was HK$16,000.00.</p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  At the end of the probation period, Mr Cheung signed a contract (âthe Contractâ) with Sun Hing dated 15 June 2004. The Contractprovided that Mr Cheung had formally become a staff of Sun Hing with a monthly salary of HK$8,000.00.  The duration of the Contractwas one year.  He was then repositioned to the Hong Kong office.   No job title was provided under the Contract.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  It is Mr Cheungâs case that notwithstanding the stated monthly salary of HK$8,000.00, when he signed the Contract, he was <i>promised</i> by Mr Ip Fung Chun (âMr Ipâ), a director of Sun Hing, that he would also be paid an annual bonus in the region of HK$200,000.00to HK$300,000.00. </p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  Mr Ip denies that there was any such promise. </p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  In August 2004, Mr Cheung was transferred to the old factory again as the support services supervisor.  The areas under his supervisionincluded the operations of the staff canteen, the factoryâs security, the staff dormitory, factory scrap materials refuse collectionand recycling.</p>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  In September 2004, Sun Hingâs management approved Mr Cheungâs suggestion to recruit an assistant to assist him in his duties. Mr Cheung himself carried out the recruitment exercise in Shenzhen. At the end, he decided to recruit Mr Zhou as his assistant.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  However, apparently since late 2004, the work relationship between Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou had turned difficult and not harmonious.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In light of this, Mr Cheung in his regular weekly meetings with Sun Hingâs management had repeatedly suggested to dismiss Mr Zhoufor what Mr Cheung described as his poor performances.  These suggestions were rejected by the management on the basis that therewas insufficient evidence to support the allegations of poor performances. </p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  One of the causes of the rift between them Mr Cheungâs disapproval of Mr Zhou was the fact that Mr Zhou had developed a relationshipwith a female worker at the old factory known as Ms Li.   Ms Li lived at the factoryâs dormitory.  In Mr Cheungâs view, it wasinappropriate and incorrect for Mr Zhou to develop a relationship with Ms Li as, according to Mr Cheungâs own understanding, MrZhou was already married.  Mr Cheung was also unhappy that Mr Zhou had âcheatedâ him by stating in the job application form thathe was âunmarriedâ.  </p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  At the same time, Mr Zhou suspected that it was Mr Cheung who had been making various anonymous calls to Ms Li and Ms Liâs familymembers telling them that Ms Li should not be âcheatedâ by Mr Zhou, as Mr Zhou was already married. </p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Mr Zhou had quarrelled with Mr Cheung on this.  Mr Cheung denied having made those calls.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  Because of these conflicts between them, Mr Zhou had on various occasions threatened Mr Cheung that he would hit Mr Cheung. </p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  It is common ground that Mr Cheung had reported to Sun Hingâs management about Mr Zhouâs said threats of violence.</p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  On 11 March 2005, an incident occurred at the refuse collection station of the old factory.  Apparently, Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou wereinvolved in an argument as to whether certain scrap materials there should be collected for recycling purpose instead of being thrownaway as refuse.  Mr Cheung said they should be while Mr Zhou disagreed.  They therefore engaged in intense arguments.  Mr Cheungthen called for the attendance of one Mr Ngai Suk Ping (é­åå¹³) (âMr Ngaiâ) and one Mr Lin Chong Ip (é£åµæ¥­) (âMr Linâ)to determine the dispute.  Mr Ngai was then in charge of the statistics division of the factory, while Mr Lin was in charge of theproduction division.  At the end, both of them decided to ask another staff to collect those scrap materials back to the factoryfor recycling.  It is their evidence that although they both believed that those materials were no longer suitable for recycling,they still did so because they wanted to give face to Mr Cheung. </p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  I will refer to this incident in this Judgment the âRefuse Station Incidentâ.</p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  On the next day on 12 March 2005, at the weekly management staff meeting, Mr Cheung again reported Mr Zhouâs inappropriate relationshipwith Ms Li and that Mr Zhou was already married.  It is Mr Cheungâs case that at that time, Mr Zhou suddenly came to the meetingand threatened Mr Cheung with words to the effect that he could summon someone he knew in a police station to dump Mr Cheung intoa refuse station.</p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  On 14 March 2005, Mr Cheung caused a notice (âthe Noticeâ) to be issued in the name of Sun Hing and posted in the factory. TheNotice referred to the Refuse Station Incident, and announced the discharge of Mr Zhouâs duties as an assistant to the supportservices supervisor.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  On 15 March 2005, a general staff meeting was held at the factory.  This was attended by some 48 persons. They included, <i>inter alia</i>, Mr Ip, Mr Lau Pak Shan (åä¼¯ç) (âMr Lauâ) who is another director of Sun Hing, Mr Ngai, Mr Lin, Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou. For convenience, I would call this âthe 15 March Meetingâ.</p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  It was recorded in the minutes (âthe Minutesâ) of the 15 March Meeting that, <i>inter alia</i>, Mr Cheung reported on matters under his responsibilities.  He also reported other matters of which he was dissatisfied with Mr Zhouâsperformance.  These included (a) the Refuse Station Incident, and (b) the allegation that Mr Zhou was married but still inappropriatelydeveloping a relationship with a female colleague.  Mr Ip was recorded in the Minutes to have made various responses to these complaints. I will discuss these responses in detail later in this judgment when I deal with the issues. </p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  In the morning of 18 March 2005, Mr Cheung was then working in the office situated in the old factory.  Suddenly, Mr Zhou went intothe office and assaulted him.  There is no dispute that Mr Cheung was assaulted by Mr Zhou, but the parties disputed on the mannerof the assault, which I would also deal with below. </p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  Seeing this, Mr Lin immediately held Mr Zhou with his arms around Mr Zhouâs body and pulled Mr Zhou out of the office.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  After getting Mr Zhou out of the office, Mr Lin also called for the police.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  The police later came and investigated the incident.  Mr Cheung was also sent by ambulance to the emergency department of a hospitalin Shenzhen for treatment of his injuries. </p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Mr Zhou was however not prosecuted for the assault.  It is Sun Hingâs case that this is because Mr Cheung had settled this incidentwith Mr Zhou by accepting a RMB3,000.00 compensation offered by Mr Zhou.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  On 31 January 2008, Mr Cheung brought the present claim against Sun Hing as the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant <i>and</i> Mr Ip as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.  By way of a consent order dated 29 October 2008, the claim against Mr Ip was discontinued. </p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  The present claim therefore now only concerns Sun Hing.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>C.

It is further Mr Cheungâs case that because of the assault (âthe assaultâ)by Mr Zhou on 18 March 2005, he has sustained head injury, contusion on the chest well, post-concussion syndrome, adjustment disorderand post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  Mr Cheungâs claims are premised on three causes of action, namely (a) breach of employerâs duty, (b) breach of implied termsof the contract of employment, and (c) vicarious liability.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  The particulars of breach of the employerâs duty and breach of implied terms as pleaded are essentially the same and as follows:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Failing to heed towards Mr Cheung's complaints about Mr Zhou's violent threats towards Mr Cheung and to take all reasonable andnecessary steps to discipline or warn Mr Zhou;</p>        <p>(2) Failing to take any or any reasonable step and measure to protect Mr Cheung from violent attacks of Mr Zhou;</p>        <p>(3) Failing to take precautions for the safety of Mr Cheung;</p>        <p>(4) Exposing Mr Cheung to an unnecessary risk of injuries which it knew or ought to have known;</p>        <p>(5) Causing or permitting Mr Zhou to assault Mr Cheung;</p>        <p>(6) Condoning Mr Zhou's violent threats and mis-behaviour towards Mr Cheung at all material times;</p>        <p>(7) Failing to assess the risk of injuries by Mr Zhou towards Mr Cheung even though Mr Cheung had repeatedly requested Sun Hing andMr Ip to sack Mr Zhou; and</p>        <p>(8) Being in breach of the implied term of the contract of employment that Sun Hing would take all reasonable care and precautionsfor the safety of Mr Cheung in the course of his employment and not to expose Mr Cheung to any risk of injury.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  As the pleaded breaches of duties and the implied terms are essentially the same, for convenience, I would hereafter simply referthese parts of Mr Cheungâs case as breach of duties.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  In light of Sun Hingâs acceptance at trial that Mr Cheung had before the assault informed its management about Mr Zhouâs threatsof violence, the issue regarding the case on breach of duties therefore turns essentially on whether factually, Sun Hing had imposedreasonable measures to prevent the assault from happening. </p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  With regards to the question of vicarious liability, it is Mr Cheungâs case that the attack by Mr Zhou was closely connected withthe employment.  Thus, as a matter of law, it is fair and just to hold Sun Hing vicariously liable for the wrongful acts of Mr Zhou.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  In relation to liability, Sun Hingâs defences are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) In light of Mr Zhouâs threats of violence as reported by Mr Cheung, on 9 March 2005, its management imposed measures to separatetheir job responsibilities to reduce any further chance of work conflicts arising between them.  </p>        <p>(2) Further, and in any event, the assault was caused purely by Mr Cheungâs acts in making telephone calls to Ms Li and her familymembers.  These calls had nothing to do with Mr Cheungâs work responsibilities.   There was therefore no causation even if SunHing was in breach of its duties.</p>        <p>(3) For the same reasons, the assault was not closely connected with the employment.  Sun Hing should not be held vicariously liablefor Mr Zhouâs acts.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  Insofar as quantum is concerned, Sun Hing further disputes (a) the extent and degree of injuries that Mr Cheung is said to havebeen suffering, and (b) thus the quantum of damages claimed. </p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Given the above, the principal issues under liability at trial are:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Whether Sun Hing had imposed measures to prevent the assault from happening.</p>        <p>(2) If no:</p>        <p>(a) whether Sun Hing was in breach of the duties.</p>        <p>(b) if Sun Hing was in breach of the duties, whether there was causation between the breach and the assault.</p>        <p>(3) If yes, whether those measures amounted to reasonable measures to discharge Sun Hingâs duties.</p>        <p>(4) In any event, whether the assault was so closely connected to the employment and thus Sun Hing should be held vicariously liablefor Mr Zhouâs tortious acts.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  In relation to quantum, the issues are whether Mr Cheung has proved the various heads of quantum as claimed.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>D.

The meeting was attended by MrIp, Mr Lau, Mr Chan Wai Ming (the secretary of Mr Ip), Mr Cheung and Mr Zhang.  </p>        <p>(2) In light of the continuous complaints made by Mr Cheung on Mr Zhouâs poor performance and the threats of violence, Mr Ip decidedto separate their work duties to avoid any further conflicts between them. </p>        <p>(3) The separation of duties to be implemented was that:</p>        <p>(a) Mr Cheung would be responsible for overlooking (i) the canteen operations, (ii) the factory security, (iii) the provision of electricalworks, and (iv) the management of the dormitory  [1.é£å  (è³¼èãè¡çãç¨è³) 2.ä¿å®å·¥ä½3.é»å·¥å·¥ä½4.å®¿èç®¡çå·¥ä½];while</p>        <p>(b) Mr Zhouâs duties were (i) to overlook the refuse collection station, to prevent useful materials to be put there, (ii) to beresponsible for the sale of the factoryâs crap materials, (iii) to be responsible for the safety (including fire safety) of thefactoryâs manufacturing lines, and (iv) to assist Mr Ngai in dealing with part of the personnel management [1.ç£ç®¡å·¥å» åå¾æ¿ï¼é²æ­¢æç¨ç©åæ¾å¥åå¾æ¿å§2.è² è²¬å» å§å»¢åçé·å®(å¦ç´ç®ãå»¢éµãå¸ç¢ç­)3.è² è²¬è»éçç¢å®å¨ç®¡çï¼æ¶é²äºå  4.åå©é­åå¹³èçé¨ä»½äººäºå·¥ä½].</p>        <p>(4) It was also decided at the 7 March Meeting that Mr Lau was to carry out the detail implementation of the said separation of dutieson 9 March 2005.</p>        <p>(5) Pursuant to this decision, on 9 March 2005, Mr Lau went to the old factory to implement it.  He first discussed with Mr Lin andMr Ngai as to the detailed implementation of the said separation of duties.  After discussing with Mr Lin and Mr Ngai, Mr Lau thensummoned Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou to personally tell them clearly the separation of duties. Mr Lau also warned them that after thisseparation of duties, they should no longer make allegations against each other in relation to work, and if there were anything unclear,they should report to him directly.  Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou agreed and accepted the new arrangement.  </p>        <p>(6) It is Mr Ipâs evidence<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> that after this separation of duties, Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou no longer had any direct work relationship and Mr Zhou was no longera subordinate to Mr Cheung. </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p47" class="para" id="p47">47.</a>  On the other hand, it is Mr Cheungâs evidence that there was never any such decision or implementation of separation of dutiesbetween him and Mr Zhou.  Mr Zhang also gave evidence at trial that he had not heard of this separation of duties. </p>    <p class="heading"><i>E1.2  Discussion</i></p>    <p><a name="p48" class="para" id="p48">48.</a>  I find the evidence of Sun Hingâs witnesses that there was the implementation of separation of duties incredible and unreliable.  My reasons are as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  First, Sun Hingâs said evidence is contradictory and inconsistent with the objective and unchallenged evidence of the Refuse StationIncident and what were recorded in the Minutes of the 15 March Meeting:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Under the separation of duties, matters concerning the collection of refuse and recycling of materials were supposed to be underthe responsibilities of Mr Zhou <i>not</i> Mr Cheung.  Moreover, as Mr Ipâs evidence said, since the implementation of the separation of duties, Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou nolonger had any direct work relationship and Mr Zhou was no longer subordinate to Mr Cheung<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</p>        <p>(2) If there was indeed the implementation of this separation of duties, it is incredible that the Refuse Station Incident could havehappened.  This is so because Mr Cheung should no longer be involved in or concerned with matters relating to refuse collection andthe recycling of scrap materials.  </p>        <p>(3) Further, if Mr Cheung had sought to interfere with Mr Zhouâs exercise of his authority over this matter, Mr Ngai and Mr Lin(when called upon to resolve the incident) should have pointed out to Mr Cheung that the matter was no longer under his supervisionand he should not interfere with Mr Zhouâs work.   But the unchallenged evidence is that they both instead asked the other staffto purportedly collect the materials for recycling simply to give Mr Cheung face. </p>        <p>(4) Moreover, the implementation of separation of duties is also clearly inconsistent with what were recorded in the Minutes of the15 March Meeting in the following material aspects.</p>        <p>(5) As mentioned above, the minutes recorded that Mr Cheung again made complaints at the meeting about Mr Zhou about his work performanceand the Refuse Station Incident.  He also criticised Mr Zhou for developing a relationship with a female colleague when Mr Zhou wasstill married.  In so criticising, he still referred to Mr Zhou as his assistant.   These were all inconsistent with there beingthe separation of duties, but neither Mr Ip, Mr Lau nor even Mr Zhou challenged Mr Cheung in making these criticisms.</p>        <p>(6) Further, in response to these, Mr Ip was recorded to have said, in summary, that (a) it was not permissible for Mr Cheung to makepersonal attack on other people in the meeting as it was held to discuss matters relating to work, and (b) he would also not approveMr Cheungâs suggestion of firing Mr Zhou.  Mr Ip also said that if Mr Cheung could not properly âcontrolâ Mr Zhou, Mr Cheungcould report the same to the senior management, and the senior management could make rearrangement of work duties.  There was singularlyno reference whatsoever to the separation of duties alleged to have already been implemented about a week ago. </p>        <p>(7) These responses are entirely inconsistent with there being an implementation of the separation of duties.  It is incredible thatif there were in fact the separation duties: (a) Mr Ip would not have referred to it in response to Mr Cheungâs various complaintsabout Mr Zhouâs performance and the Refuse Station Incident, (b) Mr Ip would not have commented that Mr Cheung could not âcontrolâMr Zhou, as under the separation of duties, Mr Zhou was no longer Mr Cheungâs subordinate, and (c) Mr Ip also should not have saidthat the senior management could make rearrangement of work duties upon any further reports, as this had already been done underthe alleged arrangement for separation of duties.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  Secondly, the alleged implementation of the separation of duties is also inconsistent with the following documentary evidence:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) In the Notice of discharging duties of Mr Zhou, Mr Zhou was still referred to as âå¾å¤å©çâ.</p>        <p>(2) In the notice of reducing the salary of Mr Zhou issued by Sun Hing dated 17th March 2005 and bearing the company chop, Mr Zhouis referred to as âç¶çå©çâ.</p>        <p>(3) Sun Hing contends that these notices were issued by Mr Cheung without its prior knowledge or consent. But the evidence shows thatSun Hing had not challenged or criticised Mr Cheung after the issue of these notices.  Thus, even if Sun Hingâs allegation aboutthe lack of Sun Hingâs prior consent or notice to issue these notices was true, it was subsequently condoning them.  This is similarlyinconsistent with the existence of a separation of duties. </p>        <p>(4) In the report dated 14<sup>th</sup> March 2004 made by Mr Cheung reporting the Refuse Station Incident to the management, Mr Cheung still referred to Mr Zhou as hisassistant.</p>        <p>(5) In the Form 2 dated 16<sup>th</sup> May 2005, Sun Hing described how the accident happened at part D of the Form as follows: â 3æä»½18æ¥å¨å·¥ä½éç¨ä¸­åå°<u>ä¸å±¬å¡å·¥</u>è¥²æè´å·â.  This indicates that Mr Zhou was still regarded by Sun Hing as Mr Cheungâs subordinate even on the day of the assault.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  Thirdly, Sun Hingâs evidence in support of the implementation of the separation of duties also defies common sense, is illogicaland self-contradictory:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) As to the way in which Mr Lau conveyed the decision to Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou, Mr Lau was unable to give any logical explanationsunder cross-examination as to why it was necessary for him to (a) first tell Mr Lin and Mr Ngai about the decision of separationof duties, then (b) ask Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou to come to see Mr Lau so that he could tell them again, all on the same day. </p>        <p>(2) Mr Lau explained that he had to do it this way because he did not want to cause any embarrassment (which could only mean causingembarrassment to Mr Cheung, as this new arrangement was in fact elevating Mr Zhouâs work status).  In my view, this explanationis incredible since (according to Sun Hingâs own case) Mr Cheung was already aware of the decision at the 7 March Meeting.  Further,if any embarrassment was to be avoided, Mr Lau logically should not have asked Mr Cheung <i>and</i> Mr Zhou <i>to be present at the same time</i> to tell them the decision.</p>        <p>(3) Further, Mr Lauâs evidence on this is also inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Ngai and Mr Lin.   In their respective witnessstatement, Mr Ngai and Mr Lin both said that after they were told by Mr Lau about the separation of duties decision, they togetherimmediately went to tell Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou clearly about the decision.  It does not make any logical sense as to why, if theyhad already told Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou about the decision, Mr Lau had do it all over again.</p>        <p>(4) Moreover, it is Mr Linâs evidence that there were about 70 workers involved in the areas under Mr Cheungâs original supervisionas supervisor of support services.  The evidence however suggests that no measures had been taken to inform these workers about theseparation of duties. However, these workers should know who their supervisor was.  It therefore defies common sense that if therewere indeed the separation of duties between Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou as alleged, Sun Hing would not have not taken any measures toalso inform the workers about the new arrangement.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  Mr Szeto for Sun Hing submitted that Mr Cheung made an admission of the new arrangement of duties in the 15 March Meeting as recordedin the Minutes.  The part of the Minutes counsel relied on reads: âè² è²¬ç£ç®¡åå¾ç«çå¨æ¬åå©çé¢å°éäºæµªè²»ç¾è±¡ç¡åæ¼è¡·ï¼æç¶å ´å°±èªªå¨æ¬åâ<u>å«ä½ ç®¡ååå¾ç«é½ç®¡ä¸å¥½</u>âï¼å¨æ¬åå¾ä¸é«è<b>ã</b>â.  (underline provided)</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  As far as I can see, the above quotation does not show that Mr Cheung had admitted the new arrangement.  Objectively read, whatit meant was that Mr Cheung had asked Mr Zhou as his assistant to help looking after matters relating to the refuse station.  Thisis, to the contrary, inconsistent with there being the separation of duties as Mr Cheung still referred to Mr Zhou as his assistant.</p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  For the above reasons, I reject the evidence of Mr Ip, Mr Lau, Mr Lin and Mr Ngai that there was the decision and implementationof the separation of duties by Sun Hing.  I accept the evidence of Mr Cheung and Mr Zhang that there was never such decision. </p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  I therefore find that Sun Hing did not make any arrangements to separate the work duties between Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>E2.  Had Sun Hing taken any reasonable measures to prevent the assault from happening</i></p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  Given my finding above, and the common ground that Mr Cheung had informed Sun Hingâs management about Mr Zhouâs repeated threatsof violence, I further conclude and hold that Sun Hing had not taken any reasonable measures to prevent the assault from happening.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>E3.  Was Sun Hing negligent and in breach of its duties as an employer</i></p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  It follows from above that Sun Hing was negligent and in breach of its duties as employer (as pleaded<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>) in failing to take any reasonable measures to prevent the assault from happening.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>E4.  Was there causation between the assault and the breach/negligence</i></p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  Sun Hing contends that the assault was <i>solely</i> caused by Mr Cheung in making various calls to Mr Zhouâs family members, Ms Li and Ms Liâs family members.  These calls werein turn caused by Mr Cheung prying into Mr Zhouâs private life, which was not part of or related to Mr Cheungâs job duties. In the circumstances, the separation of duties, even if imposed, could not have prevented the assault.  There was therefore no causationbetween the assault and Sun Hingâs breach of duty or negligence.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  I am not persuaded by this argument.</p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The undisputed evidence clearly shows that before the assault, there had been much work conflict between Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou,which included the Refuse Station Incident and Mr Cheungâs repeated open attempts to cause (unsuccessfully) the dismissal of MrZhou.   Although I accept that making those calls could not said to be part of Mr Cheungâs job responsibilities or duties, thereis no evidence to show and prove (as suggested by Sun Hing) that the assault was <i>solely</i> caused by Mr Cheung in making those calls<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>. In my view, taking all the evidence as a whole, the making of those calls was only be part of the reasons (the other being the workconflicts) which have triggered Mr Zhou in assaulting Mr Cheung. </p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  I therefore hold that there was causation between the assault and Sun Hingâs negligence and/or breach of duties.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>E5.  Is Sun Hing vicariously liable for Mr Zhouâs wrongful acts</i></p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Given my above conclusion that Sun Hing is liable to Mr Cheung for negligence, I would only deal with this ground briefly.</p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The relevant legal principles applicable in determining an employerâs vicarious liability for the present purposes are as follows.</p>    <p><a name="p64" class="para" id="p64">64.</a>  Whether an employer should be held vicariously liable for an employeeâs tortious act is determined by the application of whatis called the âclose connection testâ.  The test involves the following:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) âClose connectionâ refers to a connection between the employeeâs unauthorised tortious act and <i>his</i> employment which is so close to make it fair and just to hold his employer vicariously liable.  It imposes vicarious liability when,but only when, it would be fair and just to do so:  <i>Ming An Insurance Co (HK) Ltd v Ritz-Carlton Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282002%29%205%20HKCFAR%20569" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2002) 5 HKCFAR 569</a> at para 19 <i>per</i> Bohkary PJ, adopting <i>Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2002%5d%201%20AC%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2002] 1 AC 215.</a></p>        <p>(2) The underlying idea of the test is that the injury done by the employee must involve a risk sufficiently <i>inherent in or characteristic of the employerâs business</i> that it is just to make the employer to bear the loss: <i>Ming An</i>, supra, para 35 <i>per</i> Litton NPJ, citing <u>Winfield &amp; Jolowicz on Tort</u> (16<sup>th</sup> ed) at para 20-9.</p>        <p>(3) The test however is not depended on whether the employeeâs tort involved mere inadvertence or intentional acts: <i>Ming An</i>, supra, at paras 20-25.</p>        <p>(4) However, the test must be applied in the context, turning on its own facts and the particular considerations which they arise.The criterion should not be treated as a statutory formula.   The application of the test to the facts of a particular case is amatter of degree.   It is necessary to stand back to see how the employerâs activities were actually carried out and how that exposedthe victim to the risk of tortious harm caused by the employee:  <i>Ming An</i>, supra, paras 25 and 27 <i>per</i> Bokhary PJ and para 34 <i>per</i> Litton NPJ.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p65" class="para" id="p65">65.</a>  Applying the close connection test to the present facts as set out in the background and found above, I am not satisfied that therisk of the assault can be said to be sufficiently inherent in or characteristic of Sun Hingâs business that it is just to makeSun Hing to bear the loss.  In other words, I do not find that Mr Zhouâs tortuous act in assaulting Mr Cheung  and Mr Zhouâsemployment was so closely connected that it is fair to make Sun Hing as an employer <i>vicariously</i> liable.</p>    <p><a name="p66" class="para" id="p66">66.</a>  I therefore would dismiss the claim on the basis of vicarious liability.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>F.  Quantum</i></p>    <p class="heading"><i>F1.  The manner of the assault</i></p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  Before dealing with the specific heads of quantum, it is necessary for me to first determine the manner and extent of the assault. As to this, Mr Cheung and Sun Hingâs witnesses give different accounts. They are as follows.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>F1.1  The  evidence</i></p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  It is Mr Cheungâs evidence that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) He was alone in the office when the assault was mounted on him by Mr Zhou.  Mr Lin and Mr Ngai were then outside the office inthe general area.  </p>        <p>(2) Mr Zhou first heavily punched him twice at his head. He then fell down on the floor.  Mr Zhou further hit him randomly with kicksand punches at his chest, back and head.  At this time, Mr Lin and Mr Ngai came in to rescue him.</p>        <p>(3) When Mr Zhou was pulled away by Mr Ngai, Mr Zhou further kicked him three times at his chest.</p>        <p>(4) Mr Zhou was well trained in martial art and thus Mr Zhouâs hits were very powerful.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  It is however Mr Linâs evidence that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) He was sitting in the same office opposite Mr Cheung when Mr Zhou rushed in to attack Mr Cheung.  He therefore witnessed whathappened. </p>        <p>(2) Mr Zhou suddenly came into the office and grabbed Mr Cheungâs hair.  Mr Zhou then slapped Mr Cheungâs face, asking Mr Cheungnot to disturb his family members by calling them anymore.  </p>        <p>(3) Seeing this, Mr Lin immediately went across to hold Mr Zhou from behind and tried to pull him out of the office.  Mr Ngai thenalso came in to try to separate Mr Cheung and Mr Zhou.  While being pulled out of the office, Mr Zhou managed to further kick MrCheungâs chest, although the kick was <i>not</i> a powerful one as Mr Zhou was already losing his balance.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  Mr Ngaiâs evidence is that he did not actually witness the assault at close range, as he was sitting outside the office when ithappened.  But to that extent, his evidence supports that of Mr Lin.</p>    <p><a name="p71" class="para" id="p71">71.</a>  The followings are also what I regard as relevant the common facts on the medical treatments Mr Cheung received in the first weekor so after the assault:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Right after the assault, Mr Cheung was sent by ambulance to the nearby Shenzhen Hospital for treatment.  He was discharged 2 dayslater (i.e., on 20 March 2005). </p>        <p>(2) Mr Cheung later came back to Hong Kong and was admitted to the A&amp;E Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital(âPYNEHâ) on 30 March 2005 for examinations and treatment.  He was discharged on 31 March 2005.</p>        <p>(3) According to the Admission slip of the Shenzhen Hospital, the preliminary diagnoses included cerebral concussion and multiplesoft tissue contusion.  His condition was stated to be serious (é).  In the discharge slip, his condition at the time of admissionwas stated to be urgent, and his condition upon discharge was ânot yet healedâ (<u>æªç</u>).</p>        <p>(4) The diagnosis stated in the report of the CT scan of the brain by the radiology department of PYNEH was post-concussion syndrome.</p>    </blockquote>    <p class="heading"><i>F1.2  Discussion</i></p>    <p><a name="p72" class="para" id="p72">72.</a>  Although I accept that Mr Lin was in the office<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a> together with Mr Cheung when the assault was mounted, I prefer the evidence of Mr Cheung to that of Mr Lin (and Mr Ngai) as to thedetails of the assault.  This is so because Mr Cheungâs account of the manner of the attack is more consistent with the objectmedical evidence of his injuries at the time of admission at the Shenzhen Hospital.  If Mr Linâs account were correct, which tendsto show that the assault was minor and light, it would be unlikely that Mr Cheungâs injuries at that time would be recorded asmultiple and serious.   Further, I also accept that Mr Zhou was trained in martial art, as this is not challenged at trial.</p>    <p><a name="p73" class="para" id="p73">73.</a>  I therefore find that the extent and manner of the assault were as those described by Mr Cheung.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>F2.    General observation of Mr Cheungâs evidence on quantum</i></p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  It is Mr Cheungâs case that he is still suffering from the following symptoms and disabilities after the assault:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Headache and dizziness;</p>        <p>(2) Continuous pain over his chest wall and coughing;</p>        <p>(3) The pain over his chest wall increases when the weather changes;</p>        <p>(4) He can no longer enjoy outdoor activities including playing basketball, ping pong and jogging;</p>        <p>(5) Suffering from palpitations, sensation of shortness of breath, poor appetite, weight loss, tinnitus, intolerance to noise, tiredness,displays of temper outbursts easily, decreased concentration and memory impairment;</p>        <p>(6) His personality has changed and he has become easily irritable;</p>        <p>(7) Depressed mood, sense of worthlessness and repeated suicidal thoughts;</p>        <p>(8) He has to consume analgesic, sleeping pills and psychiatric medicine every day to relieve his headache and chest pain;</p>        <p>(9) Fitful sleep with frequent nightmares; and</p>        <p>(10) His sex life with his wife is affected.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  After observing Mr Cheung giving evidence at trial, coupled with other aspects of the evidence, I find him to be a witness who isprepared to over exaggerate the evidence to embellish and bolster his case on the alleged disabilities that he is said to still besuffering. </p>    <p><a name="p76" class="para" id="p76">76.</a>  I will explain why.</p>    <p><a name="p77" class="para" id="p77">77.</a>  First, at the re-opening of the Defendantâs case in June 2011, it has been demonstrated to my satisfaction that Mr Cheung wasprepared to use tempered evidence to support his claim on quantum:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) The evidence concerned are (a) receipts dated 25, 27 December 2009 and 1 and 3 January 2010 issued by a Chinese bonesetter namedè¡åæ¶, and (b) receipts dated 22 and 28 December 2009 issued by an acupuncturist named ç§è.   </p>        <p>(2) Mr Cheung has submitted copies of these receipts to support part of his claims in the present proceedings.  In those receiptsissued by the bonesetter, they referred to and described Mr Cheungâs complaint as âèæ£â (old injury).  In the receipts issuedby the acupuncturist, they referred to the area of Mr Cheungâs complaint as âå·¦ä¸è¸â (left upper chest).   These receiptsare relied upon by Mr Cheung to show that by December 2009 and January 2010, he was still consulting a bonesetter and an acupuncturistto treat his pain over his left chest.  It is thus also Mr Cheungâs case that he was still suffering from left chest pain in January2010 as a result of the assault in March 2005.  He of course also seeks to recover the fees incurred in seeking these consultationsand treatments.</p>        <p>(3) However, after the close of the partiesâ case in the present proceedings in December 2010, Sun Hingâs solicitors discoveredin early 2011 that copies of these receipts were also similarly used by Mr Cheung in another proceedings (âthe 2010 PI Proceedingsâ)issued in 2010 to claim against another party for damages regarding an alleged separate injury to his left leg and chest in anotheralleged accident (âthe Other Accidentâ)<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.    However, when used in the 2010 PI Proceedings, the same bonesetterâs receipts referred to Mr Cheungâs complaint as âæå¤æå·è³éª¨â,while the same acupuncturistâs receipts referred to his complaint as âå·¦è³è¸â.</p>        <p>(4) After looking at the copies<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a> of these receipts used in the 2010 PI Proceedings and in the present proceedings, on balance I am satisfied that the original oneswere those used in the 2010 PI proceedings referring to the injuries alleged to have been suffered by Mr Cheung in the Other Accident.</p>        <p>(5) These copies were then tipex-ed to cover the references to these injuries and changed to refer to an âold injury â(in relationto the bonesetterâ receipts) and âleft upper chestâ (in relation to the acupuncturistâs receipts) and used in the presentproceedings.</p>        <p>(6) When presented with these challenges on the evidence of the receipts, Mr Cheung has however decided not to come forward to leadevidence to explain why these same receipts (subject to the above changes made) would be used differently in two different proceedingsmounted by him. In the circumstances, the court is entitled to, and does, draw adverse inference against Mr Cheung.  </p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p78" class="para" id="p78">78.</a>  Secondly, one of Mr Cheungâs pleaded complaints is that he is still suffering from continuous and disturbing coughing problemscaused by his chest injury.  However, he did not cough at all during the whole period of the lengthy cross-examination.  When thiswas pointed out to him by Sun Hingâs Counsel towards the end of cross-examination, he explained that it was because he had takenmedicine to suppress the coughs.  The explanation is not credible since he had however started to cough a lot after leaving the witnessbox and sitting in the public gallery throughout the rest of the trial.  If he were in fact suffering from coughing which could besuppressed by medicine, it is beyond me as to why he did not continue to take the medicine for the rest of the trial while he wassitting in the public gallery.  In my view, the above shows that Mr Cheung was prepared to concoct these pretended coughs to âpatchupâ the fact that he did not cough at all during cross-examination.</p>    <p><a name="p79" class="para" id="p79">79.</a>  Thirdly, Mr Cheung even emotionally pulled up his polo shirt while giving evidence in the witness box in order to show the courtthat the area of his left chest-wall where he was kicked was still reddened and inflamed.   This is clearly an exaggeration.  Notonly is this contrary to common sense that there was still redness of a contusion some 6 years after the attack, this is also inconsistentwith the medical records: (a) the report of the Chinese Medicine department of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals dated 15 August 2008stated that there was no obvious signs of injury over Mr Cheungâs left chest-wall; (b) none of the two joint expert reports recordany findings of remaining signs of the assault over Mr Cheungâs left chest wall. In my view, it is more likely than not that MrCheung has recently caused the redness over his left chest wall by means only known to himself to seek to show to this Court thathis injury was a serious and continuing one. </p>    <p><a name="p80" class="para" id="p80">80.</a>  Finally, both psychiatrists have expressed certain degree of reservations<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> on Mr Cheungâs own accounts of the problems he was still suffering from the assault.  Dr Woo (Sun Hingâs expert) commented thatMr Cheung had exaggerated his complaints, while Dr Chao (Mr Cheungâs own expert) accepted that it was likely that Mr Cheung perceivedhis injuries as more severe than they actually.   After seeing Mr Cheung giving evidence in Court coupled with the observations Ihave set out above, if necessary, I would accept Dr Wooâs observations that Mr Cheung had intentionally exaggerated his complaints.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>F3.

I come to this viewbecause:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Other than Mr Cheungâs own assertions, there is no medical evidence which suggests that he is or should reasonably still besuffering from any physical symptoms or disabilities, including the alleged coughs, arising from the assault<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>.</p>        <p>(2) Of my conclusion above that Mr Cheung has exaggerated the extent and degree of the injuries that he has suffered from the assault.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p83" class="para" id="p83">83.</a>  Insofar as this is concerned, it is fair to say that in his submissions on quantum, Mr Shum for Mr Cheung has predominantly focusedon the psychiatric conditions that Mr Cheung says to be suffering instead of the physical injuries.</p>    <p><a name="p84" class="para" id="p84">84.</a>  In relation to the psychiatric conditions, all the experts<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> on both sides agreed in essence that Mr Cheung is suffering from a mild form of post-concussion syndrome which resulted in some moodchanges.</p>    <p><a name="p85" class="para" id="p85">85.</a>  In the premises, on the basis of the medical evidence that I have read and bearing in mind Mr Cheungâs tendency to exaggeratehis problems,  I conclude and find that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p>(1) Mr Cheungâs <i>physical</i> injuries from the assault should have healed and recovered at the latest about 1 year after the assault (see paragraph 104 below).</p>        <p>(2) The assault has resulted in his suffering from a mild form of post-concussion syndrome with some degree of mood changes.</p>        <p>(3) As a result of the post-concussion syndrome, he is suffering from the psychiatric conditions as set out in paragraph 74(1), (4)to (10) above. But they are of a much lesser degree and severity than what Mr Cheung portraits them to be.</p>        <p>(4) He is not suffering from the physical conditions set out in paragraphs 74(2) and (3) above as a result of the assault.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p86" class="para" id="p86">86.</a>  Based on these conclusions, I now turn to consider Mr Cheungâs claim for damages under each specific head.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>F4.

First, I do not think these formed part of the monetary earning he is entitled to rely on for the purposeof calculating pre-trial loss of earning.  In any event, the estimates as to the monetary worth of these benefits are provided byMr Cheung himself. No objective bases have been provided to support these estimates. I do not find them to be reliable and wouldnot use them for the purpose of calculating the pre-trial loss of earning.</p>    <p><a name="p101" class="para" id="p101">101.</a>  I therefore find that Mr Cheungâs <i>basic</i> monthly salary was HK$8,000.00 at the time of the assault. </p>    <p><a name="p102" class="para" id="p102">102.</a>  However, for the average monthly earnings in the 12-month period prior to the assault, I accept that this should be HK$10,700.00which is supported by Sun Hingâs own salary record and the Form 2.  This is so because it included a double pay.</p>    <p><a name="p103" class="para" id="p103">103.</a>  Therefore, I will adopt and use HK$10,700.00 per month as Mr Cheungâs earning to calculate the pre-trial loss of earning.</p>    <p><a name="p104" class="para" id="p104">104.</a>  Insofar as the sick-leave period is concerned, I would accept the evidence of the joint expert report by Dr Woo and Dr Choa thatMr Cheung should be able to return to work a year after the assault.  I would therefore only allow 12 months as the sick-leave periodhe was entitled to.</p>    <p><a name="p105" class="para" id="p105">105.</a>  At the same time, I also accept the summary of the evidence set out in paragraph 90 above, and find that Mr Cheung should only beable to return to a lighter duty job as a result of the assault.  As there is no challenge to the suggested job of a security guardwith a monthly salary of HK$6,500.00, I would further adopt this as the basis to calculate the pre-trial loss of earning for theperiod between the expiry of entitled sick-leaves and the date of trial (which is 55 months).</p>    <p><a name="p106" class="para" id="p106">106.</a>  In the premises, the pre-trial loss of earning of Mr Cheung should be:  HK$10,700.00 x 12 months + (HK$10,700.00 â HK$6,500.00)x 55 months) = HK$128,400.00 + HK$231,000.00 = <b>HK$359,400.00</b>.</p>    <p class="heading"><i>F6.
