The assault happened on 11 April 2006while the Plaintiff was carrying out his work as a night-shift security guard on a construction site. The Plaintiff now sues WiseSecurity Ltd., his employer (the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant), and Ever Sunny Engineering Ltd., the occupier of the site (the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant), for damages.</p>    <p><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  On the Plaintiffâs pleadings, his claim is about HK$1.6M. The sum exceeds the jurisdictional limit of this Court. I thereforeraised this with Mr. Sakhrani, the Plaintiffâs counsel, at the beginning of the trial. Mr. Sakhrani confirms that in the eventthe Court found in favour of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff would waive any amount that is over and above the jurisdictional limitof this Court.</p>    <p><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  Other than the Plaintiffâs claim, there is, in this action, a Contribution/Indemnity Notice filed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. However, when addressing the Court in her closing submissions, Ms. Pinto, counsel for both Defendants, submits that thecases for the two Defendants actually stand or fall together. In the circumstances, Ms. Pinto asks for the Notice to be withdrawn.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Assault</b></p>    <p><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  The Plaintiff started working for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as a security guard at the end of October 2005. There was an occasion between 15 February and 31 March 2006 when the Plaintiffdid not report for work. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs case is that the Plaintiff failed to report for duty without giving any reason and he did not ask for permission togo on leave. The absence of the Plaintiff was documented in the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs records. The Plaintiffâs version, however, is that he was told by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that there was no work for him to do during that period but there would be work later and they would call him.</p>    <p><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  In any event, the Plaintiff reported for duty on 6 April 2006. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant continued employing him and sent him to a newly constructed wing (âthe Buildingâ) of the Haven of Hope Hospital inTseung Kwan O to perform night-watchman duty. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs records show that the Plaintiff worked there from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am each day thereafter until the date of the assault.There is no dispute that the Plaintiff was the only guard posted by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to patrol the Building although there was another guard who was employed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. This other guard, according to the Plaintiff, was housed inside a container office opposite the Building.</p>    <p><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  At about 1:00 am on 11 April 2006, while the Plaintiff was patrolling the Building and was about to enter a room on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor in order to get the security key to insert into the clock which he carried for checking purpose, he was hit with a metal pipe(the police report referred to this as a water pipe) on his right wrist by one of two males who emerged from the room. The Plaintiffsaid that after the assault, he shouted immediately and he then saw the two men run away. The security guard employed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was alerted by the Plaintiffâs shout and a report was made to the police. According to the Plaintiff, the police founda metal pipe on the floor when they attended the Building for investigation. Other than this, no property was reported to have beentaken from the Building and no equipment or tool fit for taking away bulky objects was found left behind by the two intruders. Thesetwo men were never located.</p>    <p><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  On the evidence, it was not known for what purpose the two males entered the Building. Presumably, they entered in order to steal.They, however, did not appear to have made any noise which would have alerted the Plaintiff before he entered the room. At the timeof the assault, these two males were not caught in the course of stealing nor were they restrained from leaving. According to thePlaintiff, they were simply hiding in the room. In other words, the attack took place at the very moment when the Plaintiff enteredand even before the Plaintiff noticed the presence of the intruders.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Building</b></p>    <p><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  The Building which the Plaintiff was required to patrol was a 5-storey building. It was a new block of a hospital. At the materialtime, the Building was still under construction and, therefore, the windows and doors had not all been fitted.</p>    <p><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  The Plaintiff told the Court that the Building was not fenced off and at night, there was no lighting on the outside of the Building.There does not appear to be much dispute concerning these claims of the Plaintiff as he was not cross-examined on these aspects andthe Defendants did not assert, or adduce evidence to say, that the condition was otherwise.</p>    <p><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  One further feature about the Building which the Plaintiff mentioned in his evidence was that there was a â<i>jungle</i>â behind the Building. Again, there is not much dispute concerning the dense vegetation at the back of the Building which the Plaintiffdescribed as a â<i>jungle</i>â. From the photographs submitted by the Plaintiff, one can see that there were a lot of closely-packed tall trees lining the sideof the road opposite the back of the Building. The Plaintiffâs case is that this â<i>jungle</i>â increased the danger of people sneaking into the Building.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Negligence Pleaded</b></p>    <p><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  The Particulars of Negligence pleaded are :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)   failing to take all reasonable precautions for the safety of the Plaintiff while he was engaged upon his work by ensuring thearea the Plaintiff had to patrol was safe;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b)  failing to ensure that no unauthorized person or persons could enter the site;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)  failing to ensure that the site was properly secured and/or a fence was placed around the site and/or the open gaps on the windowsor doorways were blocked off;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d)  failing to ensure that the room on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor where the Plaintiff was required to enter during his patrol was kept locked so no unauthorized person could enter or hide there;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(e)  failing to provide the Plaintiff with a torch to patrol the site;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(f)   failing to ensure that the area where the Plaintiff was required to patrol was not dark and had sufficient lighting;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(g)  failing to supervise properly or at all the work of its servants and/or agents and/or the Plaintiff at the site to ensure thatthe area where the Plaintiff had to patrol or gain access was safe;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(h)  failing to ensure that there was sufficient manpower so that at least 2 security guards could patrol the site at any time; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(i)    failing to take all due care in all the circumstances.</p>    </blockquote>    <p><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  These particulars are repeated in respect of the Plaintiffâs claims made under the Occupiersâ Liability Ordinance, <a href="/eng/hk/legis/ord/314">Cap. 314</a>,and in respect of his claims made with regard to the alleged breach by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant of the implied terms of the contract of employment and/or the alleged breach of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs duty of care owed to the Plaintiff as the Plaintiffâs employer.</p>    <p><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  In essence, the Plaintiffâs complaint is that both Defendants did not take steps to ensure that the Building was safe for thePlaintiff to work therein and that, in particular, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not carry out any risk assessment before sending the Plaintiff to work in the Building. Mr. Sakhrani submits that thesituation was this : the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was asked by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to provide one security guard; pursuant to the request, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant provided one security guard and sent the Plaintiff to work in the Building. That was it and nothing more was done.</p>    <p><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  In respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiff says that the condition of the Building was itself an invitation to people to enter : no fencing or cordoning-off;no lighting on the exterior; the â<i>jungle</i>â at the back of the Building; the limited lighting on the staircases of the Building which was covered by scaffolding; the absenceof windows and doors; and the presence of  electrical equipment or construction material on the site.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Evidence</b></p>    <p><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  The way in which the Plaintiff sustained his injury was set out above and there was not much cross-examination on this aspect. Also,the condition of the Building was described above and there is apparently no dispute that the Building was not fenced or cordonedoff and there was no lighting on the exterior.</p>    <p><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  The Plaintiff complained of the poor lighting inside the Building. He said that although there was one light bulb on each staircase,not all of them were switched on. According to the Plaintiff, the other source of light was from the single large light bulb nearthe lift which was about 7-8 metres away from the staircases. He said the Building was dark and the light was only sufficient forhim to move around. The allegation that not all the light bulbs were switched on was, however, not mentioned in his statement. Ms.Pinto submits that the Plaintiff was exaggerating the matter. The Plaintiff also said that he was not given any torch by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. He therefore had to use his own torch for patrolling the Building. He said he had one with him at the material time.</p>    <p><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  Further, it was the Plaintiffâs evidence that there were many openings and gaps in the Building as not all the windows and doorshad been fitted. He said that the room from which the two males emerged was not locked. As to the Standing Order of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant setting out the general duties of security personnel (âthe Orderâ), the Plaintiff denied that the Order was postedin the Building and denied having seen it.</p>    <p><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  At trial, the Plaintiff said that there were hospital machinery and rolls of wiring placed in cartons stored in the Building andthat the other security guard had told him a few times that those were very expensive. The Plaintiff said that the wires were inbig quantities and were kept on each floor. This evidence of the Plaintiff was subject to much cross-examination. Ms. Pinto pointsout that the presence of hospital machinery and the information from the other guard concerning the value of the wiring and machinerywere never mentioned in the Plaintiffâs statement.</p>    <p><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  I should say at this juncture that I do not consider the alleged presence of valuable machinery and equipment in the Building tobe of material relevance as there was no evidence that such information had been made known to others or leaked out, thereby increasingthe chances of the Building being attacked by burglars/robbers. In any event, I am not convinced that valuable hospital machinerywas stored in the Building at that time. It was highly unlikely that such machinery would have been delivered to the Building whenconstruction work was still in progress; when there was still scaffolding covering the Building; when lighting was limited to thatprovided by the light bulbs; and when not all the windows and doors had been fitted. </p>    <p><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  Mr. Lee Hung Tao (âMr. Leeâ), the managing director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, also testified at trial. Mr. Lee said that he has had 20 yearsâ experience in the field of security work. At any onetime, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant provides security services to about 100 locations in Hong Kong. It is estimated that about 30-40% of these are constructionsites. Mr. Lee said that prior to the assault on the Plaintiff, the security guards employed by his company have never encounteredsuch an assault before. He regards such an assault to be rather unusual.</p>    <p><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  Insofar as the Building is concerned, Mr. Lee told the Court that Mr. Ng Ho Cheung, his employee, had gone over to the Buildingto conduct an inspection and to arrange for the setting-up of the security checkpoints. Mr. Lee, however, agreed that no generalrisk assessment concerning the Building was made as they had not been asked by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to do so. Mr. Lee further said that the Plaintiff should have been provided with a torch for his use as it was a standardpractice. He also maintained that the Order should have been shown to the Plaintiff and posted in the Building. Mr. Lee admittedthat there was no written report or written record as to what Mr. Ng did. In the circumstances, his testimony was based on his recollectionof events which happened almost 4 years ago. Mr. Lee, however, maintained that if there was anything special about the Building,Mr. Ng would have told him about it but he could not remember Mr. Ng doing so. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Employerâs Duty of Care</b></p>    <p><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr. Sakhrani relies on the case of <i>Charlton v The Forrest Printing Ink Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20IRLR%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] IRLR 559</a> to submit it is trite that an employer has a duty to take reasonable care to see that an employee is not subjected to any unnecessaryrisks of injury, including the risk of injury by criminals. On the facts of that case and based on the findings made by the trialjudge, the Court of Appeal later allowed the appeal of the appellant company and held that no damages were payable. (see <i>Charlton v The Forrest Printing Ink Co. Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20IRLR%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] IRLR 331)</a> </p>    <p><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Ms. Pinto accepts that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, as the Plaintiffâs employer, did owe a duty of care to the Plaintiff to take reasonable care for his safety at work.Primarily, the contention is as to whether there was â<i>a real risk of strangers gaining entry to the site and attacking security guards</i>â. Ms. Pinto submits that, in this particular case, the risk was low and therefore, there was no breach of any duty on the partof the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr. Sakhrani, on the other hand, submits that the question in the present case is this : â<i>was there</i> <i>a real risk of intruders entering the building at night?</i>â Mr. Sakhrani argues that if there was such a risk, then there was a risk that the intruders, in the course of escape, would inflictpersonal injuries on security personnel, and indeed anyone, inside the premises. Although there was no evidence before me, statisticalor otherwise, concerning how frequent or common personal injuries which happened on construction sites were inflicted in this manner,Mr. Sakhrani asks the Court to adopt a common sense approach when examining the case. He submits that given the Buildingâs condition,it clearly invited unlawful entry by intruders. Once intruders entered, then criminal actions by these intruders were likely to takeplace. He argues, therefore, that there was a duty on the part of the Defendants to reduce this risk of harm, no matter how thatharm might eventually manifest itself.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Risk of Injury</b></p>    <p><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  In the course of submissions, Ms. Pinto refers to a number of Hong Kong cases which examined the risk of injury caused by a thirdparty in the employment context : <i>Wong Wai Ming v Hospital Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%203%20HKLRD%20209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 3 HKLRD 209</a>; <i>Cheng Loon Yin v Secretary for Justice &amp; Anor.</i>, HCPI 118/2003, unrep. (16 November 2004); and <i>Chan Ah Kwong v Yan Cheuk Lun &amp; Ors.</i>, HCPI 287/2005, unrep. (10 August 2009).</p>    <p><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  Needless to say, the factual matrix in each case is different. Other than the general principles, these cases cannot be of muchassistance when considering whether, in this particular case and with the set of facts before me, there was a real risk of injuryand if there was such a risk, the degree of the risk.</p>    <p><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  As recorded earlier, Mr. Leeâs evidence was that in his 20 yearsâ experience in the field and with his company providing securityservices to about 100 locations (30-40% of these are construction sites) at any one time, he has not had any of his security guardsattacked in their employments in the circumstances described by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  Mr. Sakhrani asks the Court to examine the case with common sense and not to attach any weight to this evidence of Mr. Lee as itis not known whether those construction sites were in the same or similar condition as that of the Building.</p>    <p><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  Approaching the matter with common sense, I would say common sense tells us that :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  those who are minded to rob a bank, to snatch property from a person, or to enter occupied premises to steal, are prepared touse violence whereas those who sneak, at night, into a construction site, whether to steal or to idle around, may not be so prepared;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) generally speaking, construction sites are not the prime targets for robbers/burglars and are not where acts of violence are expectedsince cash, jewelleries and valuable commodities are not normally found on the sites;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)  unlike the police or the armed guards, security personnel stationed on construction sites are generally not required to engagethemselves in physical confrontation with intruders (this is in fact borne out by the evidence of the Plaintiff and that of Mr. Leewho both said that security guards are told to report to their employers and the police if they find anything unusual on the sites.They are not required to deal with the situation themselves); and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d) unless intruders are discovered and then are confronted or restrained from leaving the construction sites, in the normal courseof events, they would not be expected to resort to acts of violence.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">Taking all these together, common sense tells us that physical struggle or confrontation with intruders is not a common feature ofthe work of security guards stationed on construction sites.</p>    <p><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  Furthermore, I consider Mr. Leeâs evidence concerning the rare occurrence of physical attack on security guards posted on constructionsites to be both reliable and relevant. I accept that the conditions of these sites might be different: some might be better protected;some might not be so. However, it remains the evidence of Mr. Lee, which I accept, that in his 20 yearsâ experience in the field,it is a rare occurrence for security personnel to be attacked on construction sites by intruders.</p>    <p><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  In the circumstances, I find that the risk of intruders resorting to physical violence and attacking security personnel on constructionsites is generally low.</p>    <p><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  I now turn to the present case. While I accept that the absence of lighting on the exterior, the absence of fencing, the presenceof gaps and openings, and the allegedly poor lighting condition inside the Building might make it easier for intruders to enter,I do not consider that these would then automatically and materially change the degree of risk of injury in this case.</p>    <p><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Gaining entry to a site is one thing, resorting to acts of violence is quite another. It might be correct to say that if the sitewas open and unprotected, it would be more likely for there to be intruders but, generally speaking, there would need to be a triggeringevent or factor before an intruder would resort to violence. The relevant question in this case is not whether there was a real riskof intruders entering an open and poorly lit site, but whether there was a real risk of injury on persons caused by these intruders.</p>    <p><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  It should also be remembered that, in this case, the Building was not a lone building in an isolated area. It was a new block ofa hospital. From the photos submitted by the Plaintiff, there were other structures or buildings nearby. According to the Plaintiff,â<i>the existing hospital was at the back of the Building</i>â, so it would appear that the Building was within the precincts of the hospital complex.</p>    <p><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  In any event, it is not disputed that there was another guard stationed near the Building. Although the Plaintiff said that thisguard was not responsible for patrolling the Building and the guard only stayed inside the container office, it was the Plaintiffâsown evidence that this guardâs office was only next to or near the Building and that, when he shouted after the assault, it wasthis guard who heard him and called the police for him. Therefore, on any view of the matter, this guardâs presence could not besaid to be of no relevance. He in fact provided some form of support to the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>The Alleged Breach of Duty</b></p>    <p><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Much has been said by Mr. Sakhrani in his submissions that there was no general risk assessment made by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. He argues that the site inspection conducted by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for the setting-up of the different checkpoints was not enough. That was for patrolling purposes, not for the protectionof the Plaintiff.</p>    <p><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  Given my finding that, for construction sites, the risk of injuries as a result of attacks by intruders is generally small and consideringthe following, I do not find it unreasonable, in this case, for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant not to have conducted a general risk assessment :</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(a)  that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendantâs security guards are neither instructed nor expected to engage in physical combat with intruders;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(b) that nothing like this incident has happened in Mr. Leeâs 20 yearsâ experience;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(c)  that the Building was only a 5-storey structure;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(d) that there was another guard stationed near the Building;</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(e)  that the Building did not stand in isolation; and</p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote">(f)   that there did not appear to have anything special which would have called for a general risk assessment.</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:left">It cannot be the case that whenever such a risk assessment was absent, then there was a breach of duty on the part of the employer.Much will depend on the facts of the case.</p>    <p><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  In any event, it was not the case here that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant simply sent the Plaintiff to work without attending the site. A site inspection was conducted in order to determine whereto set up the checkpoints. The Plaintiff also admitted that he was shown around the Building by an employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant when he went to work in the Building on the first day.</p>    <p><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  For the reasons set out in paragraph 37 above, I do not find that the other matters pleaded, even assuming that they were proved,would amount to any breach of duty on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>    <p><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  In particular, insofar as the openings of the windows and doors are concerned, one normally would not expect these openings to beboarded-up when construction work was still in progress. I can hardly see how it could be said that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, putting aside the question of whether it had the power to do so, was in breach for not having these openings boarded-up.</p>    <p><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  I make a similar observation in respect of the alleged failure to have the temporary door of the room locked. The Plaintiff wasrequired to go inside the room to get the security key, it would be unreasonable to ask for this room to be locked simply to caterfor the remote possibility of people hiding inside the room.</p>    <p><a name="p42" class="para" id="p42">42.</a>  The suggestion that there should be another security guard working together with the Plaintiff is also neither here nor there. Itmight well be that if there were two guards, then they could assist and support each other at work. However, it cannot be the casethat when one guard were to be deployed to work alone, there would automatically be a breach of duty on the part of the employer.Again, much depends on the facts of the case. In the present case, there was another guard posted outside or near the Building wherethe Plaintiff was required to work.</p>    <p><a name="p43" class="para" id="p43">43.</a>  In <i>Wong Wai Ming v Hospital Authority</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2001%5d%203%20HKLRD%20209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[2001] 3 HKLRD 209</a>, Keith JA said at 212G-I,</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:left" class="quote">â<i>8.

The injury sustained by the Plaintiff was as a result of the activity of the intruder, that is, theassault. It had nothing to do with the state of the Building. It was not the case that the Plaintiff sustained the injury as a resultof any structural defect of the Building or other dangers present in the Building, say, for instance, that because of poor lightingcondition, the Plaintiff tripped and fell, thereby sustaining the injury in question.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Causation</b></p>    <p><a name="p49" class="para" id="p49">49.</a>  Even if there were breaches of duty by the Defendants as alleged by the Plaintiff, I do not see how these breaches could have causedor materially contributed to the injury suffered by the Plaintiff. The fencing, the exterior lighting, and the gaps and openingswere all related to the access to the Building. The Plaintiffâs argument is that if preventive measures had been taken, then theassailant might not have entered and the assault might not have taken place.</p>    <p><a name="p50" class="para" id="p50">50.</a>  I shall first deal with the question of entry. According to the Plaintiff, there were two intruders. It would therefore appear tobe unlikely that, at the time, these two persons were simply wandering aimlessly around, but then coming by an open site and seizingthe opportunity to enter. If, as it would appear to be the case, these two men already had in mind or had a plan to gain entry intothe Building, then given that there were two of them, they would find a way to do so and could assist each other in doing so, forexample, by acting as a look-out while the other was sneaking-in, or by pulling and pushing the other in order to gain entry. Inthe circumstances, whether or not the Building was fenced off and lighted on the exterior would probably not have deterred theseâwilled intrudersâ. There is, in addition, the observation which I have made earlier concerning the relatively remote causativelink between the access and the eventual assault.</p>    <p><a name="p51" class="para" id="p51">51.</a>  I now turn to the question of the assault. The Plaintiff was attacked by one of the intruders not when the Plaintiff tried to stopthem from leaving. It was also not the case that they were caught in the course of stealing and were stopped by the Plaintiff. Theattack took place immediately upon the Plaintiff entering the room where the two intruders were hiding. The Plaintiffâs evidencewas that, â<i>I believe the men must have been hiding in the small room because as soon as I opened the door to that room I was hit with the metalpipe on my right wrist.</i>â If the Plaintiffâs assailant was so minded to hit the Plaintiffâs right wrist even before he was noticed and confronted bythe Plaintiff; when he was unprovoked; and when the Plaintiff was outnumbered, it is difficult to see how the attack could have beenavoided with better lighting. According to the Plaintiff, the intruders were already hiding in the room and the door was closed.Therefore, better lighting would not have allowed the Plaintiff to notice the intrudersâ presence earlier and would not have puthim on alert, thus avoiding the attack.</p>    <p><a name="p52" class="para" id="p52">52.</a>  The torch also does not help. The Plaintiff said he had a torch (although he said it was his own) with him at the time, so the torchdid not assist in preventing the assault.</p>    <p><a name="p53" class="para" id="p53">53.</a>  Insofar as the suggested deployment of another guard is concerned, it would appear to be mere guesswork to say that the presenceof another guard would have prevented the assault.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>    <p><a name="p54" class="para" id="p54">54.</a>  Although one feels much sympathy for the Plaintiff, I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that liability is proved.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Contributory Negligence</b></p>    <p><a name="p55" class="para" id="p55">55.</a>  If, however, the Defendants were to be held liable for the assault, then I see nothing in the conduct of the Plaintiff which wouldhave amounted to his own negligence contributing towards the occurrence of the assault.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><b>Quantum</b></p>    <p><a name="p56" class="para" id="p56">56.</a>  For the sake of completeness, I would now proceed to consider quantum.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i>(1)   The Injury</i></p>    <p><a name="p57" class="para" id="p57">57.</a>  The Plaintiff attended the Accident &amp; Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital on the day of the assault. He was givena dynacast and was discharged on the same day. As a result of the assault, the Plaintiff was granted sick leave from 11 April 2006to 16 April 2008. CT scan of the right wrist was done on 19 May 2006. It showed a widening of the scapho-lunate (âSLâ) distanceand the diagnosis was SL carpal ligament injury and right thumb metacarpo-phalangeal joint (âMCPJâ) sprain injury. Splintagewas applied and physiotherapy was given. The Plaintiff complained of persistent pain and arthroscopic examination was conducted.On 6 December 2006, scarring of the Plaintiffâs right thumb MCPJ with synovitis and tear of the SL ligament were found. An operationfor reconstruction of the SL ligament was done on 20 March 2007 and the Plaintiff then continued his physiotherapy treatment. Repeatedarthroscopic examination was done on 16 October 2007 which showed scar formation and joint arthritis of MCPJ. The work evaluationshowed that the Plaintiff was capable of performing work involving reaching, handling and finger dexterity at all levels but witha below standard rate when compared with industrial standard.</p>    <p><a name="p58" class="para" id="p58">58.</a>  According to the joint orthopaedic examination conducted by Dr. Lee Po Chin and Dr. Lau Hoi Kuen on 16 January 2009, the Plaintiffhas residual tenderness in his right wrist and thumb with some impaired sensation in the ulnar border of the right thumb except thetip. Movements of the right thumb and right wrist were slightly limited. Both experts agree that some residual pain and stiffnessmay remain in the right wrist and right thumb but the Plaintiff should be able to perform mild to moderate exertion of his righthand and right thumb. Both experts also agree that it is not advisable for the Plaintiff to return to work that requires strenuousexertion with his right wrist and forceful rotation of his right forearm, but he can change to work as a security guard in a building,which is less demanding on exertion of the hands. Both experts agree that the Plaintiffâs current job as a salesman is also appropriate.While the Plaintiff was assessed by the Employeesâ Compensation Assessment Board on 20 August 2008 to have suffered a loss of earningcapacity of 3% because of his â<i>right wrist and thumb injuries resulting in stiffness, pain and numbness</i>â, Dr. Lee opines that, based on the residual stiffness and pain associated with the right wrist and right thumb, the impairmentof the whole person is 12%. Dr. Lauâs assessment of the impairment is 6%.</p>    <p><a name="p59" class="para" id="p59">59.</a>  At trial, the Plaintiff said that he still suffers pain at the base of the right thumb and when pressing against an object withthe bottom of his right palm. He cannot pick up heavy objects and has to take 2 tablets of painkiller during cold weather. The righthand is his preferred hand and he cannot play cricket now as his right hand is not strong enough. In his present job with the tailorshop, he feels pain if he picks up some heavy cloth or some 3 to 4 suits.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i>(2)   The Part-time Job</i></p>    <p><a name="p60" class="para" id="p60">60.</a>  The Plaintiffâs evidence was that about 1 or 2 weeks after he had started working for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, he got a part-time job as a packer. He was required to open small boxes of mobile phones to see if the goods were in goodorder, and after checking, he would put them into bigger cartons. The packing work was done in Chung King Mansion or Minden Avenue.The work was arranged by a person called âMoonâ. He did not have any further particulars about this man and he had not been tothe office of the boss. When there was work to do, his friend would phone him. He worked 4-5 hours per day and 15 days per month.He would get paid HK$200 per day in cash and he spent the money on food and rent. The Plaintiff further said that he did not bankin the money and did not get any receipt in respect of the wages he was paid. He was never asked to file a tax return concerningthese wages. The Plaintiff said that he kept this part-time job until the time of the assault as he needed to send money to his parentsin Pakistan and to repay a debt.</p>    <p><a name="p61" class="para" id="p61">61.</a>  After careful consideration, I reject the Plaintiffâs claim that he kept such a regular part-time job as he alleged. A constantmonthly income of HK$3,000 was not a small amount. As is evident from the records, the Plaintiff merely got HK$2,980 as his basicsalary and rent allowance from his employment with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. Only if he worked for 12 hours a day and worked everyday during the whole month could he then earn about HK$6,000. Therefore,if the Plaintiff had had this monthly sum of HK$3,000 from a regular part-time job which only required him to work for a few hoursa day and for about half a month, he would have treasured it very much and would have tried to ensure that the job was given to him.To not ask for or obtain any further particulars or contact details about his boss and about the office is unbelievable. It is evenmore so as the boss, according to the Plaintiff, had provided the regular part-time job to him at the specified places for almosthalf a year (November 2005 to April 2006).</p>    <p><a name="p62" class="para" id="p62">62.</a>  Further, if there had been such an employer who had a constant need to employ packers, it would appear that the business shouldbe relatively stable and established. It is inconceivable and I do not accept that in such circumstances, the packing work of mobilephones, which should be of some value, would simply be done in the open in different places, especially when there were boxes andcartons of the goods as described by the Plaintiff.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i>(3)   Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenities (PSLA)</i></p>    <p><a name="p63" class="para" id="p63">63.</a>  The Plaintiff was 28 years of age at the time of the assault.

Based on the documents provided by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff earned, on average, HK$6,341 per month between November 2005 and March 2006 (HK$6,140+ HK$6,216 + HK$7,200 + HK$2995 + HK$5985 / 4.5 months). The Plaintiff admitted taking a holiday without pay of about 2 months inPakistan every year, so the Plaintiffâs average monthly earnings at the time of the accident have to be further adjusted : HK$6,341x 10/12 = HK$5,284.</p>    <p><a name="p67" class="para" id="p67">67.</a>  During the sick leave period (11 April 2006 to 30 April 2008), the Plaintiff suffered a total loss of income of HK$5,284 x 24.7months = HK$130,515.</p>    <p><a name="p68" class="para" id="p68">68.</a>  After his sick leave expired on 30 April 2008, the Plaintiff started working in his present employment on 1 May 2008 with a monthlysalary of HK$6,175. From January 2009 onwards, his monthly income has gone up to HK$6,650. The Plaintiff said in his statement thatif not because of the injury, he would have resumed working as a security guard, earning about HK$7,000 per month. This figure wasnot challenged but his annual absence of 2 months has not yet been taken into account. After adjustment, the Plaintiff would probablybe earning an average monthly income of HK$5,833 (HK$7,000 x 10/12) if he were to resume working as a security guard after his sickleave.</p>    <p><a name="p69" class="para" id="p69">69.</a>  As at the date of the hearing, the loss of earnings for the post sick-leave period (1 May 2008 to 18 February 2010) should thereforebe : [HK$5,833 â (HK$6,175 x 10/12)] x 8 months + [HK$5,833 â (HK$6,650 x 10/12)] x 13.7 months = HK$5,504 + HK$4,000 = HK$9,504.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i><u>Future Loss of Earnings</u></i></p>    <p><a name="p70" class="para" id="p70">70.</a>  The Plaintiff is now aged 32.

He started hiscurrent job immediately after he has finished his sick leave. At the date of the trial, he has been in the same job for more than21 months and has been given a pay rise after only 8 monthsâ service. The Plaintiff took leave in August and September 2009 andwent back to Pakistan.

On balance, I donot consider that there is any substantial or real risk that the Plaintiff, at some future date during his working life, would losehis employment and would suffer financial loss because of his disadvantage in the labour market. </p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i>(7)   Special Damages</i></p>    <p><a name="p74" class="para" id="p74">74.</a>  This is agreed at HK$5,034.</p>    <p style="text-align:left" class="heading"><i>(8)   Future Medical Expenses</i></p>    <p><a name="p75" class="para" id="p75">75.</a>  In respect of further medical treatment, the joint orthopaedic report reads, â<i>We agree that <u>Mr. Aliâs condition is stable</u>. ...
