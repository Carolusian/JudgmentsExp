There is also an alternative application tohave the action struck out as an abuse of process under Order 18 r 19 of the Rules of the High Court and finally, and in any event,a further application for the Plaintiff to be made the subject of a Restricted Application Order (â<i>a RAOâ</i>) also known as a <i>Grepe v Loam</i> order.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p2" class="para" id="p2">2.</a>  In the summer of 2003 the Plaintiff, Mr Elijah Saatori, attended the Gold Coast Clinic which is a medical practice operated by theDefendant.  He wanted to have an accumulation of wax removed from his ears.  He paid $270 for this procedure which was performedfor him by a nurse who, he says, used a metal syringe which she filled up with cold water.  The use of cold water caused him to becomedizzy and also failed to dislodge the wax.  The nurse repeated the procedure, on this occasion, using warmer water.  Complaint ismade that the water was injected with such force that this again made him dizzy.  The Plaintiffâs home-made Statement of Claimdoes not disclose whether the second attempt with warmer water was successful in removing the wax but what it does plead is thatwithin three days of this procedure the Plaintiff began to suffer from tinnitus (a ringing in the ears) from which he continues tosuffer to the present day.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p3" class="para" id="p3">3.</a>  On 9 May 2006 he issued his Statement of Claim for $27 million damages because of the negligently performed syringing of his earsby the nurse.  I have taken these facts from the Statement of Claim.  As yet the Defendant says that it is unable to file a detaileddefence and so it is not possible to say whether and to what extent the Plaintiffâs version of events is accepted by the Defendant. There is at present a holding defence denying negligence. It amounts to a general denial.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p4" class="para" id="p4">4.</a>  Once it was served with the writ the Defendant took out a summons to obtain directions upon which an order was made by Master Lungon 31 July 2006 requiring the Plaintiff to comply with Practice Direction 18.1 para. 5.2 (v) by filing and serving a medical reportin support of his claim and a Statement of Damages.  On 14 December 2006, again on the Defendantâs application, Suffiad J orderedthe action to be transferred to the Personal Injury List.  The judge on that occasion dismissed the Plaintiffâs application tohave the action tried by a judge sitting with a jury and he also extended time to 28 December 2006 for the Plaintiff to file a Statementof Damages.  The Plaintiff filed his Statement of Damages on 29 December 2006. </p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p5" class="para" id="p5">5.</a>  On 1 February 2007 there was a Check List Review (âCLRâ) hearing before Master Kwan when the Plaintiff was told that he wouldneed to provide a medical report in support of his case.  He was given assistance by the Master as to what was required.  The CLRhearing was adjourned by her for four months to allow the Plaintiff time to comply with that requirement.  This hearing was restoredon 28 June 2007 when the Master ordered the Plaintiff to file his medical evidence within seven days and to attend an examinationby the Defendantâs medical expert.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p6" class="para" id="p6">6.</a>  There is a medical report from an American specialist physician Dr Robert Carpenter which, although not dated, was served and filedby the Plaintiff some time in June 2007 [Exhibits Bundle/3-4].  The content of this report together with an addendum to it whichDr Carpenter prepared on 29 October 2008 [Exhibits Bundle/17-18] will need to be considered in some detail.  Suffice it to say forpresent purposes that the Plaintiff says that he was unable to afford the services of a Hong Kong-based medical expert and researchedfor a suitable medical expert on the internet and was recommended Dr Carpenter who was willing to provide him with a report.  DrCarpenter has not examined the Plaintiff and he prepared his first report based on a factual account given to him by the Plaintiffof the procedure carried out by the nurse at the Gold Coast Clinic and the symptoms that the Plaintiff has suffered since then. The Plaintiff says that taken in combination these two reports from Dr Carpenter are fully compliant with the Practice Directionand the order of the Court of Appeal.  The Defendant, represented by Mr Bharwaney SC, disagrees.  It is for this reason thereforethat these two reports will need to be carefully examined to determine whether they pass muster for the purposes of an action suchas this.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p7" class="para" id="p7">7.</a>  Returning to the chronology, the Plaintiff submitted himself to an examination by Dr Wong, the Defendantâs specialist, on 18 July2007 who prepared a report dated 14 August 2007.  The Plaintiff then reported Dr Wong, whose report was adverse to the Plaintiffâscase, and Messrs Robertsons the Defendantâs solicitors to the ICAC for corruption on the basis that because Dr Wong had been paida fee to examine the Plaintiff and write a report which concluded that the Plaintiffâs tinnitus was due to the aging process, DrWong had written what he had because he had been instructed and paid to do so by Robertsons.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p8" class="para" id="p8">8.</a>  On 7 August 2007 the Defendant took out a summons to strike out the action on the basis of the Plaintiffâs failure to produceproper medical evidence to support his claim.  This was adjourned on its first hearing by Saunders J, who heard it, to allow thePlaintiff time to file and serve a medical report from Tuen Mun Hospital.  The Plaintiff was examined at that hospital and in a reportdated 18 February 2008 the examining doctor stated that the Plaintiff had complained of tinnitus for the previous four years andprovided him with medication for it and gave him a follow-up appointment four months later.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p9" class="para" id="p9">9.</a>  On 11 April 2008 Saunders J heard the Defendantâs application to strike out the action.  In his judgment, acceding to the application[Court Documents Bundle/13-15], he observed that;</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ <i>it is a fundamental principle of a medical negligence action that (there) must be a proper medical report from an expert establishingliability or at least arguable negligence on the part of the Defendant medical person and linking that negligence, by causation,to the condition suffered by the Plaintiff.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">The judge sympathised with the Plaintiff because of the unpleasant symptoms that he had suffered from but concluded that;</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote">ââ¦ <i>in the absence of any evidence that the tinnitus has been caused by the syringing, that evidence coming from an appropriately qualifiedmedical expert, the claim against (the Defendant) must be struck out.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p10" class="para" id="p10">10.</a>  The Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard on 23 September 2008 and judgment was handed down on 14  October2008.  Lam J (who gave the judgment to the court) decided that the Plaintiff should be given a final opportunity to get his tacklein order.  He concluded his judgment in this way [Court Documents Bundle/25-26]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>â19.  Should the Plaintiff be given one more chance to put his house in order?  Mr Carolan drew our attention to the history ofthis action and the various opportunities given to the Plaintiff to comply with the Practice Direction in the past.  By now morethan 5 years had lapsed since the occurrence of the incident the Plaintiff complained of.  It is unsatisfactory that the Plaintiffhas yet to properly and precisely formulate the grounds of his claim.  However, it is fair to observe that at the court below thefocus seemed to be place on the question of causation instead of the expert evidence on negligence.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>20.    In the interests of justice, we would grant one further indulgence to the Plaintiff to put forward his case in compliance withthe rules and the practice direction.  We will give the Plaintiff one month to file and serve all expert report supporting his allegationsof negligence against the Defendant. If such a report is not filed and served by 10 November 2008, the appeal shall be dismissed.</i> <i> If the report is filed and served before that deadline, the appeal shall be allowed in that the striking out order would be set asideand the action shall continue with a direction that the Plaintiff shall take out a summons within 7 days after the filing of thereport for leave to amend his Statement of Claim in the manner as indicated by him in the course of the appeal.  The summons shallbe returnable before the PI Master who may give further directions regarding the future conduct of the case.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>21.    As regards costs, for the reasons given above, based on the existing Statement of Claim and expert report relied upon by thePlaintiff, his claim is liable to be struck out.  Therefore, the Defendant has been acting properly in issuing the application andSaunders J</i><i> </i>was correct in striking out the action.  We decided to give the Plaintiff a further indulgence. But that indulgence should not beat the expense of the Defendant in terms of costs. We would not disturb the order of Saunders J<i> </i>on costs below.  Further, we would make a costs order nisi that the Plaintiff shall bear the Defendant's costs of the appeal in anyevent.â</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p11" class="para" id="p11">11.</a>  Given this further opportunity the Plaintiff went back to Dr Carpenter for a further report [Exhibits Bundle/17-18] which was filedthree days late on 13 November 2008.  On this occasion Dr Carpenter had more material to work from.  Whereas, for his previous reporthe only appears to have had a factual account given to him by the Plaintiff, on this occasion he noted that he had the following:</p>    <table width="762" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0">        <tr valign="top">            <td width="32" class="quote"> </td>            <td width="8" class="quote">â</td>            <td width="50" class="quote"><i>1) </i></td>            <td width="652" class="quote"><i>Diagnosis by the Baptist Hospital of Hong Kong.</i></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">            <td class="quote" width="32"> </td>            <td class="quote" width="8"> </td>            <td class="quote" width="50"><i>2) </i></td>            <td class="quote" width="652"><i>Report by Dr Buddy Wong (Rafflesâ Clinic ENT expert)</i><i> </i>and the Audiogram results from the Adventist Hospital in Hong Kong.</td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">            <td class="quote" width="32"> </td>            <td class="quote" width="8"> </td>            <td class="quote" width="50"><i>3) </i></td>            <td class="quote" width="652"><i>Audiogram and report from Tuen Mun hospital in Hong Kong.</i></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">            <td class="quote" width="32"> </td>            <td class="quote" width="8"> </td>            <td class="quote" width="50"><i>4) </i></td>            <td class="quote" width="652"><i>Established syringing practices now mandated in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.</i></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">            <td class="quote" width="32"> </td>            <td class="quote" width="8"> </td>            <td class="quote" width="50"><i>5) </i></td>            <td class="quote" width="652"><i>Appeal submissions and the recent judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Appeal.â</i></td>        </tr>    </table>    <p style="text-align:justify">He concluded his report, which will require some detailed analysis in a moment, by saying that the Plaintiffâs ear had been flushedwith excessive force causing injury and tinnitus from which he had not recovered.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p12" class="para" id="p12">12.</a>  A point is taken by Mr Bharwaney on late service of this report but if I hold that it is a report which complies with the requirementsof the Practice Direction, I would be minded to extend time for the admission of the report into evidence given that it is only threedays out of time.  If it does not comply, then there would be no reason to extend time to allow it to be received into evidence andin such circumstances the consequences referred to paragraph 20 of Lam Jâs judgment <i>supra</i> would take effect and the striking out order made by Saunders J dated 11 April 2008 would put an end to the action.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p13" class="para" id="p13">13.</a>  On 2February 2009 this summons was taken out by the Defendant to strike out the action for non-compliance with the Court of AppealâsOrder of 14 October 2008.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p14" class="para" id="p14">14.</a>  Having served and filed Dr Carpenterâs second report, the Plaintiff took out a summons to be heard on 11 May 2009 for a restoredCLR hearing with a view to the action proceeding to trial.  Given that the striking out summons remained to be heard on 16 July,Master Kwan vacated the CLR hearing on 11 July to be heard, as appropriate, on 16 July  by the judge hearing the Defendantâs strikingout summons.  This order was confirmed by Fung J, the judge in charge of the Personal Injury List, on 19 May 2009 with the resultthat all these matters came before me on 16 July.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p15" class="para" id="p15">15.</a>  That therefore traces the route by which the matter has come to be heard before me.  So far I have purposely refrained from referringto the correspondence and the accompanying pleadings and affirmations which has brought the action thus far.  I will need to do sopresently, particularly when I come to consider the striking out application based on abuse of process under the RHC and for a RAOunder the courtâs inherent jurisdiction.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p16" class="para" id="p16">16.</a>  This limb of the striking out application based on non-compliance with the Court of Appealâs order of 14 October 2008 will bea bland technical exercise compared to the other two aspects which require me to consider, and I do not do this justice by describingit in this way, the highly colourful and inflammatory correspondence and affirmations that the Plaintiff has directed at the Defendantand its solicitors and, by filing these documents in court, at the court.  At present it is possible to separate what is essentiallyan issue of construction to determine whether, taken in conjunction, Dr Carpenterâs two reports amount to the sort of evidencethat can properly be said to support an action for medical negligence in this case; from the other material which is said to justifya striking out order under Order 18 r 19 RHC, and for a RAO in support of which it is said that the Plaintiff is someone who is completelyout of control, a vexatious litigant of the worst possible kind over whom judicial restraint should now be imposed before he is allowedto cause further damage and harm to his current opponents based on his record in this action so far and his long and unsuccessfulrecord of litigation in a series of other unmeritorious actions.</p>    <p class="heading">Do Dr Carpenterâs reports comply with the Court of Appealâs Order?</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p17" class="para" id="p17">17.</a>  The test to be applied in determining whether medical negligence is established is that proposed by McNair J in <i>Bolam v Friern HMC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%201%20WLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] 1 WLR 582</a> at 586;</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âThe test is the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill.  A man need not professthe highest expert skill, it is well established law that it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill of a competent manexercising that particular art.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">For these purposes some brief further elaboration may be helpful.  As the <i>Bolam</i> case has made clear ââ¦ in determining whether a defendant has fallen below the required standard of care, great regard must beshown to responsible medical opinion, and to the fact that reasonable doctors may differ.â  As McNair J put it, a practitionerwho acts in conformity with an accepted and current practice is not negligent â<i>merely because there is a body of opinion which would take a contrary view</i>.â  See <i>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</i> 19<sup>th</sup> Edition 10-62 [603].  At 10-63 the learned editors say this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âThe practical result of this proposition is that proving fault in a doctor on the basis of his choice of a particular techniqueor method can be very difficult: the</i> [Plaintiff] <i>effectively has to show that no body of respectable medical opinion would have supported what the doctor did.  Nevertheless, the limitationson Bolam must be borne in mind.  It applies only to professional decisions whether or not to use a certain form of treatment andnot to simple cases of carelessness or inadvertence â¦â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p18" class="para" id="p18">18.</a>  These passages merely outline the general substantive tests that would be applied by a trial judge to determine whether negligencehas been established.  The requirements of the Practice Direction in this type of action are designed to require a would-be plaintiffto focus his mind, or at least to have it focused for him by those advising him, on the merits of his case on negligence againstthe medical practitioner that has treated him.  The medical report accompanying the Statement of Claim should identify with a highdegree of precision the elements of the alleged negligent treatment performed by the Defendant, which in turn will be reflected inthe Statement of Claim.  To attack a professional man in his practice is a very serious matter indeed and not to be embarked uponlightly.  It is for these reasons that the Practice Direction requires a potential plaintiff to have investigated his own case andtreatment carefully before he launches an action of this type.  Although at this stage the court will not be concerned with an analysisof the intrinsic merits of the claim as supported by the expert medical opinion filed with the Statement of Claim, nevertheless,if a report is called into question as Dr Carpentersâ have been on this occasion then the court will look at what has been saidin the report (or reports in this case) and the basis upon which their contents are put forward, to see whether they should be allowedto stand so as to require the Defendant to have to answer the action.  The burden on the Plaintiff requires him to file a reportwhich would support a case on medical negligence as reflected in <i>Bolam</i> and that the alleged negligence was causative of the condition that he now complains of.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p19" class="para" id="p19">19.</a>  Saunders J and the Court of Appeal clearly considered that Dr Carpenterâs first report did not possess those characteristics hencethe Court of Appealâs decision to give the Plaintiff a final chance to get another report which achieved what the Practice Directionrequires.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p20" class="para" id="p20">20.</a>  It seems to me that I need to look at both of Dr Carpenterâs reports in order to determine whether, in combination, they can besaid to support a reasonably arguable case of medical negligence in the circumstances of the Plaintiffâs treatment at the Defendantâsclinic.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p21" class="para" id="p21">21.</a>  As everybody knows, in the practice of personal injury cases (which includes medical negligence cases such as this one) in HongKong and I would have thought in all common law jurisdictions, a party bringing an action will have been personally examined by themedical expert whose opinion he proposes relying on.  This is no criticism of Dr Carpenter, but he has been asked to prepare a reportwithout an examination of the Plaintiff.  I daresay that it would be very rare indeed for a medical expert to agree to provide anopinion that was to go forward as the basis of a medical negligence action without having personally examined the patient.  Dr Carpenterhas agreed to this course, no doubt in order to be helpful to the Plaintiff who says he cannot afford a Hong Kong-based expert, andI am told that should the action get to trial Dr Carpenter is willing to come to Hong Kong from the United States in order to giveevidence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p22" class="para" id="p22">22.</a>  Mr Saatori submits that Dr Carpenter has in his second report identified negligence by saying that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>ââ¦ the excessive force of the syringing procedure produced acute noise trauma and caused injury to the inner ear resulting intinnitus and slightly greater hearing loss in the right ear. I reference articles from the UK which direct the technique and typeof equipment to be used for ear irrigation and state that they feel a metal syringe should not be used for irrigation, except inthe hands of a specialist because of the chance of injury to the eardrum or tinnitus from excessive force and warm water should beused to prevent dizziness.â</i> [Exhibit Bundle 17-18]</p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p23" class="para" id="p23">23.</a>  Having received this report Mr Saatori has amended his Statement of Claim [Exhibit Bundle 36].  The principal amendment is to paragraph3:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âShe then repeated the procedure, more than once, with warmer water, at my request, as the first flushes failed to dislodge thewax.  Again the force was very intense and made me dizzy again, and contravenes well established written protocols stipulating thegentle use of an electric irrigator, flushing at an angle such as not to force the water directly at the ear drum, instead of usinga metal syringe, plugged directly into the ear, forcefully, that is known to cause Tinnitus with intense and negligent repeated plungesof water with violence, as the evidence will prove in this case.  Further negligence is established by written protocols that mandatethat the procedure not be delegated to a nurse who may have had no experience in such a procedure, as is obviously the situationin this Case.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Mr Saatori says that the amended-pleading is there to adopt Dr Carpenterâs opinion that excessive force was used when flushing outthe ear which caused injury to his inner ear and resulted in him getting tinnitus.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p24" class="para" id="p24">24.</a>  Mr Bharwaney submits that taken in combination these two reports cannot support a case of medical negligence.  He draws attentionto Dr Carpenterâs first report which both Saunders J and the Court of Appeal had rejected as being capable of supporting a claimin negligence.  It is worth reciting here the significant parts of the first report [Exhibit Bundle 3-4]:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âOpinion:</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   There are no specific guidelines as to how the ears should be flushed and there is no standard of care concerning the performanceof the procedure.  Generally, the ears are flushed with warm water as cold water will cause dizziness.  The amount of force usedis not measured and is usually limited by the design of the syringe.  The angle can be either straight or at an angle, but againthere are no guidelines or correct method.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   The procedure of performing an ENG to evaluate dizziness requires squirting cold water in the ear, and this is a recognized techniquethat has been performed for many years with the desired side effect of causing dizziness.  Therefore, flushing the ears with coldwater is within the standard of care and generally is not associated with tinnitus.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   Tinnitus has many causes.  A common cause is noise exposure, either acute or chronic.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>Another is viral, another is aging.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   In this case, from the temporal relationship, it is my opinion that the tinnitus was, more likely than not, caused by noise traumafrom the water hitting the eardrum.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   It is, however, difficult to prove that the tinnitus is actually present.  There is no method for determining whether a personhas tinnitus and no method to quantify tinnitus.  There is also no reliable treatment.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   If an audiogram were done and a unilateral hearing loss was noted, then there would perhaps be concrete evidence of damage to theright ear, since this is the ear with the greater tinnitus.  Other than an audiogram, there is no reliable method to determine theextent of injury.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>Conclusion:</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   In my opinion, the noise trauma from the ear flushing, more likely than not, caused the onset of tinnitus.  Proving whether thetinnitus is, in fact, present, however, is not possible.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   I believe an audiogram would be helpful as the next step in evaluation, and if an asymmetric hearing loss is noted with the poorerhearing in the right ear this would be helpful in terms of proving that damage did occur.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>   I reserve the right to modify my opinion if further relevant information becomes available.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Dr Carpenter has identified noise trauma caused by the flushing as the cause of the tinnitus.  He accepts that proving the presenceof tinnitus is not possible but says that an audiogram would be a helpful next step and if there is present an asymmetric hearingloss with poorer hearing in the right ear this <i>âwould be helpful in terms of proving that damage did occur.â</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p25" class="para" id="p25">25.</a>  For the second report Dr Carpenter had the results of the audiogram.  The audiogram showed mild high tone loss at 4,000 and 8,000hz in both ears.  The result is that hearing loss on both sides is approximately the same, although Dr Carpenter suggests in hissecond report that <i>âpure tone audiogram clearly reveals</i> [poorer hearing in the right ear] <i>as there is a step drop at the 3,000 hz frequency compared to the left ear</i> [page 36 Hearing Bundle for the 19 May 2009].  This feature leads Dr Carpenter to say that damage has been caused to the right earas a result of the excessive force used in the syringing procedure.  Really it is only this which enables him to say that damagehas been caused to the right ear and that this damage, based on what Mr Saatori had told him about what he had experienced duringthe syringing procedure, had been the result of excessive force being applied to expel the water from the syringe and into the ear. His conclusion is this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âIn my opinion, the excessive force of the syringing procedure produced acute noise trauma and caused injury to the inner ear resultingin tinnitus and slightly greater hearing loss in the right ear.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>I reference articles from the UK which direct the technique and type of equipment to be used fur ear irrigation and state that theyfeel a metal syringe should not be used for irrigation, except in the hands of a specialist, because of the chance of injury to theeardrum or tinnitus from excessive force and warm water should be used to prevent dizziness.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>In my opinion, assuming Hong Kong is under the same standard of care as the UK, negligence occurred at the Raffles clinic in July2003 when Mr. Saatoriâs ear was flushed with excessive force, causing injury and tinnitus from which he has not recovered.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>Had Mr. Saatori been treated by the techniques described, with warm water and different apparatus, he, more likely than not, wouldnot have experienced tinnitus.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p26" class="para" id="p26">26.</a>  At this stage I am only concerned to ensure that these two reports taken together comply with the Practice Direction as being expertevidence capable of supporting a claim in medical negligence.  What I am not permitted to do is to conduct some sort of âmini-trialâon paper unless Mr Bharwaney can show that on this evidence there is simply no prospect of successfully prosecuting this action. I have Dr Buddy Wongâs much more comprehensive report which discounts negligence and concludes that this condition (if it exists),is due to aging.  Mr Saatori is now in his fifties.  Dr Wong, who has of course examined Mr Saatori, has been able to provide a closelyreasoned report which the Defendant will rely on if there is to be a trial.  But for all the <i>prima facie</i> complimentary things that one might feel able to say about Dr Wongâs report, now is not the time to embark on any comparative exerciseon what is a very limited remit of enquiring to see whether Dr Carpenterâs two reports are fit to go forward for the purposes ofthe Practice Direction so as to put the Defendant at risk of judgment being entered against it for professional negligence.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p27" class="para" id="p27">27.</a>  I have decided that on a true analysis Dr Carpenterâs reports cannot get the Plaintiff to the starting gate.  Dr Carpenter hasbased himself on a very general proposition that there is greater hearing loss in the right ear detected at 3,000 hz, although overallthe difference between the two ears is minimal on a true reading of the audiogram, and that this therefore proves damage to the rightear caused by the noise trauma which was the result of excessive force being applied to expel the water, cold at first, and thenwarmer on the second application.  It strikes me that these bare assertions based on very limited material does not amount to thesort of cogently reasoned report which the Practice Direction requires in order to start a medical negligence action.  The resulttherefore is that Mr Saatori has failed to comply with the Court of Appealâs order that he obtain a medical report which will properlysupport an action of this sort.  Accordingly, Saunders Jâs order must now take effect and the action will be struck out.  It issufficient therefore to say that I refuse to extend time to the Plaintiff to comply with the Court of Appealâs order that he filehis report by 10 November 2008 because this report would not have complied with the requirements of the Court of Appealâs orderand of paragraph 5.2(v) of Practice Direction 18.1 upon which its order was based.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p28" class="para" id="p28">28.</a>  The Defendant also has a summons to strike out the action on the grounds set out in RHC Order 18 r 19.  Mr Bharwaney says that inreality all three applications are inter-related.  It seems to me that the striking out of the action because of the failure to producea medical report which establishes a cogent case of negligence both as to liability and causation as required by Practice Direction18.1 amounts to the same thing as saying that this case, taken at its highest, discloses no reasonable cause of action and is thereforeone that is bound to fail.  To this extent therefore the application under Order 18 r 19 adds nothing to the application based onnon-compliance with paragraph 5.2(v) of the Practice Direction.  In substance both grounds amount to the same thing.  I am contentto leave matters on the basis of Saunders Jâs judgment which must now take effect due to the failure by the Plaintiff to complywith the Court of Appealâs order that on or before 10 November 2008 he serve and file a medical report that can be said to complywith the Practice Direction.  For the reasons which I have given he has failed to do so, and so no purpose would have been servedin extending time to allow him to put in Dr Carpenterâs second report which would not have complied with what the Court of Appealand the Practice Direction require.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p29" class="para" id="p29">29.</a>  This therefore puts an end to the action and the Defendant having succeeded in striking it out must now have its costs of the actionto be taxed on a party and party basis.  The order for costs will be an order <i>nisi</i>.  Should either party wish for a different order for costs they may apply in writing [which is a common way of dealing with costsorders when judgment has been handed down] within 14 days of receipt of the judgment.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p30" class="para" id="p30">30.</a>  From this I must now turn to the Defendantâs application to have Mr Saatori made the subject of a RAO. </p>    <p class="heading">RAO[The basis of such an Order]</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p31" class="para" id="p31">31.</a>  This order, if I were to make it, would cover this action.  He would therefore need to first obtain leave from a designated Judgebefore making any further application and would have to demonstrate that such an application was âarguably meritoriousâ.  Themaking of such order was considered by the Court of Final Appeal in the case of <i>Ng Yat Chi v Max Share Ltd &amp; Another FACV 5/2004.</i>  The reason why such orders should go to control the activities of a vexatious litigant was explained by the Chief Justice in thisway:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>â2.    It is not difficult to recognise the activities of the vexatious litigant.  The person concerned will almost invariably beunrepresented and will pursue abusive proceedings which usually exhibit some of the following features.  Hopeless claims are instituted. Totally misconceived appeals are launched.  Judgments of the court, both interlocutory and at trial and both first instance andappellate, may not be accepted.  There are likely to be attempts, often repeated, to re-litigate the same matters as have alreadybeen determined.  The materials filed will often be irrelevant, incoherent or scandalous.  When present at a hearing, some vexatiouslitigants are unable to conduct themselves with decorum and may hurl abuse at the opposite parties and/or the judge.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>3.      Abusive proceedings are oppressive to the other parties and result in unfairness to them.  To protect themselves against suchproceedings, time, effort and stress are involved and costs have to be incurred.  They may be in a weak position to cope.  Often,there may be little prospect of recovering the costs incurred.</i></p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>4.      Quite apart from causing unfairness to the other parties, abusive proceedings lead to unfairness to other litigants beforethe courts.  Judicial resources are inevitably finite.  The time which judges and their supporting staff have is of course limited. Where much needed resources are diverted to dealing with abusive proceedings, litigants with cases of real merit suffer as a result. It will take a longer time for their cases to be dealt with.  Courts should concentrate their resources in dealing with meritoriouscases.  Their attention should not be unnecessarily diverted to dealing with abusive proceedings.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify">Whilst the constitutional right of access to the courts is well recognised and protected both under the common law and under the BasicLaw the Chief Justice continued by observing that:</p>    <blockquote>        <p class="quote"><i>âBut it would be absurd to suggest that the right of access involves a right to abuse the courtâs process.  The pursuit of abusiveproceedings would be an improper exercise of the right of access and may be regarded as adversely affecting the right of access ofothers with meritorious cases.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p32" class="para" id="p32">32.</a>  Although mindful of the fact that it is a strong thing to require a party to show that his case has sufficient merit before it isallowed to continue the Chief Justice also advocated the need for decisive action to be taken in the appropriate case.  He said this:</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:justify" class="quote"><i>âThe right of access to the courts must of course be strongly safeguarded.  But where the circumstances are appropriate, the courtsshould not be reticent in making Grepe v. Loam orders and extended orders and should act firmly.  It must be emphasized that it isessential for courts to exercise their jurisdiction to prevent abuse of process properly and effectively.â</i></p>    </blockquote>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p33" class="para" id="p33">33.</a>  Mr Saatori has very deep religious convictions.  He is a committed Christian on the evangelical wing of Christianity.  His knowledgeof the scriptures is encyclopaedic.  He is able to quote from both volumes of the Bible at will and does so in pleadings, in correspondenceand when addressing the court.  He tells me that he can, and on occasion does, speak in tongues.  When things go wrong, in termsof the litigation in hand not going as he would wish, he calls upon Almighty Godâs wrathful vengeance to come down on his opponents. He has in the past done so, he says with success, in the case of a bank, a firm of solicitors and against individuals.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p34" class="para" id="p34">34.</a>  The papers in this case graphically demonstrate what I have just indicated.  I am afraid that this behaviour is so extensive thatto quote isolated examples, merely in the interest of brevity, could not possibly do justice to the description that I have justgiven.  If this judgment has to be considered in another court, and I can I think safely predict that it will be, then the material,extensive as it is, will need to be gone through.  I fear that such a reading will confirm that Mr Saatori, genuine as he feels hisis in all his dealings with the world as we know it and with the individuals, organisations and institutions that make up our community,is somebody, so far as litigation is concerned, who lacks any sense of rational judgment or behaviour.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p35" class="para" id="p35">35.</a>  That this is so is, in my view, overwhelmingly demonstrated in his conduct of this case when one examines the content of his correspondencewith Messrs Robertsons the Defendantâs solicitors, its senior partner Mr Lintern-Smith and his associates.  This is then allowedto spill over into the content of his pleadings and affirmations.  His lack of judgment is exemplified by the amount of the claimin this action in the sum of $27 million.  His complete absence of good sense is demonstrated by the report that he made to the ICACfor corruption against Dr Buddy Wong, the Defendantâs medical expert, and Robertsons because he says Dr Wong has been paid to saywhat appears in his medical report which happens to be adverse to his case.  He has allowed himself to get very agitated by Robertsonsbill of costs in resisting his application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.  The Court of Appeal had expressed itsdissatisfaction over the size of the bill when it was put forward as a basis for a gross assessment, but Mr Saatori has now elevatedwhat may well be a heavily taxed-down bill into what he regards as criminal conduct on the part of Robertsons which he intends totake further.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p36" class="para" id="p36">36.</a>  Added to this he has now started another action, HCA 1626 of 2009, against Robertsons, Mr Lintern-Smith and two of his associatesdirectly arising out of their representation of the Defendant in the present action which he says is criminal in character.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p37" class="para" id="p37">37.</a>  So much for this action, well and graphically evidenced in the papers.  In the event that I am held to have been in error to haveput an end to the action on the basis that I have considered in the first part of this judgment, the conduct of this action by MrSaatori would have afforded me an alternative ground for staying it on the basis of his abusive and offensive conduct.  No litigantor his representatives should have to put up with such abuse in terms of insulting behaviour which apart from the insult that isgiven does absolutely nothing to advance the case to trial.  This action was started three years ago and no meaningful progress hasbeen made.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p38" class="para" id="p38">38.</a>  Mr Bharwaney has also drawn to my attention Mr Saatoriâs long history of unmeritorious litigation against a variety of other opponents. He has been able to discover seven previous actions going back to 1989 which Mr Bharwaney has briefly summarised.  Together withthis action and the recently started HCA 1629 of 2009 there are nine in total.  Although Mr Saatori has addressed me on a numberof them to try and show that they had merit he appears to have failed in all of them.  In this action which I have already struckout for the reasons which I have previously given, this now successful Defendant has accumulated a bill of costs of $800,000 in defendingitself and with no real prospect of getting any of this money back.  Mr Saatori simply has no means to meet that sort of liability.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p39" class="para" id="p39">39.</a>  For the sake of completeness I attach Mr Bharwaneyâs summary of the seven cases which Mr Saatori has brought and failed in togetherwith a brief description of those proceedings.</p>    <p style="text-align:justify" class="heading">Conclusion</p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p40" class="para" id="p40">40.</a>  I regret to have to say this, but Mr Saatori is a menace to the administration of justice.  Unless he is now put in check by themaking of a RAO the defendant will continue to be assailed by thoroughly unmeritorious applications with no prospect of being reimbursedfor the costs that it will inevitably have to spend in defending itself.  The RAO jurisdiction which the Chief Justice has describedin <i>Ng Yat Chi</i> <i>supra</i> has been designed precisely for litigants such as Mr Saatori.  In my view there is no clearer case than this one in which a RAO shouldbe made.  Accordingly, there will be an order in terms of the Defendantâs summons (as amended) for such an order, the wording ofthe summons being in line with the suggested relief set out by the Court of Final Appeal in <i>Ng Yat Chi.</i></p>    <p style="text-align:justify"><a name="p41" class="para" id="p41">41.</a>  Finally, the costs of this summons will also be to the Defendant to be taxed on a party and party basis.  This costs order willalso be an order <i>nisi</i> and I will take written submissions if either party seeks a different costs order.  These submissions should also be served within14 days of the judgment.</p>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center"> </p>        <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    </blockquote>    <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">(Ian Carlson)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style="text-align:center"> </td>            <td style="text-align:center">Deputy High Court Judge</td>        </tr>    </table>    <blockquote>        <p style="text-align:center"> </p>    </blockquote>    <!--sino section representation --><representation>        <p style="text-align:justify">Plaintiff in person<br />        Mohan Bharwaney SC instructed by Messrs Robertsons for the Defendant</p>    </representation><!--sino section text -->    <hr width="80%" />    <p style="text-align:center">REVIEW OF SAATORIâS PREVIOUS ACTIONS</p>    <p>    <u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">1  HCA No.4675</a> of 1989</u></p>    <blockquote>        <p>â«  P. claims he invented a board game in 1982 which he called âGalaxionâ.
